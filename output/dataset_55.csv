2704866,Meimaropoulos v Cheum (No. 2) [2014] NSWDC 76,"Judgment

The timetable for costs issues following judgment in these proceedings

1These are proceedings for damages for personal injury after the plaintiff suffered injuries arising from the conduct of the defendants' dog. I heard the proceedings in January 2014 and gave judgment for the plaintiff on 27 March 2014 for $28,458.77.

2During the hearing the defendants foreshadowed applications for costs orders under s 98 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) (""the Act"") and Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR"") r 42.35 and requested me to reserve the issue of costs. In order 2 of my orders following judgment I reserved costs, with liberty to apply within 28 days of judgment. The plaintiff has made no application for costs orders, but the defendants by, Notice of Motion filed on 23 April 2014 seek the following costs orders: 

(a)That the plaintiff pay the defendants' reserved costs;

(b)That the plaintiff pay 50% of the costs incurred by the defendants; and

(c)That the plaintiff pay the costs of this Motion.

3The defendants rely upon the affidavit of Mario Fiorenzo Di Lizio sworn 22 April 2014.

4Mr Brennan of Counsel appeared for the plaintiff on the application, but only, he informed the court, as amicus curiae. The sole purpose of his appearance was to advise that Messrs Brydens (""Brydens""), who are still on record for the plaintiff, propose to file a Notice of Ceasing to Act, and that a Holding Summons filed in the Court of Appeal filed by Brydens on behalf of the plaintiff had now been withdrawn. Mr Brennan then asked to be excused, stating that the plaintiff has consulted other solicitors, and that she is aware of the orders sought in the application before me for hearing today but had given no instructions to Brydens to appear.

5The Notice of Motion was served on Brydens two months ago. During the intervening period, the plaintiff was able to give Brydens instructions in relation to both lodging and withdrawing the Holding Summons in the Court of Appeal. 

6Mr Brennan does not seek an adjournment, and I do not propose to grant one. I am satisfied that the plaintiff has been on notice that this application would be brought as the proposed applications were raised in the course of the hearing, and I reserved the issue of costs of the hearing for this reason. I am satisfied that the plaintiff has been provided with the Notice of Motion by her solicitors during the past two months, and that she knows that this application is listed for hearing today but has elected not to be represented.

7Mr Gruzman of counsel has refined the orders sought to a series of four separate claims:

(a)Costs thrown away by the plaintiff's application on 3 August 2013 to vacate the hearing dates of 27 and 28 August 2012;

(b)Costs of the plaintiff's motion to join the defendant's insurer, which application was dismissed on 17 April 2013; and

(c)The defendants' application that there should be no costs payable by them for the hearing on 28 - 31 January and 7 February 2014; and 

(d)The defendants' application that the plaintiff, notwithstanding having recovered a verdict, should pay 25% of their costs.

8The relevant provisions are ss 60 and 98 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (""the Act"") and Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (""UCPR"") r 42.35. 

9In his helpful submissions, Mr Gruzman draws my attention to the case management principles necessary to ensure costs are proportionate to ""the importance and complexity of the subject matter in dispute"": Craigcare Group Pty ltd v Superkite Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 326 at [279], citing Baychek v Baychek [2010] NSWSC 987 at [8] - [17]. This is particularly the case in the present circumstances, where the amount recovered by the plaintiff falls below the threshold in r 42.35(1)(a), and where her conduct of the proceedings both before and during the hearing resulted in substantial wasting of court time, as well as incurring extra costs for the defendants.

(a) Costs incurred by the vacating of the first hearing date

10The defendants' application for costs incurred by the vacating of the first hearing date is straightforward. The asserted reason for the vacating of the order was that the plaintiff suffered a stroke in April 2012 and was referred to a neurologist on 7 July 2012, following which her solicitor advised it was ""anticipated"" (Exhibit L to the affidavit of Mr Di Lizio) that a report would be obtained to confirm whether this was causally linked to the circumstances in which she fell following the accident the subject of this litigation. The neurologist did not express this opinion and refused to provide a report. The application to vacate the hearing date was brought so that the neurologist's file could be obtained under subpoena.

11The solicitors for the defendants very sensibly agreed to the vacating of the hearing date, which saved considerable costs, and only sought an order for costs to be reserved.

12The only person who connected the stroke to the accident was the plaintiff herself. There was no medical evidence connecting the plaintiff's stroke with the circumstances in which she tripped on the edge of the footpath after seeing the defendants' dog run around her. No claim was made for such as link at the trial. To the contrary, there was clear evidence that the plaintiff had had high blood pressure for years, and was at risk for strokes for this reason.

13This was not a case where the adjournment was sought because of new medical evidence. The plaintiff's solicitors sought an adjournment because the plaintiff's treating doctor had refused to express the opinion sought, and refused to provide a report. The purpose of the adjournment was not to obtain a second opinion, but to subpoena the treating doctors' notes to find out what he had written, which was perilously close to being a fishing expedition. There was no medical evidence of any kind to connect the stroke with her fall and the Second Further Amended Statement of Particulars filed on 17 July 2013 made no such claim.

14While an application to adjourn a hearing where new medical evidence or a change in the plaintiff's medical condition may be reasonable, this was not the case here. The plaintiff's application to adjourn the hearing was unmeritorious. The defendants, who agreed to these costs being reserved at the time, are entitled to an order in their favour for the costs thrown away by reason of the vacating of the hearing date. 

(b) The plaintiff's application to join the defendants' home insurer

15After the hearing date was vacated, further delays were occasioned by the plaintiff seeking to join the defendants' home insurer. The proceedings were adjourned on 20 November 2012 and 8 February 2013, resulting in an order for the plaintiff to pay the costs of the defendants for the second adjourned date. When the motion was filed, the hearing was adjourned first to 15 February 2013 and then to 15 March 2013, but the plaintiff was not ready to proceed and had to be adjourned to 4 April 2013. The defendants were served with a subpoena to produce documents relating to the insurance of the property and seeking information about their finances. Although these documents were supplied, the plaintiff was still not ready to proceed on 4 April 2013. The plaintiff's motion was dismissed on 17 April 2013 and the proceedings stood over to 7 August 2013, when the hearing date of 28 January 2014 was allocated. 

16The application to join the insurer was misconceived. In addition, six months were wasted due to the unreadiness of the plaintiff to file and serve it, and to proceed with the motion when it was before the court. The plaintiff should pay the defendants' costs in relation to this motion, including not only reserved costs but also costs for those occasions when no order was made.

(c) Costs of the hearing

17This application falls into two parts. The first issue is whether the costs should follow the event, having regard to the provisions of UCPR r 42.35. The second is whether the plaintiff is guilty of conduct that makes it appear to the court that some other order should be made: Maestrale v Aspite [2014] NSWCA 182 at [79], citing Anglo-Cyprian Trade Agencies v Paphos Wine Industries [1951] 1 All E R 873 at 874 per Devlin LJ. The defendants have modified the orders sought on this basis, and now seek orders that the plaintiff pay 25% of their legal costs.

18The third and fourth applications rely on the same factual basis in relation to each of these issues, namely that this was a very simple claim of a trip or fall following the plaintiff being frightened by the defendants' small, fluffy dog barking and running around her, and the only complication was the wide range of injuries and disabilities claimed by the plaintiff when her injuries were in fact in very limited compass.

19The provisions of UCPR r 42.35 contain two prerequisites. The first is that the plaintiff recovers less than the sum of $40,000, and the second is that the plaintiff is otherwise entitled to an order for costs. In those circumstances, an order for payment of those costs will not ordinarily be made unless the court is satisfied that both the commencement and continuation of the proceedings in this court, rather than the Local Court, are warranted. 

20The plaintiff has made no submissions on this issue. The judgment court must be affirmatively satisfied that proceedings in this court were warranted and, if not, the rules must be applied to disentitle the successful party: Shield Mercantile Pty Ltd v Citigroup Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 287 at [18] - [24]; Ji v Firth [2013] NSWSC 148 at [18] - [30]. 

21Although the onus of establishing entitlement to costs lies on the plaintiff in such circumstances, I do not intend to determine this application simply on that basis. If the plaintiff were here, the argument would undoubtedly be put that the potential judgment amount, even if only part of the plaintiff's claim were accepted, would exceed the threshold amount. Counsel for the plaintiff abandoned nearly all of these claims during the hearing. That is not uncommon, and should not count against the plaintiff either. 

22The reason why I consider that no costs order is warranted is that, as is set out below (as well as in my judgment at (at [86] - [127]), I am satisfied that the plaintiff knowingly made dishonest claims throughout the litigation in order to inflate her modest injury (suitable for Local Court proceedings) into a substantial claim. As set out in more detail below, this included giving false answers to requests for particulars (affidavit of Mr Di Lizio, paragraphs 6 - 9) and providing false information about her injuries and symptoms.

23In those circumstances, I am not satisfied that either the commencement or continuation of these proceedings in the District Court was warranted and even if they were, given the smallness of the damages sum, I would not be prepared to exercise the discretion UCPR r 42.35 conveys (""may be made, but will not ordinarily be made"") to make an order for costs to follow the event. 

(d) The plaintiff to pay 25% of the defendants' hearing costs

24Beazley JA explained the applicability of s 98 of the Act to applications for costs to be awarded contrary to the principle that costs follow the event in Maestrale v Aspite, supra, at [79] - [80]:

""[79] A successful party may be deprived of costs if guilty of conduct that makes it appear to the court that some other order should be made: Anglo-Cyprian Trade Agencies Ltd v Paphos Wine Industries [1951] 1 All E R 873 at 874 per Devlin J; Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; 193 CLR 72. The conduct may relate directly to the litigation or to the circumstances leading up to the litigation: see Oshlack at 97 per McHugh J.
[80] Conduct in the litigation that may cause a court to exercise the discretion to make some other order than costs follow the event includes where the successful party ""unnecessarily protracts the proceedings"": Oshlack at 97 per McHugh J. Although McHugh J dissented in the decision in Oshlack there was no disagreement in the High Court as to these general principles: see Mannix v Loumbos [2000] NSWCA 32 at [14] per Foster AJA.""

25Beazley JA went on to refer to Arian v Nguyen [2001] NSWCA 5 as an example of the applicability of these principles. The plaintiff in those proceedings, despite successfully bringing a personal injury action, was held not to be a credible witness, in that he had deliberately not told the truth and had exaggerated his symptoms. Although overturning the decision on other grounds, the Court of Appeal approved the reasoning of the judge who had displaced the usual costs order on this basis (Maestrale v Aspite, supra, at [81]). 

26The facts in Arian v Nguyen were similar to the present; the plaintiff grossly exaggerated symptoms from a minor accident. As I have set out in my judgment at [86] - [127], the plaintiff similarly attributed a wide range of symptoms to her fall for which there was either no medical/optometric evidence, or the evidence was based on dishonest or exaggerated claims. 

27However, the plaintiff in these proceedings went much further. The claim for psychiatric/psychological injury in the report of Dr Anantharaman, who attributes a range of physical conditions (including stroke, blood clot and foot injury) outside her expertise and a range of psychological problems as attributable to the accident when they were known by her to be attributable to other causes. But for a copy of her report outlining the true causes of the plaintiff's problems being provided under subpoena by another medical provider, this untruthful evidence would not have come to light. Dr Anantharam's report was relied upon by other medical practitioners, notably Dr Glancey, who took the plaintiff at face value when she claimed to him to have had a happy family life and physical health before her encounter with the defendants' dog. 

28The process of obtaining reports from medical practitioners who do not then need to attend court for cross-examination is predicated upon those medical practitioners acting in accord with the spirit of the Code of Conduct. Courts have to be able to take these reports on trust and breach of that trust by a party in litigation should result in an appropriate costs penalty. This is particularly the case for treating doctors such as Dr Anantharam, who do not have to acknowledge the Code of Conduct. Her report certainly does not show any familiarity with the Code's contents.

29Additionally, the plaintiff, in answers to particulars, stated that she had not suffered any prior accidents (affidavit of Mr Di Lizio, paragraph 6). In fact the plaintiff had suffered a similar fall for which she had suffered a facial injury and broken her glasses (affidavit of Mr Di Lizio, paragraphs 7 - 9). The very substantial claims for foot and ankle injuries were acknowledged during the trial to be unrelated to her fall. Other claimed disabilities were simply not referred to in closing submissions.

30Other aspects of the plaintiff's claim for damages were exaggerated or misleading. The amount claimed for plaintiff's past out-of-pocket expenses was almost double the actual sum. The plaintiff's claim for home care, which turned upon her son having given up his job to care for her, was not proceeded with in submissions after he agreed in cross-examination he was in fact running a business from home. According to the (genuine) treatment notes of Dr Anantharam, far from this being at the plaintiff's request, she was opposed to his having given up his job and wanting to work from home, and listed this as one of the issues on which she wanted counselling. Even the past out-of-pocket expenses, which are generally the subject of agreement in personal injury proceedings, were grossly inflated.

31As a result of the plaintiff's untruthful and exaggerated claims, the defendants were put to considerable additional expense in obtaining medical evidence in reply, in an exhaustive analysis of the plaintiff's out-of-pocket expenses, and in issuing subpoenae to discover the material that the plaintiff had kept hidden, including her claim for damages from her 2001 fall, her real reasons for consulting Dr Anantharaman, and the real reasons for her stroke and foot problems. 

32This was always a modest claim for aggravation to the plaintiff's shoulder cuff problems, with the possibility of damage to the trigeminal nerve, albeit not causative of any harm. The plaintiff's overreaction to having a small, fluffy dog run around her meant that the potential for contributory negligence was likely. The plaintiff had required no home care sufficient to reach the threshold and had no claim for economic loss. The subject matter of the claim - a fall following being frightened by a dog - was, as I have found, eminently suitable to the Local Court.

33The circumstances in these proceedings giving rise to the application before the court are of the same exceptional nature as those decisions discussed by the Court of Appeal in Arian v Nguyen, supra. Although the plaintiff suffered a genuine injury as a result of being frightened by the defendants' dog, I am satisfied that the plaintiff's claims of injury and disabilities, home care requirements and past out-of-pocket expenses have been grossly exaggerated. Not only has the plaintiff been less than truthful with medical experts such as Dr Glancey, but she has put forward reports from her treating psychologist the contents of which must be of deep concern to the court. 

34In determining the percentage of the costs to be awarded, I have had regard to the Court of Appeal's analysis of the appropriate costs order to make in Arian v Nguyen, supra. That decision was, however, handed down before s 98 was enacted. The requirement for proceedings to be ""just, cheap and quick"" (s 56) and proportional to the issues (s 60) are intended to prevent flagrant dishonesty of the kind that occurred in these proceedings. Nevertheless, 50% of the costs of the whole proceedings would be too heavy a burden for the plaintiff to bear. A more appropriate order would be for the plaintiff to pay 25% of the costs of the hearing. The pre-hearing costs are suitably adjusted by reason of the orders I shall make in relation to the vacated hearing and the plaintiff's unsuccessful motion to join the insurer. In addition, I propose to make an order for set-off of these costs against the judgment sum.

		01 July 2014",2014-06-26 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704877,R v Hines (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 990,"ex tempore Judgment (revised)

1HIS HONOUR: There is a joint application before the Court for the evidence of a witness, SJ, to be given by way of an interview recorded with him on 5 March 2013. SJ was born in August 1996 and so was 16 years of age at the time that he made that interview. He turned 17 in August 2013. He is now almost 18.

2In addition to the application that his evidence be given by way of that recorded interview, it is also the joint application of the parties that the witness give his evidence by closed-circuit television facility rather than entering into the courtroom. 

3There is a specific provision in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (the Act) for 'vulnerable persons' to give evidence in the manner suggested here: see ss 306M-306ZP and in particular s 306U (evidence in chief by recorded interview) and 306ZB (evidence by closed circuit televison). A vulnerable person is defined under s 306M of the Act as a child or a cognitively impaired person. However, those provisions do not apply to this witness because s 306P of the Act restricts the application of the relevant Part of the Act to ""a child who is under the age of 16"". 

4SJ is a ""child"" on any common sense approach to the question. He was in year 10 at school when he made the interview. The questioning at the beginning of the interview makes it clear that the police who were investigating the case approached the interview on the basis that he was a child. They asked him a number of questions about his ability to know the difference between the truth and a lie in much the same manner that they would for very young children. 

5Mr Wilson of Senior Counsel who appears for the accused in the trial has indicated that he has reviewed the video recording and that SJ is indeed a child. He says further that he appears to be quite unsophisticated. 

6The definition of ""child"" in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (which refers to a ""child of any age"") and under s 3 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW) (""a person under the age of 18 years"") would apply to this witness. Unfortunately, because of s 306P, the relevant provisions of the Act do not apply to him. 

7As a consequence, the parties jointly ask me to exercise a power under s 26(a) of the Evidence Act. That provision allows the Court to control the questioning of a witness and specifically allows the Court to make such orders as it considers just in relation to ""the way in which witnesses are to be questioned"". 

8The provision has been considered on more than one occasion. It has allowed, for example, what is sometimes called ""hot tubbing"" to occur, where multiple witnesses are called at one time. It has been used in other ways and been given a relatively wide operation: see, for example, LGM v CAM [2008] FamCA 185; Harrington-Smith v Western Australia [2002] FCA 934. As O'Ryan J states in LGM v CAM ""it is the trial judge's duty to ensure the parties have a fair trial"".

9It seems to me, particularly given the position taken by Mr Wilson, which is a considered and sensible one, that it is appropriate for the evidence to be given in the manner proposed by the Crown. Mr Wilson has indicated that not only is his client not prejudiced by the method proposed but in fact will obtain some forensic advantage because it will ensure that material in that interview which Mr Wilson intends to use in Mr Hines' defence will come out in a clear and predictable manner.

10As I said, Mr Wilson has also referred to the witness as being perhaps a little unsophisticated, so that the purpose of the provisions in the Act really would ordinarily be directed to just this type of witness but unfortunately, as a result of the terms of the legislation, they do not apply. 

11I propose to make an order acceding to the joint application of the parties. Accordingly, I make an order under s 26(a) Evidence Act that the witness, SJ, is to be questioned by playing the recorded interview made 5 March 2013 and that the balance of the evidence be given by closed-circuit television.

12I remind all concerned of the statutory prohibition concerning the publication of the identity and names of child witnesses.

2704880,"Palfrey v Spiteri, Palfrey v Spiteri, Palfrey v South Penrith Sand & Soil Pty Ltd, Palfrey v Roberts [2014] NSWSC 842","File numbers continued: 2011/407599, 2011/407560, 2011/407531, 2011/407510, 2011/407636, 2011/407623


Sentence

1Mr David Palfrey, the prosecutor, has brought a series of charges by a number of individual Summonses each dated 19 December 2011.

2The charges are against South Penrith Sand & Soil Pty Ltd (""the Company"" or ""South Penrith""), Mr Peter John Spiteri (who was the owner of the Company and its principal director), Mrs Tienie Spiteri (the wife of Mr Peter Spiteri and also a director of the Company), and Mr Jason Roberts, who was employed as a scheduler by the Company.

3Each of the Defendants had pleaded guilty to the charges contained in the Summonses with which the prosecutor is proceeding. Some Summonses have more than one charge. It will be convenient to set out in tabular form the details of the Summonses and charges in due course. 

4Earlier interlocutory proceedings dealing with issues about the number of charges and multiplicity of alleged offences, were dealt with by Barr AJ: Palfrey v South Penrith Sand & Soil Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 1357. 

5These remarks on sentence deal with the facts underlying the charges, which are substantially agreed, the material concerning the seriousness of the offences, the individual positions and circumstances of each defendant, and the sentences which the Court has determined to impose. It is convenient to address all of these matters together. 

6It will be convenient to commence these remarks on sentence by considering the principal issues, and the common and generally agreed facts.

Commencement of Investigation

7South Penrith is a company which transported quarried materials, such as sand, soil and gravel, from their source to various sites, largely construction sites, in metropolitan Sydney. It also purchases and resells the quarried materials. The vehicles used for these commercial purposes, and which are relevant to these proceedings, were all in the category known as regulated heavy vehicles, that is, vehicles in excess of 12 tonnes Gross Vehicle Mass.

8In 2010, which is the time period with which these charges are concerned, South Penrith had been in operation for about 20 years. It had 22 permanent employees, consisting of 14 permanent truck drivers, two schedulers, two office staff and Mr and Mrs Spiteri. As well, there were six casual drivers who were largely used for weekend work.

9Mr Spiteri was a truck driver for nearly 25 years until 1994, when he purchased the existing business of, and commenced to run, South Penrith. According to the Company accounts, this was a successful enterprise. In the financial year ending 30 June 2010, South Penrith had a total revenue of slightly under $6.5 M. For the 2011 financial year, it was over $6.1 M, and for the 2012 financial year it had a total revenue of over $6.8 M.

10In March and April 2010, two South Penrith trucks were involved in major road accidents, one on the M4 Motorway and the other on the M7 Motorway. None of the charges before this Court directly relate to those accidents. But, it was as a consequence of these accidents that officers of Roads and Maritime Services (""RMS""), on 12 April 2010, commenced an investigation into the business practices of South Penrith. This audit concentrated on issues of fatigue management, reasonable working hours and the business practices surrounding these matters.

11It was immediately apparent to the RMS Audit, and South Penrith and the other defendants agreed, that there were no systems or practices in place which addressed any issue relating to fatigue management for the drivers of the Company's vehicles. Nor were there any practices which regulated driving hours by reference to the prescribed reasonable driving hours. Trucks were scheduled to, and were operating according to customer service and commercial considerations, rather than in any way which took account of, and followed, safe working practices, as specified by the legislation.

Statutory Regime

12The Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (""RTG Act""), was, at the relevant time, the applicable legislation. It is necessary also to refer to the Road Transport (General) Regulation 2005 (""the RTG Regulation""). Since the time of the events in question, that legislation has been repealed, and has been replaced by the Heavy Vehicle National Law (NSW) - No.42a, which came into effect in NSW on 10 February 2014. 

13The purpose of the provisions under the road transport legislation was to regulate the use of heavy vehicle transport in a number of ways so as to improve the safety of all road users, and the travelling public. 

14One of the ways in which the legislation addressed this issue, was to address the fatigue of drivers. Part 6 of the RTG Regulation deals with heavy vehicle driver fatigue. By clause 45 of the RTG Regulation, the driver of a regulated heavy vehicle, must not drive such a vehicle ""while he or she is impaired by fatigue"". By clause 46 of the RTG Regulation, any party in the ""chain of responsibility"" must take all reasonable steps to ensure that a person does not drive the vehicle on a road while the person is impaired by fatigue.

15Clause 44 of the RTG Regulation deals with impairment by fatigue. It is in the following form:

""44. What is impaired by fatigue?

1. A driver is impaired by fatigue if the driver's ability to drive a vehicle safely is affected by fatigue.

2. When deciding whether a driver was impaired by fatigue, a court may take into account anything it considers is relevant, including (but not limited to) the following:

(a) any relevant cause of fatigue or sign of fatigue that was evident, and the degree to which it may indicate that the driver was impaired by fatigue;

(b) any behaviour of the driver that may have resulted from being impaired by fatigue;

(c) the nature and extent of any physical or mental exertion by the driver;

(d) whether the driver was in breach of his or her work and rest hours.

3. A court may consider a driver to be impaired by fatigue even if the driver has complied with any requirements under this Part (for example, the standard hours) or under any other legislation.""

16Clause 49 of the RTG Regulation deals with duties falling on employers and operators. It is in the following form:

""49 Duties on employers, prime contractors and operators

(1) This clause applies to:

(a) the employer of an employed driver of a regulated heavy vehicle, and

(b) the prime contractor of a self-employed driver of a regulated heavy vehicle, and

(c) the operator of the regulated heavy vehicle if the driver is to make a journey for the operator.

(2) The employer, prime contractor and operator each must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the employer's, prime contractor's or operator's business practices will not cause, by act or omission, the driver:
(a) to drive on a road or road related area while impaired by fatigue, or

(b) to drive while in breach of his or her work and rest hours option, or

(c) to drive in breach of another law in order to avoid driving while impaired by fatigue or while in breach of his or her work and rest hours option.

Maximum penalty:

(a) in the case of an individual-20 penalty units (in the case of a first offence) or 40 penalty units (in the case of a second or subsequent offence), and

17People employed as, or carrying out the duties of, schedulers have obligations imposed by Clause 50 of the RTG Regulation. Clause 50 is in the following form:

""50 Duties of schedulers

(1) This clause applies to the scheduler of:

(a) a regulated heavy vehicle, or
(b) a driver of a regulated heavy vehicle.

(2) The scheduler must take all reasonable steps to ensure that a driver's schedule for driving the vehicle will not cause, by act or omission, the driver:

(a) to drive on a road or road related area while impaired by fatigue, or

(b) to drive while in breach of his or her work and rest hours option, or

(c) to drive in breach of another law in order to avoid driving while impaired by fatigue or while in breach of his or her work and rest hours 

Maximum penalty:

(a) in the case of an individual-20 penalty units (in the case of a first offence) or 40 penalty units (in the case of a second or subsequent offence), and

(b) in the case of a corporation-100 penalty units (in the case of a first offence) or 200 penalty units (in the case of a second or subsequent offence).

(3) The scheduler must not cause the driver to drive the vehicle unless:

(a) the scheduler has complied with subclause (2), and

(b) the driver's schedule for driving the vehicle allows for:

(i) the driver to take rest breaks in accordance with his or her work and rest hours option, and

(ii) traffic conditions and other delays that could reasonably be expected.

Maximum penalty:

(a) in the case of an individual-15 penalty units (in the case of a first offence) or 30 penalty units (in the case of a second or subsequent offence), and

(b) in the case of a corporation-75 penalty units (in the case of a first offence) or 150 penalty units (in the case of a second or subsequent offence).

(4) A person accused of an offence under this clause does not have the benefit of the mistake of fact defence.""

18Division 3 of Part 6 of the RTG Regulation deals with work and rest times. 

19In broad terms, work time includes not just the time that drivers spend driving a regulated heavy vehicle on a road, but also includes other times that the driver spends doing tasks that are related to the operation of a regulated heavy vehicle, including loading or unloading of the vehicle, cleaning or refuelling the vehicle and, as well inspecting, servicing or repairing the vehicle.

20Division 3 of the RTG Regulation, by Clause 64, provides for standard work hours for drivers of regulated heavy vehicles. Simply put, in a total period of 24 hours, the maximum work time for a driver is 12 hours. The minimum rest time is seven continuous hours. In any seven day period (168 hours), the maximum work time is 72 hours, and the minimum rest time is 24 continuous hours.

21Clause 64 provides that if a driver works more than 13.5 hours in any period of 24 hours, the offence is categorised as carrying a critical risk. In a seven day period, if a driver works more than 75 hours, the offence is categorised as having a critical risk.

22Any penalty which may be imposed for a breach of standard hours provisions depends upon the degree of risk which accompanies the breach. Where the risk is a critical risk offence, then in the case of a first offence, the maximum penalty is 25 penalty units; in the case of a second or subsequent offence, the maximum offence is 50 penalty units. 

23Under s 178 of the RTG Act, a director may be taken to have committed an offence if the body corporate has done so. Section 178 is in the following form:

""178 Liability of directors, partners, employers and others for offences by bodies corporate, partnerships, associations and employees

(1) If a body corporate commits an offence under the road transport legislation, each director of the body corporate, and each person concerned in the management of the body corporate, is taken to have committed the offence and is punishable accordingly.

...

(4) If an employee commits an applicable road law offence, the employer is taken to have committed the offence and is punishable accordingly.

(4A) Subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4) do not apply in respect of an offence under a provision of a regulation made under the road transport legislation that is declared by such a regulation to be an excluded provision for the purposes of this section.

(5) This section does not affect the liability of the person who actually committed the offence.

(6) A person may be proceeded against and found guilty of an offence arising under this section whether or not the body corporate or other person who actually committed the offence has been proceeded against or been found guilty of the offence.

(7) It is a defence to a prosecution for an offence arising under subsection (1) if the defendant establishes that:

(a) the defendant was not in a position to influence the conduct of the body corporate in relation to the actual offence, or

(b) the defendant, being in such a position, took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to prevent the commission of the actual offence. 
...""

24Insofar as Mr and Mrs Spiteri are charged with offences in their capacity as a director of the Company, those charges are brought pursuant to s 178(1) of the RTG Act. Insofar as Mr Spiteri and Mr Jason Roberts are the subject of charges which relate to their duties as schedulers, then those charges are brought pursuant to cl 50(2)(a) or clause 50(2)(b) of the RTG Regulation.

25Insofar as the Company is the subject of charges, those charges are brought pursuant to cl 49(2)(a) of the RTG Regulation, cl 50(2)(a) of the RTG Regulation and cl 50(2)(b) of the RTG Regulation. In one case, the Company is also charged by reference to the provisions of s 178(4) of the RTG Act.

Factual Context

26It will be apparent from the charges to which pleas have been entered, and from the Statements of Agreed Facts, that at various times, and on various dates, particular drivers drove for periods in excess of the standard work hours, and drove whilst affected by fatigue. There was no dispute at the hearing of the sentence proceedings that the named drivers had driven regulated heavy vehicles on the road for the number of hours specified, or else whilst affected by fatigue. 

27There was also no dispute that the drivers were driving on those dates for the periods specified because they were scheduled to do so, either by Mr Spiteri, or by Mr Roberts. Nor was there any dispute that Mr Spiteri in his capacity as a director could have, but did not, take steps to address these business practices and change them. So far as Mrs Spiteri is concerned the evidence is sparse, but the proof of the charge was constituted by the fact that she was a director, and in the case of the single charge preferred against her, that the Company was in breach of its obligations.

28In those circumstances, it is appropriate to set out in tabular form the details of the dates, the working hours, the nature of the charge and which defendant is proceeded against, together with a record of the Summons containing the charge and the applicable maximum penalties. The contents of this table were provided by the prosecution, and agreed as correct by the defendants.

29It will be apparent from this table that, as the evidence ultimately demonstrated, prior to the audit of the RMS in April 2010, the Company had taken no steps at all to implement any business practice which in any way addressed any fatigue related issue, or which attempted to comply with the reasonable working hours requirements of the RTG Regulation. 

30After the RMS audit, the Company sought external advice in order to create systems which would address these matters as part of the Company's business. But that was the first occasion when it was done. 

31Prior to the RMS audit, the Company left the question of working hours and fatigue to individual drivers, in particular, it left it to individual drivers to take breaks as and when they saw fit. However, when a driver's vehicle was stationary for an identifiable period, contact was generally made with the driver by the scheduler or the office staff of the Company to enquire why the vehicle was not moving. This contact could occur because each truck was fitted with a GPS tracking system which could be observed from the Company's office.

32As well, no real attention was paid to the safety consequences of drivers starting their shifts early in the morning, or driving through to late hours in the evening. Notwithstanding that, as is apparent from the legislation, issues relating to fatigue management and standard working hours were prominent in the heavy trucking industry. Since at least 2005, if not for many years prior to that time, the Company, its directors and responsible staff, simply ignored their lawful obligations. 

33On any view the number of occasions and the extent of the excess hours being worked by truck drivers in the Company as seen from the details underlying the charges, demonstrate plainly that this was a company that did not address its legal obligations.

34For reasons which will become apparent, I have accepted the submissions of senior counsel for the defendants that this was largely a ""one person"" company, with the consequence that the responsibility for this inaction rests substantially at the feet of Mr Spiteri.

35As these details show, the conduct subject to the charges is contained within a period of about a month, and involves the driving of six individual drivers, which is a significant proportion (over 40 per cent) of the permanent driver work force of the Company.

36It is proper to infer from the number and date spread of these offences, the explanations proffered by the defendants and that they had no systems or practices in place which addressed issues relating to fatigue, that these offences could not be regarded as ""one-off"" or isolated offences. These offences are properly to be regarded as examples drawn from the period examined by the RMS officers, shortly prior to the commencement of its audit.

37That does not mean that in imposing a sentence for these offences, the defendants are being punished for conduct which has not been charged against them. To the contrary, this conclusion serves to place the offences and their criminality into the true context of what was happening (or not happening) at South Penrith as it went about its day-to-day business.

One Person Company

38The Company and Mr Spiteri submitted that the principles applicable to the charging of a company and its directors, where in truth the Company was a one person company, are applicable here. Specifically, it was put by senior counsel for the defendants that Mr Spiteri was the ""physical emanation"" of the Company. 

39The Company is owned by Mr and Mrs Spiteri who had at the time of the offences, one share each. They were each directors, although it seems clear that Mr Spiteri was the active director in and about the conduct of the business of the Company. To the extent that Mrs Spiteri attended, which was on a couple of days a week, she undertook administrative tasks, and had nothing to do with the operations of the heavy vehicles. 

40The legal principles to which attention is drawn are those which exist to avoid punishing the owners of a company twice over. Where a company is in substance the business alter ego of an individual, that is, a ""one person company"", and both the company and its owner face monetary penalties for the same conduct which underlies separate offences, then there is a risk that the individual will be doubly punished because the imposition of a monetary penalty on the company, which affects its financial position, will diminish the individual's valuable interest in the company. As well, the individual will be subject to a monetary fine in their individual capacity. 

41Accordingly, it is relevant to take the relationship which here exists between the Company and Mr Spiteri into account to avoid double punishment.

42As Sackville J said in Minister for the Environment and Heritage v Greentree (No.3) [2004] FCA 1317 at [78], having described the factual circumstances that the company in question was a ""one-person company"":

""78. I infer that Mr Greentree will bear the burden of any diminution of Auen's assets that will result from the imposition of a pecuniary penalty on the company. It is appropriate to take that fact into account in order to prevent Mr Greentree being punished, in effect, twice over: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd (No 2) (2002) 190 ALR 169, at 182 [45], per Finkelstein J; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Adler (2002) 42 ACSR 80, at 116-117 [131]-[132], per Santow J. On the other hand, Auen has been involved in a deliberate contravention of s 16(1) of the EPBC Act. The contravening conduct was undertaken in Auen's commercial interests. It is also necessary to bear in mind that the maximum penalties that can be imposed on a corporation are ten times larger than the penalties that can be imposed on individuals who contravene the EPBC Act. The overall pecuniary penalty should obviously be no less than if Auen, a corporation, had been the sole contravenor. On the contrary, the overall penalty should reflect the fact that Mr Greentree, as well as Auen, has contravened s 16(1) of the EPBC Act.""

43Here, because of the facts which are described below, the risk of double counting is a small one because the company has few remaining assets, and the impact of financial diminution of the Company on Mr Spiteri is slight. Nevertheless, particularly in light of his evidence that he would pay any fine imposed on the Company, I will keep it in mind, and take proper account of it.

44The prosecution accepted that with respect to the offences to which the Company pleaded guilty, and to which Mr Spiteri pleaded guilty, where the offences were in substance the same, that the Court should apply the principle so as to avoid double punishment.

Single Act of Criminality

45Another aspect of the submissions of senior counsel for the defendant, was that double punishment needed to be avoided in the circumstances here by imposition of fines for each separate offence because each offence was the product of a single act of criminality. Evidence revealed what, in substance, was said to be a single failure which led to all of the charges, namely the failure by Mr Spiteri as the controlling principal of the Company to institute any fatigue management system in order to ensure compliance with the legislation prior to the RMS audit. In short, senior counsel submits that each individual offence is the inevitable product of the lack of a proper business system of fatigue management which would address both the requirements of reasonable work hours and avoiding driver fatigue.

46The prosecution agreed that the proper conclusion for the Court to draw from the facts was that the Court would, when seeking to understand the true criminality involved in the offence, conclude that they all derived from a single course of conduct, namely a failure to address and implement a system of fatigue management. The prosecution accepted that this single course of conduct approach was consistent with the manner in which the prosecution had conducted its case. However, it did not accept that this meant that in substance there was only one offence.

47It does not seem to me, accepting this position, that no penalty ought be imposed with respect to some, or perhaps most, of the charges. Such an approach would not adequately recognise that each charge represents an occasion of criminality, and an occasion when the road users and travelling public were potentially put at risk by sharing the road with a driver who was, or was at risk of, being affected by fatigue, and thus presented a potential danger to all other road users. When such a driver is driving a heavy vehicle, here over 12 tonnes GVM, the potential for harm is significant.

48As well, the Court in imposing any sentence where more than one offence is involved, is required to ensure that the principle of totality is adhered to: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [40] per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ; Mill v The Queen [1998] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59 at [8] per Wilson, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ. The effect of adherence to this principle will ensure that the fines ultimately imposed reflect the criminality involved. 

The Change in South Penrith's Financial Position

49In the financial year ended 30 June 2010, South Penrith had total revenue of almost $6.5 M. It had a significant number of trucks and trailers to carry out its business. 

50It used to own the land from which the business operated. According to the evidence of Mr Spiteri, at a time prior to March 2010, although he was not sure when, the two properties which were used by the Company as its trucking bases, were transferred from the Company to the Spiteri Family Superannuation Fund.

51By the end of the 30 June 2013 financial year, the Company's position was very different. On 14 November 2012, it sold the whole of its business undertaking and all of its assets, including goodwill, to a company which presently trades as Penrith Sand & Soil. This new company is wholly unrelated to any of the current defendants.

52According to the evidence of Mr Gatt, who is, and has been for some years, the accountant for the defendants (except Mr Roberts), the effect of the sale was that all liabilities, whether current or non-current, were paid in full and a capital gain of $784,000, which related to the sale of the goodwill valued at $800,000 on a cost base of $16,000, was paid out to the Spiteri Family Superannuation Fund for the benefit of Mr and Mrs Spiteri. The payment disbursed in this way, did not become liable for capital gains tax. 

53The documentary evidence also suggested that other funds must have been received and disbursed, but Mr Gatt's evidence was quite unsatisfactory as to what happened to these amounts.

54However, it is clear that the current position is that the Company has about $15,000 in the bank. It does not conduct any business activities, and has no source of income. The end result is that the Company cannot pay anymore than $15,000 by way of fines unless an external contribution is made. Although Mr Spiteri said that it was his intention so to do, neither he nor his wife are under any legal obligation to make any contribution to the Company, and it may simply be put into liquidation.

55In these circumstances the issue of double penalty to which Sackville J referred in Greentree (No.3), has limited weight. In short, even if Mr Spiteri was to lose the entirety of his remaining investment in the Company because it has to pay one or more fines, that loss would not in the overall picture be a significant one, having regard to the careful steps taken since 2010, to realise the value of his investment as a shareholder of the Company.

Principles of Sentencing

56The imposition of a sentence in this case calls up both the common law principles relating to sentencing, and also a variety of statutory provisions.

57The Parliament of NSW has set out the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender including a company. Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that those purposes are:

(a)to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence;
(b)to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences;
(c)to protect the community from the offender;
(d)to promote the rehabilitation of the offender;
(e)to make the offender accountable for his or her actions;
(f)to denounce the conduct of the offender;
(g)to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.

58It is self-evident that these purposes overlap, may be in conflict, and cannot be considered in isolation, one from the other, in their application to a particular case. These purposes do not rank in any order of priority. The Court is obliged in imposing these sentences to have regard to these purposes.

59The terms of s 21A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, mean that the Parliament has preserved the entire body of judicially developed, or common law, sentencing principles: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [56]-[57], Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [18]. These common law principles have been developed over time by courts to provide guidance for the exercise of the sentencing discretion by every judge. 

60This is a case where, given the nature of the offences, the fact that they involved heavy transport vehicles, and occurred on public roads, the principle of general deterrence must play an important role. In these circumstances, the condign punishment of Mr Spiteri and the Company will operate as a general deterrence for others who, or which, operate heavy transport vehicles on the public roads of NSW from committing breaches of transport legislation which is directed at enhancing road safety.

61Given that South Penrith, and the other defendants, are no longer operating in the heavy transport industry, the need for specific deterrence is somewhat limited. 

Seriousness of the Offences

62It is appropriate to make an assessment of the seriousness of the offences and the conduct of Mr Spiteri, the Company and the other defendants. This assessment does not have regard to matters personal to each defendant, but is to be determined by reference to the nature of the offending: Muldrock at [27].

63The RTG Act and the RTG Regulation address issues of the safety of road users of public roads. They address issues of the safety of the travelling public. Fatigue management is one of the ways in which in the heavy transport industry this safety is addressed and ensured. 

64Fortunately, none of these offences involved any actual injury, loss or damage. However, the potential for such injury, loss or damage was significant. There can be no doubt that when a driver of a heavy vehicle is engaged in working for 19 hours in a day, such as in the case of Mr Christopher Attard on 30 March 2010, when he started at 3am and finished at 10pm, for every kilometre which he drove on the public road on that day, every other road user was placed at risk. The fact that no collision occurred was a matter of good fortune and chance. 

65Mr Spiteri's failure to inform himself about and take advice upon, the road transport legislation, insofar as it affected the safety of his company's commercial operations, was a course of conduct which simply, and in a wholesale way, failed to address not only his legal obligations, but also matters of common sense, such as tiredness and fatigue of drivers who drove very long hours.

66In Mr Spiteri's case, it was clear from his evidence that he accepted that there were records created within the Company which contained all of the relevant details which would have enabled him to address issues of fatigue management had he wished so to do. As senior counsel for the defendants admitted, there was a facility with the Company could have used for fatigue management purposes, but did not.

67The complete failure by Mr Spiteri, even though there was a capacity to do so, to address issues of fatigue management for the drivers employed by the Company, was in my assessment a very serious failure. It is near the top end of the range of seriousness for offences of this kind.

68Similarly, because the Company was the operating business entity, its failure to address fatigue management was also serious. However, accepting as I do, senior counsel for the defendant's submissions that the Company was a ""one person company"", that is, the conduct of its affairs in the area of operations and operational safety, was undertaken by Mr Spiteri who made all of the relevant decisions, the Company's criminality and conduct is the consequence of, and derives from, Mr Spiteri's conduct and his failure to adequately address the legal obligations for operators of heavy vehicles under the road transport legislation. However, the Company is an independent legal entity. Its criminality is akin to that of Mr Spiteri. 

69Mr Roberts was an employed scheduler, who did not receive any formal training with respect to his duties as such. He acted in accordance with the system in place, which he was not really in a position to significantly change. Mr Roberts' criminality is less serious than that of Mr Spiteri and the Company. I assess it as below the mid-range for offences such as these.

70Mrs Spiteri, although a director of the Company, left the operations of the Company to her husband. So far as the evidence shows, she had no experience in heavy transport operations. It does not appear that the directors of the Company held formal or regular meetings at which the affairs of the Company were discussed. No minutes of any meetings of directors have been tendered in evidence.

71I consider that in all the particular circumstances here, the seriousness of the criminality for the single offence with which Mrs Spiteri has been charged is low.

Statutory Aggravating Factors

72Section 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act contains a number of matters which are prescribed as aggravating factors to which this Court is to have regard, and take into account.

73The aggravating factors are largely irrelevant to the offences here, and the facts and circumstances underlying the offences. However, s 21A(2)(i) does provide that an aggravating factor exists where the offence ""... was committed without regard for public safety"". Here, the offences occurred in circumstances where the defendants, other than Mrs Spiteri, completely failed to have regard to public safety. I will take this into account. 

Statutory Mitigating Factors

74Section 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act lists a number of mitigating factors to which the Court must have regard, and which it must take into account.

75First, I note and will have regard to the fact that none of the defendants have any record of previous convictions: s 21A(3)(e).

76Secondly, I note and will have regard to the fact that, on the limited material available, that each of Mr and Mrs Spiteri, and Mr Roberts are persons of good character: s 21A(3)(f).

77The evidence shows, as I have earlier described, that the Company has sold the business and no longer operates. Mr and Mrs Spiteri have retired from any involvement in the business of South Penrith and have no association with the new company. Mr Roberts is not employed by the new company which operates the business formerly conducted by South Penrith. He works as a consultant, although it is not clear in what industry. However, having regard to the systems implemented after the RMS audit by the Company, and his close participation in them, I am satisfied that he is unlikely to re-offend. I am also satisfied that in the circumstances which now exist, the Company and Mr and Mrs Spiteri are also unlikely to re-offend: s 21A(3)(g).

Plea of Guilty

78It is clear that when the RMS officers attended to conduct their audit, the Company and Mr Spiteri made it clear that they did not have any systems in place to deal with fatigue management issues.

79In April 2012, the solicitors for the defendants, except Mrs Spiteri, indicated by filing a document entitled ""Memorandum of Plea"" on 2 April 2012, that the three defendants would plead guilty to a number of charges. The Memorandum indicated that some charges would be the subject of legal argument as to whether they were valid. The Memorandum made plain that the defendants would plead guilty to such of these disputed charges as the Court found were validly preferred.

80On 2 April 2012, the defendants filed a Notice of Motion which was intended to bring about an early determination of which charges were validly brought. 

81On 20 November 2012, Barr AJ made orders with respect to the challenges made to the various charges. The effect of that judgment was that two Summonses, each containing 11 charges, were dismissed, and in various other Summonses, a total of 14 other charges were dismissed. In respect of these dismissed Summonses and charges, Barr AJ held in his reasons, delivered on 9 November 2012, that it was not open to the prosecutor to proceed with charges where an abuse of process would occur.

82After the Court made orders on 20 November 2012, on 23 November 2012 the defendants, except Mrs Spiteri, filed a further Memorandum of Plea, in which they indicated that they would plead guilty to the remaining extant charges. The Memorandum noted that the defendants maintained their earlier pleas of guilty, and pleaded guilty to the identified extant charges.

83By letter dated 18 December 2012, the solicitors for Mrs Spiteri for the first time indicated that she intended to plead guilty to the charge against her on the next occasion when the matter was before the Court.

84The prosecution accepts that the pleas which were indicated in April 2012, were entered at the earliest practicable time. 

85The prosecution did not accept that the pleas which were entered in November 2012, were entered at the earliest practicable time. Counsel submitted that the pleas were only entered because of the decision and orders of Barr AJ. The prosecution submitted that the Court, with respect to these charges, could not take into account the earlier offer to plead to the charges which the Court subsequently held were valid. 

86Senior counsel for the three defendants submitted that there was little more the defendants could do to facilitate the administration of justice, in circumstances where they had a legitimate legal argument that the conduct of the prosecutor amounted, in many instances, to an abuse of the Court's process. Accordingly, he submitted that any delay which enabled those questions to be determined ought not to be held against them by the Court not allowing a full discount.

87Section 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that a court must take into account not just the fact of when an offender pleads guilty, but also when an offender ""...indicated an intention to plead guilty ..."".

88Although the pleas which were in fact entered in November 2012 were later than those entered earlier in April 2012, I am satisfied that the earlier Memorandum, and the correspondence at the time, all indicated sufficiently for the purpose of the legislation an intention to plead guilty. Accordingly, in respect of those three defendants, I am satisfied that the same discount should apply to all of the charges to which they have pleaded guilty.

89In so finding, I am conscious of the authorities which require the Court to concentrate upon the timing of a plea as the principal basis for the discount allowed: see R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1. I am also conscious of the requirement to separately consider the utilitarian value of pleas entered at different times: see Regina v SY [2003] NSWCCA 291. I am also conscious of the fact that the reason for the delay is generally irrelevant: see Regina v Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56; (2006) 160 A Crim R 510.

90However, this is an exceptional case because up until the reasons of Barr AJ were delivered, the prosecution persisted, unreasonably in my assessment, in pursuing a range of charges which were not open to it. I am satisfied that there was real utilitarian value in the indication in April 2012 of an intention to plead guilty, and that in this exceptional case, the same discount ought to apply. In my assessment, the appropriate discount for all defendants, except Mrs Spiteri, is 25 per cent.

91Mrs Spiteri's first indication was much later, but nevertheless before the proceedings were fixed for hearing. To recognise the utilitarian value of Mrs Spiteri's plea, I propose to allow a discount of about 15 per cent. 

Fines Act 1996

92Section 6 of the Fines Act 1996 provides that a court, when considering the amount of a fine which is to be fixed, must consider such information about the means of an offender as may be made available, and such other matters as the Court considers relevant.

93I have already noted that the Company has about $15,000 remaining in its bank account. It does not have any reason for spending this money, other than on payments of any fine imposed by the Court.

94Mr and Mrs Spiteri have retired from conducting the business of South Penrith. The capital gain from the sale of the business has been paid into a superannuation fund of which they are beneficiaries. This was a sum of $784,000. There is no additional information about their assets and liabilities, or their income or expenditure. It is not submitted on their behalf that there is anything about their financial position which ought to have a moderating role on the sum of any fine which would otherwise be fixed by the Court.

95The evidence of Mr Roberts about his financial position is unchallenged. He has a modest and, because he is employed as a contractor, intermittent income. He has little, if any, savings. He is in a position to afford only a modest fine.

Other Matters of Mitigation

96The Company and Mr Spiteri submit that their early acceptance of culpability, their prompt response to remedy the position by retaining a safety and compliance consultant, their early formal pleas of guilty, when combined with the evidence of Mr Spiteri, demonstrate contrition and remorse.

97Mr Roberts also submits that his early acceptance of the lack of appropriate diligence on his part, and his early indication of guilty pleas demonstrates contrition and remorse.

98The evidence of Mr Spiteri was that for a period of about four years he had wanted to sell the business. Although not entirely clear, it seems that this wish, and the existence of one possible buyer pre-dated the accidents which caused the RMS audit to occur. His evidence then seems to be that the existence of the charges, and the fact that he ""... was hurt a lot by this incident"" increased his sense of pressure, and this led to him selling the business when he was approached by the purchaser, and now current owner.

99Whilst I accept that Mr Spiteri finally came to a sale of the business in these circumstances, I do not see that his evidence bespeaks remorse or contrition. I accept that he was hurt by what happened, but that effect, whilst it may be relevant to the impact generally of the events and these proceedings upon him, does not establish contrition or remorse.

100The steps taken after the RMS audit to make the business affairs of the Company compliant with the legislation are commendable, and will be taken into account. It is also submitted that an administrative officer of the Company provided assistance to the authorities during the RMS audit. That is undoubtedly so. But in the circumstances, whilst I will have regard to that conduct, it does not merit significant weight.

101To the extent that the pleas of guilty contained an expression of remorse, I will take that into account for all defendants.

Discernment

102The conduct of the business of South Penrith in respect to issue of fatigue management was seriously defective. Mr Spiteri must bear the principal responsibility for this. It was his failure as the director responsible for the conduct of the trucking operations to pay attention to the requirements of the law. Had he done so, none of these offences would have occurred.

103The extent of the work hour breaches are accepted by the defendants as being critical risk offences. The fatigue offences are in no different position. The objective seriousness of the offences of Mr Spiteri and the Company was at a significant level. For Mr Roberts it is somewhat less. The objective seriousness of the offence of Mrs Spiteri was low. I have also had regard to the subjective circumstances of each of Mr and Mrs Spiteri, and Mr Roberts. 

104It is necessary to consider each of the offences and impose a penalty appropriate in all the circumstances which have been discussed earlier. In particular, it is necessary to keep in mind, as between the Company and its director, Mr Spiteri, that he should not be doubly punished. It is also necessary to keep in mind and apply the appropriate discount for the pleas of guilty to which I have earlier given attention. 

105Although all of the offences are serious, not all are equal in terms of the extent of the breaches of the legislation dealing with work hours. Some allowance must be made for such differences and some penalties will be higher to reflect these differences. 

106As well, in the case of some drivers and some breaches, there will be two offences against the same defendant arising from substantially the same facts. By of way of example, Mr Roberts is charged with respect to Mr Stephen Day's driving on 31 March 2010 with both a breach of cl 50(2)(a) and cl 50(2)(b) of the RTG Regulation. In imposing a fine for such offences, it will be necessary to keep in mind that whilst each are individual offences, the offending conduct is substantially the same, namely that Mr Day drove in excess of the minimum specified hours on that day.

107Whilst the principles of sentencing stand against a mechanistic or mathematical approach, it is appropriate, in these unusual circumstances, and in light of the large number of charges with which the Court has to deal, to explain my broad approach to sentencing each of the defendants.

108In Mr Spiteri's case I have generally imposed a fine of 50 per cent of the maximum available. Where a second offence has been charged with respect to the same driver and the same date, the second fine is 25 per cent of the maximum available. In a number of cases where I have formed the view that the breaches were more serious the fines imposed have been higher.

109In the case of South Penrith, I have imposed penalties which reflect the fact that, on the one hand, the Company was the principal operator of the business, but on the other, Mr Spiteri was in real control and the Company was essentially a one person company.

110It is inappropriate to impose a fine on the Company so that Mr Spiteri is doubly punished. For that reason the fine has generally been fixed for the Company at 30 per cent of the maximum. If there is a second offence arising out of the same driver's conduct on the same date, that second offence is fixed at 15 per cent of the maximum.

111With respect to Mr Roberts, in light of the fact that he was an essentially untrained employee who is of limited financial means, I have generally imposed a fine of $500 for each offence, with a lesser fine when a second offence occurs on similar facts.

112Mrs Spiteri's fine is a nominal one reflecting her low degree of criminality, and the fact that she is charged in her capacity as a director of the Company.

Fines Imposed

113It will be appropriate to repeat the earlier table, but in a form which inserts the fines to be imposed, in place of the maximum penalties. The later orders of the Court will reflect the fines imposed by reference to each Summons.

Costs

114The prosecutor sought an order against all of the defendants that they pay the professional costs of the prosecutor. The prosecutor made it clear that he was not seeking to include in that order any previously reserved costs. 

115In seeking the order for costs, the prosecutor relied upon the provisions of s 257B of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

116The defendants opposed the order, and submitted that the prosecutor had conducted himself unreasonably during the course of the proceedings and, so, should be denied his costs.

117The defendants submitted that the prosecutor's conduct was unreasonable in three respects. First, the number and duplication of the charges was unreasonable. Secondly, the defendants point to the prosecutor's failure to supply a concise statement of the factual basis of the charges as being unreasonable conduct. This, it was submitted, prevented the defendants from making further early admissions. Thirdly, the defendants submitted that the prosecutor provided and relied upon voluminous material in interlocutory proceedings that was unnecessary because the material was largely irrelevant. 

118The interlocutory decisions of Barr AJ dealt with the matter outlined in the first and third bases above. His Honour made an order reserving the costs of those proceedings. The order for costs, which the prosecutor claims now, specifically excludes any reserved costs. The effect of this is that the defendants will not be faced with paying costs for two of the three matters that they regard as unreasonable. I do not need to make any finding as to whether the conduct of the prosecutor was or was not unreasonable in these respects.

119The second basis above, namely, that there was no provision by the prosecutor of statements of facts when requested, is regrettable. However, I am not satisfied that the conduct was unreasonable to such an extent as would warrant the Court making an order for costs. To the extent that any item of costs that is claimed can be said to be unreasonable, then that item can be challenged, and if appropriate, disallowed, during an assessment process.

120The prosecution was brought on a proper basis and in fulfilment of the discharge of a public obligation to enforce the heavy transport legislation where appropriate. In respect of the extant charges, the prosecution has resulted in multiple convictions. There is no good reason advanced as to why the defendants ought not pay the prosecutor's professional costs. In my view they should. 

121However, the legislation does not permit an order to be made that a defendant pay the prosecutor's costs of any proceedings in which they were not involved as a party. Accordingly, the costs orders will be framed to reflect only those proceedings to which the Company and other defendants were each a party.

		30 June 2014",2014-06-26 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704882,Aslan v R [2014] NSWCCA 114,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon him in the District Court on 12 December 2012, following his pleas of guilty to four counts on an indictment. Counts 1 to 3 were of sexual intercourse without consent; count 4 was of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Taken into account, pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"") were a further four offences listed on a Form 1: one of indecent assault, one of attempted sexual intercourse without consent, and two of sexual intercourse without consent.

2By s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), the maximum penalty applicable to sentences of sexual intercourse without consent (and attempted sexual intercourse without consent) is imprisonment for 14 years. Pursuant to Pt 4, Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, a standard non-parole period of 7 years is specified. By s 59(1) of the Crimes Act, the maximum penalty for assault occasioning actual bodily harm is imprisonment for 5 years. By s 61L of the Crimes Act, an offence of indecent assault (where charged separately) attracts a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years.

3Haesler DCJ sentenced the applicant pursuant to s 53A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, by imposing a single aggregate sentence of imprisonment for 9 years (commencing on 9 December 2011) with a non-parole period of 6 years which will expire on 8 December 2017. In so sentencing, and in compliance with s 53A(2), Haesler DCJ specified the sentences that he would, had he sentenced separately for each offence on the indictment, have imposed. Those indicative sentences were:

Count 1, taking into account the Form 1 offences: imprisonment for 6 years and 9 months, with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months;

Counts 2 and 3: imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 3 years;

Count 4: a fixed term of imprisonment for 1 year and 6 months.

He did not (and was not required to) state what level of accumulation and concurrency he would have made.

The facts

4All offences were committed as part of a single and extremely violent event, in the very early hours of 4 June 2011. The complainant, a woman of 35 years, had spent the previous evening with a friend and others in a hotel at Dulwich Hill. The complainant's friend left and the complainant remained at the hotel until about 1.30am, when she left to walk towards another hotel. While she was doing so, the applicant approached the complainant, greeted her, and put his arm around her shoulders, pulling her towards him. The complainant protested, but the applicant persisted, and told her to ""shut up"" and ""be quiet"". He steered her towards the entrance of a nearby church. There he continued to tell the complainant to shut up, and threatened to kill her if she did not. He ordered her to remove her clothes. She refused, and he attempted forcibly to remove her skirt. She yielded, and removed her own clothes. The applicant then ordered the complainant to perform fellatio upon him, forcing her head into his groin area. This constituted the first offence of sexual intercourse without consent (count 1 on the indictment). The applicant took hold of and caressed the complainant's breasts, and kissed her, inserting his tongue into her mouth. This constituted the indecent assault, the first of the offences on the Form 1. The applicant told the complainant to lie on her back, and attempted to have penile-vaginal sexual intercourse with her. He was unable to achieve erection. This constituted the attempted sexual intercourse without consent, the second offence on the Form 1. He again ordered the complainant to perform fellatio upon him. This constituted the third offence on the Form 1, of sexual intercourse without consent. The applicant ordered the complainant again to perform fellatio upon him, while he performed cunnilingus on her. This constituted the second count on the indictment of sexual intercourse without consent (count 2) and the fourth offence on the Form 1, of sexual intercourse without consent. The applicant again penetrated the complainant's vagina, either with his finger or a piece of a plant. This constituted the third count on the indictment of sexual intercourse without consent (count 3). The complainant complained that she was feeling faint and was very cold. The applicant handed the complainant her clothing (and, inadvertently, his own underwear) and the complainant dressed. The applicant also dressed and walked the complainant towards his car, his arm around her shoulders. She broke free and attempted to escape. The applicant took hold of her, and struck her on the mouth. The complainant fell to the ground and grazed her knees and hands. This constituted the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (count 4 on the indictment). 

5The complainant sought help from a nearby service station and telephoned the emergency number. 

6The applicant was identified as the perpetrator by DNA recovered from the underwear he had included in the clothing he returned to the complainant. He was arrested on 9 June 2011 and has remained in custody since that date. He entered a plea of guilty on 27 July 2012. 

7The complainant provided a comprehensive and articulate Victim Impact Statement. Hardly surprisingly, she said that, throughout the attack (which she appropriately described as a ""horrific ordeal"") she was ""extremely terrified and constantly afraid of what was going to happen to [her]"". She feared that she might be murdered. She said that, at the time of writing (which appears to have been about September 2012) she still suffered from nightmares and flashbacks, with continual reminders of the anger in the eyes of her attacker, and the feeling of powerlessness. She gave considerable detail, not necessary here to repeat, of the continuing impact on her life and her emotional stability. She has been unable to return to her pre-attack work, which was in Family Dispute Resolution.

The applicant's personal circumstances 

8The applicant's personal circumstances are complex. Evidence concerning his history came from a variety of sources, including a pre-sentence report prepared for the purpose of sentencing, a psychiatric report by Dr Stephen Allnutt, prepared for the same purpose, and oral evidence given by his sister. In addition, made available were extensive medical records relating to the applicant as well as pre-sentence reports prepared for earlier criminal proceedings against him. The material also included medical records maintained by Justice Health, during previous incarcerations of the applicant. From these sources the following emerges. 

9The applicant was born in Australia in August 1975, of Turkish parents, the third of four children. He was not quite 36 years of age at the date of the offence. 

10The family was highly dysfunctional. The applicant's father was an alcoholic who was violent towards his wife, the applicant's mother, and to the children. Not infrequently, the applicant's mother took the children from the house to nearby parks to wait until her husband was asleep before returning home. The applicant's father was reported to suffer from a mental illness, the nature of which has not been specified. The applicant's parents separated in 2001; his father died in 2007. The applicant began using drugs and alcohol at the age of 12.

11The applicant has a significant criminal history, which includes convictions for armed robbery with wounding (1993, aged about 18) and robbery (2009), and drug supply (2001). By far the most serious conviction is for manslaughter, committed in 1993 (just before the applicant turned 18) in respect of which he entered a plea of guilty. For that offence he was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years.

12In April 2009 the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years and 4 months (with a non-parole period of 3 years) for offences of assault with intent to rob, robbery, possession of a prohibited drug and shoplifting. He was released to parole on 9 February 2011. On 30 June 2011, following his arrest for the current offences, parole was revoked and he was returned to custody to serve the balance of that term, which expired on 15 August 2012. The present offences were therefore committed while the parole order was current.

13The applicant has been involved in two motor traffic accidents. The first was in February 2001, when he was riding a motorcycle. He sustained injuries to his leg, shoulder and back. The second, in November 2003, was a high-speed motor vehicle accident in which he was the driver of a car that crashed into parked cars. He suffered head injuries. He underwent extensive neurological assessment. This revealed a degree of brain damage. It is difficult, on the evidence, to assess the nature or degree of the brain damage. 

14The material before the sentencing judge included comprehensive medical records and reports on his condition up to May 2004. It also included a report from the psychiatrist, Dr Allnutt, dated 26 June 2012. Dr Allnutt had available to him the applicant's medical record, both with respect to the investigations following the motor vehicle accident and the Justice Health records. 

15The author of the Pre-Sentence Report recorded:

""It is reported that as a result of the motor vehicle crashes, [the applicant] sustained brain damage which led to his being diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder. He was prescribed medication for these conditions; however after being released to parole, Mr Aslan admitted that he did not adhere to his medication regime and had, in fact, not taken any medication for five days prior to the offence. Instead he chose to self medicate with alcohol and illicit substances as his mental condition deteriorated.""

16It was also reported that the applicant began abusing drugs and alcohol at the age of 12, using alcohol to the point of passing out. After the motorcycle accident he began using heroin intravenously, as well as a variety of other drugs, including amphetamines.

17The applicant married in 2005 and is the father of a son, now about eight years of age. He is separated from his wife. His wife left, with their son, as a result of the applicant's continued drug and alcohol use and mental health instability, which led to previous offences and incarceration.

18The history taken by Dr Allnutt recorded the applicant having seen a psychiatrist while in custody in 2008, as a result of which he was treated for anxiety. The anxiety apparently continued after his release and he used cannabis by way of dealing with that condition. The applicant also reported to Dr Allnutt weekly ongoing panic attacks, and some symptoms of paranoia. 

19Dr Allnutt made extensive reference to the historical material with which he had been provided. On the basis of that material, and the history taken from the applicant, Dr Allnutt expressed the following opinions:

""In my opinion [the applicant] was manifesting symptoms of anxiety and depression characterised by poor motivation, poor self esteem but predominantly panic attacks in the form of crawling in his skin, restlessness, rapid breathing, shortness of breath and palpitations lasting for a few minutes; in addition to this he describes perceptual phenomena in the form of voices, hearing people whispering about him; overall while he manifests panic attacks, I would not diagnose him with a chronic psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia, but it is likely that his perceptual disturbances relate to mild persisting drug induced psychotic symptoms related to his long term substance abuse history.

... He has suffered a severe head injury and possibly ongoing cognitive difficulties as a consequence of that; a prior neuropsychological assessment reported short-term memory impairment, concrete thought impulsiveness, poor concentration and attention, disinhibited behaviour and psychomotor agitation, poor judgment, disorganised planning and given the relative static nature of cognitive impairment due to severe brain injury these difficulties likely remain (I did not have available a recent neuropsychological assessment).""

20With specific reference to the applicant's mental state at the time of the offences, Dr Allnutt said:

""At the time of the alleged offence [the applicant] would have been experiencing the ongoing cognitive problems derived from his head injury; he also describes at that time experiencing episodes of 'black outs' where he would lose memory for things, however this is in the context of a long history of poly-substance abuse; substance intoxication is known to cause episodes of 'black outs' related to periods of intoxication and this is probably the cause of [the applicant's] 'black outs'.

In the time leading up to the index incident he was using substances on a regular basis including cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines, methamphetamines and alcohol; he was experiencing voices where he would hear people whispering about him; he would turn and look and sometimes think that people were there; these symptoms likely were related to his substance abuse and drug induced.

He was also experiencing panic attacks.

... 

I do not believe that he had an underlying mental disorder that caused significant distortion of his perception of events due to a mental condition; while he has memory problems on cognitive testing his account his unlikely to be confabulation; he was intoxicated and likely was experiencing the ongoing effect of head injury and there could have been a compounding of effects and thus he would have been at risk of having poor judgment and being disinhibited; this could have made him vulnerable to misinterpreting the complainant's signals, that is to misinterpreting the interaction he had with her an invitation to consensual sexual activity; however this does not explain the allegation of coercive sexual activity.

The nexus between his cognitive deficits, intoxication and the alleged offending is probably best determined once the factual matters are established, that is once there is factual clarity on the nature of the interaction between [the applicant] and the victim; I would also recommend that [the applicant] pursue further neuropsychological assessment.""

21The references in the last and second last of these paragraphs to factual matters concerning the offence were references to the account given by the applicant to Dr Allnutt of the events of 3-4 June 2011. That account exculpated the applicant, and asserted that it was the complainant who initiated the sexual activity, following an arrangement between them that he would provide her with ""some substances"" in return for sexual favours. That account was significantly contradicted by the agreed statement of facts.

22The applicant's medical history, which was contained in the substantial bundle of records provided to Dr Allnutt, included rehabilitation reports written in 2004, in the immediate aftermath of the motor vehicle accident, as well as a report of neuropsychological assessment dated 19 May 2004.

23On 7 May 2004 Dr Stuart Browne, a Rehabilitation Specialist, reported on his investigations of the applicant's head injury. He recorded having seen the applicant on numerous occasions, and said:

""His behaviour has been consistent with a traumatic brain injury, with evidence of cognitive impairment and behavioural changes. He has demonstrated significant short term memory impairment, concrete thought, impulsiveness, poor concentration and attention, disinhibited behaviour, and psychomotor agitation. 

[The applicant's] brain injury manifests as forgetfulness, impulsive decision making, poor judgments, and disorganised planning. He interrupts frequently during conversations, indicating his lack of impulse control ...""

24On 19 May 2004 Dr Charlotte Morgan, a clinical neuropsychologist, after conducting a battery of tests, reported:

""The overall pattern of his test results, behaviour and interpersonal interaction suggests ongoing post-concussional disorder evident by continued dysfunction in executive functioning (conceptual shifting, inhibition difficulties, word generativity difficulties, and poor abstraction), slowed cognitive processing, poor visual and verbal memory and verbal reasoning dysfunction. Evidence of behavioural changes also presented severe difficulties with managing depression, anxiety and stress. This is consistent [with] the pattern expected in post-concussional disorder associated with traumatic brain injury.""

The Remarks on Sentence

25Haesler DCJ recounted the facts of the offences. Not surprisingly, he found the offences, both the individually and in toto, to be ""of very significant objective seriousness""; he referred to the Crown's characterisation of the events as ""any woman's worst nightmare"", a characterisation with which he expressly agreed. He then referred, in some detail, to the applicant's personal circumstances. When dealing with matters personal to the applicant, his Honour said:

""... nothing in the offender's background mitigates the objective seriousness of his crimes. That said, there are matters which cause me to mitigate the sentence which would otherwise be appropriate. His injuries, particularly his acquired brain injury do require a measure of sympathy as noted by Allan J in Engert v R [1995] 85 A Crim R 67. It is also clear that a consequence of his injury it will mean that his custodial sentence will weigh more heavily on him than other prisoners. His time in prison will be more onerous. This does not eliminate the need for specific deterrence. It does moderate to a very small degree the requirements calling for general deterrence, more for the issue of sympathy as spoken of by Allan J than because of his condition ... There is room in this sentencing exercise for moderation of the sentence because of his acquired brain injury and other problems ...

While this [the applicant's continuing use of illicit drugs and alcohol] may in turn be explained by his acquired brain injury, his dysfunctional background and the antisocial impact of long periods of incarceration while a child, nothing could operate to excuse what was done to [the complainant]. Specific and general deterrence principles still have a role to play."" (italics added)

26With respect to the applicant's acquired brain injury, he said:

""I accept that that injury left the offender with less capacity to exercise care and judgment as to the use of and the uptake of drugs and alcohol.""

He made extensive reference to Dr Allnutt's report which he found was essentially ""sound"" (the only reservation being his record of the applicant's (later contradicted) exculpatory account of the events in question). He expressed his intention of taking that injury into account in the formulation of the overall sentence, and said:

""I am prepared to accept that it made him more susceptible to abusing drugs and alcohol because he had less intellectual capacity to refuse or make a decision whether or not to use such drugs and alcohol. Clearly his acquired brain injury interfered with his capacity to exercise judgment in that respect. I do not accept however that there was any direct impact of the acquired brain injury on his offending this night ...

He was clearly still capable, despite his brain injury, of making rational choices. He was warned by his parole officer about resuming the uptake of drugs. He was counselled by his parole officers. He was counselled by his family. He chose to go off his medication. He chose to use alcohol. He chose to use drugs and he committed this offence under the influence of drugs and alcohol, not under the influence of his acquired brain injury. He knew what he was doing and he knew that what he was doing was wrong."" (italics added)

27Haesler DCJ accepted that, by reason of the brain injury, the applicant's time in prison would be more difficult than it otherwise would (see [25] above). However, he was also conscious of the need to protect the community, a consideration that is sometimes enhanced in cases where mental impairment is a factor.

28He noted that the four counts on the indictment represented part of a ""connected series of events"", and considered them to involve ""similar levels of seriousness"". He considered that each of the offences of sexual intercourse without consent ""involved criminality of the highest order"". He referred to the Victim Impact Statement, and concluded that the emotional harm suffered by the complainant was substantial. He recognised that the offences were aggravated by the fact that they were committed while the applicant was on conditional liberty.

29In recognition of the applicant's pleas of guilty, Haesler DCJ reduced the sentence he otherwise would have imposed by 25 per cent: see R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383.

30Pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act he varied the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period. The reason for this was substantially the applicant's brain injury, and other personal circumstances to which reference has already been made.

The grounds of the application

31The proposed grounds of appeal are eight in number. Grounds 1 to 5 complain of the manner in which the applicant's ""acquired brain injury"" was treated by the sentencing judge: they assert that insufficient weight was given to the opinion of Dr Allnutt (extracted above); that the sentencing judge erroneously limited the relevance of the applicant's acquired brain injury to his capacity to exercise care and judgment as to the use of drugs and alcohol; that the sentencing judge erroneously held that there was no direct impact of the applicant's acquired brain injury on the offence. Proposed grounds 4 and 5 are pleaded as follows:

""4 His Honour erred by failing to find that the offender's acquired brain injury did not contribute to the commission of the offences in a material way.

5 His Honour erred by failing to find the offender's acquired brain injury did not significantly reduce the offender's moral culpability as relevant to general deterrence.""

(Obviously these grounds do not reflect what the pleader intended to plead.)

32Ground 6 asserts that the aggregate sentence is [manifestly] excessive in all of the circumstances. Grounds 7 and 8 complain that the variation in the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence was inadequate and failed to provide adequate time for supervision on parole.

Consideration

Grounds 1-5: the effect of the applicant's ""acquired brain injury""

33This Court has frequently had to grapple with the effect on sentencing (especially with respect to serious or violent crimes) of mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental or emotional impairment or disability. The compassion and sympathy that such a condition engenders collide with the need for sentences to reflect the objective gravity of the offence in question, the community's interest in general deterrence, and that criminal conduct must be met with appropriate denunciation and retribution. Over the years, the applicable principles have evolved. They were most recently re-stated by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [177]. They are as follows:

""[Principle 1]  Where the state of a person's mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence ...

[Principle 2]  It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed ...

[Principle 3]  It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced ...

[Principle 4]  It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence ...

[Principle 5]  Conversely, it may be that because of a person's mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence ... Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public ..."" (internal citations omitted, italics added)

34It will be observed that none of these principles is stated as absolute. What is recognised is the potential effect, in any given case, of a mental disability. It does not follow that, because an offender suffers from some mental impairment or disability, his or her moral culpability is reduced (principle 1); nor that he or she is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence (principle 2); nor that a custodial sentence will weigh more heavily upon him or her (principle 3); nor that the significance of specific deterrence is reduced or eliminated (principle 4). Nor, on the other hand, does it follow that a person with mental impairment is a danger to the community, indicating a need for community protection (principle 5). Too often, the mere fact of mental illness is advanced to this Court as necessarily calling for a more lenient sentence. What the principles spelled out by McClellan CJ at CL do is direct attention to considerations that experience has shown commonly arise in such cases. There is, however, no presumption. It remains necessary for the sentencing court to examine the relevant facts in order to determine whether, in the specific case, the mental condition has the consequence contended for.

35A central question (but not the only question) is whether the mental illness or other condition had a causative role to play in the commission of the offence or offences for which the offender is to be sentenced. Counsel who appeared for the applicant accepted that this was the principal issue in this case. If it is concluded that there was a causal connection, then the offender's moral culpability may be reduced (see principle 1). That connection may also warrant lesser attention being paid to the need for the sentence to reflect considerations of general deterrence (principle 2).

36Haesler DCJ gave careful consideration to whether any causal link between the applicant's acquired brain injury and the commission of the offences had been established. He accepted a causal link between the acquired brain injury and the applicant's drug and alcohol consumption; he expressly did not accept such a causal link between the acquired brain injury and the commission of the offences. 

37That process of reasoning is the subject of grounds 1-4 of the proposed appeal. The basis for the challenge is to be found in the reports of Dr Morgan and Dr Allnutt. Dr Morgan was the neuropsychologist who conducted a series of tests on the applicant in May 2004, only five months after the motor vehicle accident that caused the injury. She, it will be recalled, found slow cognitive processing, poor visual and verbal memory and verbal reasoning dysfunction. She also found evidence of behavioural changes in managing depression, anxiety and stress. She said that this was consistent with the pattern expected in post-concussional disorder associated with traumatic brain injury.

38She recommended monitoring over the following six months, and repeat neuropsychological assessment after that time. There is no evidence of such repeat assessment. 

39It is true that Dr Allnutt considered that, at the time of the offences, the applicant ""would have been experiencing the ongoing cognitive problems derived from his head injury"". However, he did not make a causal connection between the applicant's cognitive problems and his involvement in these offences. Rather, he went on immediately to deal with the applicant's ""black outs"", which he explicitly associated with poly-substance abuse. 

40In respect of the applicant's head injury, Dr Allnutt relied significantly upon the medical history and the reports of other professionals. They include Dr Morgan's report and others, none later than May 2004. 

41It was submitted that there is established no rational basis for the judge's finding that the effect of the acquired brain injury was limited to drug and alcohol abuse. I would reject that proposition. There is no evidentiary basis for any other finding.

42In any event, notwithstanding that he was not satisfied that a causal connection existed between the acquired brain injury and the commission of the offences, Haesler DCJ expressly took into account the effects of the acquired brain injury. He accepted that prison would weigh more heavily on him. I have set out above the many passages in the Remarks on Sentence in which he referred to the brain injury and I do not repeat them.

43The actual effect of the applicant's acquired brain injury on him was not the subject of any clear evidence. Apart from Dr Allnutt, who, in this respect, relied on the reports of those who treated and examined the applicant following the motor vehicle accident, the most recent reports were dated 2004. 

44In considering this issue, it is of some value also to compare the applicant's record pre-injury and that post injury. Prior to injury he was convicted of offences of assault, robbery with wounding, manslaughter, and supply of prohibited drug. Post injury, he had significant periods with no, or relatively minor, convictions, until the series of offences, including robbery, in 2009. That is not suggestive of a causal connection between the acquired brain injury and the offences the subject of the present application.

45I am satisfied that Haesler DCJ appropriately took into account the applicant's medical condition. I would reject these proposed grounds of appeal.

Ground 6: manifest excess?

46The submissions directed to ground 6 repeated what had been said in relation to grounds 1-5. It was further argued that the sentence was, in any event, manifestly excessive. It was pointed out that, since a 25 per cent reduction in what otherwise would have been the sentence was allowed in recognition of the pleas of guilty, the starting point was a sentence (head sentence) of 12 years. This, it was submitted, was manifestly excessive ""in all the circumstances"". 

47It is only necessary to reflect on the nature of the offences to reject this contention. The complainant was, over a short space of time, subjected to five separate instances of sexual intercourse without consent, of the most invasive and degrading kind - forced fellatio (on three occasions), unwanted cunnilingus, penetration with a finger or a plant part, together with an attempted sixth instance that failed only because the applicant failed to achieve erection. She was threatened. After the sexual assaults she was physically assaulted with sufficient force to cause her to fall to the ground. Her Victim Impact Statement tells of the impact of the offences on her.

48I reject the suggestion that a starting point of 12 years for this series of offences was anything other than well within the range available. I would reject ground 6.

Grounds 7-8: special circumstances

49These grounds complain that, although the applicant was given the benefit of a finding of special circumstances and the consequent reduction in the statutory proportion between the head sentence and the non-parole period, that reduction was insufficient because he will need a longer period on supervised parole.

50A sentence of 9 years, on the statutory proportions, would result in a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months. The variation allowed was therefore of 9 months. This is far from insignificant. Consideration of this ground involves appreciation of what supervision will be available to the applicant. He will have the benefit (should he choose to avail himself of it) of pre-release sex offender programmes. From his release (if his conduct is such that he is granted parole on the expiration of the non-parole period) he will have 3 years to take advantage of the supervision that will be made available to him. I am satisfied that this is an adequate period of supervision. 

51The second aspect to which attention must be directed is the ultimate length of the non-parole period. In my opinion, for this series of offences, anything below 6 years by way of non-parole period would be, at the very least, open to question.

52I would reject grounds 7 and 8.

53Although I would grant leave to appeal, it follows that I would dismiss the appeal.

54The orders I propose are:

(1)Leave to appeal granted;

(2)Appeal dismissed.

55ADAMS J: I agree with Simpson J.

56McCALLUM J: I agree with Simpson J, for the reasons her Honour has stated.

		20 June 2014",2014-06-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704888,"Kemp v Doble, Kemp v Doble Express Transport Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 785","Judgment
1On 2 May 2013, Peter Stewart Kemp, the prosecutor, commenced proceedings against Doble Express Transport Pty Ltd (""the Company""), alleging that it had committed, as an operator, an offence under s 56 of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (""the RTG Act"").
2On 6 June 2014, counsel for the Company indicated to the Court that it proposed to plead guilty to that offence, when the proceedings were listed for hearing on 10 June 2014.  On that day, a plea of guilty was entered.
3On 2 May 2013, the prosecutor filed a Summons alleging that Graeme John Doble (""Mr Doble"") was guilty of an offence pursuant to s 178 of the RTG Act in respect of an offence by an operator under s 56 of that Act.  
4On Tuesday 10 June 2014, counsel for Mr Doble entered a plea of guilty to that offence.  
5The sentencing proceedings were heard together.  The evidence in each proceeding was the evidence in the other proceeding.  It is convenient to deal with both matters in the one judgment, because of the commonality of facts.
6The Company and Mr Doble now stand to be sentenced for these offences.  The maximum penalty for each of these offences is determined by reference to the categorisation of the offence, or in the case of Mr Doble, the underlying offence, as being minor, substantial or severe, as those terms are used in s 59 and s 60 of the RTG Act.
7Here, each of the prosecution, the Company and Mr Doble, agree that each of these offences is properly to be categorised as involving a severe breach of the statutory requirements.  Accordingly, the maximum fine that can be imposed with respect to the Company for its offence is 250 penalty units, which amounts to $27,500.  The maximum fine that can be imposed for Mr Doble for his offence is 50 penalty units, which amounts to $5,500.
8In the matter of Kemp v KGB Protective Coatings Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 586, at [6]-[8], I had occasion to draw attention, in the context of that prosecution to the fact that the penalties fell within the jurisdictional limit of the Local Court of NSW.  I repeat the remarks that I there made about the inappropriateness of the use of the summary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court for offences of the kind here being dealt with.
Principles of Sentencing
9The imposition of a sentence in this case calls up both the common law principles relating to sentencing, and also a variety of statutory provisions.
10The Parliament of NSW has set out the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender including a company.  Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides that those purposes are:
(a)to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence;(b)to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences;(c)to protect the community from the offender;(d)to promote the rehabilitation of the offender;(e)to make the offender accountable for his or her actions;(f)to denounce the conduct of the offender;(g)to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.
11It is self-evident that these purposes overlap, may be in conflict, and cannot be considered in isolation, one from the other, in their application to a particular case.  These purposes do not rank in any order of priority.  The Court is obliged in imposing these sentences to have regard to these purposes.
12The terms of s 21A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, mean that the Parliament has preserved the entire body of judicially developed, or common law, sentencing principles: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [56]-[57], Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [18].  These common law principles have been developed over time by courts to provide guidance for the exercise of the sentencing discretion by every judge.  
13This is a case where, given the nature of the offence, the fact it involved a heavy transport vehicle and occurred on a public road and the principle of general deterrence, must play an important but proportionate, role.  In these circumstances the condign punishment of the Company will operate as a general deterrence for other companies which operate heavy vehicles for transport on the public roads of NSW from committing breaches of transport legislation, in particular of load restraint requirements, and thereby enhance road safety.  It should also serve as a deterrent for any person who is a director of such a company.
The Facts
14The prosecutor, and each of the Company and Mr Doble, have agreed upon a Statement of Facts which generally describe the conduct of each of the defendants, the offences and their consequences.  I am not bound to accept these facts, however, in this case, upon the basis of such material as has been tendered, I do so.  The facts, which I accept and which relate to the time of the offences, are set out below:
""1. At about 10.20am on 3 May 2011, a combination motor vehicle, consisting of a Volvo rigid truck, NSW Registration K69126, and a single axle ""pig"" trailer, NSW Registration K69126 (the trailer) [together referred to as 'the combination'], was being driven in a generally eastern direction along Lue Road, approximately 15 km from Mudgee in the State of NSW.
2. At about the said time and place the trailer was loaded with 5 bulk industrial gas cylinder packs, known as Maxi 8s.
3. At about the said time and place, the trailer flipped onto the path of oncoming traffic.
4. A portion of the trailer and at least one of the 5 Maxi 8s collided with a Mazda wagon being driven by Ms Jane Mersing.

22. Mr Webber was assigned by DXT to operate the combination in the transport of goods by road....
29. Air Liquide supplied industrial gases, in particular nitrogen gas, in bulk cylinder packs known as ""Maxi 8"" packs (Maxi 8s).
30. Maxi 8s consisted of:(i)        a metal, caged pallet (pallet) that measured:· 197cm high;· 97cm wide; and· 47cm deep(ii)       8 connected gas cylinders.The base of each Maxi 8 was smooth metal.
31. Each Maxi 8 was marked with an ""average gross weight"" of ""920kg"" and a ""safe working load"" weight of ""920kg"".
32. A Maxi 8, when the 8 gas cylinders were ""empty"" of gas, had an average gross weight of approximately 700kg.
33. On 2 January, 2007 Air Liquide and Robert Oatley Vineyards Pty Limited (ROV) executed a Cylinder Service and Supply Agreement, for an initial term of five years, pursuant to which ROV agreed to purchase from Air Liquide and Air Liquide agreed to supply ROV with its total industrial gas requirements. The Cylinder Service and Supply Agreement included the supply of gaseous nitrogen by Air Liquide to ROV at its premises located on Henry Lawson Drive at Mudgee (the winery).
34. Commencing in about 2008, Air Liquide retained the services of DXT in relation to the delivery by road, from time to time, of gaseous nitrogen, contained in cylinders to the winery and the collection of empty gas cylinders from the winery.
35. There was no written contract between Air Liquide and DXT in relation to the provision by DXT of its services in the delivery by road of cylinders of gaseous nitrogen to ROV and the return of empty gas cylinders from ROV by road to Air Liquide.
36. Air Liquide did not provide any written instructions, written directions and/or written guidelines to DXT in relation to the transportation by road of its gas cylinders, whether full or empty, including the transportation by road of bulk packs of gas cylinders supplied by Air Liquide and known as Maxi 8s.
37. On or about 14 April, 2011 ROV ordered delivery of one Maxi 8 of nitrogen from Air Liquide to the winery and requested the collection of five empty Maxi 8s from the winery for return to Air Liquide.
....
40. On or about 29 April, 2011, ... Air Liquide, placed two orders with DXT in relation to:(i)        the delivery of one Maxi 8 of gaseous nitrogen to the winery; and (ii)       the collection from the winery of five Maxi 8s that were empty of gas for return to Air Liquide.
....
42. On 3 May, 2011, in the course of his employment with DXT, Mr Webber was assigned to drive the combination on the transport run comprised in DXT runsheet number 45829.
43. The DXT transport run comprised in DXT runsheet number 45829 included the collection of five Maxi 8s from ""Oatley Family Wines, Henry Lawson Drive, (Poet's Corner Winery) Mudgee NSW 2850"" for return to Air Liquide under DXT pickup reference number PU4097.
44. At about 9.20am on 3 May, 2011 Mr Webber drove the combination into the winery.
45. On the arrival of the combination at the winery:· the truck contained a small amount of general freight; and· the trailer was empty.
46. On the arrival of the combination at the winery five Air Liquide Maxi 8s, empty of gas, were available to be collected by Mr Webber for return by road to Air Liquide.
47. Under Mr Webber's direction the five Maxi 8s were loaded, using a forklift, onto the trailer. The Maxi 8's were loaded one by one. Four Maxi 8s were loaded across the front of the trailer, immediately adjacent to the headboard. The remaining Maxi 8 was loaded to the rear of, and immediately adjacent to, the four Maxi 8s.
48. At the time of loading, the five Maxi 8s were loaded firmly against each other on the trailer.
49. The combined width of the four Maxi 8s, loaded by side by side adjacent to the headboard of the trailer, was 188cm.
50. The four Maxi 8s loaded adjacent to the headboard were positioned centrally on the trailer and there was a gap of approximately 25cm to the raised edge or combing of the trailer on either side of the four Maxi 8s loaded adjacent to the headboard.
51. The fifth Maxi 8, loaded to the rear of the four Maxi 8s adjacent to the headboard, was also centred on the trailer.
52. The headboard of the trailer was metal with a smooth painted surface.
53. The surface of the trailer, onto which the five Maxi 8s were loaded, was unpainted checkerboard sheet metal.
54. No anti-slip material or dunnage was placed between the base of each Maxi 8 and the checkerboard metal deck of the trailer.
55. Mr Webber restrained the five Maxi 8s on the trailer using a single 2,500kg synthetic ratchet strap (the strap).
56. The strap was placed, by Mr Webber, around the five Maxi 8s with:· one end of the strap being secured to an upright component of the headboard located to the right-hand side of the trailer;· the other end of the strap being secured to an upright component of the headboard located to the left of the trailer; and· the strap located approximately 125cm from the base of each ""Maxi 8 .
57. Mr Webber did not place any padding or other protection to stop the strap from rubbing on the metal angles of the headboard and the metal angles of the Maxi 8s.
58. Mr Webber did not apply any load restraint over the top of the Maxi 8s to prevent vertical movement.
59. Mr Webber did not block the load to prevent sideways movement of the Maxi 8s on the deck of the trailer.
60. At all material times, after the five Maxi 8s had been loaded and retrained on the trailer, Mr Webber put in place two metal side gates. Mr Webber used two natural fibre ropes to secure the side gates in position on the trailer. The two ropes were not used to restrain the five Maxi 8s on the trailer.
61. Mr Webber then drove the combination out of the winery and travelled, by road, towards Rylstone in the State of New South Wales.
62. At about 10.20am Mr Webber was driving the combination at approximately 90km per hour in a generally easterly direction on Lue Road about 15km from Mudgee.
63. On Lue Road, a short distance past the Hayes Gap Rd turn-off, and shortly after Mr Webber had driven the combination through a right hand kink in the road, some or all of the Maxi 8s moved to the left on the bed of the trailer. The movement of the Maxi 8s, to the left on the bed of the trailer, caused the trailer to dip towards its left hand side.
64. A short time later, as Mr Webber was commencing to drive the combination through a left hand bend in Lue Road, the Maxi 8s moved across the bed of the trailer to right hand side of the trailer. The movement of the Maxi 8s on the bed of the trailer, to its right hand side, caused the trailer to dip to the right.
65. As the trailer dipped towards its right hand side, the left hand tyre of the trailer lifted from the roadway, continuing to rise until the trailer flipped into the oncoming lane of Lue Road.
66. At the same time and at the same place on Lue Road, Jane Mersing, 58 years of age, was driving a Mazda wagon, NSW Registration VXL-969, in a generally westerly direction.  There were no passengers in the Mazda wagon.
67. The turning moment caused by the movement of the Maxi 8s on the bed of the trailer, from left to right, caused stress on the tow coupling between the truck and the trailer.
68. Due to stress on the tow coupling, from the turning moment caused by the movement of the Maxi 8 s from left to right on the bed of the trailer, the trailer dislodged from the tow bar fitted to the truck.
69. The safety chains, used as backup between the truck and trailer, failed due to the forces involved in the overturning of the trailer.
70. The five Maxi 8s were also dislodged from the trailer.
71. A portion of the trailer and at least one Maxi 8 collided with the Mazda wagon being driven by Ms Mersing.
72. The impact of the trailer, and of at least one Maxi 8, with the Mazda wagon caused Ms Mersing to sustain severe injury.
73. As a result of the injuries sustained in the impact, Ms Mersing died at the incident scene.
74. A mechanical examination of the trailer performed after the incident disclosed no mechanical defect or failure in relation to the trailer that was a contributing factor to the subject incident.
75. Upon examination after the incident, the main clamping bolt which formed part of the towing mechanism between the truck and trailer, was found to have failed. Upon examination, the mode of failure was observed to be consistent with mechanical overload, most likely due to the overturning moment of the trailer which caused axial tensile forces to be applied to the clamping bolt.
76. Prior to the incident the clamping bolt was not compromised in any way that contributed to the occurrence of the subject incident.
....
78. The general condition of the roadway at the incident scene was in excellent condition and no features were identified that played a causative role in the subject incident.
15That the load was not properly secured is clear and accepted by the Company and Mr Doble.  But it is necessary to understand the ways in which the securing of it was defective and what could have been done to remedy that inadequacy, and so prevent the death of Ms Mersing.
16This evidence is to be obtained in large part from the expert report of Mr M Robertson of Engistics Pty Ltd, which is relied upon by the prosecution.  Mr Robertson was not required for cross-examination.  His report was accepted as substantially accurate by Mr Rob Di Cristoforo, an expert relied upon by the Company and Mr Doble.  I accept Mr Robertson's evidence.  
17Mr Robertson identifies two ""crucial matters"" which had a direct effect on the load restraint.  The first is that the metal pallets of gas cylinders were placed directly onto the steel deck of the trailer, resulting in low friction.  This could have easily been addressed by placing anti-slip rubber matting, timber sheeting or timber dunnage between the metal pallet and the steel deck of the trailer.  Mr Robertson expressed the view that placing goods ""metal on metal"" directly onto a steel deck was poor load restraint practice.  The problem of low ""metal on metal"" friction was widely known in the transport industry prior to this collision.  Mr Doble accepted in his evidence that this was so.
18The second crucial matter identified by Mr Robertson was the method of lashing used in this case because, besides being of inadequate restraining capacity, the lashing failed to provide any direct restraint.  This means that the relevant force was taken directly onto the lashing without relying upon friction.  That failure occurred because only one strap was used, and it was anchored at an inappropriate angle being bent around and towards the central uprights of the headboard.  The webbing straps did not have any protective sleeve at the corners of the steel post.  
19Such was the inadequacy of the restraining strap that Mr Robertson expressed the view that it:
""... dooms the strap to premature failure when loaded because it exposes the webbing to a steel edge and places uneven loads on the strands within the webbing.""
20In short, the combination of these two crucial matters meant that there was little sideways resistance to sliding, with the result that the restraint method failed at 0.21 G of lateral force, when the minimum legal requirement for adequate sideways restraint was that the load not be able to move or dislodge under a lateral force of 0.5 G.  Put simply, the capacity of the lashing was a little over forty per cent of the minimum legal requirement.
21The inadequacy of the load restraint could have been, but was not, addressed by any of the following measures which were well-known in the transport industry, and readily available to be implemented here:
using timber or other like material to ""sideways block"" the load to prevent lateral movement;using at least three webbing straps and lashing the load in a different configuration;restraining the load over the top of it to prevent vertical movement during transport;attaching the webbing straps to the outer, rather than the central, vertical posts of the headboard.
22The expert opinions of Mr Robertson and Mr Di Cristoforo both expressed the view, which I accept, that the breach of the load restraint requirement was a severe breach.  I am satisfied that it was because the breach involved an appreciable issue of harm to public safety.  Once the gas cylinders had been loaded, the journey embarked on was about 150km long.  That the journey was much shorter in fact because of the collision does not diminish the potential risk of harm to public safety.
23As well, because of the inadequacy of the load restraint and the risk of the load being dislodged during the journey, there was a serious risk of harm to the road infrastructure and, if a collision occurred, there would inevitably be increased traffic congestion at and around the collision site, with a consequent diminution of public amenity.
24Clearly this was a severe risk breach with many of the consequences to which s 60 of the RTG Act refers.
Specific Statutory Provisions
25In imposing a penalty for each of these offences, there are a number of specific statutory provisions to which it is necessary to have regard.  
26The first of these is clause 61(2) of the Road Transport (Mass Loading and Access) Regulation 2005 (""MLA Regulations"").  That clause provides that a load on a vehicle or trailer 
""... must be secured so that it is unlikely to ... be dislodged from the vehicle.""
27As well, s 60 of the RTG Act is also relevant.  It is in the following form:
""60 Matters to be taken into consideration by courts (1) The purpose of this section is to bring to the attention of courts the general implications and consequences of breaches of mass, dimension or load restraint requirements when determining the kinds and levels of sanctions to be imposed.(2) In determining the sanctions (including the level of fine) that are to be imposed in respect of breaches of mass, dimension or load restraint requirements, a court is to take into consideration the classification of the breach under this Part and, having regard to that classification, the following matters:(a)  minor risk breaches ...(b)  substantial risk breaches ...(c)  severe risk breaches involve one or more of the following:(i) an appreciable risk of harm to public safety or theenvironment,(ii) a serious risk of accelerated road wear,(iii) a serious risk of harm to road infrastructure,(iv) a serious risk of increased traffic congestion,(v) a serious risk of diminished public amenity,(vi) a serious risk of unfair commercial advantage....""
28As Price J said in Roads & Traffic Authority NSW v Fletcher International Exports Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 936; (2008) 51 MVR 41 at [40]:
""40 The purpose of s 60 is to bring to the attention of courts when considering an appropriate sentence the consequences of a failure to comply with a breach of mass, dimension or load restraint requirement. The matters to which a court is required by s 60(2) to have regard depends upon the classification of the risk breach as a minor, substantial or severe. The matters which a court is required to consider by the Legislature for a severe risk breach are necessarily very different to those for a minor risk breach. The requirement that regard be had to an appreciable risk of harm to public safety is exclusive to sentencing for a severe risk breach: s 60(2)(c)(i). For a severe risk breach it is the seriousness of the risk which distinguishes those matters detailed in subparagraphs (ii)-(vi) from the matters to be considered for a substantial risk breach: s 60(2)(b)(i)-(v). Nothing in s 60 affects any other matter that a court may consider when sentencing an offender such as s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which sets out the purposes for which a court can impose a sentence and s 21A of the same Act which provides for aggravating and mitigating factors.""
29Because I am imposing a sentence for a severe risk breach, I am obliged to, and will have regard to, each of the matters in s 60(c)(i)-(vi) inclusive, insofar as they are presently relevant.  As I have earlier remarked, the matters within that section which are of particular relevance are:
(h)an appreciable risk of harm to public safety as was demonstrated by what in fact occurred;
(i)a serious risk of harm to the road infrastructure as occurred when the load, having fallen off the truck, damaged the road itself, and which may have, but fortunately did not occasion any damage to other roadside infrastructure;
(j)the serious risk of traffic congestion caused by the happening of either of the two events to which I have just made reference or, alternatively, if the load shifted in the course of transport.
30The provisions of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act must also be taken into account.  Section 21A(2) provides for matters which are regarded as aggravating factors to be taken into consideration when imposing a sentence.  Here, relevantly, s 21A(2)(g) requires the Court to take into account as an aggravating factor, that the injury, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial.  There is no doubt that those consequences of this offence were substantial.  The loss of the life of Ms Mersing, is the most serious consequence of this offence.  
31Section 21A(3) of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) Act requires the Court to have regard to particular factors as mitigating the offence.  In accordance with that section, I have regard here to the fact that the Company does not have any record of relevant previous convictions: s 21A(3)(e).
32The provisions of s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, have the effect that, if the Company is remorseful and as provided for in s 21A(3)(g), is unlikely to offend again, then these are matters which can be taken into account by way of mitigation when considering the appropriate penalty to be imposed.  It will be necessary to consider whether this is so in due course.  
33Since the Court is imposing a fine on the Company, s 6 of the Fines Act 1996 requires the Court to consider such information as is provided about the means of the Company to pay the fine.  The Company has not tendered any financial statements or other information about its capacity or lack of capacity to pay any fine which is imposed.  Mr Doble is in a similar position.  Thus, there is no basis to temper any fine because of the financial circumstances of either defendant.
34I cannot be satisfied that any fine which may be imposed would have any significant adverse financial impact on the commercial operations of the Company.  I do not propose to regard this factor as having any significant weight in assessing the appropriate fine to be imposed.  
Plea of Guilty
35Offenders, such as the Company and Mr Doble, who or which plead guilty to the offences charged, are ordinarily entitled to a discount with respect to any penalty which is imposed, so as to recognise the utilitarian value of the plea to the administration of justice in NSW: s 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
36It is clear that the discount for the utilitarian value of a plea will be determined largely by the timing of the plea, so that the earlier the plea, the greater discount: R v Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [154]; R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377 at [117]; R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32].
37As Howie J said in Borkowski, with the agreement of McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J, at [32]:
""9. The utilitarian value of a delayed plea is less and consequently the discount is reduced even where there has been a plea bargain ..., or where the offender is waiting to see what charges are ultimately brought by the Crown ..., the offender has delayed the plea to obtain some forensic advantage ... ""
38On 19 September 2013, the proceedings were fixed, together with other proceedings, for a contested hearing by the Court, for a period of 10 days.  I am informed by counsel for the Company and Mr Doble, that at the time the matter was fixed for hearing, the estimate of the proceedings insofar as they affected the Company, Mr Doble and his fellow directors, was five days.  The balance of the estimated period was to deal with other matters which were to be listed at the same time as the present proceedings.
39Accepting this, a plea delivered, as these were, either on the last court day before the commencement of defended hearings or else, as in Mr Doble's case, on the first day of the hearing, cannot be regarded as an early plea.  The matter was factually uncomplicated.  Two years passed between the accident and the commencement of the proceedings, and a further 12 months passed before the pleas were entered.  Over that lengthy period, each of the defendants had ample time to inform themselves of what had happened in the collision, and to consider their response to the summonses.  By the time the plea was notified to the Court, including the fact that the hearing of the sentencing proceedings would take about two hours, the Court was unable to reallocate the time that was set aside for these two matters.
40I assess the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty, having regard to the very late stage at which they were entered, as being minimal.  I do not propose in all of these circumstances to allow any discount to reflect the late entry of a plea of guilty, in each matter.
Likelihood of Re-offending
41Mr Doble gave evidence.  He was the only officer of the Company to be called.  
42The manager of the Bathurst Depot, Mr Ross Miller, was the manager directly responsible for what occurred on the day in question.  Mr Miller has an ongoing role at the Bathurst Depot.  He was not called to give any evidence as to what happened, and how such an event might be prevented from happening in the future.  
43Mr Doble, who is a director and the owner of one half of the Company, gave some evidence as to what the Company had done since the events of 3 May 2011.  His counsel submitted that from this evidence the Court would be satisfied that it would be unlikely that the Company would commit a further offence of the type here committed.  
44I am not so satisfied.  I accept Mr Doble's evidence that the Company has undertaken one formal training session in Sydney with an external training provider, about proper load restraint.  The Court has not been provided with the details of who attended that training, whether it encompassed all of the drivers employed by the Company or any of the relevant depot managers, and other staff in charge of the Company's operations.  
45The Court was informed that the Company operated about 60 trucks, of various sizes, from six depots in NSW.  The formal training was apparently only provided in Sydney, and it is quite unclear from the evidence the extent to which such training penetrated those in the Company's employ who needed it, and who were located outside Sydney.  Some informal training was apparently provided at some country depots.  Again, there is no detail available to identify the context and extent of this.
46As well, Mr Doble says, and I accept, that the accident, involving as it did the death of road user, has led to a greater awareness amongst the Company's staff of the need to ensure that loads are safely secured.  So much can be accepted. Awareness ought give rise to vigilance, and constant vigilance is one means by which safety can be improved.  
47Finally, Mr Doble gave evidence, again which I accept, that drivers were provided with mobile telephones and could, if they required advice about the securing of a load, telephone their depot manager for such help.  Mr Doble agreed that the provision of mobile telephones to the drivers was principally for commercial and customer service reasons, but he said that they provided a means whereby drivers could obtain expert advice if necessary.
48However, at the end of Mr Doble's evidence, I was left with the clear impression that the notion of the Company and its directors embracing, implementing and maintaining a culture of safety, which would be necessary to prevent a recurrence of this offence in the trucking operations, was not at all understood and did not exist.
49It is apparent from Mr Doble's evidence that a good deal of the loading of the vehicles operated by the Company occurs at the Company's depots.  There, goods are moved from one form of vehicle to another.  It appears that loads are redistributed for the purposes of efficiency of transport and delivery.  The consequence of this occurring at a depot is that there is practical guidance from, and oversight by the depot manager with respect to all trucks leaving the depot, to ensure that loads had been secured properly in the depot.
50However, this does not address that part of the transport business in which the Company is engaged, of collection of goods from distant locations (that is, locations distant from the depot), and the subsequent transportation of those goods collected from one distant location and moved to another, or alternatively, from one distant location to a depot.  
51It is apparent that with respect to such loading and transport, the Company exercises no practical supervision at all of the securing of the load, and except for the provision of formal training on one occasion in 2011, has not formally trained any of its employees again inadequate securing of loads.  The evidence did not address this issue for any employee who may have joined the Company since 2011.
52At each depot of the Company, and in the possession of the depot manager, is a copy of the presently published National Load Restraint Guide.  That Guide contains detailed information as to how loads can be properly and adequately secured.  A copy of the Guide is not made available to drivers to carry in their trucks. Accordingly, a truck driver who loads at a distant location does not have the benefit of being able to consult the Guide in order to check how a load should be secured or whether such securing system as has been put in place is appropriate.
53There is no random audit undertaken by the Company to check whether drivers have in fact appropriately secured any load.  The Company leaves it to the responsibility of each driver, whose individual skill in this area must necessarily be variable.  Some will be better than others.  Nor is there a system for drivers to report by way of photograph or otherwise, about the securing of the load, before setting off from distant locations for their trip.  Ultimately, Mr Doble accepted in his evidence that nothing has changed in the Company's approach to securing loads adequately at distant locations since the accident here being dealt with.
54In short, if a driver loading at a distant location is not securing the load adequately, it is unlikely to come to the Company's attention unless an accident of the kind relevant here, occurs.  
55I am not satisfied in all the circumstances that the Company has demonstrated that it is unlikely to re-offend.  The same conclusion applies to Mr Doble.  On the contrary, I am satisfied that the Company, under the direction of Mr Doble, continues to operate its freight transport business in a way which presents ongoing and largely uncontrolled and unaddressed risks to public safety.
Remorse
56It is appropriate under s 21A(3)(i) of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act to take into account in mitigation of the offences, that the Company and Mr Doble have expressed remorse for their conduct.  Except for the plea of guilty to the offences, there is no evidence that the Company or Mr Doble have accepted responsibility for their actions nor have they, other than by their pleas, acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by their actions.  There is no evidence that they have made, or attempted to make, any reparation for the injury, loss or damage caused by their conduct as the statute requires.
57I am not persuaded on the balance of probabilities that the mere entry of a plea, particularly at the time at which it was entered, indicates any remorse on the part of the Company or Mr Doble.  
58I am not satisfied that the Company or Mr Doble are entitled to any mitigation by reason of any expression of remorse, or any demonstration of remorse with respect to these offences.  
Seriousness of the Offence
59It is appropriate to make an assessment of the seriousness of the offence, and the conduct of the Company and Mr Doble.  This assessment arises from the nature and circumstance of the offence: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [27].
60I am satisfied that the events underlying the offences amount to a serious example of a severe risk breach of a load restraint offence.  The load that was being moved was a heavy one, consisting of five separate packs, each containing eight gas cylinders.  It was about 3.5 tonnes.
61The distance being travelled from Mudgee to Bathurst, via Rylstone and Kandos, was over 150km.  The route taken included significant distances along principal rural roads, which might reasonably be expected to be carrying a reasonable volume of traffic.  The vast bulk of the journey was carried out over roads which are regularly used by traffic, and which could not be considered to be remote or unused roads.  As a matter of fact, the load restraint failure caused the death of Ms Mersing, an entirely innocent road user who was complying with all of her obligations.  The resultant collision presented a significant disruption to traffic travelling along Lue Road between Mudgee and Rylstone, which was a designated tourist route.
62Having regard to the entirety of the route which it was intended that the truck would travel, and which trip was truncated by the accident, there was a serious risk not only to the lives of fellow road users but also to road infrastructure and public amenity in allowing a vehicle with an insecure load to travel as the truck and trailer combination did on this journey.
63The role of the Company and its responsibility for the event that transpired cannot be said to be a singular one.  Nevertheless, I am satisfied it was a central role.  The Company was the operator of the vehicle; it received the order from the consignor; it determined which of its fleet of trucks would attend to collect the load; it determined which driver would attend to collect the load; it, through its driver, had the responsibility of ensuring the load was placed on the truck, and of ensuring that the load was secured adequately.  This it did not do, other than by leaving it to the driver, Mr Webber, who clearly did not have an adequate understanding of the steps which ought to have been taken to secure the load.  Mr Doble accepted in his evidence that such steps as should have been taken to secure the load adequately were simple, basic and well known in the transport industry well before May 2011.  
64I have concluded that all of these circumstances combine to show that this is a very serious offence with respect to the Company, and an offence that falls at the upper end of the range of seriousness.
65Mr Doble was, as I have earlier indicated, the principal director of the Company, and a shareholder who owned one half of the Company.
66Whilst he was not personally present at the Bathurst Depot, nor was he present when the truck and trailer combination was loaded, nevertheless, as the legislation recognises, it is important that any director of a company engaged in this industry takes steps to ensure compliance by the company of which he is a director, and its employees, with the provisions of the road transport legislation.
67The clear impression which I had from Mr Doble's evidence was that he had nothing to do with this particular load and this particular driver - leaving it all to the discretion of his Bathurst Depot manager, Mr Miller.  Although Mr Doble expressed the view in evidence, which I accept, that Mr Miller was hired by the Company because he seemed to be appropriately qualified, it is quite insufficient for a director of a company in the heavy transport industry, particularly where the director is in effect the day-to-day chief executive of the company as was here the case, to simply leave these matters in the hands of subordinates without ensuring adequate training, adequate supervision, adequate checking and on-going management of the safety requirements imposed by the heavy vehicles legislation.  If there is to be an effective culture of safety in any organisation, it must be implemented and championed by those in charge of the organisation.
68The clear impression I had from Mr Doble was that he did little to attend to these matters of safety, leaving them essentially to depot managers, and that his duties seemed to concentrate on customer service and other like matters.
69What occurred here, as I have earlier said, was a serious offence.  Mr Doble's failure to address any of the underlying issues was a serious breach of his obligations as a director created by the road transport legislation. 
70I have also concluded that, in Mr Doble's case, the offence falls at the upper end of the range of seriousness.  
Previous Convictions
71The prosecution tendered the prosecution history of the Company.  The prosecution accepted that, for the purposes of the legislation under which the charges were brought, the Company ought be regarded by the Court as a first offender.  There is no suggestion that Mr Doble has previously been convicted of any relevant offence.  
72I take into account the fact that neither of the Company nor Mr Doble has, relevantly, any previous record of convictions, or convictions that are of any significance to the offence to which they have pleaded guilty.
Penalty
73Insofar as the Company is concerned, I impose a fine for the load restraint offence of 225 penalty units.  I acknowledge that this fine approaches the maximum of 250 penalty units, but in fixing that number, the approach reflects my conclusion of the objective seriousness of the criminality involved and the need for general deterrence, taken together with all of the other factors and, in particular, the fact that I am unpersuaded that anything which the Company has done will be likely to avoid a recurrence of an event such as this.
74With respect to the offence by Mr Doble, I impose a penalty of 40 penalty units.  Again, I accept that this approaches the maximum of 50 penalty units.  In my view, any lesser penalty would not aid as a deterrent for those in the heavy transport industry to conduct themselves and their businesses, in a way which protects, so far as is possible, the safety of the public.

2704892,Alex v Goodsir [2014] NSWDC 72,"Judgment

1These are reasons for my ruling today that imputation (a) is not bad in form by reason of the use of the word ""corrupt""

2These are proceedings for defamation, commenced against Mr Goodsir in his capacity as the editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, for publication of an article on 10 March 2014 entitled ""Union corruption: Byrnes says he will tell all at royal commission/'Big Jim' and the bagman"". A boxed small headline indicates that this article is one of a series, published under the general title ""Inside the building racket"". 

3The imputation the subject of this ruling is as follows:

(a)The plaintiff is corrupt (paragraphs 1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 36).

4These headlines are a clear indication of the nature and content of the matter complained of. This is not a publication that is ""anxious to wound but afraid to strike"" (see Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden (1998) 43 NSWLR 158 at 169 per Hunt AJA). The opening paragraphs robustly reveal that ""colourful business identity"" Jim Byrnes has vowed to tell the royal commission into corruption everything he knows about bribery, links to organise crime and the ""allegedly"" underhand dealings of concerning both the ""crime figure and allegedly corrupt building company owner George Alex"" (paragraph 5) and the CFMEU ""boss"", Brian Parker.

5A list of these proposed revelations then follows. Mr Byrnes states that he will name ""at least four"" CFMEU organisers whom the plaintiff has bribed (paragraph 9) and the builders to whom he has given expensive gifts (paragraph 26). One of these is a ""bagman"" Mr Byrnes saw taking an envelope of cash at the plaintiff's home; this ""bagman"" also threatened to kill a whistleblower who had questioned why the plaintiff was being promoted by the union despite having ""ripped off"" workers (paragraphs 4 and 22). Mr Byrnes goes on to state that the plaintiff a man convicted of murder after his release from gaol ""in an additional attempt to win union support for his building firms"" (paragraph 17). Mr Alex mixes with a wide range of disreputable persons such as ""extensive organised crime ties"" (paragraphs 4,10, 18), bikies and gangsters (paragraph 24, 26) and additionally had ""extensive connections in the Labour movement"" (paragraph 16). To this can be added his shonky business dealings and ripping off workers' entitlements totalling hundreds of thousands of dollars (paragraphs 22 - 25), questionable dealings in horse racing (paragraphs 8, 27 - 29), being a ""crime figure"" himself (paragraph 5) and, most relevantly, using ""corrupt business practices (paragraph 24).

6These are not put forward as merely allegations made by Mr Byrne, himself a convicted criminal who has been banned twice from operating companies, but as matters for which there is reliable corroboration in the form of revelations by whistleblowers (paragraphs 20 - 22 and 35), inquiries by the Tax Office and ""law enforcement agencies"" (paragraph 10), confirmation of facts from former Senator Graham Richardson (paragraphs 11 - 13) and horse ownership records (paragraph 28), as well as the plaintiff's own conduct, in that he ""recently"" moved to repay the workers he had ""ripped off"" sums totalling ""hundreds of thousands of dollars in outstanding entitlements"" (paragraph 25). 

7By the time the reader gets to paragraph 30 - 31, where Mr Parker ripostes that his dealings with the plaintiff were ""appropriate"" and that Mr Byrne's statements should be ""carefully weighed"", a picture has been painted of the plaintiff as having corrupt business practices over a broad spectrum. 

8The first issue is the degree of specificity required for imputation (a). In Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135, Gleeson J explained (at 137) that the plaintiff was entitled to plead an imputation as broadly as the allegations that were made. If the matter complained of said that Mr X was ""disgusting"", then the imputation was ""X is disgusting"". 

9The second issue is whether the plaintiff should be permitted to plead an imputation stating merely that he is ""corrupt"", as opposed to defining the corruption in question (such as bribery). Gleeson CJ in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (at 138) outlined the limited circumstances in which the broad imputation of ""corrupt"" conduct would be permitted, as follows:

""Allegations of corruption have, in recent years, provided a fruitful source of controversy in this area of defamation law and practice. As Hunt J pointed out in Whelan and elsewhere, the word ""corrupt"" can have significantly different shades of meaning. This does not make it unusual, but, because it is a word the use of which is apt to give rise to allegations of defamation, it seems to have come in for a high degree of forensic exegesis. Depending upon the context, for example, it can mean that a person takes bribes, or that he abuses power entrusted to him, or that he improperly obtains private benefits from a public position. The range of possible meanings of the word when used in connection with public officials in this State has been substantially expanded by the enactment of the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 which defines ""corrupt conduct"" in a manner that goes well beyond the ordinary meaning of that expression and is notable for its generality and vagueness.""

10In those proceedings, the broadcast opened with general references to corruption and the Independent Commission Against Corruption, but went on to recount events ""without making any clear or logical connection between the opening remarks and the events and matters in question"" (at 140). In those circumstances, Gleeson CJ considered that to permit the plaintiff to frame imputations of corruption without specifying which of the different possible kinds of corruption is being referred to would be contrary to the relevant rules of pleading.

11By contrast, in John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd v Foord (1988) 12 NSWLR 706, where the heading was ""GOVT'S WAR ON CORRUPT JUDGES"", an imputation that the plaintiff was a corrupt judge was not bad in form, and should be allowed to go to the jury. Clarke JA noted at 726:

""If the complaint is that the imputation as pleaded lacks claritybecause the word 'corrupt' is ambiguous then that deficiency flowsnaturally from the material published. It was the defendant who used the word 'corrupt' and, provided that the respondent in an unqualified manner can satisfy the test on identification and there is no issue about that in these proceedings, then there can be no argument but that the poster is describing the respondent as a corrupt judge. I regard the appellant's submissions on this imputation as hopeless and it must, in my opinion, be submitted to the jury."" 

12Mrs Barnett submits, and I agree, that the question is where, in between these two cases, this particular matter complained of falls. She submits that the plaintiff should be required to define the kind of corruption of which he stands accused, by referring to bribery, this being the principal allegation made.

13I do not accept that this level of refinement is necessary in these proceedings. As the analysis of the allegations in the matter complained of set out above demonstrates, this is not a case where the imputation is so lacking in clarity as to be likely to cause confusion at the trial, warranting it to be defined or struck out. Although the plaintiff is initially referred to as ""allegedly corrupt"", the long list of claims leading to the statement in paragraph 24 concerning the plaintiff's ""corrupt business practices"" is then followed by further revelations about those business practices, including the fact that the plaintiff has ""recently moved to repay"" hundreds of thousands of dollars to the workers whose rights he disregarded in the course of those corrupt business practices. 

14Unlike Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation, supra, there is a direct connection between the allegations of corruption and the conduct involved, at both the beginning and the end, and the sheer weight of the allegations quickly overcomes any anodyne effect from the initial, sole, use of the word ""alleged"" in relation to the plaintiff's corruption.

15In the circumstancing, I am satisfied both that this is a general smear of the ""X is disgusting"" kind (Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation, supra, at 137 per Gleeson CJ), and that there is no need for further refinement as to the kind of corruption, for the reasons explained by Clarke JA in Ford, supra.

16Accordingly I decline to strike out imputation (a). 

Orders

(1)Defendant's application to strike out imputation (a) is dismissed.

(2)Defendant pay plaintiff's costs of this application.

(3)Matter stood over to Monday 23 June 2014 at 9:00am before Gibson DCJ.

Schedule - Matter complained of

1Union corruption/ Byrnes says he will tell all at royal commission

2'Big Jim' and the bagman

3Exclusive Nick McKenzie, Richard Baker, James Massola, Nick Ralston

4Colourful business identity Jim Byrnes has vowed to give evidence at the royal commission into union corruption about construction union bribery, links to organised criminals and the allegedly underhand dealings of CFMEU boss Brian Parker.

5Fairfax Media can also reveal that crime figure and allegedly corrupt building company owner George Alex hired Labor power-broker Graham Richardson to help lobby developers and secure contracts in the mid-2000s.

6In an exclusive interview, ''Big Jim'' Byrnes said he is ''looking forward'' to telling commission investigators about his dealings with Mr Alex and the construction union and says he will:

7► Identify the union official and ''bagman'' who Mr Byrnes says he saw take an envelope of cash at the home of Mr Alex.

8► Allege that he helped to buy a racehorse for Mr Parker and builder Denis Delic and then registered the horse in the names of the trio's wives to disguise Mr Parker's involvement in the racing venture.

9► Identify at least four senior serving or former CFMEU organisers who have allegedly been bribed by builders, including Mr Alex.

10Mr Alex is a former bankrupt who has been repeatedly chased by the Tax Office over unpaid tax and examined by law enforcement agencies over his dealings with organised crime figures.

11Mr Richardson told Fairfax Media that he consulted for Mr Alex and his business partners for ''a year or two''.

12''My job was to try and get them work in the construction industry, but the reality was that there was too many established firms and it was a very difficult task,'' he said.

''I got them [the company] a couple of dribs and drabs, but didn't get them any permanent contracts for their labour hire firm,'' Mr Richardson said.

13Fairfax Media is not suggesting... 

14[Caption] INSIDE THE BUILDING RACKET

15'Big Jim' Byrnes vows to tell all at royal commission

16...Mr Richardson ever acted improperly or knew of Mr Alex's extensive criminal associations in Sydney and Melbourne. But Mr Alex's link to the former NSW Labor senator highlights Mr Alex's extensive connections in the Labor movement.

17Fairfax Media can also reveal that in an additional attempt to win union support for his building firms, Mr Alex employed CFMEU organiser Sammy Manna's son, Adriano, after he was released from a 12-year stint in prison for attempted murder.

18Mr Alex has extensive organised crime ties in Melbourne and Sydney, where his labour hire businesses operate with union backing. Mr Byrnes was involved in some of Mr Alex's business affairs before the pair fell out over a business deal.

19Mr Byrnes was once Alan Bond's financial adviser and has a chequered history dating back to the 1980s, when he was jailed for the deemed supply of heroin, acquitted of fraud charges and banned twice from operating companies.

20In 2007, after Mr Byrnes pleaded guilty to smashing the office window of a solicitor, a NSW judge agreed that Mr Byrnes should avoid a jail term and that he had made a success of himself after a bad start in life.

21Mr Byrnes's allegations about the inappropriate ties between union officials and Mr Alex and Mr Delic corroborate claims recently made by two CFMEU officials turned whistleblowers, Brian Fitzpatrick and Andrew Quirk.

22The union organiser who Mr Byrnes says he saw taking a ''white envelope'' filled with cash from Mr Alex is the same union official who Mr Fitzpatrick has alleged was inappropriately lobbying for Mr Alex's firms. Mr Fitzpatrick has alleged that this official threatened to kill him after Mr Fitzpatrick questioned why Mr Alex was being promoted by the union despite ripping off workers.

23Mr Fitzpatrick, Mr Quirk and Mr Byrnes have all alleged that Mr Parker, the NSW CFMEU secretary, was socialising and supporting Mr Alex, despite Mr Alex's shonky building industry dealings.

24Mr Byrnes said: ''I warned Parker to keep away from George Alex as Alex was tied up with bikies and gangsters. But Parker didn't [stay away]. What is most disturbing is that he favoured George Alex and his corrupt business practices over the rights of workers.''

25Mr Byrnes said that Mr Parker allowed Mr Alex to avoid the usual CFMEU auditing to ensure workers were paid their full entitlements. Mr Alex recently moved to repay workers hundreds of thousands of dollars in outstanding entitlements.

26Mr Byrnes said he will tell the royal commission that Mr Parker was given expensive gifts by Mr Delic and that the CFMEU favoured firms owned by Mr Delic, who was a business associate of both Mr Alex and murdered Hells Angels boss Zeljko Mitrovic.

27Mr Byrnes has also alleged that in 2010, he bought a $14,000 racehorse for Mr Parker and Mr Delic, who recently died of a heart attack.

28Horse ownership records obtained by Fairfax Media show that until recently, the racehorse Maroota's Way was registered in the names of ''Mrs A Delic, Mrs K Parker & Mrs C G Byrnes''.

29Mr Parker declined to answer specific questions about the horses, although NSW branch president Rita Malia said in a statement: ''Mr Parker disclosed his friendship with Denis Delic and the fact that he was once a co-owner in two horses'' with him.

30In response to Mr Byrnes's allegations, Mr Parker said in a statement: ''Jim Byrnes is a convicted criminal who has previously been struck off as a director of a company. Any statements by him should be carefully weighed.''

31Mr Parker also insisted that his dealings with Mr Delic and Mr Alex were appropriate and he had never used his influence to advantage the pair's firms.

		26 June 2014",2014-06-19 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704895,Carey v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (ACN 008 438 828) [2014] NSWDC 73,"Judgment

1The plaintiff is an indigenous Australian who has enjoyed a successful surfing career. The matters complained of are publications in the Daily Telegraph dated 12 March 2014. The first was published the 12 March 2014 edition of the newspaper and the second is the publication on the newspaper's Internet site.

Publication

2The defendants bring two applications before the court:

(a)An application to dismiss the statement of claim, on the basis that the matter complained of is incapable of defamatory meaning; and

(b)An alternative application to strike out the plaintiff's imputations on the basis of form, capacity and lack of defamatory meaning.

3The two matters complained of are identical, save for the headlines, photographs and the final paragraph. The parties agree that these differences are irrelevant to the argument. Each of the matters complained of is pleaded to convey the following imputations:

(a)The plaintiff has an apeish face (paragraphs 2, 3).

(b)The plaintiff is sub-human (2, 3).

(c)The plaintiff is an ape (2, 3).

(d)The plaintiff was expected to speak and behave like Cro-Magnon Man with grunts from his mouth (3).

(e)The plaintiff is unfit to be a member of the human race (2, 3).

The summary judgment application

4The principles upon which summary judgment as to lack of defamatory meaning may be given are as set out in the discussion of Berkoff v Burchill [1996] 4 All E R 1008, as explained in Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton (2008) Aust Torts Reports ¶81-946 at [85]-[89]. Although Bik v Australian Consolidated Press Ltd [1973] 2 NSWLR 473 is commonly referred to in such applications, Bik was an appeal from a jury finding that the matter complained of was not defamatory. The principles for dismissal on the alternate basis upon which the application is brought, namely that the antidote outweighs the bane, are set out in Morosi v Broadcasting Station 2GB Pty Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 418, although that appeal was, similarly to Bik, brought following the findings of a jury at trial.

5Applications for summary dismissal of a claim in cases on such a basis face a very high bar. As Beazley JA noted in Malcolm v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 254 at [20], the question of whether an imputation is conveyed should go to the jury unless it was ""blindingly obvious"" that no other conclusion was reasonably open. That is even more the case where the assertion is that any imputation conveyed is incapable of being defamatory, as this is quintessentially a jury question: Morosi v Broadcasting Station 2GB Pty Ltd, supra, at [6].

6Senior Counsel for the defendants made his submission as to absence of defamatory meaning on the following bases:

(a)While parts of the matter complained of were obviously offensive to the plaintiff (notably the reference to his ""apeish face""), no act or condition of the plaintiff capable of injuring his reputation (as opposed to being offensive or contemptuous in tone) could be conveyed.

(b)The matter complained of is a reaction to another publication's slighting of the plaintiff, and all it does is to record how upset the plaintiff is at this ""insensitive"" earlier publication. While the circumstances in which a publication seeking to refute a calumny may be held not to have repeated it are comparatively rare (Bennison v O'Neil [2012] NSWSC 360 at [23]), this is one of those cases. 

(c)Most importantly, where the matter complained of does touch upon the plaintiff's character (in paragraphs 6 - 10), it is to note his qualities of character in a sympathetic fashion as a person proud of his aboriginal heritage. The defendant was standing up as the plaintiff's friend, and neither agreeing with what was said nor repeating the libel. 

(d)Alternatively, if there was bane (Morosi v Broadcasting Station 2GB, supra), then paragraphs 6 - 10, which placed the plaintiff in a good light, and the reference to the allegations as ""insensitive"", constituted a full antidote. Each matter complained of also noted how ""devastated"" the plaintiff was by this ""insensitive"" slight.

7The first issue for determination is whether the matter complained of conveys imputations at all. As is set out below, I am satisfied that the matter complained of is capable of conveying imputations (a) and (b). Leave to replead imputations (c) and (e) has been granted, and imputation (d) was struck out with leave to replead. 

8The summary judgment application is not merely premised on the submission that no imputations are capable of being conveyed by reason of the anodyne nature of the matter complained of. The principal submission is that any imputation conveyed of and concerning the plaintiff cannot be defamatory, because imputations concerning the plaintiff's appearance cannot affect his reputation. A person's reputation can only be injured when the esteem in which that person is held by the community is diminished in some respect. In Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton (2009) 238 CLR 460 at [4] - [5] French CJ, Gummow, Kiefel and Bell JJ stated:

""[4] Lord Atkin proposed such a general test in Sim v Stretch, namely that statements might be defamatory if ""the words tend to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally"". An earlier test asked whether the words were likely to injure the reputation of a plaintiff by exposing him (or her) to hatred, contempt or ridicule but it had come to be considered as too narrow. It was also accepted, as something of an exception to the requirement that there be damage to a plaintiff's reputation, that matter might be defamatory if it caused a plaintiff to be shunned or avoided, which is to say excluded from society. 

[5] The common law test of defamatory matter propounded by Lord Atkin was applied in Slatyer v The Daily Telegraph Newspaper Co Ltd, although Griffith CJ expressed some concern about the ambiguity of the expression ""right thinking members of the community"". The general test, stated as whether the published matter is likely to lead an ordinary reasonable person to think the less of a plaintiff, was confirmed by this Court in Mirror Newspapers Ltd v World Hosts Pty Ltd, Chakravarti v Advertiser Newspapers Ltd and by Callinan and Heydon JJ in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Gacic. Gummow and Hayne JJ in Gacic referred to the likelihood that the imputations might cause ""ordinary decent folk"" in the community to think the less of the plaintiff."" (Footnotes omitted)

9These remarks relate to the explanation of ridicule cases given by McColl JA in Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton (2008) Aust Torts Reports ¶81-946 at [85]-[89]. At [85] - [86] her Honour explains the leading English case on the issue, Berkoff v Burchill:

""[85] A publication is capable of being defamatory even though it arguably does no more than expose the plaintiff to ridicule, but that exposure has to be such as to tend to injure the plaintiff's reputation. Berkoff v Burchill was such a case. There the question arose whether the following words published in a review of a film version of ""Frankenstein"" were capable of being defamatory of Mr Berkoff:

The Creature is made as a vessel for Waldman's brain, and rejected in disgust when it comes out scarred and primeval. It's a very new look for the Creature - no bolts in the neck or flat-top hairdo - and I think it works; it's a lot like Stephen Berkoff, only marginally better-looking.

[86] Although the Court divided as to the capacity of the matter complained of to convey, as a question of law, a defamatory imputation, O'Neill LJ and Phillips LJ holding it could, Millett LJ dissenting, all were of the view that to be capable of being defamatory the matter complained of had to tend to injure the plaintiff's reputation. After reviewing a number of authorities on what constituted defamation, O'Neill LJ concluded (at 1013):

It will be seen from this collection of definitions that words may be defamatory, even though they neither impute disgraceful conduct to the plaintiff nor any lack of skill or efficiency in the conduct of his trade or business or professional activity, if they hold him up to contempt, scorn or ridicule or tend to exclude him from society. On the other hand, insults which do not diminish a man's standing among other people do not found an action for libel or slander. The exact borderline may often be difficult to define. (emphasis added)

and (at 1018):

It is trite law that the meaning of words in a libel action is determined by the reaction of the ordinary reader ... it would, in my view, be open to a jury to conclude that in the context the remarks about Mr Berkoff gave the impression that he was not merely physically unattractive in appearance but actually repulsive. It seems to me that to say this of someone in the public eye who makes his living, in part at least, as an actor, is capable of lowering his standing in the estimation of the public and of making him an object of ridicule. (emphasis added)

[87] Phillips LJ recognised (at 1020) that the law of defamation protects reputation and that reputation was not generally dependent upon physical appearance. He acknowledged that ""with one possible exception, [there was] no precedent for holding it defamatory to describe a person as ugly"". While he concluded (at 1021) that ""a statement that a person is hideously ugly does not fall into that category of statements that are defamatory because they tend to make people shun or avoid the plaintiff"", he was also of the view that the words described the plaintiff as hideously ugly by way of ridicule and that the question whether they exposed him to ridicule to the extent that his reputation has been damaged must be answered by the jury.


10McColl JA noted, at [89], that even in the case of an imputation which exposes a person to ridicule, the Court was of the view that the plaintiff's standing or reputation had to be lowered before the imputation was capable of being defamatory. Her Honour's reference to ""standing"" is significant in my view, because it gives full force to the ""contempt"" portion of the phrase ""hatred, ridicule and contempt"". 

11Imputations arising from a display of, or comments on, a person's physical appearance may be defamatory. In Ettingshausen v Australian Consolidated Press Ltd (1991) 23 NSWLR 443, a photograph of a footballer showering in the team's change room (which appeared to show his penis) appeared to have been taken with his consent. Hunt J (at 449) considered that publication of this imputation was capable of subjecting the entirely blameless plaintiff to a more than trivial degree of ridicule, tracing the history of ""ridiculous light"" imputations from cases such as Burton v Crowell Pub Co 82 F (2d) 154 (1936) and Zybyszko v New York American 228 App. Div. 277, 239 N Y S 411 (1930) (where the plaintiff was compared to a gorilla). In McDonald v The North Queensland Newspaper Company Limited [1997] Qd R 62, a photograph of a footballer being tackled, in which his penis was shown, was similarly held to make it likely he would be ridiculed. 

12While display of a penis may subject a person to ridicule, criticism of a person's appearance as ""apeish"" or ""Cro-Magnon"" falls into both the ""ridicule"" and ""contempt"" categories of ""hatred, ridicule and contempt"". As to ridicule, comparison of an aboriginal to an ape or to Cro-Magnon man is to belittle that person's achievements, standing and reputation: Mundine v Brown (No 6) [2010] NSWSC 1285. As to contempt, in Trad v Jones (No 3) [2007] NSWADT 318 at [174], the Tribunal, albeit in relation to race vilification, observed:

""One of the most contemptuous forms of commentary on another person or group is to describe them in sub-human terms, such as likening them to insects, vermin or animals.""

13Thus the description of any person of Aboriginal or black heritage as ""ape-like"" or ""Cro-Magnon"" is diminishing to that person's reputation because it invites shunning and contempt that is damaging to the standing of the plaintiff in the community (McColl JA in Chesterton at [89], citing O'Neill JA in Berkoff v Burchill, supra) and thus to his reputation. A strike-out application on the basis that calling an Aboriginal person a ""coon"" could not be defamatory failed in Patten v Moffatt (Supreme Court of NSW, Levine J, 27 February 1995).

14Nor does the matter complained of answer these claims, beyond calling them ""insensitive"". By emphasising the plaintiff's aboriginal background, the matter complained of appears to be directly attributing the description of the plaintiff to his Aboriginal heritage. The application for summary dismissal on the basis that no defamatory imputation can be conveyed must fail.

15The alternative basis upon which the application was brought, namely that the antidote outweighs the bane, must similarly fail. The matter complained of repeats the offensive remarks twice, calls them ""insensitive"" and says the plaintiff is ""devastated"", and goes on to describe the plaintiff's pride in his Aboriginal heritage. Senior Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that his client was seeking to be a friend to the plaintiff and coming to his aid. A similar submission in Morosi v Broadcasting Station 2GB, supra, was answered by Samuels JA:

[16] All of this was put in aid of the meaning which it was said the publication conveyed. It is easy to see, I think, that a legitimate answer to these encomiums ...was that apparently made by the plaintiff's counsel, who might indeed, if I might be permitted to use a homely phrase, have said: ""With friends like these, who needs enemies?""

16The sum total of the ""antidote"" passages of the matter complained of cannot outweigh the ""bane"" of the repeated description of the plaintiff's ""apeish"" appearance. 

17The application to strike out the statement of claim is dismissed.

18The defendant also challenges the form and capacity of the imputations. As the plaintiff sought leave to replead two of the imputations, the reasons given below are brief.

The imputations

(a) The plaintiff has an apeish face.

19This is a direct quotation from the matter complained of, in circumstances where this is a permissible course: John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Blake; David Syme & Co v Blake (2001) 53 NSWLR 541 at [52] - [54] per Hodgson JA; Mahommed v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 213 at [29] per McColl JA. To say of an aboriginal person that he or she resembles an ape is capable of defamatory meaning. A person may be defamed by being ""compared to the unpalatable or discreditable characteristics of some animals or other subhuman species"" states Professor Brown in Brown on Defamation: Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, United States (2nd ed.) at [5.19], citing Mangope v Asmal 1997 (4) S A 277 (Transvaal Prov. Div) (""baboon"") and Zybyszko v New York American, supra (""gorilla""). Zybszko was referred to with approval in Berkoff v Burchill at 1015, although (at 1019) O'Neill J, dissenting, considered it an indication of ""the lengths of absurdity to which a New York lawyer will go in pleading a case"". 

20What gives the ""apeish"" its sting is the context of the plaintiff's Aboriginal background, which is repeatedly referred to in the matter complained of. The ""List of Ethnic Slurs"" in Wikipedia notes that ""ape"" means ""black person"" in the United States. The matter complained of emphasizes the plaintiff's Aboriginality, which tends to underline this unfortunate sting, rather than ameliorate it.

21Applying the test set out in Malcolm v Nationwide News Pty Ltd, supra, at [20], this imputation is capable of being conveyed.

(b) The plaintiff is sub-human.

22This imputation picks up on the reference to ""Cro-Magnon grunts"", and to the plaintiff's appearance, including his hairstyle. For the same reasons set out in (a) above, the imputation is both capable of being conveyed and defamatory.

(c) The plaintiff is an ape.

23The plaintiff has been granted leave to replead this imputation.

(d) The plaintiff was expected to speak and behave like Cro-Magnon Man with grunts from his mouth.

24This imputation suffers from the defect of form that the person who had this expectation is not identified. Whether it is the author of the original Surfing Life article, or the authors of this article, or the readers of the Daily Telegraph, the identity of any such person should be made clear. Alternatively, the ""was expected"" formula of the imputation could be replaced by an act to accompany the imputation of condition in imputation (b) concerning the plaintiff's alleged Cro-Magnon characteristics.

25This imputation has been struck out with leave to replead.

(e) The plaintiff is unfit to be a member of the human race.

26This imputation is one that ""does not seem to add anything"" and is ""an unnecessary pleader's flourish"": Waterhouse v Hickie (1995) Aust Torts Reports 81-347 per Priestley JA. Counsel for the plaintiff has accordingly sought leave to replead, which has been granted.

Orders

(1)Defendants' application for summary dismissal of the statement of claim refused.

(2)Grant leave to replead imputations (c) and (e).

(3)Imputation (d) struck out with leave to replead.

(4)Defendants' costs be costs in the cause.

(5)Plaintiff to file amended statement of claim in 14 days.

1Carey devastated by slight in surfing mag

2Indigenous surfer Otis Carey is said to be devastated by a feature in Surfing Life magazine which said he had an ""apeish face"".

3The Narabeen surfer, whose mother is of Aboriginal heritage, is also rumoured to be speaking to Sydney Swans player Adam Goodes about the insensitive article. Surfing Life, owned by Morrison Media, ran a story titled 'Poetry Night with Mermaid Killer' in their March issue written by Nathan Myers, and wrote, ""With his apeish face and cowering hair-curtains, I expect mlittle [sic] more than Cro-Magnon grunts from his mouth. I am caught off guard by the clarity and eloquence of his speech.""

4His father Chris Carey told Confidential he has read the feature and is currently focusing on the wellbeing of his son.

5""At this stage we don't want to talk about it, our concern is Otis's wellbeing,"" Carey said. ""We just have to support him.""

6In a previous interview with the father of one, Carey spoke proudly of his indigenous heritage.

7""My Nan is from the Gumbaynggirr people and my Pop was from the Bundjalung people,"" he told Focus magazine.

8""My Nan was born in the dunes up at Red Rock, so we have very strong connections to the land and ocean up around Coffs.

9""It's always such an energising feeling coming back home for a few days after being away on a surf trip; it definitely keeps me grounded coming home.

10""Whether I like it or not, that natural spiritual connection I have with the ocean and the land has been given to me as a gift through my heritage, and it's something I embrace to the fullest and something I'm very proud of.""

11'Confidential' approached 'Surfing Life' magazine but did not hear back from them before going to press

2704907,R v Opie [2014] NSWSC 814,"Judgment
1HER HONOUR:  Between 2.50am and 3.30am on 22 December 2012, the deceased, Morton Cedric Newton, was attacked and killed by Neil Alexander Opie in his home in Guildford where he lived with his adult son, Stephen.  The deceased was aged 77 at the time of his death.  Mr Opie lived alone in a unit block nearby. 
2Stephen Newton was at home on the night his father was attacked but did not witness the attack.  Shortly before 2.50am he woke to hear a person on the veranda claiming to be wounded.  The deceased (who must also have been awakened) told his son he would get keys (presumably to open the door) and that he would call an ambulance.  He was then heard to say, ""Stephen, call the police, he's got a knife"".  
3While the deceased's son was in the process of placing a call to triple zero from his bedroom he heard a yell.  He ran to the living room to find Mr Opie holding a knife, about 30cm long and possibly serrated, with the blade pointed up, and his father in a chair which had been pushed over.  Mr Opie then stabbed himself twice in the chest before staggering backwards and falling down.  The deceased's son took the knife from Mr Opie's hand and went to seek assistance from a neighbour.  As he was leaving he saw Mr Opie standing up.  
4The police arrived at the premises at approximately 3.00am and found both Mr Opie and the deceased lying on the floor.  The deceased was motionless and very pale with his eyes open.  Mr Opie was lying partially on top of him with a black-handled knife protruding from his chest.  Police instructed Mr Opie to keep his hands by his sides and not to touch the knife.  Mr Opie responded by using both of his hands to push the knife further into his chest until the blade was no longer visible outside his body.  Mr Opie was directed to stop under threat that a taser would be used.  He did not desist but pushed the knife further into his body.  A police officer discharged his taser.  Mr Opie was immobilised.  First aid was administered.
5The deceased was pronounced dead at the scene.  The autopsy revealed a single stab wound to his right upper anterior chest which punctured the upper right aspect of the pericardial sac and the right auricular appendage.  The wound was 5.3cm long and approximately 17cm deep.  This was the only injury detected on autopsy.  
6When assessed by paramedics at the scene Mr Opie registered a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 of a possible 15, indicating he was completely unresponsive and close to death.  He was conveyed to Westmead Hospital.  He suffered a cardiac arrest en route.  On admission he was revealed to have sustained multiple lacerations to his lungs, heart, diaphragm, liver and stomach. 
7On 2 January 2013 Mr Opie was formally arrested and charged with the deceased's murder.  He remained in intensive care at Westmead Hospital until 8 January 2013, and was formally discharged into police custody on 11 January 2013.  He remained under police custody for the duration of his hospital admission.   
The trial
8With the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and with leave granted under s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), Mr Opie's trial was listed to proceed without a jury.  On 12 June 2014 he was arraigned before me.  He pleaded not guilty on the ground of mental illness as provided for in s 22(2) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) (""the Act""). 
9The sole issue at trial was whether Mr Opie had discharged the onus of establishing, on the probabilities, that he should be acquitted of murder on the grounds of mental illness pursuant to s 38 of the Act.  Section 38 provides that a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness must be returned if at the time of the offence the person was mentally ill so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his or her actions at the time the offence was committed.  In R v Rodriguez [2010] NSWSC 198 at [33], Johnson J succinctly set out what is required to establish the defence of mental illness:
To establish the defence of mental illness, it must be proved upon the balance of probabilities that at the time of committing the acts causing death, the Accused was labouring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of his act, or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong. A person does not know what he was doing was wrong when he does not know that it is wrong according to the ordinary standards of right and wrong adopted by reasonable persons, or when he cannot reason with some moderate degree of calmness in relation to the moral quality of what he is doing: R v Porter [1933] HCA 1; (1933) 55 CLR 182 at 189-190.
10Both the Crown and senior counsel for Mr Opie were in agreement that a special verdict on the basis of mental illness was open and should be returned in this case.  
11The defence of mental illness will be made out in this case if I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that at the time Mr Opie stabbed the deceased to the chest he was suffering from a mental illness such that he did not know that it was wrong to act in that way.  Although Mr Opie's state of mind at the time he killed the deceased (a state of mind productive of a defect of reason and involving a disorder of the capacity to reason that the act was wrong) must have been one of disease, disorder or disturbance arising from a condition, it does not matter if the condition is temporary or longstanding, curable or incurable (see R v Pratt [2009] NSWSC 1108 at [19]).  
12In deciding whether a special verdict should be returned I am obliged to have regard to the legal and practical consequences of a finding that Mr Opie is not guilty of murder on the grounds of mental illness.  I am not, however, required to decide whether the requisite intent for the offence of murder, that is, either an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm, is proved (see R v Minani [2005] NSWCCA 226; 62 NSWLR 490).  That question only arises if I do not find that the defence of mental illness is established.  
13A compendium of documents, including an agreed statement of facts, witness statements and reports of two forensic psychiatrists, was tendered by consent.  Mr Opie was assessed by Dr Richard Furst at the request of his legal representatives on 2 October 2013, and by Dr Stephen Allnutt at the request of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions on 16 December 2013.  
14The Crown provided written submissions which senior counsel for Mr Opie accepted were eloquent of the issues to be decided and provided a reasoned analysis of the facts and the relevant law.  No oral evidence was called in the proceedings.  
Mr Opie's relationship with the deceased 
15Mr Opie lived alone in an apartment block opposite the deceased's premises.  The deceased had lived in his premises since he was a child.  Mr Opie had lived in his apartment for between seven and nine years prior to the killing.  Mr Opie told Dr Allnutt that during that time he had spoken to the deceased not more than ten times.  The deceased's son stated that he did not know Mr Opie and had never seen him before.  Cem Eryilmaz, who resided in the same apartment block as Mr Opie, had known both men for ten years prior to the killing but stated that he had never seen the deceased and Mr Opie socialising.  
Mr Opie's statements to medical staff at Westmead Hospital after the killing and to police following his arrest
16On 29 December 2012 the Psychiatry Registrar at Westmead Hospital assessed Mr Opie.  Mr Opie reported that he had stabbed himself and then stabbed the deceased because he was ""tormenting him"" and calling him names, and had done so for many years.  Mr Opie reported that the deceased had been telling other people about him, and that he knew that because of those people's ""facial expressions"".  Mr Opie also reported that he felt someone had been following him for a week prior to the incident, and that he had been given medicines to die.  He denied a depressed mood in the preceding weeks or months.  The Registrar opined that Mr Opie was paranoid at the time of the assessment and that this paranoia extended to include the deceased. 
17On 30 December 2012 Mr Opie was observed to be severely agitated, and thought to be hallucinating or delirious.  He said he could not remember stabbing the deceased.  He did claim that the deceased ""used to tell bad things about him and others and that was his nature"". 
18On 2 January 2013, whilst still in the intensive care ward at Westmead Hospital, Mr Opie participated in a short electronically recorded interview.  When informed that he was under arrest for the murder of the deceased, and when asked if he understood, Mr Opie responded, ""No, did he die?"".  In the interview Mr Opie said that he had an ""altercation"" with the deceased.  When asked if he remembered what happened during the altercation he said:
Pretty much, I was very, very low that night and every time he sees me he accuses me of being a poofter and that's what set things off ... I remember yelling at him, I remember trying to kill myself ... I remember thinking I had killed myself.
When asked why he tried to kill himself Mr Opie responded, ""Because I was so low"".  He went on to say:  
...My mind state just went down over three days and I said I was going to take my life... And as for that old guy well, let's just say a mixture. I didn't realise. I thought I was going to be dead. In fact I was dead. Most terrible news of my life ... Oh hell. I thought I was the one who .... I haven't had any dealings with him. I remember yelling at him.
When asked if he had any questions Mr Opie said: 
...I'm bloody sorry. Just at this time of year, I've never been this way, terrible ...
19Mr Opie was assessed by Dr Sara Ghaly, consultation-liaison psychiatrist, on 7 January 2013 at Westmead Hospital.  He told Dr Ghaly that he could not recall the incident, and had been really low for three days prior to his hospitalisation.  In Dr Ghaly's opinion, Mr Opie was in an acute confusional state, consistent with delirium, rendering the history he provided, including his reported memory or amnesia, unreliable.  
20Mr Opie was discharged into police custody on 11 January 2013.
21On 16 January 2013 Mr Opie was assessed by Dr Farrar, psychiatrist, at Long Bay Correctional Complex.  Mr Opie said that he knew that he had killed someone, but could not recall the offence or the events leading up to it.  He said he remembered stabbing himself but did not remember how he got to hospital.  
22Dr Furst assessed Mr Opie on 2 October 2013 at Long Bay Correctional Complex Hospital.  Mr Opie said he had no recollection of being taunted by or worried about the deceased.  He said he had ""mad dreams"" in hospital and ""woke up to a nightmare"".  He said he had no recollection of stabbing either himself or the deceased.  Dr Furst described Mr Opie as logical, with no obvious signs of depression or elevated mood, however he was restricted in his range of affective expression and lacked expression in his speech.  He did not consider Mr Opie to be psychotic or suicidal.   
23Dr Allnutt assessed Mr Opie on 16 December 2013 at the Metropolitan Special Programs Centre at Long Bay Correctional Complex.  Dr Allnutt reported that Mr Opie did not manifest behaviours suggestive of a psychiatric or neurological illness; he spoke in a clear and coherent manner and, while he reported symptoms of depression and anxiety, there was no evidence or active symptoms of mania or hypomania.  However, Mr Opie maintained the belief that the Australian Federal Police (""AFP"") might be monitoring him, and expressed a belief that there were microphones in the wall of the gaol.  
Mr Opie's history as recounted to Dr Furst and Dr Allnutt
24Mr Opie was aged 59 at the time of the killing.  He grew up in Dunedin, New Zealand and migrated to Australia in 1998.  He has a younger brother from whom he is estranged, and an older brother who had a history of mental illness.  When he was 25 or 26 years old, Mr Opie discovered his older brother hanging from a noose in the family home.  Mr Opie tried to assist his brother but his attempts failed.  Mr Opie described that event as ""...the start of the end for me.  It tormented me.  I was helpless.  I had no tools to cut him down"".  He reported experiencing intrusive images and nightmares relating to his brother's death over many years.  
25Mr Opie has consumed alcohol since the age of 17 or 18, increasing his consumption progressively after his brother's suicide up to the killing of Mr Newton.  He described himself as a functioning alcoholic.  
26Mr Opie reported to Dr Allnutt that he had suffered several head injuries throughout his childhood, including a motor vehicle accident when he was 12 years old for which he required some facial reconstruction.  
27Mr Opie described a history of mood fluctuations.  At times he described experiencing manic periods when he was ""madly enthusiastic"", full of energy and drive and requiring little sleep.  Those episodes, which lasted for days or weeks, were inevitably followed by periods of depression, accompanied by feelings of being drained, worthless, and having low energy levels like he was ""stuck in concrete"".   
28Mr Opie has been in receipt of a Disability Support Pension since 2005. 
29In August 2007 he presented to the Community Mental Health Team at Merrylands.  He reported suffering from fluctuating mood which he was self-medicating with alcohol.  He was referred to Westmead Hospital for a mental health assessment for possible bipolar affective disorder and mood swings.  At that time he was diagnosed with alcohol dependence and a mood disturbance.  In September and November 2007 he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and alcohol dependence.  He received psychotherapeutic treatment but was reluctant to take psychotropic medication.  Further mental health assessments around that time noted that Mr Opie was suffering from depression. 
Mr Opie's recollection of the days leading up to the event 
30Mr Opie recounted the period leading up to the killing to both Dr Furst and Dr Allnutt in fairly consistent terms.  For some months prior to December 2012 he had believed that the AFP were following him because of his failure to pay tax on income he had received from casual employment.  He travelled to New Zealand approximately three weeks before the killing, and whilst there became increasingly concerned that people were following him and that the AFP had communicated with New Zealand police.  
31Upon his return to Australia he said his paranoia escalated.  He returned to his home unit on occasions in the three weeks prior to the killing but could not stay overnight, returning only to obtain more clothes and alcohol.  He told Dr Allnutt that during this time he ""deteriorated into a blithering wreck ... all the suspicions were affecting me ... I was paranoid"".  He described an ATM displaying a message advising that the transaction would not be processed from which he concluded that the AFP had restricted his access to his funds.  Mr Opie telephoned a friend and reported hearing a message saying, ""You're in deep trouble - there'll be gaol"".  He told Dr Furst that for days he was ""walking, drinking, sleeping out, like a puppet on a string.""  
32During this period he continued to drink heavily and ate little.  He described hearing voices and seeing lights.  On one occasion he believed a car was tailing him.  He lay behind a fence, feeling terrified, until it drove away.
33During this period Mr Opie described feeling suicidal and taking steps to kill himself, including placing a rope over the rafters in his home.  He described feeling ""insane"", like he had ""had enough"" and he ""couldn't handle life anymore"".  When examined in October and December 2013 by both Dr Furst and Dr Allnutt he reported having no memory of the events of 22 December 2012 and only remembered waking up in hospital.  
Opinions of Dr Furst and Dr Allnutt 
34Dr Furst is of the opinion that Mr Opie meets the criteria for a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder and alcohol dependence.  He confirmed that Mr Opie has a lengthy history of depression, periods of elevated mood, and impaired psychosocial function consistent with the diagnosis of a major mental illness, most likely that of a bipolar affective disorder.  Dr Furst explained that bipolar affective disorder is characterised by:
""...one or more episodes of abnormally elevated energy levels and mood, cognitive disturbance, and one or more depressive episodes.  Individuals can also have a mixed state, in which features of both depression and mania occur at the same time.  Episodes are typically separated by periods of normal mood.  Extremes of mania and depression can also lead to psychotic symptoms including delusions and hallucinations."" 
35Dr Allnutt is of the opinion that Mr Opie suffers from a late onset psychotic disorder (late onset schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder), with a pre-existing history of a recurrent mood disorder (probably bipolar affective disorder or recurrent depressive disorder).  In Dr Allnutt's view, Mr Opie's chronic alcohol dependence has exacerbated an underlying mood disorder and contributed to the emergence of a psychotic disorder. 
36Further, Dr Allnutt is of the opinion that Mr Opie's history of head injuries may have resulted in brain damage and cognitive difficulties, however that has not been the subject of formal neuropsychological testing.  Dr Furst agreed that the potential for an underlying organic brain disorder has not been properly explored, but maintained his opinion that Mr Opie's primary mental illness is a bipolar disorder (and/or a late onset psychotic illness such as schizoaffective disorder), being of sufficient severity that further investigation as to any possible cognitive impairment is unnecessary for the purposes of determining whether Mr Opie had a defence of mental illness available to him. 
Mental state at the time of the killing 
37Dr Furst is of the opinion that at the time of the killing Mr Opie was suffering from a bipolar affective disorder, severe depression and acute psychosis, of sufficient severity so as to have made him unaware of the wrongfulness of his actions in stabbing the deceased and unable to control himself.  Dr Furst considered Mr Opie's conduct at the scene in stabbing himself multiple times as consistent with him being mentally disordered. 
38Dr Allnutt is of the opinion that at the time of the killing Mr Opie's delusional belief that he was being persecuted by the AFP was active and was exacerbated, at least transiently, by sustained levels of intoxication.  In Dr Allnutt's view, in Mr Opie's intoxicated and delusional mental state, he may have had some interaction with the deceased on the day of the killing or before that day, or may have misinterpreted events involving the deceased, as a result of which he incorporated the deceased into his delusional belief system.  Whilst Mr Opie's motivation cannot be readily identified, if this state of affairs was present Dr Allnutt is of the opinion that Mr Opie's delusional beliefs provided a transient delusional justification for him to present at the deceased's home and to act as he did.  
39Dr Furst opined that there is insufficient evidence as to the effects of intoxication on Mr Opie at the time of the killing to determine if this contributed to his incorporation of the deceased into his delusional belief system.  In Dr Furst's opinion, Mr Opie's underlying mental conditions were of sufficient severity as to render him unaware of the wrongfulness of his actions, even were the intoxicating effect of alcohol disregarded. 
40At the time of his report in November 2013 Dr Furst was of the opinion that the care Mr Opie was receiving at Long Bay Correctional Complex Hospital was inadequate for his needs, particularly considering the gravity of the charges, the nature of his suicide attempt, and his lengthy history of depression, alcoholism and mental illness.  Dr Furst recommends that Mr Opie be transferred to a therapeutic unit to allow for more regular and thorough psychiatric assessments.  He also recommends that Mr Opie's mental health be monitored by Justice Health whilst he is in custody, and that he is provided with necessary counselling and medication, including a prescription for a mood stabilising medication and/or an antipsychotic medication.  Finally, Dr Furst recommends that if Mr Opie experiences a relapse of depression and mania he will require hospital based care, probably as an involuntary patient under the Mental Health Act 2007 (NSW).  I fully endorse Dr Furst's recommendations.  Dr Allnutt did not address Mr Opie's ongoing care. 
41The Crown prosecutor submitted that I should make orders pursuant to s 39(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, that Mr Opie be detained by the Department of Corrective Services until released by due process of law.  I am satisfied that those orders should form part of the orders in disposition of the special hearing of this trial.
Orders
42Accordingly, I make the following orders:1.  Pursuant to s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW), a special verdict of not guilty of the charge of murder by reason of mental illness is returned.
2.  Pursuant to s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW), Neil Alexander Opie is to be detained in a correctional facility or at such other place as determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law.
3.  I direct that the Registrar notify the Minister for Health of these orders. 
4.  I direct that the Registrar notify the Mental Health Review Tribunal of my verdict and of these orders.  I also direct that the Registrar provide the Tribunal with a copy of these reasons and my orders and a copy of the exhibits tendered during the special hearing.

		20 June 2014",2014-06-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704910,R v Abdallah (No 7) [2014] NSWSC 829,"JUDGMENT

1On the 12th of March 2014, the jury found the offender guilty of murdering Neil Todorovski by shooting him on 4th January 2012 at Sans Souci. In bringing in this verdict the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender: was not entitled to be acquitted by reason of self-defence; was not entitled to have the charge of murder reduced to manslaughter by excessive self-defence; and was not entitled to have the charge of murder reduced to manslaughter by provocation.

2The principles of law governing the sentencing of an offender who has been found guilty by the verdict of a jury are well known and require no exposition by me (see for example Chung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; (2001) 209 CLR 1). It is my responsibility to determine the appropriate sentence. It is for me to make a decision as to the degree of culpability involved in the offender's conduct in this case, and about all other facts relevant to sentencing. In this particular case there were material differences amongst the various lay witnesses about the detail of what actually happened. By convicting the offender of murder, the jury must be taken to have been unanimously satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown proved the necessary elements of the offence of murder. But the process by which each of them reasoned to the guilty verdict may not have been the same. Some may have accepted one body of evidence, and others another. The jury's verdict decided the issue of the offender's guilt. It did not decide for present purposes why he was guilty. 

3The conflicting versions of what happened largely fall into two broad categories. It is not in dispute that he offender fired seven shots on that day from a semi-automatic .32 calibre pistol. Six at Todorovski and the seventh into the ground to warn-off one of Todorovski's henchmen, Leger. The sequence and timing of the shots is disputed. Some witnesses describe a single volley of about six shots fired in fairly rapid succession followed by a short break and then one or two shots more. On this version the latter shot or shots are fired to warn off Leger. A Mr Boutsikakis describes an initial volley of one or two shots, the sound of ""another couple"" of gunshots several seconds later when the offender was out of sight, and yet ""another couple"" of shots into the now disabled Todorovski on the roadway when he returned. One has the impression from his evidence that this last episode of shooting was a coup de grâce. 

4In the proceedings on sentence both counsel argued that to convict the offender of murder, the jury must have accepted the particular version of events given by Mr Boutsikakis which was supported (at least in part) by the evidence of a Mr Mataipule. I do not think that acceptance of one version in preference to another necessarily follows from the verdict of guilty. Accordingly it is necessary for me to decide the facts for myself. It would be wrong in principle for me to second guess the jury by attempting to reconstruct what I think must have been their reasoning process in arriving at their verdict (R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374). 

5In deciding the facts, I will bear in mind that the Crown bears the onus of proving all matters adverse to the offender beyond reasonable doubt. Facts favourable to the offender offered in mitigation must be proved by him on the balance of probabilities (R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270).

Synopsis of basic fact

6It was not disputed at the trial that the offender gunned the deceased down on 4th January 2012, in broad daylight in a residential, suburban street at Sans Souci around midday. Selmon Street is closely settled and its built environment consists of a combination of blocks of home units and single dwellings. The shooting occurred on a summer's day. There were many people out and about on Selmon Street for social, domestic and work purposes. Many more people were at home in the surrounding dwellings when the shooting occurred. These circumstances explain the number of lay witnesses who either heard or saw the shooting.

7It is not in dispute that the shooting arose out of a confrontation between the offender on one side, and the deceased and two henchmen on the other. The offender did not have the gun on him at the commencement of the confrontation. But it was available nearby under the driver's seat of his double-parked four-wheel drive vehicle. I am satisfied that he had parked with the driver's door ajar for ready access to the gun should he need it.

8It is also not in dispute that the deceased and his henchmen were armed. One henchman, Leger, was wearing knuckle-dusters, the other, Lewis, carried a long-bladed knife. Todorovski himself was armed with a primed pistol. It was in his pocket but never drawn during the fight. Later, a police officer routinely collecting exhibits from his person at St. George Hospital found it on him. The Crown dispute that the offender knew Todorovski was armed with it. The offender says he saw it in Todorovski's hand when the latter approached him.

9It is not disputed that following a short verbal exchange Leger attacked the offender punching him hard with the knuckle-dusters he was wearing. The offender responded with violence and they fell to the ground wrestling and punching at each other. I accept that Todorovski and Lewis did not stand by watching, but rather assisted Leger by kicking the offender violently. The offender, a powerfully built, very tall man of great physical prowess was able to free himself from Leger's clutches and reach in through the open car door to retrieve his gun. 

10The evidence of the offender was he did this because he believed that Todorovski meant to kill him. He said that during the earlier verbal exchange Todorovski had said, ""Do you think I am going to let you get away with this?"" ""This"" was said to be a reference to injuries inflicted in an earlier fight between them in which the offender certainly got the better of Todorovski. I will return to that. The offender said that during the struggle with Leger he heard one of the three say ""shoot him, shoot him"". He said Todorovski then said ""you're fucking dead"" and moved his hand as if to draw the gun which the offender said he knew was then in Todorovski's pocket.

11The offender said that on hearing this he got his gun and shot at Todorovski because he believed that Todorovski was going to kill him. He said ""I was really, really scared for my life"".

12I am constrained by the jury's rejection of the defence, and partial defence, of self-defence to reject the evidence I have just recounted about why the offender retrieved the gun and fired it, including his assertion that he feared for his life. Although Leger and Lewis were armed and the former attacked him with the assistance of Todorovski and Lewis, I think it unlikely that the offender saw Todorovski's gun on the day of the shooting and before it happened. It was not drawn but remained in his pocket. When the offender produced his own gun, Todorovski tried to turn and run without going for his gun. From evidence I will later recount the offender knew that Todorovski possessed a gun.

13I am satisfied that in retrieving the gun and firing it at Todorovski, the offender was acting not in self-defence but in retaliation for the assault on him. As the Crown concede, this may have involved some measure of provocation necessarily falling short of the partial defence of provocation (s 23 Crimes Act 1900; s 21A(3)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)). 

14The offender also gave evidence that he did not remember how many times he shot at Todorovski when he retrieved the gun from his car. He accepted that it might have been five or six times. The effect of his evidence (976.10T) was that he kept shooting until Todorovski fell down. I understood that it was implicit in this evidence that he wanted to stop Todorovski in his tracks to protect himself. He denied that he meant to kill him (1017.10T). He said more than once that his only intention was to stop Todorovski from killing him (1017.30T). He said he levelled the gun and started to fire until Todorovski fell to the ground and that he was not really aiming anywhere in particular (1020.15T). The offender said there was only one episode of shooting at Todorovski and it stopped when he fell. He denied delivering any coup de grâce. I am constrained by the jury's verdict to reject this exculpatory evidence.

15But it does not follow from my rejection of that evidence that there were two episodes of shooting. My finding that the offender retrieved the gun and fired at Todorovski in retaliation, and not in self-defence, is consistent with the jury's verdict of guilty of murder. This still leaves open a question relevant to the objective seriousness of this case of murder of whether the offender intended to kill Todorovski from the firing of the first shot, or only later as the defence contend. In this context, the question of whether the offender delivered a coup de grâce, to my mind may assume some importance. It seems to me that a man who guns another down in the street and then returns to shoot him, at very close range twice in the head and once in the neck may be taken to have intended to kill his victim. But obviously it might also be that a man who shoots another 6 times in a single volley intends to kill him. The question is important because the offender says for sentencing purposes, and having regard to the verdict, I should find his criminality is of a lesser degree because he initially acted in self-defence and only later formed an intention to kill when he returned and delivered the coup de grâce. The expression after all has its origin as the ""mercy"" Killing of the wounded on the field of battle. I will turn then to a review of the evidence.

The previous relationship between the offender and Todorovski

16To resolve this important question of intention, whether the offender intended to kill from the first shot, it is necessary to say something about the previous relationship between Todorovski and the offender. I accept that the offender and Todorovski became acquainted through their attendance at the gym. They would often exercise together and sometimes the offender would pick Todorovski up or drop him home before or after exercising. They moved in similar social circles and would bump into each other occasionally in the cafes and restaurants around the Brighton area. The offender's sometime girlfriend, Marni Scott (who gave evidence on his behalf at the trial) was a close friend of Todorovski's girlfriend, before the shooting. 

17Through their interaction at the gym, the offender learned that Todorovski was a chief in the Lone Wolf bikie club. Todorovski would often be accompanied by other members of the club at the gym. It was clear to the offender that they deferred to him and acknowledged his seniority. The offender also said that Todorovski struck him as a violent man and the sort of person he would not like to get on the wrong side of. Todorovski had shown him a handgun in the change room at the gym once, stating that he had it to deal with some ""drama"". For reasons not satisfactorily explained by the evidence, there was a falling out towards the end of 2011. The offender blamed this on Todorovski. He denied he had given Todorovski any offence, specifically he denied the suggestion raised peripherally in some evidence that he owed Todorovski money (see Ms Julian (845.35 - 346.25T). 

18The offender heard rumours that Todorovski had taken a set against him and concerned by these rumours he said that he decided the best way of approaching him would be to attempt to get Marni Scott's friend, Todorovski's girlfriend, to intercede with Todorovski on his behalf. 

19His evidence was that when Ms Scott was slow to provide the telephone number of Todorovski's girlfriend he sent an angry text message demanding the ""number now"". By mistake he sent the text not to Ms Scott but to Todorovski whose number he had in his phone for the purpose of arranging their previous gym sessions. 

20The offender's explanation was that Todorovski's number was in his dial list and it was ""a terrible mistake"" (962.5 - 20T). In any event, he said Todorovski took offence, accused the offender of being disrespectful and insisted in no uncertain language that the offender call upon him at his place of residence. The accused said he agreed to meet in the hope that he could explain his mistake and resolve whatever issue it was that had given rise to Todorovski taking a set against him. 

21They met on 12th December 2011, outside Todorovski's unit block. Before the offender could say anything he said that Todorovski screamed at him ""I'm going to fucking kill you, I'm going to shoot you"" punching him in the face twice and knocking him over. However, as later occurred on the 4th of January 2012, the offender was able to recover from his position of disadvantage, regain his feet, pick Todorovski up, slam him to the ground and kick him to the face (964.30T). He inflicted very severe facial injuries on Todorovski including fractures of the bones forming his eye socket. He left Todorovski lying in the gutter and made good his escape before Todorovski's henchmen who had been standing by were able to retaliate. He ran to his car and drove off at speed. He denied making any loud threats to anybody before leaving. The evidence does not disclose whether the henchmen on this occasion were also Leger and Lewis. 

22This fight was overheard by two independent lay witnesses, Ms Julian and Ms Bonaretti. Ms Bonaretti lived in the same block as Todorovski and knew his voice. She gave evidence that it was the offender, whom she did not know, who had said ""I'll fucking kill you. I'll get a gun and shoot you"". From cross-examination however, it became apparent that, soon after, she had given an account in an email to her brother in which she had identified Todorovski, whom she knew, and whose voice she had heard many times, as the person who screamed those words. 

23Ms Julian lived in the block next door. She heard similar screamed threats. She was sure it was the voice of the man she saw fleeing the scene, i.e. the offender. 

24A degree of plausibility is lent to the account of the offender that this fight was prompted by a misunderstanding about a text message by the contents of Exhibit MM, a recording of a legally intercepted telephone call after the event between Todorovski and one of his bikie associates. In the call Todorovski appears to refer to a misunderstanding about text messages. However, the words spoken by Todorovski appear to be, ""Sent me messages that wasn't supposed to be for me he reckons"" (my emphasis). This does not suggest to me that he was actually accepting that there was such a misunderstanding. From the contents of Exhibit MM it appears that Todorovski was uncertain of the origin of the dispute. 

25I find the offender's account about this matter unsatisfactory and unconvincing. The only thing I am clear about is that I have not been told the whole story about the evident severe animosity between the offender and Todorovski. I do not accept it was a misunderstanding about a girlfriend's phone number, even if sexual jealousy sometimes might be a powerful motivation for the commission of serious crime.

26It seems logical that Ms Bonaretti, who knew Todorovski might have been correct in her first account that the voice she heard was his. The offender's account has Todorovski uttering the words Ms Bonaretti heard before the offender disabled him. It is highly unlikely that Todorovski could demonstrate such ""Pythonesque"" defiance from the gutter in his highly injured state. On the other hand, it is difficult to understand why the offender would have issued such threats in circumstances where he had so clearly vanquished his adversary. But as I will attempt to make clear the evidence establishes that it was the offender who sought out Todorovski again on 4th January 2012.

27There is no reason to doubt Ms Julian's account and she was adamant that the man who uttered the threat was the man who drove away in the car. She volunteered her name and address to the police who attended Selmon Street that night, but they did not take a statement from her until after the offender shot Todorovski in January. 

28I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the fight between the offender and Todorovski occurred on 12th December 2011 in Selmon Street, Sans Souci and the offender inflicted serious personal injury upon Todorovski. I think it more likely that the offender uttered the threatening words, but I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did so, because of the conflicting evidence. I am satisfied that Todorovski started the fight by punching the accused. Whether or not the threat was made by the offender, in the end it is of no real moment. The Crown case has always been that the offender did not form an intention to kill until he pulled the gun on 4th January 2012.

The intervening period

29The evidence of what occurred between 12th December 2011 and 4th January 2012 mainly comes from the offender. But he is corroborated in some material respects by Ms Scott and a Ms Melanie Salazaar. There was also a second recording of a lawfully intercepted telephone conversation between Todorovski and one of his bikie associates. The relevance of that, however, is simply to show that by the end of December 2011 Todorovski was much recovered from his injuries and was about to resume training.

30The accused's account is that he was conscious of being under threat of retaliation for having severely injured someone he knew to be a bikie chief. 

31His fears were heightened when he read a news report online of a car similar to his being shot-up in the Rockdale area. He said that when he read that account he telephoned Todorovski, apparently no longer having any concern about contacting him directly. He tried to explain it was a misunderstanding. Todorovski said ""I don't care"", told him to stay out of the area, and said if he saw him in the area it would be over for him [968.10T] The offender understood this to be a threat on his life.

32Again there is some support for this further contact in Exhibit MM. The recording of the conversation is not perfect. (There is a transcript MFI 46). But, Todorovski seems to tell his associate that he had ""a chat"" with the offender on 15th December 2011. The exchange seems to have been as follows:

Offender: Fuck, bro, I didn't mean all this fucking ...

Todorovski: Well, bro, that's what happened.

Offender: Yeah, but you smacked me out. You punched me a couple of times to the head.

Todorovski: Well what do you expect?

Offender: Well that's why I done that.

Todoorovski: Well fuckin now we supposed to be mates again? Give it a couple of a couple of weeks, mate, fucking stay away from here.

33I might also say that the associate's chapter of the bikie club ""were not happy"" with what happened and said the offender better stay away from them. Todorovski expressed displeasure with the offender's tactics in the fight. Having said that Todorovski's recorded account is not consistent with him threatening the offender's death. He does seem to warn the offender off.

34Ms Salazaar, another friend of the offender, said that she had bumped into Todorovski in Coles at Ramsgate sometime in December 2011. It must have been after the fight because she noticed Todorovski's facial injuries. She said Todorovski asked if she still saw the offender. When she said ""yes"", he said ""give him a message from me. Tell him I am after him and I'm going to get him."" (1134.45T). 

35Ms Scott said Todorovski was very, very angry and told her ""it's not over"". He showed her a handgun and said ""this is for your fucking boyfriend"". She was frightened and told the offender about it on 3rd January 2012. She said she urged the offender to try and sort things out because she was afraid for him.

36The Crown elicited evidence from these witnesses which suggested they are partisan. Ms Scott had been in a relationship with the offender sometime prior to 4th January 2011 and continues now to visit him whilst he was in custody. She apparently is no longer friendly with Todorovski's girlfriend. Ms Salazaar had a reason to strongly resent Todorovski. It was not made explicit in evidence, but I formed the impression that he broke up a serious relationship she was in with one of Todorovski's bikie associates. She made it quite clear that she was not an admirer of his. Neither of these witnesses had come forward to volunteer their information to the police during their investigation of the shooting of Mr Todorovski, although both knew of it. In fact, Ms Scott had arrived to visit her friend shortly after the shooting occurred.

37Notwithstanding these valid criticisms of the impartiality of these witnesses, having had the advantage of seeing and hearing them give evidence, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that they were telling the truth. I am satisfied that Todorovski was a violent man, and some kind of bikie chief. He obviously possessed a gun. The events of 12th December 2011 demonstrate he had a propensity for violence. Indeed the events of 4th January 2102 demonstrate he was prepared to arm himself for conflict with the offender. It is true that neither of the recordings of the telephone intercepts portray any expression by him of any determination to exact revenge for the beating he received at the hands of the offender, but he may have wished to downplay the significance of the matter to his bikie colleague, who seemed angrier about it than Todorovski . 

38It seems consistent with the probabilities then that Todorovski would not shrug off the beating and its underlying cause, whatever that was. 

39In response to reading about the shot up car, his belief that Todorovski was a threat, and the warning passed on from Ms Salazaar the offender took action. He did not receive Ms Scott's warning until the night before he murdered Todorovski but her warning prompted him to contact Todorovski again, a matter to which I will return.

40The action taken by the offender was, he says at the urging of a friend, to arm himself. He says, for his protection but I have rejected this explanation in conformity with the jury's verdict. I find that being forewarned of Todorovski's intentions he forearmed himself to leave his options open in the event of a further confrontation. 

The events of 4th January 2012

41Having received Ms Scott's warning about Todorovski's intentions the previous night, the offender determined to contact Todorovski again to bring their dispute to a head. I accept he hoped to settle it once and for all. I do not accept that he genuinely thought this could be achieved amicably with a handshake. Some level of intimidation and violence was going to be necessary. 

42In this context taking the gun portrays a level of planning or premeditation. I accept the argument for the Crown that the offender arranged the meeting with Todorovski and came to it having turned his mind to the fact that he might have to use the gun on the deceased, even if he hoped he could make Todorovski back off by physical initimidation.

43The evidence shows that it was the offender who demanded the meeting with Todorovski on 4th January. When he first called Todorovski's number he was already in the car driving to Sans Souci from Malabar where he was minding a house for a friend. At the time he called, Todorovski and his henchmen were in the process of inhaling or ingesting a cocktail of drugs. This is established by the physical evidence found by the police in their subsequent examination of Todorovski's unit and the toxicological tests carried out as part of the post mortem. 

44Initially the offender spoke to Todorovski's girlfriend who discouraged the offender from coming and tried to avoid Todorovski talking to him. The offender, however, was persistent and called repeatedly. The last call was made from Selmon Street outside Todorovski's unit where the offender had double-parked his black Range Rover. A resident from across the street who was then backing her car out of her driveway found that he was blocking her way. She noticed that he was on the phone and from his body language formed the impression he was in a state of some agitation (Ms. Gorman at 278T).

45I infer that by showing up in Selmon Street, the offender intended to give Todorovski no option but to come out into the street and confront him. The offender did not intend to be in Selmon Street long. As I have said, he double-parked, effectively in the middle of the road. He got out of the car and stood on the driver's side with the door ajar so he could access his concealed gun if he decided circumstances warranted its use. This was to be no long-winded attempt at mediation. I do not accept that the offender said to Todorovski merely ""I want to come and talk to you. We need to fix this issue between us [972.15T]"". 

46The offender was successful in forcing Todorovski's hand. When he emerged from the unit block he was wearing a Lone Wolf shirt and carrying a concealed weapon. His two henchmen were likewise wearing garments which identified them as members of the Lone Wolf bikie gang. I have no doubt that Todorovski and his henchmen would have been fired up by the drugs they had taken. As I have said all were armed and must have been expecting trouble for some reason not made explicit by acceptable evidence.

47I interpolate that leger and Lewis both refused to answer questions at the trial and were subsequently imprisoned by me for contempt of court. Their evidence doubtless would have made the resolution of disputed questions of fact easier, and might have cast light on the underlying reasons for the animosity between the offender and Todorovski.

48I have already stated the basic facts and I will not repeat them. The constraints imposed by the jury's verdict and the absence of acceptable evidence, make it impossible for me to make any finding about the nature and content of the underlying dispute; what was said in the short verbal exchange before the violence started; and the offender's true motive for shooting Todorovski. Motive, of course, is not an element of the offence.

49As I have stated my main purpose in reviewing the evidence so far has been to decide whether or not the Crown have proved beyond reasonable doubt whether or not the offender shot Todorovski in two discreet episodes, one of which was by way of coup de grâce. The importance of this, as I have explained, is what it says about the intention of the offender and in particular when he formed the intention to kill rather than to maim. Either intention is sufficient for the crime of murder. But the former involves a higher level of culpability than the latter for the purposes of the law of sentencing. To resolve the issue it is necessary to refer to the evidence of some of the independent witnesses.

The lay evidence

50Mr Mark Sua was one of a team of tree loppers whose car had broken down on their way to a job. They were waiting at the western end of Selmon Street near its intersection with Rocky Point Road. Mr Sua heard screaming and shouting then gunshots. When he looked to where the shots were coming from he saw two people running off. These were Lewis and Leger. The offender was chasing leger in the direction of the units. When he returned from the chase the offender got back in his car and ""just sped off"" [688.5]. Mr Sua gave no evidence of any coup de grâce. He said after the shooting that the offender was yelling out ""do youse want some more?"" He heard four or five shots in a single volley. After the offender went out of view between the unit blocks he heard another shot. I interpolate, this was a shot fired to warn Leger off. There were no further shots. 

51Another of the tree loppers was Mr Leutogi. His attention was attracted by hearing a shot. He said he heard a total of five shots two of which were fired after the offender had gone out of view chasing Leger. He heard no further gun shots and gave no evidence of any coup de grâce. He said he heard the offender yelling at Leger to ""get the fuck back here"".

52Mrs Kiel lives across the road from where the shooting occurred. She was at home with her mother-in-law and her children when it happened. She heard some loud bangs, which her mother-in-law said sounded like gunshots. She went to her front door to investigate and saw the offender firing a gun over a fence up a driveway across the road. This was the shot to warn Leger off. She then went to check on her children and when she returned to the door she saw the offender drive off. She did not give any evidence of hearing further shots which might have been attributable to a coup de grâce. ([743.35T]).

53Mrs Alexander had just pulled up in Selmon Street very near where the shooting occurred. She was coming to visit her parents. She noticed the offender's double-parked vehicle when she parked. It was about 4 or 5 car lengths ahead of her. She got out of the car to walk around to remove her infant from the child restraint in the back seat. Mrs Alexander was conscious of scuffling going on near the double-parked car as she was attending to her daughter. She then heard a bang which frightened her because she knew it was a gunshot from previous experience. She got back into the driver's position of the car and got low in the vehicle trying to ""quieten"" her daughter [712.50]. She heard a succession of bangs which identified as gunshots totalling six ""or it could have been seven"" [715.5T]. She heard swearing then she heard a car drive off. She kept her head down because she did not want to be seen. She did not see the shooting. After she heard the car drive off, she got out of her car and saw Todorovski on the ground writhing in pain. She thought wrongly, as it happens, that he had been shot in the leg [716.30T]. Understandably Mrs Alexander was very upset by being in close proximity to these dire, frightening events. And for that reason she was not confident in her recall. In cross-examination she agreed that the shots she heard were in quick succession. Her evidence does not support the execution of a coup de grâce. 

54Mr Baker was a resident of the unit block where Mrs Alexander's parents lived. He had police and military experience and was familiar with firearms. He heard ""approximately"" five gunshots in quick succession. He wasn't prepared to concede it could have been six, as he counted them. However the forensic evidence in the case establishes that there were six spent cartridges found on Selmon Street from which I infer six shots were fired. Notwithstanding his intransigence about the number of shots, I found Mr Baker to be an otherwise impressive witness. He said the gunshots happened in quick succession within about 5 or 6 seconds. It was not as long as 10 seconds. When he heard the gunshots he went to a window overlooking the street and looked out. He saw the Range Rover and noticed the driver's door was open. He also saw the offender. By this time the offender must have returned from chasing Leger. He saw the offender walk to the front of his vehicle looking at the ground. I infer he was looking at Mr Todorovski on the ground. Mr Baker heard no further gunshots at that time. Mr Baker's evidence does not support the coup de grâce. He rang 000 and went outside to investigate when he came across Mrs Alexander in a panic and her child. He took them into her parents' home. 

55I will now deal with the evidence which supports the offender delivering a coup de grâce to the disabled Todorovski. Mr Thompson was at home in his Selmon Street unit watching the cricket on television. He heard some loud bangs which he initially thought might have been a car backfiring. He didn't take too much notice until he heard a few more. His best recollection was that he heard five to seven shots in all. They were not all consecutive shots. He heard three and after a gap of 15 to 20 seconds he heard the rest. After hearing the second series he went out on his balcony to investigate. When he got to a vantage point on his balcony. He saw the offender's vehicle swerving to the right and ""taking off"" [865.15T]. He was unshaken from this account in cross-examination, but said a period of ""30 seconds maximum"" had elapsed from the last shot to when the offender's car drove away. Accepting that estimates of time made by lay witnesses who have no reason to clock it may be inaccurate, 30 seconds seems a long time between any coup de grâce and the departure of the offender.

56Mr Mataipule was one of the tree loppers. He was near his broken down car looking towards Rocky Point Road. He heard some gunshots and turned around. He saw the offender standing in the middle of the road yelling and screaming ""who's next"" [603.15T]. He then saw the offender disappear to the left, obviously in pursuit of Leger. He said ""a minute"" later he came back and stood over the person that was on the ground, obviously Todorovski, and drove off. He was asked:

Q. Did you see him do anything when he came back?

A. He was yelling and screaming.

When asked:

Q. Can you say what it was you saw him do? What did you see him do?

There was a long pause and he was visibly upset. After the pause, he said:

A. I saw him shoot a man.

Mr Mataipule clarified that when he looked up he saw the offender shoot Todorovski and yell out ""who's next"" [606.5T]. He saw someone, obviously Lewis, running away towards the intersection of Selmon and Campbell Streets, to the east [607.15T] and another person, obviously Leger, running off towards the units [607.30T]. Todorovski who had been shot was on the ground. Mr Mataipule rang 000 on his mobile phone. He said whilst he was on the phone he walked down to where Todorovski was lying. When he got there he was still breathing and he noticed two gunshot wounds to his head.

57Further evidence was sought to be elicited from Mr Mataipule about the sequence of events. With respect, his account was somewhat confusing. He was asked (unhelpfully) whether Todorovski was shot in the head before or after the car drove off. Of course, he answered ""before"" [610.10T]. He was then asked whether it was before or after the offender disappeared from his sight the first time. Whilst the prosecutor was withdrawing that question, the transcript shows the witness answered, ""it was before"" [610.20T]. A further series of questions themselves suggested that the shots to the head occurred when the offender returned from his pursuit of Leger. However, he was then asked this question [610.40T]:

Q. And when he fired into the head of the man, where was the man that he shot.

A. He dropped to the ground. He was standing conversating (conversing) with him (sic).

And then [611.5T]:

Q. Was he shot when he was on the ground.

A. Yes.

Overall this sounds like Mr Mataipule might have witnessed a coup de grâce, but that is far from clear.

58Initially in cross-examination he said his attention was attracted by the sound of two shots only. He denied it could have been six [614.35T]. Just before the luncheon adjournment, he agreed that he had told the Magistrate at the committal proceedings that when the offender came into view after his pursuit of Leger he went straight to his driver's door, got in and drove away. He said that evidence was correct [617.45T]. After the luncheon adjournment he reaffirmed that evidence and said that he heard one gunshot when the offender was out of view. He was then reminded that in chief he had said that he saw the offender shoot Todorovski on the ground before leaving. He said ""I'm probably confused or had it the wrong way around"" [625.5T]. He was taken to the statement he made on the 4th of January 2012 when one would suppose the events were fresh in his mind. In that account he said he heard the initial two shots, the offender scream ""who's next"", another two shots coming from the front of the car, saw the offender disappearing, coming back and firing another two shots from the front of his car. This first account of course suggests the coup de grâce. Yet again, he was cross-examined about his evidence at the committal. It was drawn to his attention that he did not mention the coup de grâce shots in that evidence. Reviewing the transcript of the Trial, it's not clear at all to me that Mr Mataipule accepted his evidence at the committal was the most accurate version. Indeed, from the transcript he seems to be saying that he regarded his original statement as being consistent with his evidence at the committal (639.5 - .30T). 

59I should say that Mr Mataipule struck me as an unsophisticated young man with limited experience of life. His account is somewhat confusing as to whether there was a coup de grâce or not. At best it can be said that parts of his evidence support that version including his first account.

60The principal witness who put forward evidence supporting the coup de grâce version is Mr Bill Boutsikakis. Mr Boutsikakis had been down at the eastern end of Selmon Street, inspecting a car he was interested in purchasing. His own car was parked next to the kerb on the northern side of the road facing west. In other words, it was parked with the driver's side nearest the kerb. Looking west a utility vehicle with a tabletop load space surrounded by low side-boards and tailgate obstructed his vision to where the confrontation took place, to some extent. So he was not able to see everything that transpired. But because the offender's vehicle was double-parked and the offender, Todorovski and his henchmen were standing on it's driver's side, he was able to see much of what occurred. 

61He saw the circle of men talking ""and then all of a sudden it broke into a fight"" [481.15T]. He saw Leger punch the offender. They then fell to the ground rolling around wrestling. He saw Todorovski and Lewis move to where the scuffle was, but he could not see what they were doing. When the offender freed himself from the fight he saw him go around the rear of his vehicle to the passenger side where he was out of sight. When he re-emerged he had a gun in his right hand (the offender is left handed). He saw the offender start to fire and Lewis and Leger run away. Todorovski fell to the ground. He then saw the offender chase Leger. When he re-appeared he fired ""another couple of shots"" into Todorovski [484.15T]. 

62I think it important to record that Mr Boutsikakis gave the coup de grâce version of events to the emergency services operator when he dialled 000 on his mobile phone (Exhibit P). During that call he said the offender had ""shot one bloke and the others ran away and then [he] came back and emptied a few more rounds"". In evidence he said the offender emptied a few more rounds into Mr Todorovski.

63Mr Boutsikakis gave the coup de grâce version of events to police officers that very day. But an issue about his evidence is that he was asked to make a number of statements on different occasions and inevitably inconsistencies have crept in. Not only did he make a statement early in the afternoon of the shooting. He was brought back for a second statement later that day and underwent a police walk through some weeks later which was recorded on DVD. With great respect, these processes did not assist in the maintenance of the clarity of Mr Boutsikakis' account. During cross-examination he was taken through all of these various versions and tested about the various inconsistencies they contained. Moreover, the account he gave at the committal contained yet further inconsistencies. I will not detail all of them. It is worth recording that from the excerpt of the DVD of the walkthrough that was played in cross-examination, it is relatively clear that Mr Boutsikakis described something like a coup de grâce as part and parcel of the original shooting rather than as something which occurred after the pursuit of Leger.

64In a long, thorough and skilful cross-examination, Mr Boutsikakis was taken through the various inconsistencies and the significant disadvantages of his position to observe what was going on by reason of the distance, the position of his car, and his difficulty hearing because his car windows were up and the air conditioning was on. He was also taken through his evidence in the committal in detail. It is fair to say that in the course of that he accepted it was possible that he was mistaken about the sequence of events and all of the shots may have been fired in a single volley [564.45 - 566.5T]. However, I think that, basically, he adhered to his original version that there was a coup de grâce, although his confidence about that may have been shaken. 

65I permitted the Crown prosecutor to re-examine him under s 108, Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) on his police station statement of 4th January 2014, containing his original version, which he maintained was true. 

Expert evidence

66Before making a decision on the facts, I think it necessary to discuss some of the expert evidence from Mr Van der Walt, a ballistics expert, and Associate Professor Orde, a forensic pathologist. In truth little of their evidence was really in dispute, simply because neither of them could cast any light on the sequence of events. In particular, although both were able to give valuable evidence about the range at which the bullets inflicting Mr Todorovski's wounds were fired, neither of them was able to say directly, obviously, what the sequence of their infliction was and whether there was a coup de grâce. 

67It was clear that Mr Todorovski sustained six gun shot wounds to various parts of his body and that six spent cartridges were recovered from around the carriageway of Selmon Street in close proximity to where the shooting occurred. From this it can be said that each of the shots fired by the offender at Todorovski on Selmon Street found its mark.

68There were three wounds to the left side of Todorovski's head and neck. One of the head wounds, that closer to the front of the head, was marked by ""gunshot tattooing"" as a result of either hard or loose contact indicating that the nozzle of the pistol was no more than 10 millimetres from the wound [357 and 437T]. The second head wound and the neck wound also had a degree of tattooing. According to Associate Professor Orde, the maximum range at which these were inflicted was between 30 to 60 centimetres. Of the three other wounds, one was to Todorovski's left index finger involving entry and exit wounds caused by one bullet. Another entered his back more or less centrally. And a sixth wound entered the right side of his back and travelled from right to left and back to front in a slightly upward trajectory. It tracked through his right posterior chest space, through the diaphragm, through upper part of the liver and into the bottom end of the heart piercing the right ventricle. This injury led to an accumulation of blood, which Professor Orde said, ""can have catastrophic effects on the function of the heart"". This bullet continued until it came to rest just beneath the skin on the left side of the chest [450.35 - 451.10T].

69The professor said not all of the injuries would necessarily have proved fatal, especially those to the hand or neck, unless he bled to death from them. He said:

I think the most logical conclusion is to say that death would be due to the combined effects of these injuries, primarily the two to the front of the head and the one to the heart. Any of those could have been capable of causing death in isolation. The fact that there was an accumulation of blood around the heart suggests that perhaps that injury had occurred in a matter of seconds or minutes perhaps prior to death. The accumulation of the volume of blood was of a degree that such death may have been due to that. [453.20T].

70Professor Orde also said that the injury to the left hand could have been a defensive injury. Professor Orde said that the injuries to his back and hand were inflicted whilst Todorovski was standing and the injuries to the head and neck were inflicted whilst he was on the ground. That was one possibility. In cross-examination he agreed that another possibility was that the head injuries were inflicted at very close range whilst Todorovski was standing and in the process of turning to go to his right to run away. He accepted that after the infliction of the head wounds it was possible that he might stumble a step or two, still turning, and that the wounds to the back were then inflicted ""if they had been in rapid succession"" [471.5T]. He did add the rider if the shots to the head were inflicted first, he would expect the victim to fall rapidly. 

71Both experts agreed that as there was an exit wound from one of the headshots and the neck shot, had those shots been fired whilst Todorovski was on the ground some mark of their exit might have been made on the road. No such marks were found by the police crime scene examiners.

72As I have said the expert evidence is incapable of resolving the issue. The overall effect of it is that either of the competing versions is consistent with the objective scientific evidence. The absence of a record of gunshot marks on the road is in my judgment neither here nor there. Notwithstanding the careful examination by the crime scene investigators and other experts on 4th January 2012, of the crime scene such matters may well have been missed. This is especially so as there was a puddle of blood on the roadway that had flowed from the head and neck injuries.

Decision about whether there was a coup de grâce

73The question is whether I am persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the acts of the offender which constitute murder included firing three shots in a coup de grâce. Having further reviewed the evidence myself for the purpose of sentencing the offender, I am not so satisfied. That is, the evidence leaves me in doubt as to whether the offender did return from his pursuit of Leger and fire three shots into Todorovski's neck and head at very close range.

74As the expert evidence is essentially neutral on this issue, the question must be decided by reference to the lay witnesses. Of all the lay witnesses who gave evidence relevant to this question only Mr Boutsikakis and Mr Mataipule support that version of events, and the latter only in part. I accept that each of them was a truthful witness doing his very best to give an accurate account of what he saw and heard. I also accept that a coup de grâce, being a cold blooded act, is likely to impress itself upon one's memory. However, it is well known that even in a case of traumatic, memorable events, people's perception is not always reliable. 

75I accept that Mr Boutsikakis is entirely genuine in what he says he saw and his evidence is made impressive by the fact that he gave that account from the very outset when he made the 000 call. Mr Mataipule's evidence is also supported by an early consistent statement but that suffered from his tendency to distinctly vacillate in the witness box. My impression on the whole was that Mr Boutsikakis did not.

76The real difficulty I have with accepting that account is the body of lay evidence which stands against it. I am very conscious that mere weight of numbers need not carry the day. Quality, rather than quantity is the most significant consideration. However, I was impressed by Mr Baker. Although he was somewhat inflexible about whether it could have been six shots, rather than five, he struck me as a very careful witness. His great familiarity with firearms because of the nature of his work suggests to me that he would recognise a gunshot as soon as he heard it and I was left with the impression that he paid close attention to them once he heard the first. Mrs Alexander was a very nervous witness. Understandably, of all the lay witnesses I am sure she had gone through the most frightening experience. She gave the impression of being primarily reliant upon her statement, rather than her memory. Mrs Kiel was impressive and gives no evidence consistent with the coup de grâce. Mr Thompson's evidence can be taken as supporting either version. The initial gap he speaks of was consistent with the coup de grâce, but the gap before the departure of the offender is not. None of Mr Mataipule's colleagues who were with him at all times give an account like his. Obviously, a coup de grâce could have occurred, but I am not persuaded to the requisite degree that it did. I find that the offender shot Todorovski in a single volley of six shots fired in rapid succession.

What was the offender's intention

77I return to the central question, what was the offender's intention? Did he intend to kill Todorovski from the first shot? I do not accept the arguments of counsel that the single volley of six shots version is inconsistent with the jury's verdict of guilty. I have found, consistently with that verdict, that the offender did not act in self-defence in retrieving the gun, but acted purely in retaliation. On the version I have accepted, as I have commented before, all six shots fired by the offender at Todorovski found a mark. No less than three of the six caused his death. The first shots were fired at his head and neck, indeed the very first shot was into his head at very close range as Todorovski was turning to his right to flee with his henchmen. As Todorovski started to tumble and fall the offender continued to fire. I am not persuaded that the wounds to the left hand are defensive wounds. Rather, I think it more likely that they were inflicted with the wounds to his back as the offender continued to fire as Todorovski fell to the ground. 

78As I find that: the offender went to Selmon Street to confront Todorovski; that he did so with a degree of premeditation implicit in bringing a gun he was prepared to use if necessary; when attacked he pulled the weapon at the earliest opportunity; his first shots were fired at point blank range; and he continued to fire an additional five shots, each of which struck its target, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender, from the first shot, fired his gun at Todorovski intending to kill him.

Victim Impact statement

79As is now well known, the impact of a death on the family of a deceased is irrelevant to the length of the sentence imposed. The loss of one human life cannot be considered more serious than the loss of another (R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76). Because it is relevant to understanding what happened, I have referred to the circumstance that Todorovski during his life was a bikie chief. Notwithstanding that circumstance it is well to state that the law values all human life equally. As Adams J has expressed it (R v Dang (1999) NSWCCA 42 at [25] - [26]):

The reason why a victim's impact statement cannot be taken into account where a person dies may easily be demonstrated. Assume the deceased was friendless; assume the deceased had no family, it would be monstrous to suggest that that meant for some reason killing her should attract a lesser sentence than would be the case if, as is the situation here, she had a loving family and grieving relatives. Essentially, then, the reason that victim impact statements in cases involving death are not taken into account in imposing sentence is that law holds, as it must, that in death we are all equal and the idea that it is more serious or more culpable to kill someone who has or is surrounded by a loving and grieving family than someone who is alone is offensive to our notions of equality before the law.

In my view it is equally offensive to our notions of equality before the law to treat the death of Todorovski as unimportant in terms of the maintenance of peace and good order in our community. Many would disapprove of Todorovski's activities but that is not to the point.

80Moreover, Todorovski had family who cared about him. I had the benefit of hearing his sister read a family victim impact statement at the proceedings on sentence. I have no doubt that she, like others who have suffered the same loss, carries the burden of it very heavily. I express my condolences to her and to the other members of the family of the deceased.

Subjective circumstances

81The offender was born on 19th June 1986. He was 25 at the date of his offending and is now 28. 

82He was educated to Higher School Certificate level and played rugby and water-polo at school. He has not received any tertiary education. Since leaving school he has worked in the construction industry and at times managing a bar. He is unmarried and has no dependent children.

83His local criminal record is not such as to cause concern for present purposes. There is one offence of supplying a prohibited drug when he was 17 years of age for which he received a bond. The few other matters are of no moment. He has never been convicted in New South Wales of a crime of violence.

84Of more concern is a conviction for kidnapping in New Zealand in 2006 when he was 20. He went to New Zealand with a friend whose wife had left him. They were there for four days when they kidnapped the man with whom the wife was living. The offender was instrumental in this. As I have said, he is a very tall, strongly built young man. He approached the victim in the garage of his home and ""asked"" him to come with him to talk to the husband. He guided the victim to the car where the husband was waiting by placing his right hand on the victim's left shoulder. He put the victim in the back seat of the car and sat there beside him. The victim was then driven to another address. When the offender left the premises to obtain food, the husband bound the victims hands. Upon the offender's return he cut the bindings from the victim with a Stanley knife, accidentally cutting his hand. I infer that the offender persuaded the husband to release the victim and they then drove him to a nearby taxi stand, dropped him off and offered him money for the cab. The offender was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years. The kidnapping offence involved no overt violence. The period of detention of the victim was relatively short, being around one and a half hours, but doubtless he would have been very afraid. The worrying aspect of that offending for present purposes is, like the present case, it involves the offender seeking to settle disputes by taking the law into his own hands. This evinces an attitude of disregard for the law.

85I received a pre-sentence report which has been amended since the details of the offender's New Zealand conviction have been obtained. Knowledge of that matter has not caused the author of the report to alter the opinions originally expressed. The offender gave a history of the offending broadly consistent with his evidence at the Trial. This involves adherence to the view that he acted in self-defence which I have said more than once I am constrained to reject. He has been assessed as at a low/medium risk of re-offending. No matters requiring rehabilitation whilst in custody were identified. He might benefit from a violent offender's program. The author of the report expressed the view that he was unlikely to benefit from any extended period of supervision by Corrective Services on release. 

86I have received a report of Dr Olav Nielssen which, by leave, was later amended and is now dated 29th May 2014. Once again, the offender gave Dr Nielssen a history of the offending consistent with his evidence at the trial. Once again, I must reject that account. Dr Nielssen was of the view that he suffered from no psychiatric disorder nor was there any form of developmental delay, learning disorder, brain injury, psychotic illness or severe mood disorder. His level of substance abuse was not considered sufficient to justify the diagnosis of a disorder. Dr Nielssen points out that ""homicide recidivism is rare"". 

87When giving evidence, the offender was asked about how he felt about the fact that he killed Todorovski. He said:

I'm really sorry for it. I'm terrified, I really didn't want this to happen [956.45T].

He told the community corrections officer that he was shattered and upset that Todorovski had died. He spoke to Dr Nielssen of ""his sadness at having caused... Todorovski's death"". I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that these expressions of regret constitute evidence of remorse. Remorse normally involves acknowledgment of guilt, an acceptance of responsibility for one's own actions, and the demonstration of a determination to change. None of these things can be persuasively shown whilst the offender, effectively, maintains his innocence on the basis of the self-defence the jury have rejected.

88The rejection by the jury of self-defence and provocation ""does not necessarily mean that the accused cannot get the benefit, as a mitigating factor, at least to some extent, of the factual basis upon which they rested. If a sentencing judge is satisfied from the credible evidence in a case that there was a degree of provocation, he may taken it into account as a mitigating factor"". (R v Bell (1985) 2 NSWLR 466 at 485 per Lee J; R v Heffernan [2005] NSWSC 739 per Hoeben J (as his Honour then was)).

89From the jury's verdict, and facts as I find them to be, I am not satisfied that the offender acted in any way in self-defence. However, I accept, as the Crown concede, that there was a degree of provocation offered by Todorovski in setting his henchmen upon the offender and in joining in the attack and I will take that factor into account by way of mitigation to a degree. 

90A number of character references were tendered from family, friends and neighbours, all of whom appear to be persons of good character who spoke highly of what they knew of the offender's character. Amongst them was the Muslim chaplain from Corrective Services, who informed me that the offender regularly attends chapel and speaks with him. He has impressed the chaplain as a man who is sincere in his eagerness to live life according to the teachings of his faith. 

91The offender's sister spoke of him as a gentle giant who was non confrontational and reserved. He has helped with her children following the death of her first husband and her divorce from her second. He expressed to her his deep regret for getting dragged into the confrontation. I accept that he is a contributing member of the family, but his sister's assessment about what happened, and why, is different from mine.

92A neighbour, whose disabled child the offender has assisted and otherwise shown kindness to, spoke of him as very gentle and kind. She said the offending was completely out of character. A family friend who is in business said the offender was of good repute in his local neighbourhood. Again, however, the remorse the offender has expressed to this referee is couched in the language of justification by reason of self-defence. He described him as a very good person with a soft heart.

93A former girlfriend described him as loyal and respectful and as showing patience, kindness and love to her son. Again, her view of things is affected by her unreserved acceptance that the offender acted in self-defence.

94Other supporters also speak highly of the offender and describe him as gentle. They say that violence or aggression is alien to his character. Again, however, the weight that can be given to these statements is reduced by the firm, and no doubt genuine, belief of the supporters that the offender must have acted in self-defence.

95The New Zealand offending; the reduced weight to which the references are entitled because they proceed on an erroneous view of the facts; and the offender's engagement in the fight of 12th December 2011, taken together make it difficult to accept unreservedly that the offender was a person of good character. There is no doubt he enjoyed a good reputation amongst his family, friends and neighbours. 

96I accept the evidence of the Community Corrections Officer and Dr Nielssen. This suggests that he is unlikely to commit a similar offence in the future. However, the propensity to take the law into his own hands remains a concern. This somewhat reduces what otherwise appears to be his good prospects of rehabilitation.

97I am asked to consider imposing a lesser penalty than I otherwise would, by having regard to the degree to which the administration of justice has been facilitated by the defence within the meaning of s 22A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999 (NSW) (Sentencing Act). 

98When the matter was first mentioned before me on 7th February 2014, Mr Dalton of Senior Counsel informed me that there would be no issue that the offender shot and killed Todorovski. The only issue would be that he did so in self defence. In this regard, I understood that the offender would admit that in shooting Todorovski he intended to inflict really serious personal injury,not necessarily to kill him. The Trial was run on this single issue of self-defence only. Moreover, the defence attempted to further reduce necessary hearing time by seeking agreement on the facts that could be proved by the expert witnesses (see R v Abdallah (No. 3) [2014] NSWSC 267). The learned Crown Prosecutor exercised his right not to agree to this course, even though the ballistic experts reached agreement between themselves. The defence's offer in this regard, if accepted, would have reduced the time taken up by the Trial. The concessions made and accepted were valuable in as much as they eliminated the need for the Crown to identify the offender as the killer and would otherwise have reduced the length and complexity of the trial. Notwithstanding these concessions, the Crown was entitled to attempt to prove the higher level of culpability involved in an intention to kill. However, the degree to which the administration of justice has been facilitated should be recognised and I will take it into account when fixing the sentence.

Principles relevant to sentencing in this case

99I am required to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if I am satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution or punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence (s 61 Sentencing Act). Bad as this offending is, I am satisfied that it does not fall into that very extreme category and I record that it was not suggested by the Crown that it did. I can move on from this consideration.

100Even so, it remains important to bear in mind that life imprisonment is the maximum punishment for the crime of murder: s 19A Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). However, I am authorised by law to impose a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term: s 21 Sentencing Act. Murder is also an offence for which Parliament has fixed a standard non-parole period, in this case, of 20 years (Division 1A Sentencing Act). The maximum penalty and standard non-parole period provide important guideposts for fixing the appropriate penalty.

101The nature of the sentencing task is to fix the appropriate sentence for the offence and the offender, having regard to all relevant facts, matters and circumstances. A sentence must fit the offending having regard to its objective seriousness; that is the offender must be adequately punished for his offending. At the same time, a sentence should not exceed what is proportionate to the crime.

102As is often said, after treason, murder is the most serious offence known to our law. It must always be viewed as an objectively serious crime. But an assessment of all the circumstances informing the objective seriousness of the particular offending must be made as that evaluation is relevant in assessing the degree of moral culpability involved

103It goes without saying, that in any case of murder no penalty other than a long period of imprisonment is appropriate. As I have decided that this is not a very extreme case of murder, I will impose a sentence for a specified period of years, which will also legally require me to fix a non-parole period. The non-parole period is the minimum period of time that justice requires the offender to serve in prison. Unless I find special circumstances, by law the additional term during which the offender may be eligible for parole must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period. It should not be assumed, however, that an offender is automatically released on the first day on which he is eligible for parole. Again by our law, an investigative process is undertaken by the executive branch of government, not the Court, to determine whether a given offender should in fact be released on parole.

104Sentencing is not a purely logical exercise. Its purposes are various, overlapping and competing. They include the protection of society; retribution and denunciation; general and specific deterrence; and reform and rehabilitation: Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465; s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999 (NSW). And increasingly, the recognition of the harm done to victims and the community.

105Mitigating factors must be given appropriate weight. But they must not be allowed ""to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence"" (Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; 87 ALJR 1035 [53]; Veen at 477).

106It is necessary to ""recognise the longstanding obligation of the state to vindicate the dignity of each victim of violence, to express the community's disapproval of that offending, and to afford such protection as can be afforded by the state to the vulnerable against repetition of violence. Further, one of the historical functions of the criminal law has been to discourage victims and their friends and families from resorting to self-help, and the consequent escalation of violent vendettas between members of the community."" (Munda at [54]).

107That the offender, by his violent conduct took a human life, is a consideration ""with a very powerful claim on the sentencing discretion"" (Munda at [55]). It is necessary that violent offending be justly punished to vindicate the human dignity of the victim, to protect the community and to deter the offender and others.

Objective seriousness of the offending

108As murder is an offence which carries a standard non-parole period, I am required to assess the objective seriousness of this offending without reference to matters personal to the offender. My sole regard is the nature of the offending. (Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at 132 [27]). 

109As I have said, the degree of moral culpability in this offending was high. The offender shot his victim with a deadly weapon intending to kill him. There was an element of planning and premeditation involved in the offending. He obtained the gun and took it with him having in mind that he was prepared to use it if things turned violent as they may well, and in fact did.

110The shooting occurred in broad daylight in a residential, suburban street in southern Sydney. It was a holiday time of year and many people were about, including a mother and her child, a citizen looking for a new car, and workmen whose car had broken down. Additionally, many residents were at home. There was a high level of actual public danger involved in this offending.

111Gun crimes have certain prevalence in Sydney, sufficient to cause public concern about the threat they pose to public safety and the maintenance of peace in our society. The use of guns to settle personal differences tears at the fabric of our society. The use of a gun to settle a difference is a serious crime because the offender is putting himself above the law by taking it into his own hands.

112As I have said, murder is always serious. The seriousness of this particular offending is emphasised by the elements of the threat to public safety, defiance of the law and the degree of planning I have identified.

Mitigation

113I have dealt with the mitigating factors in this offending when I dealt with the offender's personal circumstances. There was a degree of provocation falling well short of the legal requirements of the partial defence, which prompted the actual use of the gun.

114The absence of a frank acknowledgment of responsibility, and the failure to disclose the true reasons for his offending, mean the weight that might otherwise be due to the positive factors I have identified is reduced. Without a full acknowledgment of responsibility, one can only prognosticate in a guarded way about what might otherwise be apparently good prospects for rehabilitation and the unlikelihood of future offending. Then there is the propensity to take the law into his own hands, demonstrated by this offending, and the previous New Zealand offending. 

115These considerations lead me to conclude that notwithstanding the positive things that might be said in the offender's favour, he has not established a strong case for leniency.

Comparable sentences

116I was referred to a number of cases said to provide a yardstick against which the sentence to be imposed in this case could be measured. I bear in mind that what is required is consistency of principle, not numerical equivalence: (Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45, 242 CLR 250). Previous decisions may establish a range of sentences actually imposed; they do not establish the correctness of the range: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 1994; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 at [303] - [305].

117The offender laid special emphasis upon R v Fahda [2013] NSWCCA 86. The family of the offender and his victim were feuding. After a chance encounter with the victim, who threatened the offender's life, the offender retrieved the gun he habitually carried and fired twelve shots at the victim who was sitting in his car. Seven bullets found their mark. He intended to kill. The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed a Crown appeal from a 20 year sentence consisting of a non-parole period of 14 years and an additional term of 6 years. The offender was of limited intellectual ability and suffered from mental illness. The mental health issues in part explained the offending. 

118In R v Hamzy [2004] NSWCCA 243, the offender was convicted of a number of offences including murder. The dispute originated from an argument in a nightclub. It was continued on a footpath outside the club and the offender chased the fleeing victim shooting him twice at close range in quick succession. For the murder the offender was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 20 years having a non-parole period of 15 years and an additional term of 6 years. The offender was 19 years of age, had an unfortunate background and benefited from the leniency normally extended to youthful offenders. The sentencing Judge found that the offender shot to kill. A severity appeal was dismissed.

119The offender in R v Linard Shamouil; R v Steven David [2009] NSWSC 24 was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 19 years having a non-parole period of 14 years and 6 months and an additional term of 4 years and 6 months. He received a discount of 15 percent for a late plea. The offender was a 20 year old with a bad criminal record. He shot a 21 year old who had slighted his younger female relative. They met to talk, a scuffle broke out and the offender produced a gun, which after some hesitation he fired 3 times in rapid succession. Each shot found its mark, one fatally. There was a need to accumulate the sentence on sentences for other offending and the principle of totality applied. But for the plea, the sentencing judge would have imposed a sentence of 22 years.

120In R v Nguyen; R v Pham; R v Vu; R v To [2005] NSWCCA 362 the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed a sentence of 25 years with a non-parole period of 20 years imposed on an offender who had shot his victim 3 times in a laneway behind some shops. He was re-sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 20 years with a non-parole period of 16. The Court held that the sentencing discretion miscarried by failing to afford some limited mitigation on account of the offender's youth. 

121In R v Taylor [2003] NSWCCA 194, the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed a severity appeal from a term of imprisonment of 18 years having a non-parole period of 14 years and an additional term of 4 years. The offender was aged 24 when he shot his former partner's new boyfriend out of a jealous desire for revenge. The shooting occurred in his forme partner's home and she was present when it occurred. He had taken the gun with him, but the sentencing Judge found that he had not formed an intention to kill the deceased prior to the confrontation in the home. On the break-up of a previous relationship, the offender had engaged in aggressive behaviour involving the use of a firearm. But he had no other relevant offending.

122As the High Court of Australia has recently emphasised (Barbaro v the Queen; Zirilli v the Queen [2014] HCA 2 at [44] - [49]) sentences imposed in previous cases do not fix the bounds of a permissible range within which a sentence should fall. Sentencing is not a mathematical exercise. It requires consideration of all of the circumstances of the offence and the offender. More than one view may be open but the judge is required to fix a single sentence. 

123From my consideration of these cases, I have not identified any particular guiding principle which governs their outcome and should be applied in the present case. I have borne the decisions in mind and derived some guidance from them. But it is difficult to form the view, notwithstanding superficial factual similarities, that these six cases provide an appropriate yardstick by which to measure the sentence I will impose. The sample is too small, and each case turned upon its own facts. 

Sentence

124I have borne in mind the principles of law I have referred to and all of the facts, matters and circumstances discussed in this judgment. The circumstances of this case engage the obligation of the state to denounce the offender's crime and to deter others from operating outside the law or taking it into their own hands. Vindication of the value of human life is also of central importance.

125Were it not for the facilitation of the course of justice in the conduct of the Trial, I would have imposed a term of imprisonment of 28 years. When one has regard to the range of discount conventionally available for a late plea of guilty, the discount allowed cannot be great, but something in the order of 12 months seems to me appropriate. 

126I am not satisfied that special circumstances have been established justifying a variation of the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the additional term. I have taken into account the offender's subjective circumstances. The evidence before me does not suggest any particular need for supervision in the community if the offender is released on parole over and above that which may be necessary in any case after service of a long term of full-time custody. The sentence I will pass allows for that.

127The offender has been in custody since his arrest in Western Australia on 12th January 2012 and his sentence will commence on that date.

128Tarek Abdallah by its verdict the jury have convicted you of the murder of Neil Todorovski on 4th January 2012. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment having a non-parole period of 20 years commencing on 12th January 2012 and expiring on 11th January 2032, with an additional term of 6 years and 8 months commencing on 12th January 2032 and expiring on 11th ""September 2038. The first date upon which you will be eligible for release on parole is 11th January 2032.

		23 June 2014",2014-06-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704911,Jane Maria Sakovits v R Ronald Rudolf Sakovits v R [2014] NSWCCA 109,"Judgment
1THE COURT: On 4 February 2013 the applicants Jane Maria Sakovits and Ronald Rudolf Sakovits pleaded not guilty to an indictment containing two counts, namely:

(i)that between about 1 April 2001 and about 23 May 2001 at Sydney in the state of New South Wales and elsewhere, conspired with Lynette Cataline Liles and each other to defraud the Commonwealth; and

(ii)that between about 24 May 2001 and about 30 September 2006 at Sydney in the state of New South Wales and elsewhere, did conspire with Lynette Cataline Liles and each other with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to a third person, namely, the Commonwealth.

2The first count alleged an offence contrary to ss. 29D and 86(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (""the Act""), the maximum penalty for which is 20 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units. The second count alleged an offence contrary to s. 134.5(3) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) (""the Code""), the maximum penalty for which is 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $66,000.00. 

3It will be apparent that the Crown alleged a single conspiracy between 1 April 2001 and 30 September 2006. The necessity for two separate counts was brought about by legislative changes which came into effect on 24 May 2001 (see generally Agius v R [2011] NSWCCA 119). For the purposes of sentencing, it was accepted that the maximum penalty in respect of count 1 should be regarded as being 10 years imprisonment (see R v Boughen; R v Cameron [2012] NSWCCA 17 at [3]). 

4Following a trial before Hall J and a jury, the applicants were found guilty of the offences. On 26 April 2013 his Honour sentenced each of the applicants as follows:

(i)in respect of count 1, imprisonment for a period of 6 months commencing on 26 April 2013 and expiring 25 October 2013; 

(ii)in respect of count 2, imprisonment for a period of 5 years commencing on 26 April 2013 and expiring on 25 April 2018, to be released on a recognizance at the expiration of 2 years and 6 months, namely 25 October 2015, upon giving security in the amount of $200.00 on a condition to be of good behaviour for a period of 2 years and 6 months.

5Each of the applicants now seeks leave to appeal against the sentences which were imposed. The two grounds of appeal are as follows:

(i)the learned sentencing judge erred in his determination of the hardship of a custodial sentence to members of the applicants' family, and to the applicants;

(ii)the sentences imposed in respect of count 2 were manifestly excessive.

6As we have set out more fully below, the first ground was based partly upon the effect of a custodial sentence upon Mrs Margaret Potts, the mother of the applicant Jane Sakovits. Following the imposition of sentence, Mrs Potts passed away. However, it was conceded by counsel for the applicants on the hearing of the appeal that Mrs Potts' death was not relevant to the determination of the first ground, and that the question of whether the sentencing judge had erred was to be determined according to the circumstances which prevailed at the time of sentencing.

THE FACTS
7His Honour found the following facts (see R v Sakovits [2013] NSWSC 464 at [18] and following):

""18 During the period of the offending, both offenders were directors of a company, Inform Promotions (""Inform""). Mr Ronald Sakovits was secretary of that company until 30 June 2006, on which date Mrs Sakovits was appointed secretary of the company.

19 Either or both of Mr and Mrs Sakovits authorised the lodgement of the company tax returns for Inform for the financial years ended 30 June 2000 to 30 June 2006.

20 Their involvement in what has been characterised as a tax avoidance scheme during which the offences by them were committed occurred in circumstances in which their accountant, Lynette Liles, introduced them to a scheme which led to them participating in an offshore ""round robin"" arrangement involving a Vanuatu company, International Prestige Promotions (""IPPI""). The arrangement enabled the offenders to evade payment of both company and personal income tax.

21 The company, IPPI, was incorporated by the offenders in Vanuatu at the suggestion and with the assistance of Ms Liles. The company income tax frauds were achieved through the transfer of monies from Australia to Vanuatu disguised as legitimate payments by Inform for the cost of services such as 'marketing and promotions' provided by IPPI.

22 The offenders created or were party to the creation of false invoices purportedly raised by IPPI to give the appearance of the payments being for legitimate business expenses. The offenders and Liles falsely recorded the payments from Inform to IPPI in Inform's accounts as business expenses. Such false expenses in turn flowed through to the relevant company income tax returns, thereby reducing the company's taxable income declared to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and the overall amount of company tax paid. Due to the ATO's system of self-assessment, the tax returns were processed automatically, resulting in assessments being issued based on the tax returns depriving the ATO of the correct amount of tax.

23 The offenders' participation in the arrangement caused a loss to the taxation revenue in the following respects:

(1) unpaid company tax on income fraudulently reduced by claims for the deduction from assessable income of fictitious business expenses; and

(2) unpaid personal tax through the fraudulent failure to declare as assessable income the monies received by the scheme participants in consequence of the international round robins (the receipts being dividends and hence part of their assessable incomes).

24 The company tax shortfall resulting from the false claims for Inform over the years 2000-2006 was $530,789.

25 The amounts falsely claimed as 'marketing and promotion' and other expenses in respect of the individual financial years may be summarised as follows:

(i) The financial year ended 30 June 2000, total expenses claimed amounted to $216,727, resulting in a tax shortfall of approximately $101,862.

(ii) In respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2001, total expenses falsely claimed was $231,538, resulting in a tax shortfall of approximately $46,313.

(iii) In respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2002, expenses falsely claimed was $181,766, together with 'agency fees' of $16,000 resulting in a tax shortfall of approximately $59,302.

(iv) In respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2003, expenses incorrectly claimed was $208,938.18, and 'agency fees' of $89,624 resulting in a tax shortfall of approximately $89,569.

(v) In respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2004, two groups of expenses were falsely claimed, the first amounted to $216,783.50, and the second, $257,534.80 resulting in a tax shortfall of approximately $112,475.

(vi) In respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2005, expenses falsely amounted to claim $268,582, and a further $94,384 resulting in a tax shortfall of approximately $89,448.

(vii) In respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2006, expenses falsely claimed as 'rent' was $109,150, and 'agency fees' of $106,071 resulting in a tax shortfall of approximately $31,821.

26 The personal income tax shortfall resulting from Jane Sakovits' failure to declare her true assessable income for the seven financial years in question was $326,432.

27 The personal income tax shortfall resulting from Ronald Sakovits' failure to declare his true assessable income for the seven financial years in question was approximately $320,672.

28 The total company and personal income tax shortfall is approximately $1,177,893.""

Ground 1 - The learned sentencing judge erred in his determination of the hardship of a custodial sentence to members of the applicants' family and to the applicants
The evidence 
8Evidence was given in the sentence proceedings by the applicants' daughter-in-law, Simone Sakovits, in relation to Mrs Potts' health. Ms Sakovits, who was a registered nurse with experience in aged and palliative care, told the court (commencing at T4 L45) that Mrs Potts:

(i)was 85 years old;

(ii)had been admitted to hospital about one week previously, having lived independently in her own home up until that time; 

(iii)suffered from an obstructive pulmonary disease which affected her breathing and which had necessitated the installation of a continuous oxygen supply at her home;

(iv)had advanced osteoporosis which had resulted in her sustaining two crushed vertebrae for which she had been prescribed oral morphine to control her pain levels;

(v)had been diagnosed with pneumonia; and

(vi)had been found to have a mass in her right lung, further investigation of which could not be undertaken due to her inability to be administered the anaesthetic necessary to conduct a biopsy. 

9Ms Sakovits described Mrs Potts' condition as one of ""severe frailty"". She explained that prior to her admission to hospital, the applicants had provided Mrs Potts with assistance on 4 days of each week, with a registered nurse doing so on the remaining 3 days. She said that she thought it unlikely that Mrs Potts would be able to return home once she was discharged from hospital and that as a consequence, she was about to commence enquiries as to the availability of care facilities. Ms Sakovits explained that there were no family members other than the applicants who could assist her in that regard. 

10In terms of the health of the applicants, two reports of Dr Lachlan Soper were tendered before his Honour. In relation to the applicant Ronald Sakovits, Dr Soper reported (inter alia):

""The stress of this situation over a number of years has resulted in him having clinical stress, anxiety and depression. In May 2011 I referred him to see Dr Asha Yourell, clinical psychologist.

This stress may have contributed to his heart attack which he had on 18 April 2010, for which he was later stented in November 2010...He has left rotator cuff tears for which Dr Graeme McDonald has recommended he undertake shoulder surgery as soon as his trial is finished.""

11Dr Soper then set out the medications which had been prescribed for the applicant, before noting that his past medical history included:

(i)hypertension;
(ii)peripheral neuropathy;
(iii)hypercholesterolemia;
(iv)restless leg syndrome;
(v)urinary urgency;
(vi)osteoarthritis; 
(vii)heart attack;
(viii)exostoses.

12In relation to the applicant Jane Sakovits, Dr Soper reported (inter alia): 

""Our first appointment was because she was sent to me by her solicitor because of anxiety, headaches, insomnia and depression. I referred her to Dr Kathy Rooney, psychologist that day and put her on Efexor XR antidepressant on our follow up consult in October 2008. I have seen her about 10 times a year since that point and a lot of the focus has been around her anxiety and stress. We have needed to double her Efexor XR dose to 150mg and have failed to be able to successfully reduce the dose"". 

13Dr Soper then set out the medications which had been prescribed for the applicant, before noting that her past medical history included: 

(i)depression and anxiety (which he noted was ""probably off and on for most of her life"");
(ii)hypercholesterolemia;
(iii)hyperlipidaemia;
(iv)obstructive sleep apnoea;
(v)diabetes;
(vi)urinary frequency;
(vii)periodontitis.

The findings of the sentencing judge
14In terms of the health of Mrs Potts, and the effect upon her of any custodial sentence imposed upon the applicants, his Honour concluded (at [62]): 

""I turn to another personal circumstance which concerns the poor health of Mrs Sakovits' mother. The evidence called at the sentence hearing established that Mrs Sakovits' mother is elderly and in a very ill condition. Section 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act, entitles and requires that I am to bring into account family consequences subject to one condition. The circumstances may not be given substantial weight in the sentencing determination unless they can be characterised as ""exceptional"": R v Togias [2001] NSWCCA 522 at [9]-[17]; R v Hinton [2002] NSWCCA 405; 134 A Crim R 286 at [31]; R v Agius [2012] NSWSC 978 at [87]. It appears likely that Mrs Sakovits' mother will not return home and will be admitted to an appropriate care institution. Whilst the impact, in particular, upon Mrs Sakovits of her mother's condition is understandably a matter of great and serious concern, on the construction which the relevant case law authorities have placed upon the provisions of s 16A(2)(p), the evidence does not enable me to make a finding that the circumstances can be characterised as ""exceptional"" for the purposes of applying that provision.""

15As to the age and health of each of the applicants, his Honour made specific reference (at [49]) to the reports of Dr Soper before concluding (at [51]-[53]):

""51 It is apparent that both offenders will require ongoing medical attendances and supervision and monitoring in relation to a number of medical issues and the prescription of required medications.

52 It is accepted that an offender's psychological and medical health and age may increase the hardship of a sentence and may therefore be taken into account in deciding what sentence is appropriate, but that consideration is limited by the necessity of maintaining proper standards of punishment: R v Hart [1999] NSWCCA 204 per Sperling J at [8].

53 Whilst a sentencing judge is entitled, in arriving at the appropriate penalty, to take into account an offender's age, health, generally speaking, those factors of themselves do not mean that a term of imprisonment should not be imposed if it is otherwise warranted. They are factors that may, instead, affect the length of a custodial sentence. In the present proceedings, I consider that the evidence as to the age and states of health of each of Mr and Mrs Sakovits are matters that must be taken into account in the sentence determinations in accordance with the provisions of s 16A(2)(m).""

The submissions of the applicants
16Counsel for the applicants accepted that before the sentencing judge could take into account, under s. 16A(2)(p) of the Act, the probable effect upon Mrs Potts of custodial sentences imposed upon the applicants, it was necessary to establish that such effect was exceptional (see R v Zerafa [2013] NSWCCA 222). He submitted that in concluding that the probable effect in the present case was not exceptional, the sentencing judge had erred. 

17Counsel submitted that the effect of the applicants' incarceration upon Mrs Potts went beyond that which was typical. It was submitted that this was because the applicants were, in effect, Mrs Potts' primary carers and that the inevitable result of their incarceration was that Mrs Potts was deprived of their care, as well as their companionship, at a time in her life when she was seriously ill and facing the prospect of transition from hospital into some other care facility. 

18To the extent that this ground asserted an error on the part of the sentencing judge in his determination of the hardship of a custodial sentence upon the applicants themselves, counsel emphasised that the applicants had been married for more than 40 years and now found themselves separated from each other. He submitted that whilst separation from other family members may be an inevitable consequence of a person's incarceration, that situation was to be distinguished from the present because the applicants had been separated from one another. In this regard, counsel sought to draw an analogy between the position of the applicants, and that of a foreign national incarcerated in this country following sentence. He further submitted that the impact of the sentence upon the applicant Jane Sakovits was rendered even greater because she had been separated from an elderly parent. 

The submissions of the Crown
19The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge was obviously mindful of the principles governing the operation of s. 16A(2)(p), had properly applied them, and had correctly concluded that the effect of the applicants' incarceration upon Mrs Potts was not exceptional. To the extent that the applicants would not be able to care for Mrs Potts if incarcerated, it was submitted that other family members had apparently been available to administer care in the event that the need to do so arose. 

20As to the separation of the applicants from each other, the Crown firstly pointed out that no such submission had been made to the sentencing judge. The Crown further submitted that although the applicants were not able to contact each other, they were nevertheless able to receive visits from other family members and acquaintances. In these circumstances, the Crown submitted that a clear distinction was to be drawn between the position of the applicants and that of a foreign national serving a sentence of imprisonment in Australia. The Crown further submitted that even if such an analogy was drawn, the fact of separation would be a circumstance deserving of limited weight (see R v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231). 

Determination 
21Section 16A(2)(p) of the Act provides as follows:
Matters to which court to have regard when passing sentence 
(1) In determining the sentence to be passed, or the order to be made, in respect of any person for a federal offence, a court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence. 

(2) In addition to any other matters, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court: 

...

(p) the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person's family or dependants. 


22In Zerafa (supra) Hoeben CJ at CL and Latham J concluded that the ""probable effect"" to which reference is made in s.16A(2)(p) must be exceptional. In particular their Honours said (at [93]):

""93 In relation to s16A(2)(p) it is not appropriate for this Court to overrule or depart from cases such as Togias and Hinton. As the respondent accepted, the ""exceptional hardship"" approach has been followed in Queensland and Victoria, and to a limited extent in South Australia and Western Australia. It is only the ACT which has refused to follow that line of authority. As Spigelman CJ acknowledged in Togias:

""17 If there is to be any change in this position, and that was not put in this case even on a formal basis, only the High Court can effect it.""


23In our view, for a number of reasons, the sentencing judge's conclusion that the probable effect of the applicants' incarceration on Mrs Potts was not exceptional was correct. 

24Firstly, on the evidence before his Honour it was virtually inevitable that Mrs Potts would no longer be able to live independently, and would be transferred from hospital to some other facility within which she would be provided with appropriate care. That would have rendered it unnecessary for the applicants to administer any day to day care. To the extent that enquiries had to be undertaken about the availability of such facility, they were able to be undertaken by Ms Sakovits without the need for assistance from the applicants.

25Secondly, even if Mrs Potts had been able to return home from hospital (which, on the evidence, was most unlikely) the care which had been provided by the applicants was limited in any event. Moreover, there was at least one other family member, namely Ms Sakovits, who would seemingly have been available to provide care in lieu of the applicants, and who was exceptionally well qualified to do so. All of these circumstances tended wholly against the proposition that the effect upon Mrs Potts of the applicants' incarceration was exceptional (as to which see Eken v R [2007] NSWCCA 320 at [52] per Hidden J (Handley AJA and Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) agreeing); Pham v R [2009] NSWCCA 25; (2009) 193 A Crim R 190 at [49]-[50] per Latham J (Giles JA and Mathews AJA agreeing); R v Bateson [2011] NSWSC 643 at [43] per Buddin J).

26Thirdly, as a general proposition, the fact that the parents of members of the prison population may be ill or disabled is not uncommon (see Pham (supra) at [51] per Latham J). 

27To the extent that Ground 1 relied upon the hardship to the applicants resulting from their own separation, s. 16A(2)(p) had no application. Moreover, no such submission was put to the sentencing judge by senior counsel then appearing for the applicants. Generally speaking, a party will be bound by counsel's conduct of proceedings at first instance (see generally Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; (2012) 223 A Crim R 460 at [79]-[80] per Johnson J (McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreeing); Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194 per Johnson J (at [36]) (McClellan CJ at CL and Hammerschlag J agreeing). 

28In any event, separation of two co-offenders who happen to be married is an unavoidable consequence of incarceration. Even if a submission based upon that circumstance had been put to the sentencing judge, it would have been deserving of little weight. 

29For all of these reasons, his Honour's conclusion that the effect of the applicants' incarceration upon Mrs Potts was not exceptional was correct and no appealable error has been demonstrated. It follows that ground 1 is not made out.

Ground 2 - The sentences imposed in respect of count 2 in each case were manifestly excessive.
The submissions of the applicants 
30In support of this ground counsel for the applicants relied firstly upon sentences imposed in other cases of similar offending including, in particular R v Mascall (unreported 11 May 2012 District Court of NSW). He submitted that the proper application of sentencing principles demanded that the sentences imposed ""accord with legitimate community expectations whilst at the same time lean towards mercy"". 

31In written submissions it was put on behalf of the applicants that the sentences were manifestly excessive in light of the ""particular subjective circumstances of the appellants"". Those subjective circumstances were said to include:

(i)the age of the applicants;

(ii)the fact that they were each in need of ongoing medical attention; and

(iii)the deprivation of contact with each other.

32In oral argument, counsel for the applicants submitted that there were ""unique features"" in the present case, although in doing so he again concentrated upon the hardship arising from the applicants' separation from each other. 

The submissions of the Crown
33The Crown submitted that there were features which differentiated the present case from those relied upon by the applicants for comparative purposes, and that reference to those cases did nothing other than confirm that the sentences imposed upon the applicants were within the proper range of sentencing discretion. 

34The Crown further submitted that all of the relevant subjective features had been taken into account by the sentencing judge and that when regard was had to the seriousness of the offending, the applicants had failed to demonstrate that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. 

Determination 
35In order to establish that the sentences were manifestly excessive, the applicants must establish that such sentences were unreasonable or plainly unjust (see Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357; [2005] HCA 25 at 370-371; [25]). 

36It is not necessary, for the purposes of determining this ground, to canvass the facts and circumstances of the sentences imposed in the other cases to which the Court was referred. It is sufficient for present purposes to state that such cases are distinguishable on various bases. They do not, in our view, provide any support for the proposition that the sentences imposed upon the applicants are manifestly excessive. 

37The sentencing judge gave careful and comprehensive consideration to every aspect of the subjective case of each applicant, including: 

(i)their otherwise unblemished character;
(ii)their mental and physical health;
(iii)their age; and 
(iv)the delay in prosecuting the matter which, he concluded, would have caused extreme anguish to each of the applicants, particularly given their respective states of health.

38At the same time, his Honour properly pointed out (at [52]) that it was necessary to balance particular subjective circumstances, such as the applicants' mental health, against the necessity to maintain a proper standard of punishment (see R v Hart [1999] NSWCCA 240 at [8] per Sperling J, Meagher JA and Simpson J agreeing). 

39The necessity to maintain a proper standard of punishment obviously required his Honour to take into account the circumstances of the offending. The Crown submitted to the sentencing judge that the offending was ""not particularly complicated"". That was correct, in the sense that at its most fundamental level the conspiracy involved:

(i) the transmission of money from Australia to Vanuatu;

(ii)the deduction of certain amounts and their transmission to the promoter of the scheme; and 

(iii)the return of the balance of the monies to the applicants. 

40However as evidenced by the following, the Crown's labelling of the offending in that way ran the risk of understating its true seriousness. 

41Firstly, the conspiracy required the incorporation of IPPI in Vanuatu.

42Secondly, it required the opening of a bank account in Vanuatu into which the payments could be made. As his Honour pointed out (at [34]) the use of Vanuatu, a well known tax haven, as the place for IPPI's incorporation was a factor which assisted the applicants in concealing their involvement in the offending. 
43Thirdly, this was not a case in which a single bank account was utilised for the purpose of putting the conspiracy into effect. Leaving aside the accounts in Australia which were used to facilitate the return of the money, diagrammatic spreadsheets tendered by the Crown before the sentencing judge established that in 2001, 2002 and 2004 respectively, money transferred to IPPI in Vanuatu was subsequently directed to:

(i)an account in the United States, operated in the name of Interglobal Waste Management Inc., which was under the control of one or both of the applicants;

(ii)another account in the United States, operated in the name FBO Material Technologies Inc., which was similarly under the control of one or both of the applicants; and

(iii)the purchase, in Chile, of items connected with the business of the applicant Ronald Sakovits. 

44Fourthly, the money which was directed from the account of IPPL in Vanuatu back to the applicants in Australia was not directed to a single account. Amounts were variously deposited into a personal account and a trust account, and additional amounts were accessed by cash withdrawals made through Automatic Teller Machines. The only available conclusion is that this method of distribution, along with the direction of other amounts to accounts and entities overseas, was adopted by the applicants in an effort to conceal their involvement in the conspiracy.

45Fifthly, the implementation and conduct of the conspiracy required the creation of invoices which falsely represented that expenses had been incurred by Inform Promotions when this was in fact not the case. These documents were obviously created in an attempt to ascribe some air of legitimacy to the transfers which were made to IPPL. 

46Sixthly, the creation of those invoices gave rise to the necessity to construct the accounts of Inform Promotions in a manner which was correspondingly false and misleading. 

47Seventhly, over the period of the conspiracy, the applicants repeatedly lodged personal taxation returns which were false, and caused company taxation returns to be lodged which were similarly false. 

48When viewed in this way, the conspiracy in which the applicants engaged, whilst not particularly complicated in one sense, was (as his Honour correctly found at [32]) nevertheless sophisticated. His His HIts implementation necessarily involved a degree of planning, and its continuation involved a multiplicity of acts which were obviously designed to ensure, as far as possible, that the involvement of the applicants would not be detected. 

49There were other matters which were also relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence. Neither applicant demonstrated any contrition. His Honour found (at [34]) that they were motivated by self interest. The conspiracy in which they engaged extended over a period of more than five years and resulted in a significant loss to the revenue. The extent of that loss was an obviously significant factor (see R v Hawkins (1989) 45 A Crim R 430 at 435 per Lee J, Newman J and Loveday J agreeing). His Honour took all of these factors into account (at [32]) having correctly observed (at [29]) that general deterrence assumed particular significance (see for example Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Gregory [2011] VSCA 145; (2011) 211 A Crim R 147 at [53] per the Court (Warren CJ, Redlich JA and Ross AJA). 

50On any view, the applicants' offending warranted condign punishment. In Hili v R; Jones v R (2010) 242 CLR 520; [2010] HCA 45 the majority of the High Court (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) made the following relevant observations (at [63]):

""The applicants' offending was sustained for a long time. It was planned, deliberate and deceitful requiring for its implementation the telling of many lies. The applicants acted out of personal greed. The amount of tax evaded was not small. Detection of offending of this kind is not easy. Serious tax fraud which this was, is offending that affects the whole community. As was pointed out in Ruha [2010] QCA 10, the sentences imposed had to have both a deterrent and punitive effect, and those effects had to be reflected in the head sentences and the recognizance release orders that were made"".

51Those observations are directly apposite to the present case. 

52In our view, the sentences imposed upon each of the applicants were entirely appropriate. 

53It follows that ground 2 is not made out.

ORDERS
54The Court makes the following orders in each case: 

(1)Leave to appeal is granted;
(2)The appeal is dismissed.

2704913,R v Daniel [2014] NSWSC 1968,"ex tempore Judgment


	
	This is an application for bail by Darren Daniel. The applicant faces a number of charges said to have been committed between 21 February 2013 and 30 April 2013. It is said that the applicant engaged in the supply of a particular prohibited drug, which I infer is in the nature of an amphetamine. The allegation is that to a degree he was something of a street-level dealer with regard to very small quantities but, eventually, things progressed to the stage where he allegedly, on four occasions, supplied a large commercial quantity of that drug, indeed substantially above what is the large commercial quantity. The maximum penalty, therefore, is imprisonment for life, with a standard non-parole period of fifteen years.
	
	
	It is alleged that, on 27 February 2013, the applicant supplied 130 grams of the drug in the form of 500 tablets in return for $12,500. On 8 March 2013 it is alleged he supplied 137 grams of the same drug in return for $12,500 in cash.
	
	
	The Crown case is that a great deal of the criminal allegations were electronically recorded by way of video surveillance, electronic recordings of things said by people and, indeed, SMS messages sent to and by the applicant.
	
	
	It is alleged that on arrest the applicant had $1100 cash in his possession, a number of street deals in his possession, plastic bags suggestive of dealing, and also cannabis leaf was found in a motor vehicle.
	
	
	I can proceed on the basis (and his solicitor has not sought to persuade me otherwise) that the Crown case is very strong.
	
	
	For the purposes of s 17(3)(b), it can be said that the seriousness of the offences derives from the maximum penalty to which I have referred, which speaks for itself.
	
	
	Furthermore, if the applicant is convicted, it is inevitable that he will spend many years in gaol.
	
	
	Before I go further, I should say that s 74 of the Bail Act 2013 applies to this application, the applicant having been refused bail by Beech-Jones J in September last year.
	
	
	Without delving into the intricacies of s 74 of the new Act, the parties have been content for me to approach it on the basis that “information before the court” has changed: in particular, the presumption that existed against the applicant being granted bail, which no longer exists. Secondly, his solicitor Ms Neil has submitted that that effluxion of time since September last year constitutes a “change in circumstance”. As I say, without engaging in a detailed exercise of statutory interpretation, I am prepared to approach the matter on the basis that a prerequisite in s 74 has been made out.
	
	
	The applicant was born in September 1979. Accordingly, unless I am mistaken, he is now about thirty-four years of age. His criminal record started when he was approximately seventeen years of age. In truth, it is quite short, although it is not something to be proud of. It is not a matter causing great concern on this application. It has the flavour that he is a person who has suffered from a problem with prohibited drugs.
	
	
	Section 17 of the Act calls upon me to consider whether there is an unacceptable risk of one of four matters. Without listing them, suffice to say I consider there is an unacceptable risk that the applicant will fail to appear; to express it bluntly, that he would be the subject to a powerful motivation to abscond if granted bail. The question is whether that unacceptable risk can be mitigated by the imposition of strict bail conditions.
	
	
	Ms Neil has informed me today that it is proposed he would live with his mother’s cousin at an address at Queanbeyan, and that that gentleman has undertaken to report the applicant if he were to breach bail. She has explained that, before his incarceration, the applicant was homeless, living in a motor vehicle, his psychological state was very poor and was untreated – in fact, he was a drug addict, and it was out of control.
	
	
	Over the past fourteen months, he has been treated in custody by psychiatrists. He has been medicated with anti-depressants. His mother has noted he has changed. He has been able to take a balanced perspective on things and is looking to the future.
	
	
	The applicant was at one stage a plasterer, and Ms Neil’s instructions are he would have good prospects of employment, if released. She made it clear that, if I thought it appropriate, he would be content to contact immediately drug and alcohol services and obtain assistance from them. It is also her case that, as far as he is concerned, he is no longer a drug addict.
	
	
	Ms Neil has put forward a detailed proposal that includes living at an address in Queanbeyan, reporting to the police, abstaining from drugs and alcohol, and having nothing to do with the co-defendants. It also includes the fact that his mother, who has provided an impressive letter which became Exhibit 1, would deposit and agree to forfeit the considerable sum of $20,000.
	
	
	Considering the factors in s 17(3), I think that it can be said generally that the applicant’s background, including his criminality history and proposed community ties, is favourable. It can also be said the applicant does not have a history of violence, and has not previously committed a serious offence on bail. Nor does he have a pattern of non-compliance with court orders.
	
	
	It is highly regrettable this man has spent a year in custody and it seems he will spend another year, until 15 March next year, until the matter is resolved.
	
	
	Having said that, it cannot be denied that this offence is extremely serious.
	
	
	On the limited material before me, I proceed on the basis the Crown case is extremely strong and, as I said, a lengthy custodial sentence could be imposed after March 2015. With regard to any non-parole period, it seems to me that its length is inevitable, if this man is convicted.
	
	
	In short, in light of the strength of the Crown case; the inevitability of custody if convicted; the fact that I consider this man is suffering from an unresolved drug problem; and given there is a strong motivation for the applicant not to attend court if granted bail, to my mind the unacceptable risk of the applicant failing to appear cannot be mitigated by the imposition of bail conditions. Bail must therefore be refused.

		12 September 2016",2014-06-22 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704917,Westpac Banking Corporation v Diagne [2014] NSWSC 822,"Judgment

Introduction

1In these proceedings, the plaintiff, Westpac Banking Corporation, as successor in law to St.George Bank Ltd, seeks to recover from the first defendant, Mr Diagne, and the second defendant, Mrs Diagne, an amount of $3,276,039.66 plus interest from 31 May 2014 said to be owing in respect of various loans advanced to Mr and Mrs Diagne or guaranteed by them during the period from October 2000 to November 2006 and to enforce two mortgages given as security in respect of those loans. In this judgment, I will refer to Westpac and St.George interchangeably as ""the Bank"".

2Various facilities were provided by the Bank and the terms of those facilities were amended from time to time. The principal facilities were a loan obtained by Mr and Mrs Diagne in 1999 for the amount of $463,000 to acquire their home in South Coogee and a Commercial Loan Facility provided to Mr and Mrs Diagne on 17 August 2005 for $670,000 to enable them to buy a property in Enmore from which they proposed to operate a restaurant through a company known as Afrilanka Pty Ltd (Afrilanka). Both loans were secured by registered first mortgages over the relevant properties.

3There is no dispute that the moneys were advanced and have not been repaid. Nor is there any dispute concerning the terms on which the loans were made. However, in a Commercial List Cross Claim Statement filed on 21 October 2013, Mr and Mrs Diagne contend that the Bank made misrepresentations or engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct which caused them loss. They plead an alternative claim based on estoppel. They also make a claim under the Contracts Review Act 1980 (NSW) and claim that the Bank was negligent in advancing money to them and that it breached an implied warranty of fitness for purpose in reducing an overdraft that had been made available to Afrilanka. Finally, Mrs Diagne makes a claim based on the principles stated by the High Court in Yerkey v Jones [1939] HCA 3; (1939) 63 CLR 649. In their Summons, Mr and Mrs Diagne sought orders that the Bank's mortgages be set aside, a declaration that the amount claimed by the Bank is not payable and damages. However, it is apparent from correspondence between the parties' solicitors that Mr and Mrs Diagne no longer press for an order that the mortgage over the South Coogee property be set aside and, during the course of final submissions, Mr Diagne, who by that time represented himself and for the most part spoke for his wife, conceded that he and his wife owed the Bank money. The relief they sought was that they be put back in the position they were in before they bought the Enmore property.

4Mr and Mrs Diagne came to represent themselves following an application on the first day of the hearing by their counsel and solicitors that they be given leave to withdraw. I gave that leave. Mr and Mrs Diagne then sought an adjournment in order to obtain other legal representation. I refused that application. The proceedings were originally set down for hearing commencing on 14 April 2014. That hearing date had to be vacated because of the late service of Mr and Mrs Diagne's evidence. I was not satisfied that Mr and Mrs Diagne would be able to obtain alternative legal representation and, consequently, was not satisfied that there would be any utility in granting an adjournment. As a result, Mr and Mrs Diagne represented themselves throughout the hearing. They did, however, have the benefit of affidavits and a detailed Commercial List Cross Claim Statement that had been drafted by their previous legal advisers.

5Also on the first day of the hearing, the plaintiff made an application to amend its response to the Commercial List Cross Claim Statement to raise limitation defences. The evidence was that the Bank had given notice of the proposed amendments on 21 March 2014 at a time when Mr and Mrs Diagne were still legally represented. The limitation defences do not raise any new factual issues. In those circumstances, I allowed the amendments. However, as will become apparent, it has not been necessary to consider the defences based on the expiration of limitation periods.

Background facts

6Mr Diagne was born in Senegal in 1949. After completing high school, he worked in the clothing industry in Dakar. He operated with friends his own small business in that industry for a period of time. He migrated to Australia in 1979. For a time, he worked as a labourer and also as a kitchen hand and in other capacities in various restaurants in Sydney, with the intention of gaining experience so that he could eventually establish his own business. In the mid-1980s, he operated a small business known as ""Order-A-Meal"" from a house he rented. It is apparent that Mr Diagne worked very hard and was able to save a significant sum of money. He established his first restaurant in Oxford Street near Taylor Square, which was known as ""Afrilanka"". In or around 1990, he opened up a restaurant in King Street, Newtown known as ""Kilimanjaro"", which was very successful. 

7Mr Diagne married his wife in Senegal in 1994. 

8On 31 August 1995, Mr and Mrs Diagne incorporated Afrilanka. They were the company's sole directors and shareholders. That company took over the business of operating the restaurant. It paid Mr and Mrs Diagne salaries. The evidence is that, in the period 2003 to 2005, Mr and Mrs Diagne each earned between $90,000 and $100,000 and that the company itself was profitable.

9In or about May 1999, Mr and Mrs Diagne bought their home in South Coogee. As I have said, for that purpose, they entered into a home loan agreement with St.George Bank, which was termed a Portfolio Loan Facility. On 16 October 2000, they increased their borrowings to $702,000 under that facility. The loan was secured by a registered first mortgage over the property.

10On 19 November 2001, Mr and Mrs Diagne's Portfolio Loan Facility was varied to increase the credit limit from $702,000 to $1,050,000.

11In January 2005, Mr Diagne approached his bank manager, Ms Gail Merry, about obtaining a loan to buy a property in or around Enmore to open a second restaurant, with the intention eventually of selling Kilimanjaro. As a result, the limit of Mr and Mrs Diagne's Portfolio Loan Facility was increased to $1,275,000 in order to provide funds to pay the deposit in respect of the proposed purchase.

12On or about 25 May 2005, Mr and Mrs Diagne bought the property at Enmore. The purchase price was $1,050,500. It was their intention at the time to open an African restaurant at the property, which became known as ""Lat-Dior African Eatery"". Mr Diagne paid a deposit of $95,500 using funds drawn from the Portfolio Loan Facility.

13Mr Diagne's evidence is that he had previously arranged to borrow $668,500 from Citibank or to borrow $716,250 from Colonial First State to assist with payment of the purchase price of the Enmore property. Some time after contracts had been exchanged, Ms Merry introduced Mr Diagne to Mr Gary Culmer who, at the time, was a relationship manager in the corporate and business banking division of the Bank to discuss the possibility of borrowing the money from the Bank. He and Mr Diagne had numerous conversations concerning a proposed loan. Mr Diagne says that Mr Culmer was very keen to get his business. During their first conversation, Mr Diagne says that Mr Culmer said:

We will help you get ahead. We want your business. We will help you. We will not let you go. I have driven past your restaurant many times. The African map on the mural is very attractive and educative. You have been in business for a long time. We want to support you.

14Mr Culmer visited the Enmore premises on at least one occasion before settlement. During the visit, Mr Diagne says that he expressed concern about the size of the downstairs area. He says that he said to Mr Culmer that the restaurant needed to be bigger to be viable and that it would be necessary to have tables upstairs. According to Mr Diagne, the conversation continued:

MD: This is what I'm planning to do, to incorporate upstairs and downstairs so that there is a bigger seating capacity. If we open upstairs, we could more than double the seating capacity, to around 50 people.

GC: Yes Mohamed, I can see what is needed. We will help you to increase the seating capacity. But let's do it step by step and get your loan approved and then we can get another loan approved for upstairs. Let's get the ball rolling. Let me get your documents ready for settlement. Then we can increase the amount borrowed.

Mr Culmer denies the conversation. He says he recalls that, on one occasion, Mr Diagne took him upstairs where there were mattresses. He says that Mr Diagne said to him words to the effect of ""workers sleep here"". According to him, that is the only conversation they had regarding the upstairs area.

15On 28 July 2005, Mr Culmer wrote to Mr Diagne in which he said:

I refer to our telephone conversation of yesterday and confirm that the Bank would consider a loan application for the following:

● A Variable Rate or Fixed Rate loan of $668,000 (70% of $955,000) with principal and interest payments over 15 years. The first year to be interest only payments with the residual debt to clear within the remaining 14 year term.

● A variable rate interest only loan of $95,500 over 3 months to enable the payment of the GST component of the commercial property purchase. This loan is to be cleared in full upon the receipt of your GST refund. A letter from your account [sic] is to be provided to verify/confirm that you are entitled to the GST refund and that you have no outstanding taxation liabilities.

● A variable rate principal and interest loan of $103,000 over 12 months.

The letter went on to say that the loan would need to be secured by a first mortgage and guarantees. It also set out some additional information that Mr Culmer required in order ""to proceed with the application"". Mr Culmer prepared a credit application in support of that loan on 29 July 2005. However, the application was not proceeded with, apparently because Mr Diagne thought that it was inferior to the offer that he had already received from Colonial First State.

16One of the documents sought by Mr Culmer was a statement of assets and liabilities. It appears that Mr Culmer faxed the relevant form to Mr Diagne on 28 July 2005 and that Mr Diagne completed it on that day. Mr Diagne says that he did so under pressure from Mr Culmer. He also says that Mr Culmer told him to state in the form that the value of the property at South Coogee was $2 million, since that would facilitate the approval. Mr Diagne says he followed Mr Culmer's advice, although he thought that the amount was too high. This evidence is disputed by the Bank. Nothing turns on the resolution of that dispute. However, it seems likely that Mr Culmer was in a hurry to obtain the statement for the credit application he prepared the following day. On the other hand, for reasons I explain in the next paragraph, I do not accept that Mr Culmer told Mr Diagne what figures to include in the form.

17It appears that there were further discussions between Mr Culmer and Mr Diagne concerning the facilities the Bank was willing to provide and, on 10 August 2005, Mr Culmer prepared a further credit application. That application included the following commentary:

The clients have exchanged contracts on the property and the settlement is schedule [sic] for 3/8/2005. When the clients exchanged the contracts they thought that they would be able to borrower [sic] against the purchase price including GST however they have now realised that this is not the case. To fund the purchase they engaged a broker who has obtained an [sic] Letter of Offer from Citibank for a 5 year interest only commercial loan to purchase the commercial property. Additionally, Citibank will provide resi finance against the house property on the basis of an extension rate of 80%. Mr Diagne believes that, based on current local sales, that the house would value at M$2 however if it only valued the same as our valuation of M$1.7 an extra $85k would be released to him. This extra resi money of at least $85k would enable the clients to pay the GST. If the property valued at M$1.8 then an extra $165k would be released.

St George is therefore facing the loss of the existing M$1.275 Portfolio Loan together with the commercial facilities sought. ...

Mr Culmer's references to lower valuations and the consequences of those valuations for the application make no sense if he really had told Mr Diagne to include a figure of $2 million for the value of the South Coogee property in his statement of assets and liabilities; and, in my opinion, Mr Diagne's evidence on this matter cannot be accepted.

18The credit application was considered shortly after it was submitted and it appears that Mr Culmer rang Mr Diagne to tell him the result on 12 August 2005, since, on that day, Mr Diagne faxed Mr Culmer a note in which he said:

Following our telephone conversation of today, can you please formally put your offer to me in writing and fax it to me.

19Mr Culmer responded to that request on the same day setting out the terms of a facility offer that was said to supersede the Bank's earlier offer. The revised offer was for the following facilities:

Commercial Loan - Fixed       $670,000

Commercial Loan - Variable     $95,000

Commercial Overdraft              $45,000

At that stage, it was contemplated that the borrowers would be Mr and Mrs Diagne and that the loans would be guaranteed by Afrilanka. The commercial loan for $95,000 was to pay the GST on the purchase of the Enmore property, which would eventually be refunded and paid to the Bank in discharge of the loan.

20Mr and Mrs Diagne signed the acceptance at the end of that offer on 17 August 2005. The acceptance stated that, by signing the document, Mr and Mrs Diagne accepted the facilities on the terms set out in the offer. The acceptance also contained the following paragraph:

We recommend that you get independent legal and financial advice before entering into this facility agreement.

Mr Culmer witnessed both their signatures.

21At the same time, Mr and Mrs Diagne accepted an offer to increase the limit on their Portfolio Loan Facility from $1,275,000 to $1,360,000. They also signed declarations that they had received independent legal advice regarding the loan and security documents relating to the Enmore property. Their signatures on those declarations were witnessed by Mr Richard Trayer, a solicitor who had acted for them on the purchase of the South Coogee property. Afrilanka executed a guarantee of the facilities.

22Mr Trayer swore an affidavit in the proceedings. He cannot recall what advice he gave Mr and Mrs Diagne. However, he says that it was his usual practice when giving advice in relation to a standard mortgage or loan agreement to explain the nature of the document and the consequences of not repaying the amounts due. He says he has no reason to doubt that he followed that practice in the case of Mr and Mrs Diagne. Mr Diagne chose not to cross-examine Mr Trayer.

23On 24 August 2005, the sale of the Enmore property settled.

24On 8 September 2005, Mr Culmer submitted a further credit application for a Master Lease Facility of $100,000. It is not clear how that application came about. However, the application includes the following comments in support of the facility:

Settlement for the purchase of the Enmore restaurant has been completed and the opening is scheduled for early to mid October 2005. Mr Diagne is currently attending to some minor alterations to the seating, painting and re-location of counters etc.

He has requested that we now assist with the leasing of some general equipment items and other items. Some of the items that are required immediately are two tabletop Combi Steamer costing $10,000 each, a hot & cold counter and installation costing $31,273 and some other items costing $3,034.

To assist the client, it is intended to provide him with a Master Lease facility for $100k which will cover his immediate requirements as well as his future requirements.

25The facility was approved and was executed by Afrilanka on 13 September 2005. It appears that it was originally contemplated that Mr and Mrs Diagne would guarantee Afrilanka's obligations under the Master Lease Facility. However, no such guarantees were given.

26On 4 November 2005, the overdraft was transferred from Mr and Mrs Diagne to Afrilanka with Mr and Mrs Diagne as guarantors. The credit application in support of that change also noted that Mr and Mrs Diagne had repaid the facility for $95,000 from the GST refund that they had obtained. Mr and Mrs Diagne signed the relevant facility letter as guarantors. Curiously, each of them also purported to sign as witnesses to their own signatures. 

27On 5 December 2005, Mr and Mrs Diagne executed a deed of guarantee and indemnity in respect of the liabilities of Afrilanka under the overdraft facility up to a limit of $45,000, together with other amounts payable under that facility. At the same time, they executed declarations that they had received independent legal advice in respect of the guarantee. Those declarations were witnessed by a Justice of the Peace.

28Mr Diagne said in his affidavit that there was no discussion with him concerning the transfer of the overdraft to Afrilanka. The Bank takes issue with that evidence. Little turns on it, since it is clear that Mr Diagne was aware that he had an overdraft. Indeed, one of his complaints in the case is that the overdraft the Bank granted was insufficient for a new business. However, Mr Diagne's evidence is difficult to reconcile with the documents he signed. It is also difficult to reconcile with a declaration of independent financial advice provided to the Bank on 5 December 2005 by Ms Beverley Gough, who was, at the time, Mr and Mrs Diagne's accountant and who prepared tax returns for them and for Afrilanka. Among other things, that declaration records the following:

I considered and advised [Mr and Mrs Diagne] about the obligations of the Borrower to St George Bank Limited under the Letter of Offer dated 3 November 2005 [the offer of the overdraft to Afrilanka] and the viability of the borrowing in terms of servicing of interest and repayment. I advised them that matters to be considered included many matters both within and beyond the Borrowers control and these would include fraud or poor management, imprudent business practices, failure to effect proper insurances, over optimistic income and profit projections, changes in interest rates and changes in the market place, economy or law.

29On 16 February 2006, the Bank offered Afrilanka a temporary increase in its overdraft from $45,000 to $70,000 until 16 August 2006 with a reduction of $35,000 in the master lease limit. The credit application in support of that variation records the following:

Client recently opened a new restaurant in Enmore and received approval for a Master Lease of $100k to assist with the fit out and equipping of the premises. In an effort to have the restaurant open prior to Christmas, Mr Diagne paid cash for a number of items to the value of $25k rather then [sic] use his Master Lease facility. This was due to the type and low costs of the items involved and timing issues.

As a consequence, the company's account is carrying an un-budgeted amount of $25k that was originally supposed to be part of the Master Lease. Mr Diagne has therefore requested a temporary increase in the company's limit of $25k for 6 months to allow him to reduce the $25k from trading. He does not wish to enter into any Sale & Lease Back type arrangement to move the $25k to the Master Lease facility.

30Mr Diagne says in his affidavit that there was no discussion with him prior to the Bank increasing the overdraft. That, however, seems unlikely. As I have said, one of Mr Diagne's complaints in the case was that the overdraft was insufficient. The likelihood is that it is an issue that Mr Diagne raised with Mr Culmer at the time and that the increase in the overdraft was a response to a request made by Mr Diagne, as the credit application records.

31Mr and Mrs Diagne signed the acceptance of the Bank's offer as directors of Afrilanka and signed guarantees of Afrilanka's obligations.Their signatures were witnessed by Mr Diagne's aunt, who also witnessed Mr and Mrs Diagne's signatures on a number of subsequent documents. Mrs Diagne raised in submissions the question whether that affected the validity of the documents, but clearly it does not. 

32On 7 March 2006, Mr and Mrs Diagne executed an extension of their guarantee and indemnity in respect of the variation to the overdraft and also executed declarations of independent legal advice. Mr and Mrs Diagne's signatures in respect of the guarantees were witnessed by Mr Diagne's aunt, but again nothing turns on that. The declarations were witnessed by a Justice of the Peace.

33Mr Diagne says in his affidavit that he had a number of conversations by telephone with Mr Culmer in 2006 in which, as part of the conversation, he reminded Mr Culmer of the importance of arranging a loan or extending further credit to enable renovation of the upstairs so that the seating capacity could be increased. He says that he stressed that it was vital that the seating capacity be increased, but that he never received a satisfactory response from Mr Culmer.

34By about 14 June 2006, Afrilanka's overdraft had reached $92,000 and the Portfolio Loan Facility was approximately $8,000 in arrears. On 14 June 2006, Mr Culmer prepared a credit application for a new facility in the name of Afrilanka for $100,000 with a reduction in the overdraft to $20,000. The application records the following reason for the new facility:

Client opened his new fast food eatery at Enmore prior to Christmas 2005. The eatery was financed by us (security property S2) which although previously being a restaurant needed refurbishment and renovation. Client also installed new fittings etc which were financed through our Master lease facility. The eatery serves African style foods at low prices of $10-$15 a meal. Client also operates a formal restaurant at Newtown which also serves African style food.

Client now realises that he under-estimated the set up costs and this has been reflected in his overdraft usage. He now wants to re-structure the company's borrowings by way of a new $100k P & I variable rate loan over 8 years. These funds will be used to:

$92k - clear existing hard core overdraft
$8k - clear Portfolio arrears
$100k - new loan

Client wishes to retain a $20k overdraft limit for come and go use.

Client is confident that with the expense of the new eatery behind him and the gradual increase in the new eatery that he will be able to make lump sum reductions to the new variable rate loan over the medium term. Interim financials to April 2006 attached support this.

35Mr Diagne gave evidence in his affidavit that ""our"" financial difficulties worsened when the overdraft limit was reduced to $20,000. He says that again there was no discussion with him or his wife before the overdraft was reduced. Again, I do not accept that evidence. In my view, it is inconceivable that the Bank did not have discussions with Mr Diagne concerning the fact that Afrilanka had exceeded its overdraft limit by a significant margin. The reduction of the overdraft limit to $20,000 and the offer of a new loan of $100,000 at a lower interest rate was clearly an accommodation offered by the Bank to assist Mr Diagne with the financial difficulties he and his wife and their business found themselves in. It is inherently improbable that the Bank did not discuss that fact with them or that they did not appreciate that what was being offered to them was an accommodation.

36Again, Mr and Mrs Diagne executed extensions of their guarantee and indemnity and declarations of independent legal advice, which were witnessed by a Justice of the Peace.

37On 10 October 2006, Mr Culmer prepared a credit application seeking approval for the following:

1) temporary increase in the company's limit of $25k from $20k to $45k for 4 months to enable the clearance of the portfolio loan excess of $8k and the covering of the existing o/d excess of $12k.

2) bank guarantee for $17,000 for a rental bond

3) a new $10k principal and interest loan to assist with the immigration costs of two family friends who are immigrating from Africa.

The request for a bank guarantee for $17,000 was approved. However, approval of the other facilities was refused.

38On 17 October 2006, the Bank wrote to Mr and Mrs Diagne informing them of the Bank's decision. It also stated that any cheques presented in excess of the $20,000 overdraft limit would be dishonoured. Mr Diagne replied to that letter on 1 November 2006. In that reply, he said that the bank guarantee needed to be for $20,020. The increase in the guarantee was approved by the Bank and Mr and Mrs Diagne were told of that approval in a letter dated 3 November 2006.

39On 21 December 2006, the Bank wrote to Mr and Mrs Diagne observing that the Portfolio Loan Facility in respect of the South Coogee property was $20,830.04 in arrears and that the loan in respect of the Enmore property was $8,725.79 in arrears. The letter demanded repayment of all facilities within 30 days. The Bank commenced legal recovery action on 27 February 2007. By that stage, Mr Richard Walker had taken over responsibility for the relationship from Mr Culmer.

40The Bank did not pursue its recovery action. There were negotiations between Mr Diagne and the Bank in relation to proposed repayment schedules and Mr and Mrs Diagne made some attempts to refinance their facilities with the Bank. They put the property at South Coogee up for sale, but the property did not sell. On 4 December 2008, the Bank and Mr and Mrs Diagne reached a forbearance agreement following a without prejudice meeting attended by the Bank's and Mr and Mrs Diagne's solicitors. In the meantime, a dispute developed between Mr and Mrs Diagne and the landlord of the Kilimanjaro premises and ultimately that lease was terminated.

41Eventually, following further negotiations, on 14 January 2011, the Bank issued a notice under s 57(2)(b) of the Real Property Act 1900 (NSW) in respect of the South Coogee property. In response, Mr and Mrs Diagne notified a dispute to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), which had the effect of staying any further enforcement action. FOS issued its determination on 29 May 2013. The Bank served letters of demand on 19 July 2013 and commenced these proceedings on 26 August 2013.

42It is not necessary to describe in detail the negotiations between the Bank and Mrs and Mrs Diagne leading up to the demands issued on 19 July 2013. It is noteworthy, however, that at no time prior to filing their cross summons did either Mr or Mrs Diagne assert that they had been misled by Mr Culmer. In particular, the notice of dispute served on the Bank by FOS described the dispute that had been notified to it in these terms:

Dispute summary: The applicants' complaint relates to a default notice they have received from St George bank, regarding loan account XXXXXX. The applicants say that they are the proprietors of two successful restaurants and in the past 12 months they have been in dispute with the landlord of one of these restaurants. They own the other commercial property outright. The dispute is currently before the Administrative Decisions Tribunal. The applicants say that the drain on their financial resources have been considerable. The applicants say that they expect the matter to be settled shortly, and when it is, they will be able to bring the loan up to date.

Mr and Mrs Diagne

43Before addressing the issues in the case, it is necessary to say something about Mr and Mrs Diagne.

44Mr Diagne came across as an intelligent and articulate person. He said in evidence that, at the time he bought the Enmore property, he was naïve and ignorant of banking practices in Australia, that he did not appreciate that he could have negotiated with the Bank concerning the amount of the overdraft and that his English was poorer then than it is now. However, I think that evidence is likely to be exaggerated to some extent. The impression I gained was that Mr Diagne was reasonably sophisticated when it came to business matters and was able to look after his own interests. He had no difficulty in applying to a number of financial institutions for a loan to finance the acquisition of the Enmore property and it is apparent that he used the offers of loans from other banks as a means of negotiating more attractive terms from the Bank. Despite what he said in evidence, before applying for loans in respect of the Enmore property, he had some experience in obtaining a small overdraft from another bank and some form of commercial lease or loan from another financial institution. He was sophisticated enough to ask the Bank to put its offer in writing so that he could consider it; and he had run a successful business for a number of years. He also appears to have had no difficulty in arranging for Afrilanka's overdraft to be increased. It may be that Mr Diagne's English has improved over time. However, there is no evidence to suggest that his knowledge of English prevented him from understanding the nature and consequences of the transactions he was entering into. There are no significant written communications from Mr Diagne at the time he arranged the loans to buy the Enmore property, but his later communications, from late 2006 onwards, suggest that he had an excellent grasp of written English. 

45Mrs Diagne swore an affidavit in the proceedings. Through much of the proceedings, she was assisted by an interpreter. When she came to give oral evidence, she said (through the interpreter) that she could read a little English but that she did not really understand written English. It transpired that, although she had been informed of the contents of her affidavit, it had not been translated for her. In those circumstances, I was not prepared to admit her affidavit and she was not cross-examined. She did, however, address the Court in English on the last day of the hearing. Although, on occasions, she was a little difficult to understand and although she lacked confidence in her ability to speak English, she had no difficulty in making the points that she wanted to make or in understanding what was said to her. 

The claims based on representations

46The claims based on representations allegedly made by Mr Culmer are put in various ways. It is alleged that the Bank made false or misleading representations in contravention of s 12DA of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (the ASIC Act). That section relevantly provides:

(1) A person must not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct in relation to financial services that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive.

47It is also alleged that the Bank engaged in misrepresentations at common law. Finally, it is alleged that the representations made by Mr Culmer and the detrimental reliance of Mr and Mrs Diagne gave rise to an estoppel. In each case, the factual basis for the claim is the same. It is alleged that Mr Culmer ""misrepresented to [Mr and Mrs Diagne] the extent of the financial accommodation that the Defendants would be offered, leading [Mr and Mrs Diagne] to believe that the [Bank] would financially support renovations to the property to increase the number of tables in the restaurant if [Mr and Mrs Diagne] purchased the Enmore Property"". As a consequence, it is alleged that Mr and Mrs Diagne have suffered loss because they have been unable to meet their financial obligations. In the case of the estoppel claim, the detriment they are alleged to have suffered is that they purchased the Enmore property and suffered losses from attempting to operate a restaurant there, including the inability to continue to operate the Kilimanjaro restaurant.

48In my opinion, these claims must fail for two reasons.

49First, I do not accept that Mr Culmer engaged in any misleading conduct. It is likely that he said to Mr Diagne words to the effect that the Bank wanted to assist him and Mrs Diagne. That was a natural thing for Mr Culmer to say, particularly when he knew that Mr Diagne had approached other Banks. Those words were true; and the Bank did assist Mr and Mrs Diagne by making the loans it did to them. It is also likely that Mr Diagne said that he wanted to borrow money to renovate the Enmore premises; and it is quite possible that Mr Culmer told Mr Diagne that it would be better first to process the loan to acquire the property. Again, that is precisely what happened. After the initial loan to purchase the Enmore property, the Bank lent the sum of $100,000 to be used to renovate the property. However, I do not accept that Mr Culmer said anything to Mr Diagne to suggest that the Bank would advance further money to enable him (or Afrilanka) to renovate the upstairs area of the property. There is no written evidence that Mr Diagne made a request for additional funds to renovate the upstairs area of the Enmore property. Nor is there any reason for him to have done so. He could have used the unused portion of the Master Lease Facility to renovate the upstairs area if that is what he really wanted to do. There is no evidence to suggest that the facility was inadequate for that purpose. Mr Diagne's evidence was that he already had enough tables and chairs to put in that area. It is obvious from photographs tendered by Mr Diagne that the upstairs area needed painting and some decorations. But there is no reason to think that the unused portion of the Master Lease Facility was inadequate for that purpose. 

50If such a request had been made, the likelihood is that Mr Culmer would have recorded that request in a credit application. He recorded other requests for loans in credit applications, which were rejected, such as the request for a loan to assist with the immigration costs of two family friends who were migrating from Africa. Until these proceedings were commenced, there is no evidence that Mr Diagne ever complained in writing that the Bank had represented that it would advance additional money to enable Mr and Mrs Diagne to renovate the upstairs area. If there was any substance to the complaint, it would have been included in the complaint to FOS. However, it was not.

51Second, this aspect of the case proceeds on the basis that Mr and Mrs Diagne had not bought the Enmore premises at the time the representations on which they rely were made. That was plainly not the case. They had exchanged contracts before Mr Diagne ever met Mr Culmer. In those circumstances, it is very difficult to see what loss or detriment Mr and Mrs Diagne suffered as a consequence of the statements that Mr Culmer is alleged to have made. They were committed to the purchase of the Enmore property. It seems clear that they bought the property to open up a second restaurant. It is not suggested that they could have borrowed more from another financial institution than the Bank ultimately agreed to lend them.

52In the light of those conclusions, it is unnecessary to consider the Bank's limitation defence.

The Contracts Review Act claim

53Section 7(1) of the Contracts Review Act provides:

Where the Court finds a contract or a provision of a contract to have been unjust in the circumstances relating to the contract at the time it was made, the Court may, if it considers it just to do so, and for the purpose of avoiding as far as practicable an unjust consequence or result, do any one or more of the following: 

(a) it may decide to refuse to enforce any or all of the provisions of the contract,

(b) it may make an order declaring the contract void, in whole or in part,

(c) it may make an order varying, in whole or in part, any provision of the contract,

(d) it may, in relation to a land instrument, make an order for or with respect to requiring the execution of an instrument that: 

(i) varies, or has the effect of varying, the provisions of the land instrument, or

(ii) terminates or otherwise affects, or has the effect of terminating or otherwise affecting, the operation or effect of the land instrument.

54Section 6(2) of the Contracts Review Act provides:

A person may not be granted relief under this Act in relation to a contract so far as the contract was entered into in the course of or for the purpose of a trade, business or profession carried on by the person or proposed to be carried on by the person, other than a farming undertaking (including, but not limited to, an agricultural, pastoral, horticultural, orcharding or viticultural undertaking) carried on by the person or proposed to be carried on by the person wholly or principally in New South Wales.

55Section 9 of the Contracts Review Act sets out the matters that the court is required to take into account in determining whether a contract is unjust in the circumstances relating to the contract at the time it was made. It is not necessary to set those matters out. In the present case, the particulars to para 38 of the Commercial List Cross Claim Statement filed by Mr and Mrs Diagne allege that the contracts relating to the purchase of the Enmore property and all subsequent facilities, variations and guarantees arising from the purchase of that property were unjust because:


The Bank failed to interview Mrs Diagne in relation to the proposed loans, variations of loans and facilities to ensure that she had a reasonable understanding of those loans and the consequences of a failure to meet repayment;
The Bank permitted Mr Diagne to witness Mrs Diagne's signature on all facilities documents with no Bank officer present;
The Bank failed to ensure that Mr and Mrs Diagne had independent legal and financial advice before signing each of the facilities documents;
The Bank incorporated onerous terms in the facilities documents - in particular, requiring Mr and Mrs Diagne to guarantee the debts of Afrilanka in circumstances where it already had a mortgage over the Enmore property and linking the mortgage over the South Coogee property to their business loans in circumstances where it was not necessary to do so;
There was a material inequality of bargaining power between the Bank and Mr and Mrs Diagne;
Mr and Mrs Diagne had little commercial experience and, having regard to their background, levels of education and limited English and consequently were not reasonably able to protect their interests;
The terms and conditions of the facilities were not explained to Mr and Mrs Diagne in an intelligible way by any person before they entered into the facilities.

56A number of these allegations are factually wrong. The critical documents that were signed by Mr and Mrs Diagne in relation to the purchase of the Enmore property were the Commercial Loan Facility letter dated 12 August 2005 (and signed by them on 17 August 2005), which covered the loan to buy the property, the loan to pay the GST amount and the overdraft of $45,000, and the mortgage of the Enmore property that was dated 22 August 2005. Mr Culmer witnessed Mr and Mrs Diagne's signatures on the Commercial Loan Facility and Mr Trayer witnessed Mr and Mrs Diagne's signatures on the mortgage and the certificates of independent legal advice and gave evidence to the effect that he explained the effect of both documents to them. That evidence was unchallenged. Mr and Mrs Diagne did not guarantee Afrilanka's obligations under the Master Lease Facility. They did guarantee the overdraft when it was transferred from them to Afrilanka. Their signatures on those guarantees were witnessed by Mr Diagne's aunt. However, their declarations that they had received independent legal advice were witnessed by a Justice of the Peace. More significantly, Mr and Mrs Diagne obtained independent financial advice from Ms Gough in relation to the guarantees. Finally, it is unclear what is meant by the allegation that the Bank linked the mortgage over the South Coogee property to Mr and Mrs Diagne's business loans. Mr and Mrs Diagne borrowed against the South Coogee property to pay the deposit in respect of the purchase of the Enmore property. However, the loans were not otherwise linked.

57There was a dispute concerning whether Mr Culmer explained the Commercial Loan Facility and mortgage in relation to the purchase of the Enmore property to Mrs Diagne. Mr Culmer said that he did. Mr Diagne gave evidence that Mr Culmer had never met Mrs Diagne. I prefer Mr Culmer's evidence on this point. Mr Diagne's evidence is inconsistent with the fact that Mr Culmer witnessed Mrs Diagne's signature on the Commercial Loan Facility. In any event, it is plain that Mr and Mrs Diagne both received independent legal advice on the Commercial Loan Facility and mortgage.

58In my opinion, there is no merit in the contention that the documents relating to loans advanced in connection with the purchase of the Enmore property and the business carried on at that property were unfair.

59As I have said, Mr and Mrs Diagne agreed to buy the Enmore property and were committed to establishing a restaurant on it before they approached the Bank to finance the acquisition of the property. They had considerable business experience in operating restaurants and had done so successfully. They received independent legal advice in relation to the relevant transactions. They were no worse off when the overdraft was transferred from them to Afrilanka. In any event, they plainly received independent financial advice in relation to the guarantees they gave at that time. In those circumstances, there is no basis for the contention that the agreements concerning the original loan and overdraft were unfair at the time they were entered into.

60The overdraft was increased and eventually a substantial part of it was replaced by a commercial loan. Mr and Mrs Diagne signed certificates on each occasion that they had received independent legal advice in relation to those transactions. There may be a question whether those certificates were accurate. However, in my opinion, the Bank was not required to go behind those certificates: see Provident Capital Ltd v Papa [2013] NSWCA 36; (2012) 84 NSWLR 231 at [114]. Mr Culmer had met with Mr and Mrs Diagne and witnessed their signatures on the original Commercial Loan Facility for the Enmore property. He believed that both were fluent in English as a result of that meeting. That was certainly true of Mr Diagne; and having regard to the submissions that Mrs Diagne made to me, it was a reasonable conclusion to reach in relation to Mrs Diagne. Consequently, the Bank had a reasonable basis for believing that Mr and Mrs Diagne understood the certificates they signed. The claim that the agreement by which the overdraft was increased was unfair appears to be based on a contention that the Bank should not have permitted the business carried on by Afrilanka to incur further debt, or at least should not have lent further money to Afrilanka if the price of doing so was guarantees from Mr and Mrs Diagne. But why that is so is unclear. Although the business was carried on by Afrilanka, it was effectively carried on for the benefit of Mr and Mrs Diagne. It was not unjust, in those circumstances, for the Bank to require Mr and Mrs Diagne to guarantee the debts of Afrilanka. They obtained financial advice on the initial guarantees they signed. They certified that they had received independent legal advice when they gave additional guarantees. There is no reason to believe that they did not understand the effect of those certificates. There is no reason to think that the Bank appreciated that Afrilanka was throwing good money after bad when it increased the overdraft. Indeed, Mr Diagne's principal complaint was that the Bank did not provide Afrilanka with sufficient working capital (and, in particular, a larger overdraft) to enable it to establish a successful restaurant at the Enmore premises. But at no stage did the Bank promise to advance more than it did. Consequently, it is difficult to see how it acted unjustly in not advancing more.

61Having regard to the conclusions I have reached, it is unnecessary to consider whether the operation of the Contracts Review Act is excluded by s 6(2). It is sufficient to observe that the contention faces very serious difficulties in light of the decision of the Full Federal Court in Quikfund (Australia) Pty Limited v Airmark Consolidators Pty Limited [2014] FCAFC 70.

62It follows that the claim based on the Contracts Review Act must fail.

The Yerkey v Jones claim

63The defence that arises from the High Court's decision in Yerkey v Jones [1939] HCA 3; (1939) 63 CLR 649 is available where a husband procures a wife to become surety for his debt. As the High Court explained in Garcia v National Australia Bank Ltd [1998] HCA 48; (1998) 194 CLR 395 at [31], in order to make out the defence, a wife must establish that she obtained no financial benefit from the guarantees she gave and must satisfy the following conditions:

(a) in fact the surety did not understand the purport and effect of the transaction; (b) the transaction was voluntary (in the sense that the surety obtained no gain from the contract the performance of which was guaranteed); (c) the lender is to be taken to have understood that, as a wife, the surety may repose trust and confidence in her husband in matters of business and therefore to have understood that the husband may not fully and accurately explain the purport and effect of the transaction to his wife; and yet (d) the lender did not itself take steps to explain the transaction to the wife or find out that a stranger had explained it to her. 

The defence only applies insofar as Mrs Diagne guaranteed the debts of Mr Diagne or Afrilanka. It cannot apply to the loans made to Mrs Diagne herself.

64Mrs Diagne's claim does not satisfy these requirements. She was not a volunteer. She had an interest and worked in the business in respect of which the loans were made. There is no reason to think that Mrs Diagne did not understand the effect of the guarantees she gave. The Bank required Mrs Diagne to obtain a certificate from an independent accountant that the accountant had explained the guarantees to her, and that certificate was given. The Bank also required Mrs Diagne to sign certificates that she had received independent legal advice in relation to the subsequent guarantees she gave when the overdraft was increased and subsequently converted to a commercial loan. Mr and Mrs Diagne had previously obtained legal advice from Mr Trayer in relation to related transactions. There was no reason for the Bank to doubt the accuracy of the certificates that Mrs Diagne gave. Accordingly, her claim based on Yerkey v Jones must fail.

Negligence

65Broadly speaking, the negligence claim is put in two ways. First, it is alleged that the Bank owed Mr and Mrs Diagne a duty to ""[p]rudently investigate the income, assets and liabilities of [Mr and Mrs Diagne] and the proposed business plan of [Mr and Mrs Diagne] in order to determine serviceability"". Second, it is alleged that the Bank owed a duty ""[t]o take reasonable remedial action when the loans fell into arrears, including investigating the causes of the arrears, working with [Mr and Mrs Diagne] to remedy the problems identified and continuing to monitor the ability of the borrowers and guarantors to adequately service the facilities"". Included in that duty was a duty ""to appropriately set and alter limits on overdraft facilities"". 

66It is not clear from the pleading how it is alleged that the Bank breached the first duty, although implicit in the allegation is that the Bank ought not to have made the loans it did. It appears that it is alleged that the Bank breached the second duty by reducing the overdraft without consultation, proper investigation or adequate notice. It is this second beach that is at the heart of Mr Diagne's complaint.

67The allegation that the Bank breached its duty of care in the first way that is alleged was supported by an expert report prepared by Mr John Brewster. Mr Brewster was a retired banker, who, for a large part of his career, had held senior credit and lending positions with Westpac Banking Corporation. Mr Brewster initially expressed the view that the loan to Mr and Mrs Diagne to buy the Enmore premises would not have been made by a responsible banker and that the Bank's delay in taking steps to recover the amount lent to it (thereby increasing the ultimate level of debt) was ""well wide of acceptable banking standards"".

68There are a number of difficulties with this claim.

69First, I do not accept that the Bank owed Mr and Mrs Diagne a duty of care to investigate their financial circumstances to determine whether the loan that was made was appropriate for them: see Tai Hing Cotton Mill Ltd v Liu Chong Hing Bank Ltd [1986] AC 80 at 107-108; Tomlin v Ford Credit Australia Ltd [2005] NSWSC 540.

70Second, there is a tension in Mr and Mrs Diagne's claim. Their real complaint is that the Bank failed to provide sufficient working capital to permit them to establish the business at the Enmore premises. Their complaint is not that the Bank lent them money in circumstances where it should not have done so. That is hardly surprising, given that they had already committed to buying the Enmore property before they approached the Bank for a loan.

71Third, the Bank filed an expert report from Mr Paul Goodman, which was critical of the conclusions reached by Mr Brewster. Mr Goodman concluded that the Bank ""acted prudently in approving the original facility to Mr and Mrs Diagne to assist with the purchase of the Enmore property"" and that it allowed them ""more than sufficient time to rectify the situation"". To his credit, after reading that report, Mr Brewster prepared a supplementary report that largely agreed with the conclusions reached by Mr Goodman. The areas of disagreement were minor.

72Fourth, it is difficult to see how the Bank could have done more than it did. The Bank provided Afrilanka with a commercial lease facility to permit it to renovate the Enmore property. When it became apparent that Mr and Mrs Diagne required more working capital, it adjusted the facilities to provide an increase in the overdraft. It permitted the overdraft to increase beyond its limit and replaced it with a commercial loan facility, leaving an overdraft limit of $20,000. Contrary to what is suggested in the Commercial List Cross Claim Statement and some of the evidence filed by Mr and Mrs Diagne, the overall result was that the Bank permitted Afrilanka's borrowings (leaving the Master Lease Facility aside) to increase to $120,000. There is no evidence that would support the conclusion that further borrowings would have permitted Mr and Mrs Diagne to trade out of their difficulties.

73In view of the conclusions I have reached, it is unnecessary to consider the Bank's limitation defence. The claim based on negligence must fail.

Breach of implied warranty of fitness for purpose

74The Commercial List Cross Claim Statement alleges that there was a warranty implied by s 12ED of the ASIC Act that the overdraft facilities would be fit for the purpose for which they were given, namely to assist in the smooth operation of the Lat-Dior African Eatery and the Kilimanjaro restaurant. Section 12ED(2) of the ASIC Act provides:

[Where implied warranty exists] If:
(a) a person supplies financial services to a consumer in the course of a business; and
(b) the consumer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the person:
(i) any particular purpose for which the services are required; or
(ii) the result that he or she desires the services to achieve;
there is an implied warranty that:
(c) the services supplied under the contract for the supply of the services; and
(d) any materials supplied in connection with those services;
will be reasonably fit for that purpose or are of such a nature and quality that they might reasonably be expected to achieve that result, except if the circumstances show that the consumer does not rely, or that it is unreasonable for him or her to rely, on the person's skill or judgment.

75It is alleged that the warranty was breached by the reductions in the overdraft which were made ""without consultation, proper investigation and inquiries by the [Bank] and without adequate notice"" with the result that ""the overdraft was insufficient and inadequate for the purpose, considering the expenses of a new business at the Enmore Property and on-going expenses at the Kilamanjaro [sic]"".

76In my opinion, there is no merit in this claim and it contains a number of factual errors. First, the overdraft was not granted to assist with expenses at the Kilimanjaro restaurant. At the time the overdraft was granted, that restaurant was profitable and it was expected that profits from that restaurant would assist in funding the start up of the second restaurant. For reasons that are not explained in the evidence, it appears that unexpected difficulties arose at the Kilimanjaro restaurant. Second, the allegation overlooks the $100,000 commercial loan facility that was granted by the Bank to pay out the existing overdraft. Third, for the reasons I have given, it is not correct to say that the changes to the overdraft were made without adequate notice or consultation.

77These difficulties aside, there is a fundamental problem with the claim. The overdraft about which Mr and Mrs Diagne complain was granted to Afrilanka, not them. Although they guaranteed Afrilanka's obligations under the relevant agreements, Mr and Mrs Diagne were not a party to them. Consequently, any claim for breach of warranty is one that could only be brought by Afrilanka.

Orders

78It follows that the Bank is entitled to judgment for possession of the two properties and for the sum that it claims. There are two outstanding issues. One is costs. The other relates to post judgment interest.

79The Bank claims its costs on an indemnity basis.

80Clause 14.2 of the Commercial Loan Facility relevantly provides:

You indemnify us against, and you must therefore pay us on demand for, liability, loss or costs (including consequential or economic loss) we suffer or incur:

(a) if you default under an arrangement with us; or

...

""Costs"" is defined to include ""charges and expenses; and costs, charges and expenses in connection with advisers (in the case of legal advisers, on a full indemnity basis or solicitor and own client basis, whichever is higher)"".

81The overdraft facility and the commercial loan, which were guaranteed by Mr and Mrs Diagne, contain similar provisions. However, no similar provision is contained in the Portfolio Loan Facility. 

82The court is given a discretion under s 98(1) of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) to award costs on an indemnity basis. Where a contract provides for payment of costs on that basis, the court ordinarily exercises its costs discretion to give effect to that contractual right: see Rail Corporation NSW v Leduva Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 138 at [26]-[34] per Nicholas J; Kyabram Property Investments Pty Ltd v Murray [2006] NSWSC 54 at [17]-[18] per Campbell J; Boreland v Docker [2007] NSWSC 53 at [114]-[117] per White J; National Australia Bank Ltd v Chen-Conway [2008] NSWSC 485. The court, however, is not bound to do so and any costs order remains at the court's discretion: Abigroup Ltd v Sandtara Pty Ltd [2002] NSWCA 45 at [9] per Stein JA (with whom Giles JA and Young CJ in Eq agreed); Kyabram Property Investments Pty Ltd v Murray [2005] NSWCA 87 at [14] per Beazley JA (with whom Hodgson and Ipp JJA agreed).

83In this case, the costs incurred by the Bank, including the costs incurred in defending the claims made in the Commercial List Cross Claim Statement, were costs suffered by the Bank as a consequence of Mr and Mrs Diagne's defaults. There is no reason not to give effect to the relevant contractual indemnities. As I have said, no contractual indemnity was included in the Portfolio Loan Facility. However, few of the costs in the case related to the enforcement of that facility alone. Accordingly, in my opinion, it is appropriate to order that Mr and Mrs Diagne pay the Bank's costs on an indemnity basis.

84As to post-judgment interest, s 101 of the Civil Procedure Act provides that, unless the court orders otherwise, interest is payable on so much of the amount of a judgment as from time to time is unpaid. Interest is payable at the prescribed rate or such other rate as the court may order. In this case, the Bank seeks an order that Mr and Mrs Diagne pay interest on the judgment ""at the prescribed rate or at various rates charged by the plaintiff to customers on like accounts (compounded monthly) from the date of judgment on so much of the money as is from time to time unpaid, whichever is the higher"".

85In my opinion, it is not appropriate to make an order in those terms. It should be apparent on the face of the order at what rate post-judgment interest is payable. It is not appropriate to make an order that interest be payable at a rate that can only be determined by undertaking a factual enquiry. Nor is it appropriate to make an order that interest be payable at the higher of two rates that need to be ascertained. No submissions were made to the Court concerning an appropriate interest rate or whether this is an appropriate case in which to make an order under s 101. Consequently, in my opinion, no order should be made under s 101, with the result that post-judgment interest will run at the prescribed rate.

86As at the date of this judgment, the total amount owing by Mr and Mrs Diagne is $3,290,558.06. That amount has been calculated by taking the amount set out in the affidavit of debt sworn by Ms Lansom on 2 June 2014, which calculated interest up until 31 May 2014, and adding interest to that amount calculated from 31 May 2014 to the date of judgment at the relevant contractual rates.

87The orders of the Court, therefore, are:

(1)The defendants give the plaintiff possession of all the land comprised in certificate of title folio identifier 2/1032744 being the land situated at and known as xxxx, Enmore in the State of New South Wales (Enmore Property);

(2)The defendants give the plaintiff possession of all the land comprised in certificate of title folio identifier 9/248060 being the land situated at and known as xxxx, South Coogee in the State of New South Wales (South Coogee Property);

(3)The plaintiff has leave to issue a writ of possession in respect of the Enmore Property.

(4)The plaintiff has leave to issue a writ of possession in respect of the South Coogee Property.

(5)A writ of possession be issued forthwith in respect of the Enmore Property.

(6)A writ of possession be issued forthwith in respect of the South Coogee Property.

(7)Judgment for the plaintiff against the first and second defendants for the sum of $3,290,558.06.

(8)The cross-claimants' cross-claims are dismissed.

(9)The defendants/cross-claimants pay the plaintiff's/cross-defendant's costs on an indemnity basis.

		23 June 2014",2014-06-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704920,Versluys v R [2014] NSWCCA 98,"Judgment

1Simpson J: I agree with Hamill J.

2Hidden J: I agree with Hamill J. I doubt that it is necessary to make a finding of special circumstances simply for the purpose of rounding off the length of the non-parole period.

3Hamill J On 27 July 2004, Lee Versluys (the Appellant) murdered his de facto partner, Jodie Lee Hingston, by strangling her. On 21 November 2005, he was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to murder. On 1 December 2005 a jury found him guilty of murder. On 24 March 2006 he was sentenced by Newman AJ to a non-parole period of 20 years, commencing 27 July 2004 and expiring on 26 July 2024. An additional term (or balance of term) of six years and eight months is to commence on 27 July 2024.

4He appealed against his conviction and sought leave to appeal against his sentence. On 3 April 2008 this Court, differently constituted, dismissed the conviction appeal, granted leave to appeal against the sentence but dismissed that appeal: Versluys v R [2008] NSWCCA 76. 

5On 20 December 2013, Latham J made an order under s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 referring the case to this Court to be deal with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912: Application by Lee Versluys pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, unreported SC (NSW) (Latham J) 20 December 2013. As I understand the judgment of R A Hulme J in Carlton v R [2014] NSWCCA 14, the requirement for leave is obviated when the case comes to the Court following a referral under Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. 

6There is no issue surrounding the conviction. The basis upon which Latham J ordered the referral, and the sole ground of appeal advanced on behalf of the Appellant, is that the sentencing proceedings miscarried because Newman AJ (and in turn this Court) 'erred in the application of the standard non-parole period legislation'. 

7It is common ground between the parties, and it was the opinion of Latham J, that this ground is established or, at least, ""well founded"": per Latham J at [8]. 

8Both the sentencing Judge and this Court applied the law relating to the standard non-parole period in s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) as it had been expressed and explained in the decision of this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131, 60 NSWLR 168. 

9In Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 391, 244 CLR 120, the High Court held (at [25]) that R v Way was wrongly decided and that ""it was an error to characterize s 54B(2) as framed in mandatory terms"". A sentencing judge is not required to commence by asking ""whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non parole period"". 

10The High Court held (at [26]) that the introduction of the standard non-parole period did not involve a departure from accepted sentencing principles whereby:
""[T]he judge identifies all the factors that are relevant to the sentence, discusses their significance and then makes a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence given all the factors of the case."" 
See, for example, Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25, 228 CLR 357 at 378. 

11Further, the High Court rejected (at [28]) ""a two-stage approach to the sentencing of offenders for Div 1A offences, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness by comparison with an hypothesised offence answering that description and, in the event that it does, by inquiring if there are matters justifying a longer or shorter period"". 

12Since the decision in Muldrock v The Queen this Court has been called upon to deal with a number of cases in which it is either alleged or established that what has come to be known as 'Muldrock error' caused the sentencing proceedings to miscarry. Two such cases have been subject of successful applications for special leave to appeal to the High Court: see Kentwell v R [2013] NSWCCA 266; O'Grady v R [2013] NSWCCA 281; Kentwell v The Queen; O'Grady v The Queen [2014] HCATrans 113. The parties are agreed that nothing in those cases is likely to impact on the resolution of the Appellant's appeal. 

13The present case provides a particularly stark example of the kind of error discussed by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen. At [33] through to [35], the sentencing Judge referred to the decision in R v Way and concluded (at [35]): 
""[H]owever applying what fell from the Court of Criminal Appeal in Way, I am of the view that the matters adverted to by [defence counsel] in his submissions as to the applicability of s 21A do not dissuade me that this is a case where the standard non-parole period should be applied. In my view, the objective features to which I have referred so outweigh the matters properly raised by [defence counsel] in mitigation that I therefore propose to apply that standard non-parole period.""

14It is clear from this passage that the learned sentencing Judge fell into error. The Respondent properly concedes that this is so. In fairness to his Honour, he was applying the law as it was understood to be in the light of this Court's decision in R v Way and subsequent cases. 

15I am of the opinion that the error was of such a fundamental nature that the sentence actually imposed by Newman AJ should not in any sense be used as a yardstick in determining whether, as the Respondent submits, s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 should be invoked. It is the task of this Court to determine what an appropriate sentence is, taking into account the findings as to the objective gravity of the crime which were made by the learned sentencing Judge (none of which have been challenged on this appeal). It is also necessary to take into account all relevant mitigating circumstances as they existed at the time, but also any additional subjective features of the case which have been established in evidence before this Court: see, for example, R v Douar [2005] NSWCCA 455, 159 A Crim R 154 at [124]. 

16In terms of the objective gravity of the crime, it is necessary to restate the facts as they were found by Newman AJ at [28-30]: 
""What then do I find the facts to be? I find that the deceased died as a result of pressure applied to her neck by the prisoner. In other words, she died because he strangled her. While it is the fact that the deceased's ability to breathe was inhibited by the substances found in her blood, the fact of the matter is that they were not the cause of her death but that cause was the application of pressure on her neck by the prisoner. I do not accept that the prisoner merely meant to scare the deceased or to dissuade her from the course of conduct which he says she was following immediately prior to him placing his hands around her neck. I do this for two-reasons. One, such a finding would be ""quite inconsistent with the jury's verdict"". Two, that the prisoner's conduct was consistent with the threats which he had made earlier, both to the deceased's mother and to Mr Ironside, in which he said he would strangle her if she continued to associate with other men. As I have indicated, I also accept Mr Ironside's evidence that, at the time when he was aroused by the prisoner on 27 July 2004, one component of the mood he exhibited was anger. I should add in this context Dr Botterill's evidence that the neck compression applied necessary to cause brain damage would have lasted, at a minimum, four minutes. Even accepting that the deceased's breathing ability was inhibited by the drugs she had ingested, the prisoner must have applied pressure to her neck for some minutes prior to her lapsing into unconsciousness.

While the Crown put its case to the jury on the basis of all three components of the crime of murder, namely, an intention to kill or an intention to cause grievous bodily harm or a reckless indifference to human life, I am of the view that the prisoner, in the light of the threats he had made in the past and the vast physical difference between himself and the deceased, at least intended to cause her seriously bodily harm when he placed his hands around her neck. My ultimate finding is that the prisoner intended to cause the deceased grievous bodily harm when he strangled her and that, as a consequence of his actions, the deceased died.""

17Having made those findings of fact his Honour went on (at [30]) to find that the following features of the case enhanced its objective seriousness: 
(a)"" Strangulation is a particularly horrible way for a person to die. The process as l have said must have taken some minutes, minutes in which the deceased must have been terrified and suffering great pain.

(b)The [Appellant] had in the past threatened to do exactly what he did do.

(c)The vast physical difference between the [Appellant] and the deceased makes this a most cowardly crime"".

18Whether the first of those matters was supported by evidence is unclear to me, but the finding is not challenged by counsel for the Appellant. To come to a conclusion as to an appropriate sentence, it is necessary to bear in mind a number of the facts of the case. 

19First, the Appellant is not to be sentenced on the basis that he had an intention to kill. While the finding that he ""at least"" intended to inflict grievous bodily harm is ambiguous, this Court held that ""it follows from his Honour's finding of an intention to cause grievous bodily harm that his Honour did not find that there was an intention to kill"": Versluys v R [2008] NSWCCA 76 at [31]. The Appellant sought medical help for the victim by calling '000' telling the operator ""I strangled her"" and ""she seems to be choking on her own spew"". That act is not consistent with an intention to kill. In Apps v R [2006] NSWCCA 290 Simpson J (at [49]) said:
""Certainly, in a case of murder, the state of mind in which the offence is committed is a relevant consideration going to objective seriousness. As is well known, murder may be established by proof of an act causing death committed when the act is accompanied by any one of three states of mind: in descending levels of seriousness they are: an intention to kill, an intention to cause grievous bodily harm, or reckless indifference. I have no doubt that an intention to kill as distinct from either of the two alternatives, is a consideration tending to greater objective seriousness rather than lesser. So much is obvious. Indeed, in Way, while the Court expressly alluded to mental states, followed this by the parenthetical observation that ""intention is more serious than recklessness"". However, of itself, an intention to kill alone cannot establish that a particular instance of the crime of murder is above the mid-range of seriousness. It is not the only circumstance relevant to that assessment. In this the submissions made on behalf of the applicant are correct.""

20Secondly, the sentencing Judge found that the offence was not pre-meditated and was not part of a ""planned or organized criminal activity"". While this mitigates the objective gravity of the crime, its impact is reduced by the fact that the murder was committed in the context of a violent domestic relationship and in circumstances where there was evidence of an assault by the Appellant on the victim some weeks before and also evidence that he had threatened her in the weeks leading up to the tragic incident. 

21While every case will turn on its own facts, and while no categorical proposition can be discerned from past murder cases, it is generally the case that murders involving a lack of intention to kill and a lack of premeditation are likely to be less serious than those in which there is established premeditation and an intention to kill.

22The appellant is now forty years of age. He was thirty at the time of the murder. He had a very minor criminal history and had committed no prior offences of violence. 

23Before Newman AJ, the Appellant relied on a report by a psychologist, Keith Dawes, which set out a number of difficulties the Appellant had experienced in the course of his life. He and his sister were physically abused as children and the Appellant spent time at a boys' home on more than one occasion. He had been beaten and ""locked in a cupboard"" as punishment for misbehaviour. Mr Dawes described his upbringing as ""tumultuous"" and was of the opinion that his ""behaviour is consistent with an emotional sensitive boy living under duress"". He had been ""dumped"" many times by his parents. By the time that he killed Ms Hingston, he had developed an addiction to heroin. 

24While the history provided to Mr Dawes was not given on oath by the Appellant (cf Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353, 172 A Crim R 368; R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381, 134 A Crim R 174), it does not appear to have been disputed and the sentencing Judge seems to have accepted it. 

25Newman AJ concluded that the Appellant was unlikely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour also took into account the admissions that the Appellant had made and the extent to which his conduct of the trial reflected a 'degree of disclosure' for the purposes of s 21A(3)(l) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

26His Honour held that the Appellant's remorse was 'muted' in the light of some particularly callous remarks he had made about the victim in the aftermath of the killing. The Appellant provided further evidence of remorse on the hearing of the appeal. The Respondent accepts that amendments to s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which came into effect in 2008, do not apply to this appeal. While I am prepared to accept that the applicant is now sorry, not much turns on this feature of the case in light of his comments about the deceased at the time of her murder. 

27In addition to material in existence at the time of sentence, the Appellant also relied on three affidavits prepared for this appeal. The Respondent also relied on an affidavit which annexed reports concerning some incidents in gaol that caused the Appellant to be disciplined. It is not necessary to refer in detail to this material. However, the picture that emerges is that the Appellant had a very difficult time for his first few years in gaol. He gained an enormous amount of weight and struggled with his addiction problems. The disciplinary problems are largely of a minor nature. 

28More recently, the Appellant has made attempts at completing his high school education and has completed some courses directed towards his rehabilitation. He has not used drugs in gaol, has completed a methadone programme and looks forward to participating in further drug rehabilitation when his classification allows him to do so. He has lost a substantial amount of weight. His mother has observed ""significant positive changes"" in the Appellant. 

29Counsel for the Respondent points out that this evidence really does little more than to show that the predictive assessment made by Newman AJ in 2006 was correct. While I accept that submission, the Appellant is entitled to have the positive steps that he has taken while in custody into account in an assessment of the appropriate sentence. 

30The Respondent also submitted that the material in the Appellant's subjective case was ""not compelling"". Whether or not one applies that description to the Appellant's personal (or subjective) case, it is certainly a moving and powerful one. It should be given appropriate weight in the complex of circumstances to be taken into account in reaching a just and appropriate sentence. 

31Of course, nothing in the Appellant's subjective case can overcome the terrible nature of his crime. I have read the victim impact statement that was read in Court on 20 March 2006 by the victim's mother, Debbie Hingston. It is a moving and distressing description of the devastation and grief that the Appellant's crime has caused to the family and loved ones of the victim. 

32There is no ""single correct sentence"": see, for example, Markarian v The Queen (supra) at [27]. 

33The Respondent submitted that sentences for murder have increased since the introduction of the standard non-parole period. This is borne out by an analysis of the cases decided before and after the introduction of the standard non-parole period and also in a report prepared by the Judicial Commission which was annexed to the Respondent's submissions.

34To ensure consistency of punishment I have considered the statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission although it is difficult to gain much insight from those in view of the diversity of cases that are represented in the database. 

35I have also considered the sentencing outcomes in a number of cases decided since the introduction of the standard non-parole period of 20 years. In doing so I have attempted to focus on cases where there was no intention to kill and/or no premeditation. See R v O'Leary [2004] NSWSC 821; R v Heffernan [2005] NSWSC 739; Apps v R [2006] NSWCCA 290; R v Waters [2006] NSWSC 502; R v Harvey [2007] NSWSC 871; R v Thompson [2008] NSWSC 109; R v Pocock [2008] NSWSC 1435; R v Shamouil [2009] NSWSC 24; R v O'Donnell [2009] NSWSC 42; R v Edwards [2009] NSWSC 164; Carr v R [2009] NSWSC 995; R v Cox [2009] NSWSC 1067; R v Wong [2010] NSWSC 171; R v Jones [2010] NSWSC 432; R v Borg [2010] NSWSC 951; R v Holcroft [2010] NSWSC 1294; Lee v R [2011] NSWCCA 169; Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194; R v Fahda [2013] NSWCCA 86. None of those cases are on all fours with the Appellant's case. However, a review of the cases satisfies me that the sentence that I consider to be appropriate does no violence to principles of consistency of punishment. 

36I have taken into account the purposes of sentencing in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as well as the principles of sentencing established at common law and under relevant legislation. I have taken into account the standard non-parole period of 20 years and the maximum penalty of life imprisonment. These guideposts reflect the fact that the law contemplates no crime more serious than murder. 

37In all of the circumstances, I have concluded that a total sentence of 23 ½ years should be imposed. For the sake of transparency, and without engaging in an erroneous mathematical exercise, I record that I considered 24 years to be an appropriate starting point but reduced that to give effect to the finding of Newman AJ that the Appellant deserved some benefit for the utilitarian value of the 'degree of disclosure' encompassed by his admissions and conduct of the trial. The non-parole period will be 17 years and 6 months. I have rounded this down from 17.625 years which would result from a mathematical application of s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act: cf Rios v Regina [2012] NSWCCA 8 per Adamson J at [42]-[43] and Akkawi v R; Akkawi v R [2012] NSWCCA 11 per Simpson J at [101]-[102]. If necessary, I find ""special circumstances"" for the purpose of making that slight adjustment to the length of the non-parole period. I am not otherwise persuaded that there are ""special circumstances"" justifying a further reduction in the non-parole period. In assessing the appropriate total sentence, I have taken into account the matters said to constitute ""special circumstances"". A period of six years should be ample for the Appellant to re-adjust to life in the community. 

38Accordingly, the orders that I propose are as follows:

(1)Appeal allowed.

(2)The sentence imposed by Newman AJ is quashed, and in lieu the appellant is sentenced to Imprisonment for 23 years and six months commencing on 27 July 2004 and concluding on 26 January 2028. There will be a non-parole period of 17 years and six months commencing on 27 July 2004 and concluding on 26 January 2022. The earliest date upon which the Appellant will become eligible for parole is 26 January 2022.

		11 June 2014",2014-06-09 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704928,R v Briggs (No 6) [2014] NSWSC 855,"EX TEMPORE Judgment
1HIS HONOUR:  On 10 June 2014 I ordered, pursuant to s 5BAA of the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act 1998 (NSW), that the pathologist Dr Vuletic must give evidence in person rather than by audio visual link.  That order was an exception to the general position encapsulated in s 5BAA(1) of the Act, namely that a ""government agency witness"" such as Dr Vuletic must give evidence to the Court by way of audio visual link.  
2That direction of mine was founded on two matters that pertained at the time.  The first was that it seemed that there would be a degree of contention about the evidence of the witness, and it was felt by the parties that it was more appropriate in those circumstances that the witness be able to be assessed by the jury in the witness box in person.
3The second aspect was that defence counsel proposed to have the witness examine in person in the witness box at least two items that had been retrieved from the scene of the alleged offence.  
4However, in the past day or so those circumstances have changed.  The first change is that defence counsel has had a conference with the witness in person, and it seems that there will be either very little contention about her evidence or perhaps none at all.  
5The second change is with regard to the logistical question.  During that conference, the witness had the opportunity to examine directly the two items, and will be in a position to give evidence about them, even though she will now, it is proposed, be giving evidence by way of audio visual link.  
6In short, the two aspects of the matter that led me to make that order on 10 June 2014 have been resolved.  The result is that the parties jointly submit that my order of that date should be revoked, thereby causing the matter to revert to the default position contained in s 5BAA(1); namely, that the witness must give evidence by way of audio visual link.  In all of the circumstances, I consider that the joint application is soundly appropriate.
7I make the following order: my direction of 10 June 2014 requiring Dr Vuletic to give evidence in the witness box in person is revoked.

		01 July 2014",2014-06-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704931,R v Wainwright [2014] NSWDC 368,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Trent Keith Wainwright appears today for sentence in relation to an offence to which he pleaded guilty on an indictment presented on or about 20 February 2013 which alleges, or alleged, that he on 16 January 2010 at Mortdale in the State of New South Wales did cause grievous bodily harm to Tamara Lee with intent to do grievous bodily harm to her.
	
	
	This offence is an offence contrary to s 33(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900. It carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of seven years imprisonment. The offence to which the prisoner pleaded guilty was in discharge of an indictment that principally alleged against the accused that he did cause grievous bodily harm to the victim with intent to murder her.
	
	
	The prisoner was arrested on 16 January 2010. He remained in custody, as I am informed, until 17 February 2012. He was granted bail and remained on bail, as I understand the matter, until he went back into custody on 25 October 2013. He went into custody on 25 October 2013 because he was charged in relation to an unrelated offence of stalking or intimidating with intent to cause fear to another person.
	
	
	I did not refuse bail in relation to the current matter until it came before me on 16 December 2013, having the matter before me off and on from the time that the prisoner pleaded guilty on 20 February 2013. I refused bail on the basis that the prisoner had been charged with this other matter. I will deal with the issue of the granting of bail to the prisoner subsequently by the Supreme Court which frankly at the time dismayed me. But I have an understanding now of the reasons the Supreme Court would have granted bail to the prisoner on 6 February 2014.
	
	
	The prisoner appeared off bail before this Court in March this year and I again refused the prisoner bail. The prisoner has remained without bail since that refusal. I am informed by the Crown, and I accept that up until last Friday from the Crown’s perspective solely referrable to this offence, the prisoner has in fact spent two years five months and 12 days in custody. I indicated last Friday, and I reiterate that indication, that I am prepared to take into account as well the period of time the prisoner was in custody bail refused in relation to the unrelated matter between 25 October 2013 and 16 December 2013 when I refused him bail.
	
	
	I should point out in relation to that unrelated matter, that it was dismissed at the Burwood Local Court on 22 February 2014, I expect that the only reason that he was refused bail in relation to that matter was because he was on Supreme Court bail in relation to the matter with which I am concerned. Of course, since last Friday six days have elapsed. I have calculated, as I have indicated to the parties in the discussion I have just had, that there is on my understanding of the matter, two years seven months and 12 days of custody to be taken into account. That requires the sentence to be backdated to 31 October 2011.
	
	
	In sentencing the prisoner, of course, I take into account the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period and I will come back to the issue of the relevance of the standard non-parole period when I address the current provisions that relate to that and decisions such as Muldrock v The Queen of the High Court. I have a statement of facts that was tendered on 14 March of this year. That statement of facts is of some significance in the context of the way in which this case has meandered towards its conclusion.
	
	
	It should be pointed out, as I will detail in greater particularity shortly, that one of the significant reasons for the delay in the finalisation of this matter arises out of the fact that the prisoner was considered unfit to be tried and for a period of time remained undealt with by the Court system because he was under the auspices of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. But for that intervention, which is no fault of the prisoner of course, this matter would have been concluded a number of years ago.
	
	
	The victim of the offence that the prisoner has pleaded guilty to was 19 years of age at the time of the commission of the offence. She met the prisoner though a social networking site in early 2009, although the prisoner states that he earlier met her at a wedding in Tasmania. The victim ultimately moved to Sydney from Tasmania in November or early December 2009, lived for a period of time with the prisoner and his mother and then, apparently after some dispute with the mother, the two of them moved into premises at Boundary Road, Mortdale with two people, Nigel Seller and Cindy Feng, who I understand is the owner of the property at Mortdale.
	
	
	On 15 January 2010 the prisoner told the victim he was going out drinking. He did not want her to come and he did not return home until after 1.30am on 16 January 2010. When he came back the facts state that the prisoner took the victim’s phone and started sending text messages and ringing the victim’s friends telling them “Don’t contact my girlfriend again, I know your address, I know where you live, watch out.” The victim attempted to get her phone back but could not and the prisoner continued to call and text people on her mobile phone. The prisoner specifically disputes part of the facts relating to his control of the phone and that phase of the matter. I do not see any significance in relying upon what is asserted in the statement of facts.
	
	
	The prisoner left the room where this altercation occurred and the victim went to bed. The prisoner returned to the room, turned the lights on and then commenced arguing with the victim. The argument led to the point where the prisoner indicated that he was breaking up with her and she became upset telling the prisoner not to leave her. The victim put her arms around the offender and he yelled at her, “Get out of the fucking house.” There is an allegation in the facts that the offender smashed the victim’s phone on the ground, which he disputes. The next thing the victim remembers, bearing in mind, as the facts reveal, she lost consciousness within a short period of time after she was told to get out of the house, is that the prisoner pushed her out the front of the house yelling, “Get out of the fucking house.” She lost her balance and when pushed she fell down hitting her head on the concrete steps. She does not remember anything after that until she awoke in the hospital.
	
	
	It is to be pointed out at this stage, in the context of some comments I will make about the prisoner’s claims in relation to what happened, that much of what happened was in fact witnessed by other people and the Crown has a body of evidence independent of anything that the victim may have said about the matter to reflect upon the gravity of the attack upon the victim by the prisoner.
	
	
	Seller and Feng were asleep in their bedroom in the same house. They heard yelling and screaming coming from the victim and the offender’s bedroom. Seller told the prisoner to come out of the room but was told to stay out of it, he could hear what sounded like wrestling or struggling on the wooden floorboards. He heard the victim yell out, “Nigel, please help me.” Seller went to the kitchen and rang triple 0 and he heard the offender yelling, “Get out of the house.” The victim was seen to grip the wooden floorboards with her feet to stop being dragged out. The prisoner asserts that he was not dragging her, he was lifting or pushing her. Mr Seller did not want the prisoner seeing him ring the police. He saw the victim holding onto the entry doorframe. He saw the prisoner push her out of the front door. He then saw the prisoner lift her up under both her armpits and threw her out of the front entry of the premises. He went outside to see. The victim was lying on her left side in a curled position on a concrete driveway by the steps and she was not moving. This is entirely consistent with the circumstances in which the victim lost her memory. At this stage it would seem that in fact the grievous bodily harm upon which the Crown relies had not been inflicted although she had lost consciousness. The prisoner was seen to stand over the victim’s head and yell at her.
	
	
	Ms Feng came out to see what was happening. The prisoner who was wearing shoes then stomped on the victim’s head with considerable force. Seller ran at the offender and pushed him away. Feng tried to pull the offender away and she heard him say to Seller, “Nigel, leave me alone if you don’t want me to injure your girlfriend”, which is a reference to Feng. The prisoner told Seller to stay out of it and he then stomped on the victim’s head at least three times. The offender said to Feng, “She’s trying to kill me, she deserves this.” There is no evidence, in my view, upon which one could act to conclude that at any stage the victim was trying to kill him. Mr Seller continued to try and push the offender away. The prisoner then picked up a clay pot. Mr Seller stepped away. The prisoner stood over the victim and threw the pot down on the victim’s head smashing it.
	
	
	I interpose to say that even if there had been some altercation in the bedroom where the victim had threatened him, such threat as the victim offered to him, that is the prisoner, had well and truly evaporated before she had been thrown out of the house. It is clear on the facts, that when she was stomped on and when the clay pot was dropped on her head she was defenceless. The clay terracotta pot was about 60 centimetres tall, 30 centimetres wide and 4 centimetres thick. The prisoner walked back into the house to his bedroom and started packing some belongings. He yelled out to Feng, “Don’t call the police, I don’t want to hurt Cindy’s family.” He said to Seller, “Nigel, I will remember you, you put me in gaol, you put me in gaol, I will come back.” This demonstrates whatever alcohol the prisoner had consumed that night, and I accept that he had consumed alcohol and he was to some extent intoxicated, that he still had the presence of mind to be able to threaten other people.
	
	
	He told Seller and Feng that the victim had tried to “stab me in the bedroom.” Whether that occurred I am unable to say but one would not rely upon the representations of the prisoner to be satisfied that it occurred and I repeat what the facts overwhelmingly establish and which the prisoner has never acknowledged and still refuses to acknowledge, that everything he did to the victim was completely disproportionate to any threat that she may have caused him. In any event she was defenceless.
	
	
	The prisoner left the house. He stopped next to the victim. Seller yelled out, “Trent, stop, you’ll kill her.” He then stomped on the victim’s head again. Again, I point out she was completely unconscious at this point. A number of other witnesses reported in the facts to have heard relevant things said or seen relevant events that support the accounts of Feng and Seller. One person jogging down Boundary Road in Mortdale heard a male voice yelling out, “Trent. Trent. Stop. Don’t Trent, you will kill her.” Another person saw the victim being stood over by the prisoner with the prisoner holding a ceramic pot in both his hands and throwing it down on her head. That person also saw the prisoner raise his leg and stomp it on the victim’s head repeatedly. These people remained, I must say, in the presence of these events until the police arrived.
	
	
	Another two people, an 18 year old and a 19 year old, apparently unrelated to the prisoner or anybody else associated with this incident, were walking down Boundary Road at the time of the incident. One of those men looked at the driveway of the house and saw the prisoner kicking the victim with his right foot as she was lying on the ground. The other person saw the prisoner stomping on something on the ground repeatedly. They realised after a while that in fact it was a person on the ground and they saw pieces of terracotta rubble lying around her body.
	
	
	Police attended. Eventually the prisoner was confronted. The prisoner showing absolutely no remorse for what he had done. He said this to the police, “Fuckin dumb bitch deserved it. She came at me with a knife. I’m the only reason she’s here from Tasmania anyway. She’s a fuckin psycho. I want to go, my mum’s coming.” The prisoner was told he was not going anywhere.
	
	
	You keep quiet, Mr Wainwright, thanks very much.
	
	
	Seller and Feng gave police permission to undertake their enquiries and the facts reveal other examinations, including the failure to find any knife or any other items of interest relevant to the claims of the prisoner. There was no knife or similar object found in the room where this dispute started. No knife was found anywhere in the premises that might have been relevant to the events I have outlined. The prisoner was taken to Hurstville Police Station. He declined to be interviewed. He gave no contemporaneous version save for what I have already indicated were the representations he made at the scene. Various enquiries were made both by DNA testing on shoes and the like. There were swabs taken from the prisoner. On the prisoner were photographed a number of scratches to the prisoner’s neck, right shoulder and chest.
	
	
	The broken pot pieces weighed a total of 6.8 kilograms. The average thickness of the broken pot pieces was between 20 and 25 millimetres. Various enquiries were made of the clothing of the victim and that examination reveals items or findings consistent with what the eyewitnesses had observed. The victim was taken away by ambulance after 2am. She was lying in a pool of blood around her head which was estimated to be approximately, as I understand it, a litre in quantity. There were broken pieces of terracotta around her head. Her hair was heavily matted with blood and there was blood on the terracotta pieces and I have seen photographs of the scene where she lay unconscious on the ground. She had major contusions to her face, eyes, ears and nose, and lacerations on her face. Her eyes were completely closed due to swelling.
	
	
	She was taken to the St George Hospital. Various examinations were undertaken both by X-ray and CT scan. She had lacerations on her scalp, on her face, including a 2 centimetre laceration to the side of the right eye, 3 centimetre laceration to the left eyebrow, a 5 centimetre laceration over the left mandible. She had two teeth that were loose and two teeth that were chipped. The CT scan revealed a facture through the right mandible and an undisplaced fracture measuring 10 millimetres to the left inferior orbital rim, that is the eye socket, with significant facial swelling and haematomas. An operation was performed on the victim to reduce the internal fixation of the right mandible and to repair the lacerations. The victim was on a liquid diet for four to six weeks, unable to open her mouth or chew. A few days after the operation she still had blurred vision and the stitches were eventually removed. The facial injuries were consistent with multiple blows to the face.
	
	
	There is a report from Dr Kelly Thornbury, a senior resident in plastic surgery, that sets out the detail of the injuries, particularly at para 7 and 8 of the statement consistent with the statement of facts. There is a further report which repeats much of what I have already outlined and some other information relating to medication and the like prepared by the Department of Plastic Surgery and Facio Maxillary Surgery at St George Hospital under the hand of Dr Thornbury which is in accord with the statement that has been prepared.
	
	
	I have a victim impact statement which I, of course, take into account as required under the legislation. The victim reflects upon the continuing disability that she suffers from and the emotional stress caused to her by the injuries inflicted by the prisoner. My understanding of the matter from the dental report which is attached reflects upon the fact that in December 2013 she continues to have extreme sensitivity in part of her dental structure and the victim will require more extensive treatment, particularly root canal therapy and possible removal of teeth in the future to repair the damage that is immediately attributable to the actions of the prisoner.
	
	
	I have a report from the Community Corrections Service of the Department of Corrections prepared on 3 June 2014. The prisoner was previously the subject of a bond given to him in 2005. I will deal with the detail of his criminal history shortly. During the course of that supervision from 2005 the prisoner did engage in both psychological and psychiatric treatment, and reports from medical health practitioners that were dealing with him indicated that the prisoner was willing to engage in treatment. There was a breach of the bond but no action was taken. The prisoner committed the current offence when not subject to conditional liberty. The prisoner advised the Community Corrections officer that his relationship with his mother, who strongly supports him, was estranged at times but still intact. The mother reported to the Corrections officer that whilst the prisoner living with her since his release on bail in 2012 was not physically aggressive, he was verbally aggressive but she would wish for him to return to her home on release.
	
	
	The evidence reveals that since being released to bail by the Supreme Court firstly in 2012, then again by the Supreme Court in 2014, the prisoner has largely been in receipt of a Carer’s pension looking after his mother who has a number of issues, including mental health issues. The prisoner gave the Community Corrections Service officer a history of drinking alcohol since the age of 16 but escalating consumption of alcohol occurred when the commenced working in the advertising and sales industry. He said to the officer that he had not consumed alcohol since being charged in relation to this matter. The prisoner made a claim to the Probation and Parole officer that on the night of the offence he had been socialising with work colleagues and had a belief that one of his beverages had been “spiked with an illicit substance.” I give no credence to that claim. It is a claim that does not fit with other histories that the prisoner has given in any event.
	
	
	The Community Corrections officer reviewed the history given by the prisoner of his past diagnosis, which I will deal with shortly, of borderline personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. These are largely reflected upon by Dr Jacmon, a psychologist retained primarily by the defence. No medication has been prescribed for these disorders when at large. In custody the prisoner has been prescribed some medication and has been compliant with his medication regime and he, the prisoner, indicated he was prepared to continue with this on his release to the community.
	
	
	The Community Corrections officer assessed the prisoner as at a medium risk of re-offending with a large number of needs to be addressed, including matters relating to his education, his associations, his consumption of alcohol, his emotional and personal relationships, amongst other matters, his supportive mother and his acknowledgement of his mental health conditions requiring assistance was noted, but he maintained his denial which is described as “categorical” concerning using excessive force against the victim. Another example of the prisoner failing to take responsibility for his conduct.
	
	
	The facts are overwhelming. Whatever the prisoner would say about the matter, he caused serious injury to the victim when she was in absolutely no condition to defend herself. He was considered at risk of reoffending should he consume alcohol and disengage from mental health treatment in the community and the Community Corrections officer said that particular attention on release to parole would need to be taken to his mental health.
	
	
	The prisoner’s criminal history reveals a number of findings of guilt recorded against him since he was a child. I have already indicated to the learned Crown that although there was a finding of guilt when he was 13 in respect of an offence of malicious wounding and for which he was placed on probation, but with the limited history I have of the matter suggests that it is a matter of no relevance in this proceeding save for the fact that it may reflect upon his inability to control himself. It clearly was not a serious crime at the time. He has other findings of guilt in the Children’s Court in relation to damaging property and resisting police.
	
	
	In 1998 he was convicted in the Local Court but still as a juvenile of acting in an offensive manner in public. He has a conviction, however, in 2005 for malicious wounding in the Local Court for which he was placed on a good behaviour bond, as I said earlier, for a period of two years with Probation and Parole supervision and particularly directions to receive psychiatric and psychological counselling, et cetera. That matter is commented upon the Community Corrections Service. That is the most serious conviction that is recorded. The facts of that matter were provided to me and I will come back to the facts of that matter as they are relevant to some of the matters raised by the Crown in a moment.
	
	
	The prisoner was born on 15 February 1982 and thus as I would calculate it, was about to turn 28 when charged in relation to the current matter in January 2010. He is the only child of his parents union and the evidence reveals that his mother was the subject of extreme domestic violence, as was the prisoner subjected to violence, and this has had a significant effect upon him throughout his life, particularly in the opinion of Dr Jacmon. Some aspects of the history of course are difficult to gauge given the hearsay character of the representations upon which the information is based. It is conceded in the material that he had behavioural problems at school and this was reflected in the medical treatment he received for what I understand to be ADHD and also for epilepsy. He obtained his School Certificate after changing schools at least a couple of times, leaving school eventually in Year 11 in 1997 to support his mother who had long separated from his violent father. He had a range of occupations. He worked in a computer shop as a sales assistant, worked at a store as a store person in a factory, worked at McDonald’s as part of a service crew, worked in a video rental shop. In about 2005 he worked in marketing, as I understand it, for a media firm as an account’s manager and this was the time that he increased his alcohol consumption.
	
	
	Since his release on bail, as I said, he has been on a Carer’s pension. He gave a history to Dr Jacmon of sexual assault by a neighbour and family friend when he was aged seven, and also by an older male teenager and other older boys in the neighbourhood. He said he was subject to frequent bullying and assaults at High School. He said he was assaulted with a baseball bat when he was 16. He was also assaulted at a service station in 2002 as the result of which someone was charged and convicted, and subject to another assault in 2002. I note the relevance of these matters to the assessment of Dr Jacmon. One might have thought although his conduct is contraindicative to this. That being a victim of an assault might have caused him to be more hesitant in assaulting somebody else. Dr Jacmon was of the view that these various physical and sexual assaults created a great deal of trauma and harm to the prisoner which was resistant to treatment.
	
	
	The prisoner has an interest in music and there is evidence of some accomplishment in that regard. He has had other relationships, one with a young woman in 2005 which was described as ‘stormy’. He in fact said in his history to Dr Jacmon that he met the victim in 2007 when he was performing as a musician in Tasmania but the renewed the friendship in 2009 and he gave various details of her conduct which I approach with considerable circumspection including claims of infidelity, drug use, violent mood changes and the like. He said that when he was living with her he was meeting her living expenses but the relationship soon destabilised. He said she was always checking on him. She was always enquiring about whether he was being unfaithful to her but he had affection for her which it must said is well portrayed by his conduct on the night of his arrest. He gave a history of matters relating to the issue of the incident the subject of a charge. He said that he had “patchy memories” of the incident.
	
	
	In relation to the prisoner there have been tendered, apart from Dr Jacmon’s report which is a psychologist’s report, many medical reports in this matter. Many of these predate the entering of the plea of guilty by the prisoner. A great deal of this material is material that was provided for the benefit of the Mental Health Review Tribunal. The material presents a complex and to some extent conflicting picture. It is very difficult to reconcile the various opinions that are expressed by different people.
	
	
	The history of the prisoner in terms of medical or psychological treatment, as I said earlier, is that he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder when he was seven and apparently was given a stimulant which I understand to be Ritalin until he was 14. He was also prescribed medication for epilepsy at the age of seven and has had epileptic episodes over a period of time. In 2005 at the age of 22 he attended a mental health facility in Canterbury in Sydney to seek help with depression and to receive assistance for what were described as post-traumatic stress problems. He was treated with antidepressant and an antianxiety drug and took that medication for a period of time before relying on natural therapies. He had never before prior to coming in to custody on this occasion been diagnosed with a psychotic illness and had no history of conduct whilst psychotic before coming into history.
	
	
	The assessment of his entry into custody taken by the then treating psychiatrist for Justice Health was that whilst when he came into custody he had persecutory and grandiose views and expressions. His presentations seem to be more related to personality issues than psychotic illness. He was not prescribed any particular treatment and he was eventually cleared, it was said, to return to the mainstream prison population. Although there is evidence that ultimately he received particular classification which I will deal with later on.
	
	
	He was seen by another psychiatrist who diagnosed an “adjustment reaction.” I take to him being in custody as being his first custody of any significance and a “maladaptive coping style.” Dr Adam Martin, who reported on the prisoner’s fitness to be tried, included specific matters obtained from the Justice Health records. He noted that Dr Dall had recorded the prisoner had presented with memory loss after his entry into custody in the form of “retrograde amnesia” but “was not acutely psychotic.” Another doctor, Dr Zhang, noted on 21 January 2010, this is five days after coming into custody, that there was a “diagnostic dilemma” and that the “differential diagnosis might include psychosis.”
	
	
	Dr Dall again noted in February that there was no evidence of psychosis or mood disorder. That his presentation was consistent with a possible “adjustment reaction,” a vulnerable personality, with “poor impulse control and maladaptive coping mechanisms.” Later on in March the same doctor noted no real psychotic phenomena, no evidence of mood disorder, mild anxiety and distress in relation to events leading to his arrest. He remained highly suggestible with multiple somatic and psychiatric symptoms across many domains. He does not have any symptoms, however, suggestive of any Axis 1 disorder, referring of course to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. His overall impression was “adjustment reaction, not psychotic, no evidence of mood disorder with a vulnerable personality with maladaptive coping strategies”, as he had earlier said. Dr Martin’s view was that having regard to the disturbed childhood taken from the history of the prisoner and as well as in adolescence and adulthood, and having come into mental health services from an earlier age with history of epilepsy, it was well known that epilepsy can be associated with psychological disturbance. But there was uncertainty about his diagnosis with references to the possibility of psychotic illness as well as what was referred to by Dr Dall, as the maladaptive coping traits and early maladjustment.
	
	
	He said in November 2011 that there was an overwhelming impression that his case had diagnostic uncertainty about his psychopathology. He thought at the time that the prisoner’s actions were in the context of what he described as “a rage” from a person with a “personality disorder, a tendency to impulsivity, poor coping skills, a history of threats and violence whilst intoxicated, rather than a direct result of psychosis in the context of a schizophrenic type illness”. It is that assessment that I agree with in the context of all the evidence.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen prepared a report in May 2011 directed at matters such as the prisoner’s fitness to be tried and or whether he had a defensive mental illness. He thought that the prisoner suffered from a psychotic illness, best described as a schizoaffective disorder with relating features of both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder as well as epilepsy. There is no other evidence in the history to support that conclusion.
	
	
	This was an assessment made by him at the time of interview, based upon interview and the history of symptoms expressed as recent, including bizarre persecutory beliefs, disorganisation in thinking, mildly elevated mood, et cetera. He noted the history of epilepsy and the history of psychotic illness and reported treatment for a disorder of attention and concentration whilst in childhood. Dr Nielssen made some comments about the complexity of epilepsy, the effect of partial seizures and the like, the possibility of relapsing psychotic illness, secondary to temporal lobe epilepsy.
	
	
	He also noted the claims of amnesia by the prisoner and said that recovery of memory, which was claimed by the prisoner several months after the events, was “inconsistent with the usual understanding of memory formulation as to the failure to register events because of the effect of seizure activity.”
	
	
	He formed the view that the prisoner was mentally ill at the time of the offence, a claim never made in any Court as far as I am aware, and no suggestion was made in the course of the last 18 months that the prisoner was relevantly mentally ill by any legal representative that the prisoner has had. The doctor expressed uncertainty as to whether his beliefs about the victim were delusional or not. This was a view also commented upon in the same terms by Dr Martin in July 2011 where he reflected upon the claims of infidelity by the victim as being “Not necessarily delusional in origin even if incorrect.”
	
	
	The issue of the victim’s infidelity, if that is the correct expression, is of no moment in this case having regard to the conduct of the prisoner to the victim after she was rendered unconscious. Dr Martin was not of the view that the prisoner was mentally ill. He formed the view that the prisoner had reasons for acting as he did, he felt justified in his conduct, he acknowledged he was intoxicated, he acknowledged that the assault occurred during an escalating argument in the background of “volatile relationship” and that “the prisoner had a disposition to anger and threatening behaviour.” These aspects of the matter were inconsistent with mental illness. Clearly that is so, having regard to the totality of the evidence, including the medical opinions.
	
	
	He could not see any evidence of the prisoner being manic prior to the alleged offence, nor any contemporary observations of the prisoner consistent with mental illness and he did not thing the prisoner suffered a major illness at the time of his incarceration. Martin saw the prisoner again in July 2012 and noted the absence of any psychotic features.
	
	
	Dr White(?) also reported to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. He could not diagnose Mr Wainwright with any Axis 1 condition. He was not suffering any psychotic symptoms at the time of assessment. He thought that any mood instability was more in keeping with that seen with people that had been subject to abuse in childhood and he said that there were borderline personality disorder in the prisoner, instability of mood, instability of self-image, ambivalence in several areas, including career and relationships. He also said, other elements in his personality could include narcissistic and paranoid traits, and these may give rise to the presence of paranoid or grandiose, expression, particularly in periods of extreme stress. The prisoner presented in November 2011 as being persecuted and grandiose but he was still fit to be tried.
	
	
	I note when he was released on bail he undertook a number of sessions of psychological counselling through Dr Jacmon and responded to that counselling and was diligent in his attendance. Dr Jacmon regarded his reporting and his response as “exemplary” and I have taken that into account. Dr Jacmon presented a further report in March 2014 and his assessment on the history given to him by the prisoner and his clinical assessment was that the offender’s day to day functioning was impaired by clinically significant borderline personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, what the psychologist described as “major depressive disorder” and generalised “anxiety disorder.”
	
	
	He noted that borderline personality disorder was a lifelong disorder with no effective treatment other than management. It arose in adolescence and could be a result of childhood sexual assault or violence from his father and violence he saw perpetrated against his mother, as was the symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder. His borderline personality led to an instability in mood, interpersonal relationships and self-image and the PTSD worsened these impairments. He noted that the prisoner’s treatment under his care and counselling was of assistance in safeguarding the prisoner against the manifestation of what he called “risky behaviour” and he suggested a future treatment plan based upon what is called cognitive behaviour therapy, the plan that he had undertaken throughout 2012.
	
	
	This psychologist has treated the prisoner for quite a long period of time and has treated the mother. He noted the dynamic of their relationship revolves around the fact that he was the only person close to his mother and that she had suffered severe psychological trauma stemming from her own violent marriage, and her symptoms served to trigger his own memories of the incidence that he had suffered from as a child. He noted his mother tended to be overprotective and he thought in some ways that she was trying to control him as though he was still a child.
	
	
	The last piece of evidence, extensive as it is, that I was referred to is a report that was tendered from Dr John Roberts who assessed the prisoner on 11 April 2013 when the prisoner was on bail. Much of that material contained within that report relates to views formed based upon information given by the prisoner. The prisoner gave a history to Dr Roberts in relation to the events giving rise to the charge, claiming that the victim had mental health issues, again, reiterating that she chased him with a knife and other allegations made against her about her conduct without reflecting upon his own conduct. Dr Roberts himself made a reference to the prisoner’s “self-righteous justification.” He, the prisoner, claimed to Dr Roberts that he could recall the victim falling but that she was still conscious and he claimed, which in my view is certainly observed when one has regard to the totality of the material that the case against him was based upon corruption and that he had been “set up.”
	
	
	He claimed “no recollection” of the incidents for which he was to appear in Court for over six months, but then he said memories came back to him. He said the prisoner was a garrulous person whose manner suggested an attempt to “ingratiate.” Sometimes he presented with evidence of possible thought disorder, other times that appeared to be absent. The content of his thinking suggested potentially a delusional state. This is at the time of presentation in April 2013.
	
	
	Dr Roberts referred to Dr Nielssen’s report and he came to the view, ultimately in April 2013, that the prisoner was unfit to stand trial, an issue never raised at any time subsequent to that report being made available to his legal representatives. He claimed the prisoner was then incapable of issuing instructions and made other observations which ultimately would appear to me to be irrelevant to this matter given the matters that I now have to decide. As I said, at the heel of the hunt when it was tendered it posited matters that have never been seriously advanced to this Court since April 2013 and have not been advanced by the herd of barristers that have appeared for him.
	
	
	Dr Roberts does not express any particular opinions of any value about the prisoner’s mental state at the time of the offending, he seems to be concentrating more on the state of the prisoner at the time of presentation. Ultimately, whilst I note what the doctor says, it is of little value in assessing the mental state of the prisoner at the time of the offending.
	
	
	The conclusion I reach is that the medical material and the view of the treating psychologist speaks of mental and psychological issues that may be seen as relevant to the offending, emanating primarily, from what I see, as his borderline personality disorder and the possible complications arising from the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. The anxiety and depressive symptoms would appear to be reactive to circumstances at the time of the subsequent assessments to the commission of the offence.
	
	
	There is no contemporaneous observation or record of psychotic symptoms and in my view no reliable evidence of any psychotic illness underlying or causing the prisoner’s conduct.
	
	
	I appreciate it is reported that the prisoner has from time to time had delusional beliefs after the event, but in the context of the observations of the eyewitnesses and the conduct of the prisoner that is established through the facts, the conduct of the prisoner subsequently very much falls within the realm of self-justification and the avoidance of responsibility. This is emphasised by the many versions that the prisoner has given to different people.
	
	
	If I could turn now to the conviction for malicious wounding. As I said, the facts of that were made available to the Court. I do not propose to go through the detail of it beyond saying that on 27 February 2005 the prisoner was in a hotel, he had an argument with a man when some beer was spilt and ultimately he confronted that man while he held two glasses in his hands. He hit the victim with the two glasses, one at a time, shattering one glass on the victim’s head, the victim suffered some lacerations. It would appear the victim and the prisoner were affected by alcohol. It would appear that there was to be fairly said, a degree of conflict between the two of them that was not entirely one sided. The prisoner told the custody officer when he was arrested that he had “lost it” but also said that he had acted in self-defence. Ultimately he conceded to the police that his actions may not have been reasonable.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the convictions of the prisoner, particularly, his conviction for this malicious wounding offence gave rise to the consideration that arises in s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 of an aggravating factor from the fact of previous convictions when being sentenced for a serious personal violence offence. I have had some brief discussion about that with learned counsel, and to be fair, learned counsel for the prisoner has helpfully drawn my attention to the Interpretation Act. It would appear that the use of the word “convictions” is not a literal statement and a single conviction might relevantly serve the purpose identified under subpara (d).
	
	
	Ultimately, I have concluded by reason of the finding of guilt and conviction for malicious wounding that the prisoner’s criminal history does not entitle him to any particular leniency, but I could not conclude, notwithstanding the fact that this is a personal violence offence of a serious character and the other offence was a serious personal violence offence, that his criminal history is one that leads to the aggravation that may be found under s 21A(2)(d). I find this for the reason that it was an offence committed in very different circumstances than the current one and it involved a dispute between two adult males when affected by alcohol. It lacked many of the features that would aggravate the current matter. It would appear not to be in any way related to any psychological or mental condition that the prisoner suffered and it was to be fairly said in the context of his other criminal histories, a singular event some years before this offending. The victim in that other matter was not vulnerable, the offence involved no planning, although it is fairly to be said that there is no planning in the offence with which I am concerned.
	
	
	With regard to the matters that arise under s 21A(2) I note that the offence was committed against the victim in her home, subpara (eb). On the other hand, of course, it was also the home of the prisoner. I also note that the injury and the emotional harm to the victim has been substantial as the facts reveal without need to rely upon the untested victim impact statement, but of course grievous bodily harm and the natural sequelae of that are very much an element of the offence attracting the relevant maximum penalty in the standard non-parole period. Thus to say, I believe this is not a relevant aggravating factor given that the Court is not to have any additional regard to an aggravating factor that forms and element of the offence. The victim was a young woman, that would not make her vulnerable. I appreciate at the time of the commencement of this assault she was not vulnerable. But it is fairly to be said, that at the time that she was stomped upon and the pot was thrown against her head, she was clearly vulnerable because she was unconscious and that is a matter that speaks eloquently in the facts that are provided and one does not have to turn to s 21A(2) to reach that conclusion.
	
	
	With regard to mitigating factors that arise under s 21A(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the primary mitigating factor is that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. It clearly was, on the part of the prisoner, a loss of control, if not spontaneous, certainly reactive to a domestic dispute. I am not in any way indicating at all that the prisoner was justified in using any violence against the victim, nor that any violence is ever justified in the course of a dispute, such as he and the victim had.
	
	
	In any event, the prisoner’s reaction to whatever claimed provocation of the victim was clearly completely disproportionate. Pushing her out of the house may be one thing. As she fell and struck her head on the steps that was not an intended consequence by the prisoner. But the evidence is overwhelming that from then on the prisoner acted deliberately in the face of pleas by people to stop. He acted deliberately in stomping on her head and hitting her with a clay pot when she could not protect herself.
	
	
	In any event, the other mitigating factor is the plea of guilty. For that, the prisoner is entitled to a discount, in my view, of 10%. The Crown suggested the range of discount available under the ‘guideline judgment’ of R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 was between 5 and 10%. It was acknowledged in submissions by Mr Ozen that the discount would be at the lower end of the discretionary range. This is a matter where the prisoner pleaded the day after the trial was to start. In my view, in accordance with the guideline judgment of R v Thomson; R v Houlton given the discretion that exists, a prisoner should receive the benefit of the discount of 10%, recommended within the guideline by the Court of Criminal Appeal, notwithstanding what has happened since the plea was entered.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of remorse, in my view, the prisoner has not provided evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions. He barely acknowledges the injury, loss and damage that has been caused to the victim, nor has he endeavoured to provide any reparation for damage or loss suffered by the victim. He has written a note to the Court and through his counsel has expressed his regret. But this expression of regret is not timely, it is incomplete in the context of the prisoner’s other conduct in the course of the proceedings, and it is to be borne in mind, of course, the contemporary remarks he made proven by independent witnesses that he thought the victim deserved what she got.
	
	
	I wish to deal in this context with the history of the matter, some of which I have earlier referred to. Whilst the prisoner pleaded guilty on 19 February 2013, since that time the delay in the matter has largely been contributed to by the conduct of the prisoner. The prisoner filed a motion and sought to rely upon some evidence in support of that motion to go behind the plea of guilty. The case was delayed time and time again whilst that evidence was gathered. In part, the fault may not have been with the prisoner of course, it may have been with his legal representatives. But be that as it may, ultimately on 16 December 2013 the prisoner withdrew his application and it never was determined by the Court, the Court was quite satisfied that he withdrew that application voluntarily. The matter was then ultimately adjourned until March 2014.
	
	
	The statement of facts which was tendered on 14 March 2014 the prisoner had ample opportunity to read through and comment upon as I noted last Friday.
	
	
	In fact the exhibit was marked by him in his handwriting and I faithfully recorded on the exhibit the matters that the prisoner identified that were “in dispute”, or with which he “disagreed.” The matters that he either disputed or disagreed with were relatively minor matters. They are so minor I have no need to rely upon the Crown’s version in that regard. The document that eventually settled in my own hand was checked with both the Crown and the defence. The prisoner had been given a copy of the statement of facts and was able to mark it freely. The matter was then further adjourned for reasons that were not the fault of the accused. One of those adjournments was because counsel for the prisoner fell ill. Then the matter was adjourned for a further two months whilst I was out of the jurisdiction and that is a delay I regret.
	
	
	When the matter came back before me last Friday on 6 June the prisoner appeared, as I have earlier mentioned, represented by at least the third barrister that has appeared for him in front of me, and at least the third solicitor since the matter came before me last year. The prisoner had written a letter addressed to the Court, a copy of which I gave back to his counsel. He had not seen it. I looked at the letter in anticipation of it being acted upon by the prisoner. That letter addressed to the Court and delivered to my chambers, without any solicitation on my part, generally indicated that the prisoner wanted to vacate the plea of guilty and also asked me to disqualify myself. Ultimately, learned counsel for the prisoner pressed the issue of further consideration of the circumstances in which the plea of guilty was entered, or particularly the facts were tendered, the application for me to disqualify myself contained within the document was not pressed.
	
	
	In relation to this matter I was told it that it was desired to adduce evidence or to find evidence that may be available from two medical practitioners, including Dr Roberts, that when the prisoner appeared at Court on 16 December to withdraw his application to vacate the plea of guilty he was in no mental state to make that decision. I was not prepared to adjourn the matter any further. Given the unconscionable delays that have occurred up until the present time it was not appropriate. But there are other reasons for refusing the application. One of the matters counsel for the prisoner wanted to raise with the Court was matters arising out of an opportunity for him not having been in Court to check the transcript of events that happened in past proceedings. The learned Crown Prosecutor, in my view, had a recollection of relevant events in accordance with my own. As to the claim that there may be medical evidence relevant to the issue of whether the prisoner was fit to instruct his counsel to withdraw his application to go behind the plea of guilty, I was of the view that no adjournment should be granted to pursue the matter on a number of bases.
	
	
	Firstly, although I am not a medical practitioner, when he appeared on 16 December 2013 the prisoner gave absolutely no indication of any mood disorder or mental instability or any incapacity to understand what was going on in Court or to respond to questions directed at him by myself. There was nothing in his behaviour whatsoever to suggest any instability at all. Throughout the proceedings, knowing the background of the matter, I have been concerned to ensure the prisoner understood what was happening and understood the effect of matters conveyed to me by his counsel. The fact that it was suggested he might not have been able to appreciate the proceedings on 16 December, or lack capacity to give instructions to have his application to vacate the plea withdrawn was undermined by his conduct on 14 March 2014. He was here in Court when the Crown tendered the statement of facts. As I said earlier, he was given an opportunity to read through the statement of facts, he gave indication of what he disagreed with. I agreed in his presence to mark those matters on the statement of facts and I have already made comments about that matter.
	
	
	No indication was given on that date by the prisoner, who is quite capable of speaking from the dock and has done so throughout the proceedings or through his counsel, that he would wish to withdraw his plea at that point or expressed any lack of understanding of what was happening at that particular point of time.
	
	
	One matter relied upon in support of the application for the adjournment was a letter apparently written by one of the solicitors for the prisoner to the DPP in March 2014. That letter is an exhibit in this Court. As I pointed out to counsel for the prisoner, most of it is unintelligible. But what I can discern from the letter refers to nothing about the prisoner’s mental state or any of the differing diagnosis that indicated on the part of the prisoner an understanding of the effect of his plea or his withdrawal of his application to go behind the plea of guilty.
	
	
	It seems to me, with respect, having regard to the overall history about which I am aware, and which his counsel now appearing may not be aware, that the prisoner has continually sought to delay these proceedings. Whether he is a procrastinator, a prevaricator, a dissembler of the facts and the truth, or simply a time waster and a responsibility avoider, it is difficult to conclude. But with the greatest of respect to him the tactic of seeking to go behind his plea of guilty was, with the wisdom of hindsight I now have and my knowledge of all that has gone before today, in my view a deliberate attempt to delay the inevitable and a deliberate attempt by him to avoid responsibility for his actions which he has continued to do by the various claims he has made, including a claim of a lack of memory of relevant events. This was demonstrated by the claim through his counsel that he disputed matters claimed to have been said to him by the Community Corrections officer reported in the Community Corrections report in the section under the heading “Attitude to Offending.”
	
	
	As I said earlier, I do not have a transcript of the proceedings last Friday. But initially counsel for the prisoner, as I understood it, obviously on instructions because the prisoner was very vociferously shouting instructions from the bar table and also had the opportunity to confer with his counsel for half an hour in private, indicated that he did not agree with what the Corrections officer had written. When I quizzed his counsel about what precisely was the character of the dispute, believing not unreasonably that the officer would not invent an entire account by the prisoner of his attitude to the offending in the report, it turned out that the main area of dispute was the claim in the report that the prisoner “categorically denied assaulting the victim with the pot plant or stepping on her head.”
	
	
	It was put to the Court that the position of the prisoner was that whilst he took responsibilities for his actions he had no memory of hitting her with the pot plant or stomping on her head. I do not accept that.
	
	
	The prisoner has not given evidence before me. These claims are untested, as are his claims of regret. I appreciate much of the prisoner’s conduct is very much dictated by the conditions that are outlined in the various reports and his inability really to, in some respects, control himself in some situations. It was conceded when counsel was pressed on the matter in relation to the issue of lack of memory, that the prisoner did have memory of other events leading up to the aspect of the assault. When a judge is confronted with a person who has memory of particular events and then conveniently does not have a memory of the key events, one must approach those claims of lack of memory with considerable circumspection. One does not need an expert to assist one in relation to the question of memory formulation, but I do note that the query that even Dr Nielssen had about the prisoner’s claims of lack of memory recovery.
	
	
	As I said earlier, the prisoner wrote a letter to the Court reiterating that he took responsibility for his actions and said he was sorry. I have a taken that matter into account and it may well have been written in good faith at that time but as I said it very much is at odds with the way the matter is conducted, it is very much at odds with some of the contemporaneous expressions of the prisoner and some of his comments made to various doctors over a period of time.
	
	
	The prisoner is captive to his psychological or psychiatric conditions from which he does or may suffer. But in light of what happened last Friday and the specific instructions that were conveyed to me by his counsel I detect in the prisoner’s prevarication and delaying tactics an element of deliberation and an unwillingness to face the reality of the situation, notwithstanding the claims in his note. The prisoner has fully understood the fact that he faces a significant period of imprisonment and it is in this context that one looks at the circumstances in which he went to the Supreme Court and sought bail knowing the basis upon which bail had been refused by me.
	
	
	I understand, of course, on the part of the prisoner there will be a degree of frustration from delay, a substantial body of which, I should say is not of his making. I will take the delay into account, the delay caused by the issue of his fitness to be tried and some of the delay occurring up to the present time. Many of these matters I have already outlined and some delays were caused by the charging of the prisoner with another offence which was dismissed. It is correct that a delay in sentencing is a relevant matter to be taken into account. It leaves a prisoner in a state of uncertainty but the prisoner has also contributed to that situation. I have already dealt with the issue of the time spent in custody.
	
	
	With regard to the submissions of his counsel, he accepted in his submission that it was an extremely serious offence, having regard to the extent of injury to the victim. I was asked to take into account the state of intoxication and what was regarded the underlying medical condition of the prisoner. Much reliance was placed upon the analysis of Dr Nielssen and some of the findings of Dr Martin. It was submitted at the time of the commission of the offence that the prisoner was “not thinking straight.”It was submitted that he had not formed an intent to hurt his partner any lengthy period before the relevant events. I certainly accept that latter submission that his intention to hurt his partner which he has admitted was formulated a brief time before he executed the crime. As I have said, the prisoner did not commit a planned crime and he acted in a violent way for a limited period of time.
	
	
	As for subjective matters, submissions were made about the plea of guilty which I have already dealt with, the mental state of the prisoner which I have already summarised and discussion was had about the observations of Chief Justice Gleeson in Engert, the 1995 decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal which I will deal with shortly. It was submitted that the prisoner was not at risk of further offending because he was responsive to medication and if able to avoid intoxication he can proceed with his rehabilitation, as reported by the Community Corrections officer. With regard to the previous conviction for malicious wounding, it was pointed out it was a different category of offending. By my earlier findings, I have taken into account what counsel has put to me. Reference was made to the circumstances of the prisoner’s custody, both by way of reason of media, attention to the case and by reason of his classification. If I may deal with that matter just briefly.
	
	
	Today I have been given additional evidence that shows the prisoner over a period of time has been classified as SMAP, that is, a Special Management Area Placement. I am told from the bar table, and I accept, that this is some form of protective custody and there is a record that I have seen in the exhibit tendered showing that the prisoner in April was in a particular POD where people were held with three levels of protection. I accept by definition that the prisoner’s presence in protection will place restrictions upon his movement and restrictions upon his access to programs. This is a matter of course that has been the subject of attention by the Court of Criminal Appeal on a number of occasions.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of being in protection, in the decision of Totten ([2003] NSWCCA 207) the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the sentencing Judge had erred in failing to take into account the circumstances that at least part of the sentence, and the prisoner already has served part of the sentence, a substantial part of it, in protective custody. This is relevant both to the determination of the length of the sentence and as to whether there were special circumstances pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Justice James in that judgment said;
	


“Notwithstanding the difficulties in a sentencing judge taking into account, especially without the benefit of evidence, a circumstance that part or all of any sentence of imprisonment imposed is likely to be served in some form of protective custody, I consider that it is a well entrenched principle that it is a circumstance that a sentencing judge should take into account, in favour of the prisoner, both as to the length of the sentence and the non-parole period.”


	
	Of course the weight to be given to the matter will depend on the facts of the particular case, as was discussed in many of the other cases, including Mostyn and El Hani, two decisions from 2004.
	
	
	Of course the evidence is incomplete, although the prisoner’s legal representatives have done everything they can within their earthly power to provide evidence to the Court over a short period of time. One of the difficulties for a sentencing judge is, of course, I do not know what the future holds for the prisoner once he is sentenced and perhaps his protected status will be removed from him, but I can only deal with the matter as the evidence has revealed it to be and I am prepared to give weight to what has been put to me by his counsel in the context of the principles laid down in Totten.
	
	
	In relation to the Crown’s submission, the Crown submitted that there was no causal connection between the mental condition of the prisoner and the commission of the offence. This was an offence, the Crown said, where the real contributing factors were the consumption of alcohol, the argument with the prisoner’s partner, a loss of control resulting in sustained violence. If I could just pause for a moment.
	
	
	Having regard to the medical evidence, pointing as it does in some parts in differing directions, whilst I accept the general analysis of the Crown, one of the issues that I conclude in favour of the prisoner is that contributing to the prisoner’s reaction to circumstances, that were not as he would assert them to be, were the underlying psychological conditions arising from both the borderline personality disorder and the history of post-traumatic stress disorder, and his inability thus to control himself. The Crown submitted that a substantial sentence is required both as to the head sentence and the non-parole period. I did not hear the Crown to argue against a finding of special circumstances as was submitted by the counsel for the prisoner, and I have already referred to the Crown submissions on the discount.
	
	
	Neither counsel specifically addressed the issue of standard non parole periods and the current legislation in relation to this matter. In fairness to counsel after several hours, or at least two hours, of toing and froing, the submissions of the parties did not really start until about 4 o’clock and did not conclude until 4.40pm on the Friday afternoon. The failure to address that matter was more the fault of the Court in not asking the right questions. I note the Crown submissions that the attack was a vicious attack even if not planned upon a defenceless person, and I have already made comment upon that and I have already commented upon the issue of the criminal history being an aggravating factor or not.
	
	
	Turning to the standard non-parole period. Section 54A(2) now provides that for the sentencing of an offender a standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the Table of the Division, taking into account only the “objective factors” affecting the relative seriousness of the offence in determining whether the offence is in the middle range of objective seriousness. Section 54B(2) provides;
	


“The standard non-parole period for an offence is a matter to be taken into account by a court in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender, without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender.”


	
	A recent addition of the Judicial Bulletin in commentary notes that the new legislation which came into effect on 29 October 2013 emphasises that the statutory scheme is concerned with an assessment on facts relating only to the “objective factors” and those matters are in accordance with the decision of Muldrock v R are matters which do not involve any matters personal to a particular offender.
	
	
	In Mr Muldrock’s instance (Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120), he was mentally disabled. The Court held that moral culpability was a matter to be considered in sentencing independently of the objective facts and could be a matter of significance as was identified in Muldrock at [58] and recently discussed in the decisions of Bugmy v R [2013] HCA 37, particularly at [44] - [46] and Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38 at [57]. In Muldrock it was held by the High Court that the offender’s mental condition limited his moral culpability and required less emphasis to be played on denunciation and retribution, and in some respects that aspect of the matter reflects what was said in decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal that have been summarised in the decision of Hemsley in 2004 and De La Rosa, a Crown appeal from 2010. As the authorities have held since the new legislation has come into force, the new legislation evinces an intention on the part of the legislature that the standard non-parole period is not to have determinative significance on the sentencing exercise but it is a matter to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence with the holistic approach recommended by the High Court in Markarian v R, (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51].
	
	
	I was referred to the decision of Elturk [2014] NSWCCA 61 in relation to the issue of moral culpability of the prisoner when a person’s mental state, particularly mental instability, arises for consideration as being relevant to sentencing. In that judgment the Court of Criminal Appeal, consistent with Muldrock and other decisions held that whilst an accused had expressly waived his claim of a plea of not guilty by reason of mental illness touching upon his criminal responsibility, he had not waived his right to have his mental illness considered as a causal factor in the commission of the offence.
	


“His mental state at the time of offending was relevant to the assessment of his moral culpability and the objective seriousness of the offence.”


	
	This proposition I naturally accept. 
	
	
	In that matter, however, there was absolutely no doubt that the person was suffering from a major mental illness, or a relapsing psychotic illness with features of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. I point out that the learned sentencing Judge disavowed the causal connection of the mental illness. He sentenced the prisoner to a total of eight years imprisonment. That sentence was reduced by the Court of Criminal Appeal to six and a half years imprisonment.
	
	
	In that matter the applicant had a history of mental illness for many years. His mother suffered from schizophrenia which had been diagnosed upon her when the prisoner was an infant. The prisoner or the appellant in that matter had approximately seven admissions to psychiatric hospitals in various states, including two as an involuntary patient and had for a long time been prescribed antipsychotic medication. Some hospitalisations were for up to three months. He was receiving before he committing the crime for which he was convicted long acting injections as a condition of a community treatment order. All of these features, of course, are absent here.
	
	
	He attacked his father, who described him at the time of committing the offences, having “an emotionless and expressionless face, appearing as if he was in a trance.” The prisoner told his father he had stabbed him with a knife because he had to do it because he was “the devil.” The prisoner had not slept for four nights preceding the commission of the offence, he was bizarre and unfocussed. He told interviewing police that he had a sickness in himself and he could not control himself.
	
	
	All these matters might be compared to what can be seen of the state of the prisoner. The prisoner in that matter had in the diagnosis of the doctor who viewed the electronic interview, a “chronic mental illness.”
	
	
	The Court cited what the Muldrock v R majority had discussed (at [54]) about moral culpability and that assessing the moral culpability of the prisoner was an important task. If, in the case of Elturk, his moral culpability was significantly diminished by reason of his illness, in this case whilst I accept that there is some diminution of moral responsibility in the context of psychological conditions in part caused by events beyond the prisoner’s control, the diminution is slight.
	
	
	I know the matter of Elturk was not necessarily raised for comparative purposes, I have already referred to the fact of the sentence being reduced from eight years to six and a half years. The matter to which the prisoner pleaded guilty was, if not identical, a similar offence to the current offence with the same maximum penalty and the same standard non-parole period.
	
	
	In that regard I note at [41] of the decision of Elturk a discussion by the learned President of the Court of Appeal of the statistics provided to the Court concerning the sentencing for offences under s 33(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900. Of course this offender pleads guilty to an offence under s 33(1)(b). Those statistics revealed that in the period from February 2008 to June 2013, 85% of persons sentenced for an offence for an offence under this provision received a sentence of less than eight years, even with pleas of guilty, and various other observations are made. This was to draw the Court’s attention to the fact that the sentence imposed by the learned Judge at first instance was out of kilter, in any event, with the range of sentences imposed for such offending.
	
	
	I have not been aided by any specific statistics in relation to an offence under subpara (b), but in the context of concluding by reference to the injuries the victim suffered and the lack of planning of the offence that the offence is within the middle range of objective seriousness, perhaps towards the upper end of that but not beyond the middle range, I have at least had some regard to what information is available in the decision of Elturk.
	
	
	In sentencing the prisoner of course I have had regard to the purposes of sentencing. There is a need for an element of general deterrence and specific deterrence. At the moment I do not believe the community needs protection from the offender and I do not believe the prisoner presents a risk to the victim. I am required to promote his rehabilitation and make him accountable for his actions. This does bring me back, of course, to consideration of the principles that were discussed in Engert and summarised in the decisions of Hemsley to which I earlier referred and De La Rosa.
	
	
	In De La Rosa the learned Chief Judge at Common Law went into the matter in some detail, but generally speaking there is a range or authority that says that where a person’s mental illness or disability contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way the moral culpability may be reduced, there may not then be the same call for denunciation and punishment, or as much weight placed upon the general deterrence and may moderate that consideration.
	
	
	In this particular matter the condition is not one that calls for a reduction upon the weight to be given to general deterrence, although the moral culpability issue I have already dealt with. I appreciate the prisoner by reason of his personality and the matters adverted to in the medical reports may have difficulties in custody that may not be promoted sufficiently by available resources. I do not believe, subject to supervision, that the prisoner is a danger to the community. On the other hand there is, it must be said in the way in which the prisoner has conducted himself some need to have regard to the specific deterrence of the prisoner by any penalty that the Court imposes. I am required to recognise the harm done to the victim of course and make the prisoner accountable for his crime even if he refuses to take full responsibility.
	
	
	It is thus, in all these circumstances, that I have concluded that the appropriate penalty to be imposed for this matter with the discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty is the sentence of eight years and one month commencing from 31 October 2011. I fix a non-parole period of five years to commence from 31 October 2011 and expiring on 30 October 2016. The balance of sentence will be three years and one month. I have made a finding of special circumstances. The prisoner will need an extended period of time to adjust to community living. He will also need an extended period of time of supervision to assist him in relation to access to mental health and psychological counselling and treatment, and also to receive appropriate direction in relation to the use or misuse of alcohol.
	
	
	The call for special circumstances as made by his counsel is also supported by the evidence about his current classification. I think the matter, however, is fairly summarised in the Community Corrections report. As to whether the prisoner is released at the end of the non-parole period will be a matter for the Parole Authority.
	
	
	Thus, the prisoner is convicted. You can stand up, thanks very much. He is sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period for a period of five years to date from 31 October 2011, expiring on 30 October 2016. The balance of sentence will be three years and one month. That balance of sentence will expire on 29 November 2019. Yes. You can take a seat, thanks very much.
	
	
	Mr Crown, any technical matters?
	
	
	BOWERS: I’ve nothing to raise, thank you, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Any technical matters, Mr Rosen.
	
	
	OZEN: No, thank you.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you. Mr Wainwright, you can go with the officers, thanks very much.

		23 November 2015",2014-06-11 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704942,R v Pearman [2014] NSWDC 164,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: I gave John Ward Pearman the benefit of a suspended sentence on 7 June 2013. At the time I told him that if I was forced to send him to gaol he would only have himself to blame. I now am going to send him to gaol and it is entirely true that Mr Pearman only has himself to blame.

2He came before me originally for offences involving drug supply and the possession of a prohibited weapon, namely a taser. I granted him bail under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to allow him to enter residential rehabilitation. He completed that program satisfactorily, and was in the community for some time before he came back before me on 7 June 2013 for sentence.

3I have re-read my remarks on sentence from that day. There is a flavour of some scepticism about some of the evidence that was given to me about whether Mr Pearman had genuinely given up drugs completely. For that reason I made it a condition of the bond that he undergo regular urinalysis. It appears that he never got the chance to undergo regular urinalysis because only 12 days after I put him on a s 12 bond and warned him that he would go to gaol if he so much as used drugs, he was arrested in possession of drugs, which he had for the purposes of supply, and once again he was in possession of a prohibited weapon, namely a taser.

4So a mere twelve days after I gave him the benefit of an order under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for two counts of supplying a prohibited drug and possessing a prohibited weapon, he committed another offence of supplying a prohibited drug and possessing a prohibited weapon. Mr Pearman has thumbed his nose at the law. 

5It is conceded, of course, that I must now revoke the order for suspension for the matters I dealt with in June 2013 and sentence him to imprisonment for the new offences. I will explain the circumstances of the new offences.

6Police wanted to stop a car driven by the offender with his friend in the passenger seat. They wanted to subject Mr Pearman to a random breath test. It took some time for him to stop his vehicle. When they did, police, for obvious reasons, decided to search Mr Pearman and the vehicle. 

7Police found a large number of offending items. In particular they found 7.99 grams of methylamphetamine. Mr Pearman, by his plea of guilty, admits that he had that drug in his possession for the purposes of supply. Relatively small, though, that quantity is, it is to be noted that it was of quite high purity and that at the same time police discovered something in the order of $10,000 cash.

8Police also found a small quantity of cocaine, a small quantity of heroin and a small quantity of cannabis. The possession of those drugs is on a form 1 attached to the offence of supplying the methylamphetamine..

9Drug paraphernalia was found as well, syringes, a small spoon, scales and, most importantly for the purpose of the supply matter, large numbers of resealable bags. Police discovered that the taser was operational.

10The offender has a lengthy criminal history. Not surprisingly he has also a history of drug use extending over some considerable period of time.

11His upbringing was described as chaotic. He was sexually abused as a young boy. Indeed he told a psychiatrist that he attributes most of his history of substance abuse to the sexual abuse he experienced as a child and his attempts to block out memories of that terrible time.

12After leaving school he had a large number of jobs and married and has two children who are, and have been for a while, in the custody of his parents.

13What appears to have led to the cessation of his ability to be employed was a significant motorbike accident the offender suffered in 2005. He was significantly injured and has a number of ongoing consequences. He has persistent urinary incontinence, persistent lower back pain and pelvic pain. 

14The difficulty he has obtaining pain killing drugs, the difficulty he has obtaining incontinence pads and the embarrassing consequences mean that he will do his time in custody harder than would be the case if he were in the general prison population. I will take that matter significantly into account in his favour.

15Also in the offender's favour is the circumstance that he did make a concerted effort to put his drug using days behind him. He completed the residential rehabilitation program when many people do not. He appears to have been for some indeterminate time, been able to remain drug free upon his release from that residential rehabilitation program. Those efforts are to be noted and they are to be rewarded. I have taken them into account in assessing the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender for these new offences.

16I note also that the offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. The sentences I impose upon these new matters will thus be 25% less than they would otherwise have been.

17These are, of course, serious offences. As was conceded, general deterrence is of significant importance in offences of this kind. Time without number judges comment on the close relationship between drug use and crime in the community. Drug users can rarely fund their habits through lawful sources. Drug users tend to lie, cheat, deceive, rob, burgle and commit all manner of offences in their desperate need to obtain money to satisfy their desperate need for drugs. Drugs are terrible things. They greatly affect, in a terribly harmful way, the people who use them and they greatly affect the community in general and its individual members.

18Drug dealing is an offence which almost always must have as its prime focus, general deterrence. But personal deterrence is also important in this matter. The offender's lengthy history of offending and his attitude towards the lenient sentence I imposed upon him demonstrate a need for him to have brought home to him, in the most concrete way, the consequences of his continuing criminal activity. The sentence I imposed upon him earlier focused on his rehabilitation. That was entirely unsuccessful.

19As regards his conduct after I imposed the suspended sentence upon him, this time the focus must be on the offender's punishment and personal deterrence. 

20I note that the maximum penalties are significant. For supplying a prohibited drug, the maximum penalty is 15 years and for possession of the taser, the maximum penalty is 14 years. The taser matter also has a standard non parole period of 3 years. I have taken both the maximum penalties and where appropriate the standard non parole period into account in formulating the appropriate sentences in this case. My reasons for not imposing the standing non parole period appear in these remarks on sentence.

21The sentence will date from 19 June 2013. That is the day on which the offender went into custody on these new matters. As I made clear when I dealt with Mr Pearman earlier, I took into account his pre-sentence custody and quasi custody when deciding the length of the sentences which were then suspended. So there is no justification for me backdating the sentences even further to take into account pre-sentence custody and quasi custody.

22Mr Pearman presents as a man who was somewhat defeated by the circumstances in which he now finds himself. It is a terribly sad thing to see someone of his age going back to gaol for what must be a significant period of time. He has but one life to live and it is distressing to see him waste that life in the way he has been. That is especially so when the commencement of his drug use was in the circumstances that I have referred to. But ultimately it remains the case that Mr Pearman's decision to use drugs, Mr Pearman's decision to supply drugs and Mr Pearman's decision to arm himself with a taser, obviously prepared to use it as part of his drug dealing activities, are matters of personal choice.

23I am not saying the choices are as easy for him as it is for those who are not addicted to drugs. It is a difficult choice. But Mr Pearman was given the opportunity to put his drug dealing days behind him. He failed to take it and he must be punished for the personal choice he made to commit these offences.

24I will not make a finding of special circumstances in this case. There is no justification for an extended period of supervision on parole, especially in circumstances where the length of the sentence I am about to announce will give him adequate time to engage in any rehabilitation program he would wish to engage in upon the expiring of his non parole period. 

25The orders I make are these; 

26I revoke the order for suspension of the sentences previously imposed upon the offender and order that they date from 19 June 2013.

27I set non parole periods as follows;

For the offence of possessing a taser, and to make it clear I am referring to the earlier matter, I impose a non-parole period of six months.

For the two offences of supply prohibited drug I impose a non-parole period of 18 months.

28For the new offences I impose sentences as follows;

For the offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime appearing on the s 166 certificate, I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of one year to date from 19 June 2014.

For the offence of possessing the prohibited weapon I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of two years commencing from 19 June 2014 and a head sentence of four years.

For the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, taking into account the form 1 matters, I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of two years, six months, commencing from 19 December 2015 and a head sentence of four years six months.

29Taking into account the sentences where the order for suspension has been revoked and the new sentences, the overall period of imprisonment consists of a non-parole period of five years to date from 19 June 2013 and a head sentence of seven years. The offender will become eligible to be released to parole on 18 June 2018.

		13 October 2014",2014-06-12 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704970,Poniris v R [2014] NSWCCA 100,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  In March 2012 the appellant stood trial in the District Court on ten criminal charges, three of which were brought in the alternative.  The seven principal charges comprised one count of shoot with intent to murder, two counts of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (namely cocaine and heroin), two counts of possession of a firearm with defaced identification and two counts of acting with intent to pervert the course of justice.  The Crown case was that the appellant was part of a joint criminal enterprise with Joseph Metlej and others to remove William Metlej from the Metlej family business so that Joseph Metlej could take control of it.  They planned to do this by falsely implicating William Metlej in drug and firearm offences.  
2The appellant pleaded not guilty to all charges.  His case was that he was not a party to the joint criminal enterprise and that the three main witnesses giving evidence against him lied about his involvement in order to divert attention from their own crimes.  The jury returned verdicts of guilty on all seven principal counts.
3On 29 June 2012 the trial judge imposed sentences in relation to each offence, amounting to an overall sentence of 18 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 13 years and 6 months.
4The appellant appeals against each of his convictions.  For the reasons given below, I have concluded that his appeal should be dismissed.
THE FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES
5The following descriptions of the factual circumstances surrounding the charges in the indictment are taken from the parties' written submissions.
The Crown case
6Joseph and William Metlej are brothers.  The Metlej family owned and operated a successful construction and property development company established by Joseph and William's father, Youssef Metlej.  Both brothers worked in the family business but Joseph's position was subordinate to that of his older brother William.  This led to arguments between the brothers and caused Joseph to become resentful and jealous of William.
7In about 1997 the appellant and Joseph Metlej became friends.  The appellant, who was then a plumber working at the State Rail Authority, told Joseph that he was working undercover for the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and introduced Joseph to a number of police officers with whom he was friendly. 
8After a time, the appellant and Joseph Metlej devised a plan to remove William Metlej from his position in the family business, so that Joseph could assume control.  They decided to plant prohibited drugs and a firearm in William's home and then alert the police.  The appellant was struggling financially and hoped to take advantage of Joseph's acquisition of control of the business.
9Joseph gave evidence that he ""really wanted to keep [the appellant] as a friend"" because he ""never had any other friends"", and therefore he went along with the plan (Transcript p 229).  Others were involved in the scheme at various times, including Andrew Maratos and Robert Martin, both of whom gave evidence that the appellant had held himself out to be an undercover agent with the AFP (see Transcript pp 431-2 (Maratos), 598, 606-7, 640, 660 (Martin)). 
10In 1998 the appellant used $25,000 provided to him by Joseph Metlej to obtain almost half a kilogram of cocaine and a defaced .32 calibre pistol.  He supplied these items to Joseph for him to plant them and a set of scales in William Metlej's home to make it appear that William was a drug dealer.  In September 1998, Joseph Metlej went to his brother's home and placed the items in a wardrobe in the bedroom shared by William Metlej and his wife Chantal (sometimes referred to in the evidence as Chantelle).  The appellant then arranged for Andrew Maratos to inform the New South Wales Police of the presence of those items in William's home.  Maratos did so through his solicitor.   
11The police undertook a search of William's home but failed to find the drugs or the firearm, locating only the set of scales.  However the items were discovered some days later by Chantal Metlej and taken by William to the police.
12In March 1999 the appellant and Joseph Metlej made another attempt to carry out their plan, this time with Joseph placing a gun and a quantity of heroin in William Metlej's garage.  Acting on information again provided by Andrew Maratos, the AFP executed a search warrant on William's premises and found 281 grams of heroin and a loaded .45 calibre pistol.  William Metlej was charged, but the charges were dismissed at a committal hearing a year later.
13In late 2001 the appellant, still intent upon destroying William Metlej, recruited Christian Follert through an intermediary, Robert Martin, to kill William for the sum of $50,000.  On 28 November 2002 Follert went to William's home and shot him twice as he knelt beside his car in the street changing a slashed tyre.  One bullet struck William in the head and another in the upper right arm, with a third bullet striking William's car.  William survived.
The defence case
14The appellant did not give evidence at his trial.  Nor was any oral evidence called on his behalf, although seven documentary exhibits were tendered.
15The defence case at trial was that the appellant was not involved in any joint criminal enterprise to plant drugs and firearms at William Metlej's home, nor was he involved in any joint enterprise to shoot William Metlej.  The defence contended that the three main prosecution witnesses (being Joseph Metlej, Andrew Maratos and Robert Martin) carried out the offences charged in the indictment, and that each lied in giving evidence of the appellant's involvement.  In exchange for their testimony, Maratos and Martin had been granted indemnities against prosecution for their respective roles in the joint criminal enterprise, and Joseph Metlej had received a suspended sentence for his crimes ""in large part because he had promised to testify against the appellant"" (Crown's written submissions at [17]).  The defence suggested that inducements offered by the New South Wales Crime Commission to some of those involved in the offences had led to them wrongly implicating the appellant (ibid at [18]).
16According to the defence, Joseph Metlej ""began a campaign of harassment and hatred against William and Chantelle Metlej"" in early 1998 and this was the ""real motive"" for the offences (appellant's written submissions at [11(c), (e)]).  
17While the defence accepted that the appellant had been friendly with a number of police officers, it denied that he had ever held himself out to be an undercover agent of, or an officer in, the AFP.
GROUNDS OF APPEAL AGAINST CONVICTION
GROUND 1:  THE JUDGE ERRED IN ADMITTING INTO EVIDENCE EXHIBITS W, X, Y AND AA BEING ITEMS FOUND AT THE APPELLANT'S RESIDENCE IN 2007
18This ground concerns the admissibility and permissible use of items found at the appellant's residence during the execution of a search warrant in September 2007.  In general terms, the Crown relied on these items as evidence capable of corroborating assertions by witnesses whose credibility was impugned (namely Joseph Metlej, Maratos and Martin) that the appellant passed himself off as either a police officer or someone working covertly for the police (Transcript pp 662, 666, 671, 675).  Counsel for the appellant at trial objected to the tender of the four exhibits on the ground that they were not relevant to the issues at trial, principally by reason of the gap in time between 2007 (when the items were found) and the dates alleged in the indictment.  
19Exhibit W was an internal NSW Police envelope addressed to ""Chris Poniris, DEA Office, AFP Building, Goulburn Street"".  The envelope contained documents that were dated at various points in 1999 and were therefore temporally connected with the charges in the indictment, although the documents themselves were otherwise irrelevant to the issues at trial (being concerned with building work carried out on the appellant's property).  The trial judge ruled that the exhibit was admissible as material capable of bearing upon the question of whether the appellant ""was connected with or represented himself to be connected with police during the period covered by the indictment"" (Judgment of 21 March, p 1).  
20Exhibit X was a confidential NSW Police manual relating to a Glock self-loading pistol.  It was dated 1997.  Exhibit Y was an 18-page set of documents connected with a firearms licence issued to the appellant.  Con Adams' signature appeared on the documents at a number of places.  Joseph Metlej gave evidence both at the trial and before the NSW Crime Commission that he had fired a Glock pistol at a police firing range with the appellant and Con Adams, a man who the appellant introduced as an officer in the NSW Police Force but who was in fact the proprietor of a security firm.  It was suggested to Joseph in cross-examination that he had lied about that event, and in response the Crown relied upon Exhibit Y to support his credibility in relation to that part of his evidence (Transcript pp 674, 678-9).
21In relation to Exhibit X, the trial judge stated that:
""The Crown is entitled to lead evidence of other material which may relevantly bear upon the story told by Mr Joseph Metlej. One aspect of that story is evidence that he is a person of a vulnerable character and mental state, liable to be influenced by a person purporting to be a friend. A particular aspect of this is that the friend in question, the accused Mr Poniris, is said by the Crown to have held himself out to have connections with police and policing of a kind likely to assist, on the Crown's case, in an exercise in manipulating Mr Joseph Metlej"" (Judgment of 21 March, p 2).
22After referring to Joseph's alleged attendance at the police firing range, his Honour ruled in relation to Exhibit X that there is ""some relevance in this item"" (ibid, p 3).
23Finally, Exhibit AA was a police helmet with the words ""Sgt Adams"" appearing on the back and therefore apparently belonging to Sergeant George Adams, a friend of the appellant.  Exhibit AA was tendered by the Crown as evidence capable of demonstrating an association between the appellant and George Adams (Transcript p 671).  The trial judge ruled that both Exhibit AA and Exhibit Y: 
""have some limited relevance.  In each case the only relevance is to show some connection or association between, in the first case, George Adams and in the second case a person called Con Adams.  On that limited basis, I will allow that evidence to be led"" (ibid).
24When Exhibit AA was tendered, the trial judge indicated to the jury that it was relevant
""only in the sense that you've already heard evidence that there is a Sergeant George Adams who apparently is pretty good at taekwondo and he had lessons and this item simply shows connection or association, apparently, between Mr Poniris and the man Sergeant George Adams.  There's no suggestion that he stole the helmet or anything.  It's just to show that there was some connection with George Adams"" (Transcript pp 697-8).
25In the Crown's closing address to the jury, the Crown Prosecutor dealt with the exhibits in the following terms:
""Is there evidence ... that supports the very, very crucial part of Joseph Metlej's claims that Christopher Poniris was the other guy that was his friend, worked with him in this campaign that went on over some years? ... There's some pieces of evidence in this case that lend support to what Joseph Metlej is saying in effect that Christopher Poniris passed himself off as someone who was working for the police"" (Transcript of 22 March 2012, p 3).
26After referring to Exhibit AA, the Crown continued:
""But there's other things that were found by the police at Christopher Poniris' home that speak volumes.  Volumes in terms of supporting what Mr Joseph Metlej says about Christopher Poniris passing himself off as a policeman"" (ibid).
...
""You might remember that Joseph Metlej told you that he injured his webbing between his index finger and thumb in the course of firing the [Glock].  There's some evidence that lends support to what Joseph Metlej is saying on that point.
There is the exhibit that is exhibit X, the Glock self-loading pistol [manual] which has a date stamp on each page, 1997, so it's before, it's around the time or thereafter that Mr Poniris and Mr Joseph Metlej meet according to Joseph Metlej and there's also the exhibit [Exhibit Y] that was also found at Christopher Poniris' home which is those documents relating to his firearms licence.
You've had a look at the documents and you know basically what's happened is he's been told that he hasn't undergone his necessary regular accreditation course.  When he then resubmits that in 2005 what name appears as signing off on that in some way?  Con Adams"" (ibid p 7).
27Defence counsel's closing address countered as follows:
""The Crown case really is built around a theory that Mr Poniris is responsible because he wanted to get access somehow or other to the Metlej company.  It relies on those three witnesses [Maratos, Joseph Metlej and Martin] and there's little or no independent evidence.  There is the material that was found at the house ... Interestingly enough not one witness said they saw any of those documents ... These happen to be things that were found in 2007.  Whether they existed in that form earlier or later, we don't know.  What they're brought into play for is to show that Mr Poniris has some police associates and he does because he used to go to karate.  He used to go to karate ... run by Sergeant George Adams who's a different person from Con Adams who's not a policeman.  And that's not disputed and it's not denied that he does know people who are police officers.
The defence says to you that those documents and things are a bit of [a] red herring in the sense that there is no denial that Mr Poniris knows some police officers and had colleagues who were police officers.  No witness saw those things; they're not used in any way to suggest he's a police officer"" (ibid p 39). 
28In the course of his summing-up, the trial judge made the following observations to the jury:
""... the evidence of Mr Joseph Metlej, Maratos and Martin, is subject to a number of criticisms and concerns - that is why the Crown, in its case, seeks to put before you whatever independent evidence it can to support the case it presents"" (p 48).
...
""The Crown put to you that of course the centrepiece of his case is the evidence of Joseph Metlej, that alone you might be sceptical about what he says, but you have got to take into account not only his evidence but all the other evidence in the case.  And the Crown says there are a lot of things that substantiate what he says ... exhibits W, X, [Y] and AA support the proposition the Crown makes that lying behind all of this is that you have Mr Poniris who is a kind of Walter Mitty type character, thinking he is a police officer of some sort and attaching himself in friendship to a fellow (Mr Joseph Metlej) who is as his brother put it, ""different"" but who is plainly mentally odd in the sense that he suffers from Asperger's syndrome ...
So you would accept that the items found at the search, which link back in time to some ten years before, demonstrate that Mr Poniris was holding himself out to be some kind of police officer - a very strange thing to do ..."" (pp 58-59). 
...
""However defective in some respects [the evidence of Joseph Metlej, Maratos and Martin] might be, it was not the result of collusion, the Crown says.  The Crown says that if you look at the item which is the letter, exhibit W, found at his house, this shows how he was living a life of self deception and deception of others and he has got himself as part of the DEA [possibly an acronym for Drug Enforcement Agency:  Transcript p 583] at the Australian Federal Police.
The [Glock] document [Exhibit X] ... with a date stamp of 1997 on it, supports the argument that Mr Poniris was associating with police, pretending to be a police officer and he was living that kind of fantasy life, into which he drew Joseph Metlej, on the Crown case"" (p 60).
29As noted above, counsel for the appellant at trial objected to the tender of the four exhibits on the ground of relevance.  On appeal, however, the appellant conceded that the items had some, albeit ""exceptionally limited"", relevance (appeal transcript, p 23) but contended under his first ground of appeal that the trial judge erred in failing to exclude the items under s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) on the basis that their probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant being caused by their admission into evidence.  The danger of unfair prejudice was said to lie in the risk that the jury might place too much weight on the exhibits, or use them as evidence of bad character, or might conclude that the appellant used the items to impersonate a police officer or had a propensity to pass himself off as a police officer (appellant's written submissions at [44], [47]-[49]). 
30Counsel for the appellant accepted that defence counsel at trial did not in terms rely upon s 137 (appeal transcript, p 1; written submissions at [29]).  However, he submitted that there were references by defence counsel to a risk of the jury making improper use of the evidence and that as the appellant objected to the material (albeit only on the ground of relevance), the trial judge was obliged to undertake the balancing exercise provided for by s 137.  While appeal counsel initially contended that the trial judge had an obligation to consider excluding the evidence under s 137 irrespective of any objection (written submissions at [30]), this submission was subsequently withdrawn (supplementary submissions at [5]).  The submissions on which the appellant came to rely were that s 137 was relied on at trial implicitly, even if not expressly, and alternatively that the appellant's objection on the ground of relevance was sufficient to require the trial judge to consider whether s 137 applied.
Whether the appellant relied on s 137 at trial
31Section 137 of the Evidence Act provides as follows:
""In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.""
32The suggestion that defence counsel at trial implicitly or indirectly raised the issue of s 137 must be rejected.  Leaving aside the objections taken at trial as to the relevance of the exhibits, the only arguable references by defence counsel to the risk of improper use of the evidence by the jury were as follows.  In relation to Exhibit Y, counsel said:  
""The fact that Mr Con Adams, who's not a police officer, has signed something to do - and who's the proprietor of a security firm, which has Glock pistols, has signed a document saying somebody is accredited or not accredited to have a Glock, doesn't in any way at all mean that he was present at a firing range.  It just doesn't connect and it'd be an improper use of that document for the jury to draw that conclusion.  The fact that Con Adams has signed a document at some other point in time, saying that this man - and is a proprietor of a security firm.  He's not a policeman.  Saying that this man is accredited to use a Glock would - no jury could possibly use that properly to say that Mr Con Adams had taken Mr Metlej to a firing range, a police firing range and has pretended to be a police officer and been issued with a newly issued Glock pistol and use it."" (emphasis added) (Transcript p 679)
33In the course of objecting to Exhibit W, defence counsel argued:
""Nobody says, ""I saw an envelope"", nobody has any reference to an envelope, and as to what the contents of the envelope are, which - clearly, they belong to the envelope, when they were put in there, is impossible to say and it's pure speculation and doesn't advance the Crown case in any way, shape or form."" (emphasis added) (Transcript p 676)
34In my view, the appellant's submission that these objections taken by defence counsel demonstrate that he raised the risk of unfair prejudice and therefore, implicitly, the issue of s 137 for the trial judge's consideration cannot be accepted.  The fundamental objection at trial to the admissibility of the four exhibits was plainly one of relevance (see Transcript pp 665-6, 674-6).  The defence bore the onus of having the evidence excluded under s 137 on the basis of unfair prejudice (Gilmour v Environment Protection Authority; Tableland Topdressing Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority [2002] NSWCCA 399; 55 NSWLR 593 at [46]; Kuehne v R [2011] NSWCCA 101 at [21]) but defence counsel, no doubt for good reason (there being no suggestion of incompetence), chose not to invoke it (see Potts v R [2012] NSWCCA 229; 227 A Crim R 217 at [64]).  As observed by R A Hulme J, with whom Beazley P and Bellew J agreed, in Bin Sulaeman v R [2013] NSWCCA 283:
""[t]here is a general requirement in an adversarial court or tribunal that counsel make clear the grounds on which they press an objection or seek some other ... procedural or discretionary ruling ... At least in criminal trials in NSW, the only limit to that rule is the requirement upon the trial judge to ensure for the accused a fair trial according to law ... A trial judge is entitled to, and counsel are obliged to provide, a proper foundation on which to base a ruling when asked to exercise a discretionary power. Objections to evidence are not at-large contentions concerning admissibility; they are vehicles for the raising of specific issues"" (at [133], [139]).  
35I do not consider that, in the statements at the trial relied upon on appeal, defence counsel was asserting a prospect of prejudice to his client by the jury's misuse of the evidence, such as to impliedly invoke s 137. Rather, in my view counsel was simply advancing his submission that the items were irrelevant and therefore inadmissible.  
Whether an independent obligation to consider s 137
36The question which then arises is whether, because the appellant had objected to the evidence on the ground of relevance, the trial judge was obliged to undertake the balancing exercise set out in s 137 in the absence of any reliance by the defence on that section.  The appellant contended that the ""requirement to ensure a fair trial must include a consideration of section 137"" (supplementary submissions at [12]).
37Whether there is a duty on a trial judge to consider excluding evidence pursuant to s 137 in the absence of an application to do so has been the subject of authority in this Court.  
38The reasoning in this Court's earlier decision in Steve v R [2008] NSWCCA 231; 189 A Crim R 68 was disapproved in FDP v R [2008] NSWCCA 317; 74 NSWLR 645.  In the latter case, the appellant had pleaded guilty to three counts of taking a child with intent to remove the child from the lawful control of the complainant (his wife) without her consent, and was convicted at trial of the further offence of wounding contrary to s 35 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  On appeal, the appellant contended that the trial miscarried due to the reception of inadmissible or unfairly prejudicial evidence to which no objection was taken at trial - namely, evidence of the making of an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order against the appellant and of particular statements made by the appellant towards his wife during the course of an argument.
39This Court, constituted by McClellan CJ at CL, Grove and Howie JJ, held that a trial judge is not obliged by s 137 to reject evidence on his or her own motion in the absence of an objection based on that section.  
40The Court adopted (at [28]) the following passage from the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ and Hayne J in Dhanhoa v The Queen [2003] HCA 40; 217 CLR 1:
""[20] Sections 114 and 115 [concerning identification evidence], like many other provisions of the Evidence Act, declare that evidence of a certain kind is not admissible in certain circumstances, or unless certain conditions are fulfilled.  Yet evidence of a kind to which those sections refer may not be the subject of objection. Counsel for an accused person may have any one of a number of reasons for not objecting.  A trial judge ordinarily will not know why no objection is taken, and may have no right to enquire ... The Evidence Act applies in an adversarial context.  It is the parties, and their counsel, who define the issues at trial, select the witnesses, and choose the evidence that they will lead, and to which they will take objection ..."" 
41The Court in FDP v R continued:
""[28] With respect, we find the argument contained in paragraph 20 in the judgment of Dhanhoa set out above compelling in rejecting the notion that, generally speaking, a trial judge should take upon himself or herself the role of determining the admissibility or reception of evidence to which no objection is taken by a lawyer representing an accused person.  There may be provisions that unambiguously impose such an obligation on a court by the wording of the section, for example s 275A [of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), now repealed], or by reason of its subject matter; for example provisions concerned with the exclusion of evidence in the public interest such as s 130.  But we do not believe that s 137 falls into either of those categories and therefore, imposes an obligation on a trial judge to reject evidence of his or her own motion where no objection is taken and the accused is legally represented.  There may be exceptional situations where a trial judge is compelled to intervene in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice, but there is in our opinion no provision of the Evidence Act that requires such intervention."" (emphasis added)
[29] So far as s 137 is concerned, we do not understand how a trial judge could reliably undertake the balancing exercise that the section requires between the probative value of the evidence and the danger of unfair prejudice without a complete understanding of both the Crown and defence cases and the arguments to be addressed to the jury by the parties.  Yet the section is engaged when the Crown first introduces the evidence that is later impugned in this Court.  This difficulty is alone sufficient to lead us to the conclusion that s 137 cannot operate to oblige a judge to reject evidence that may later be seen in the context of the whole of the trial to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice.""
42The Court found that no miscarriage of justice had occurred as a result of the admission of the evidence in question and dismissed the appeal against conviction.  In that case, no objection at all had been taken at trial to the tender of the evidence.  However, I consider the Court's reasoning to be equally applicable where, as here, an objection is taken to the evidence but on a basis other than s 137.  This is arguably an a fortiori case because it is clear in such a situation that defence counsel (assuming that the accused is represented) has turned his or her mind to the admissibility of the evidence and, it can be inferred, has decided to confine the objection to one of relevance.
43Furthermore, contrary to the appellant's contention, I do not consider the reasoning in FDP to be inapplicable where, as in the present case, the evidence is tendered late in a Crown case which concludes the evidence at the trial because the accused does not call evidence.  Although the Court in FDP remarked on the difficulty of applying s 137 where the trial judge has less than complete knowledge of the parties' cases, this was not the basis, or at least not the only basis, of the Court's decision.  In any event, in the situation postulated by counsel for the appellant in this case, whilst the evidence might be near completion, closing addresses are yet to be made.
44In Potts v R and Shepherd v R [2011] NSWCCA 245, the Court affirmed the decision in FDP that s 137 of the Evidence Act does not impose an obligation on a trial judge to reject evidence to which no objection under s 137 has been taken at trial by defence counsel (at [66] and [30] respectively).  In the latter decision, the Court stated that it ""should be careful in the assessment of submissions made by reference to provisions of the [Evidence] Act which are said to apply, when no argument to that effect was made to the trial judge (in particular by experienced counsel)"" ([30]).
45Finally, in Penza and Di Maria v R [2013] NSWCCA 21, Hoeben JA reviewed the reasoning in Steve v R, FDP v R and Chand v R [2011] NSWCCA 53 in respect of s 137.  In relation to Chand, his Honour noted (at [197]) that:
"" ... with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL and Blanch J, I upheld a ground of appeal based on s 137 Evidence Act, even though objection had not [been] taken to the evidence at trial.  I did so because the Court was referred to the decision in Steve v R but was not referred to FDP.  Having now had the opportunity of reading both those decisions, I have no doubt as to the correctness of the reasoning in FDP and that on this issue, Le and Steve should not be followed.""
46At [226] of Penza and Di Maria Campbell J, with whom Button J agreed on this point, preferred to reserve his position in relation to s 137 since
"" ... strictly, this aspect does not arise for the reasons expressed by [Hoeben JA] at [192]-[193].  And, as the differences were not identified by counsel nor addressed by them, I would prefer to leave the resolution of the question to an appropriate case where the Court has had the benefit of full argument.""
47In both Steve and Chand, where the Court found that the trial judge ought to have considered s 137 independently of any objection by trial counsel, the danger of unfair prejudice arising from the evidence in question was plain.  In Steve, the material included evidence of ""extreme bad character"" (being that the appellant was a sexual predator, a child molester and a person of violent disposition towards women), and tendency or propensity evidence in respect of which no notice had been served on the accused (see ss 97, 100 Evidence Act; Steve at [61]-[62], [64], [66]-[67], [69], [81]).  Moreover, that material was either irrelevant or bore ""no probative value"" at all (at [58], [60], [64], [66], [69]).  
48Likewise in Chand, the evidence consisted of 20 COPS entries detailing complaints made by the appellant to the police in relation to alleged conduct on the part of his neighbours, problems with the CIA, and planes flying over his house in order to spy on him and his family (see [80]).  In the context of an allegation that the appellant had intentionally driven his vehicle at a motorbike ridden by a neighbour, that evidence clearly posed a danger of unfair prejudice to him.
49Where, as in those cases, the danger of unfair prejudice is manifest, an obligation to exclude the evidence under s 137 may arise in accordance with the trial judge's overriding obligation to ensure a fair trial according to law (Pemble v R [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107 at 117-8 per Barwick CJ; James v R [2014] HCA 6; 88 ALJR 427 at [24]).  However, any risk of undue prejudice arising from the exhibits impugned in the present case cannot be characterised as so obvious or self-evident that the trial judge was obliged to intervene to ensure that the appellant was not denied a fair trial by reason of their reception into evidence.  The decision of counsel for the appellant at trial to refrain from invoking s 137 for the trial judge's consideration and to object instead to the admission of the evidence on the basis of relevance tends to confirm this to have been the case:  see Ward v R [2013] NSWCCA 46 at [27].  
50Accordingly, I consider that the trial judge did not err in failing to consider s 137 of his own motion.  The question then arises of whether the appellant can rely on s 137 for the first time on appeal, either as of right or pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW).
Whether rule 4 applicable
51Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules provides as follows:
""4 Exclusion of certain matters as grounds for appeal etc
No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.""
52It was common ground between the parties that the appellant required leave under r 4 to raise Grounds 2, 3 and 4 of the appeal as the complaints embodied within those grounds were not raised for the trial judge's consideration (see appellant's supplementary submissions at [3]).  However, the appellant contended that he did not need leave to rely on Ground 1, even assuming that it did not reflect a point taken at first instance, because he had objected to the subject evidence, although on a different ground to that the subject of Ground 1.  At the appeal hearing, the parties were directed to file and serve supplementary written submissions on the operation of r 4 where objection to the admission of evidence is taken at trial on one basis and, on appeal, objection is taken on a different basis.  The Crown submitted, and the appellant denied, that r 4 applies in those circumstances.
53In Bin Sulaeman v R, the appellant was convicted of aggravated people smuggling.  He appealed against his conviction inter alia on the basis that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of a confession.  Counsel for the accused had objected at trial to the admission of the evidence by reference to ss 85, 90, 138 and 139 of the Evidence Act, but on appeal raised various points concerning the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) and Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which had not been relied on at trial.  R A Hulme J (with whom Beazley P and Bellew J agreed) held that r 4 applied to those points (at [132]).  In coming to that conclusion, his Honour observed that:
""Reading the rule literally, leave would not be required to appeal an evidentiary ruling where objection was taken on any ground.  That is, no matter how unmeritorious the objection that was taken at trial, an appellant is thereby free to raise any new ground for the objection on appeal.  That cannot be the correct reading of the rule because it flies in the face of established principles of appellate procedure"" (at [124]).
54A similar conclusion with respect to r 4 was reached by Simpson J in Vickers v R [2006] NSWCCA 60; 160 A Crim R 195.  In that case, counsel for the appellant had argued at trial that a particular statement ought to be excluded for discretionary reasons but on appeal contended that the statement was hearsay which was not rendered admissible by s 65 of the Evidence Act.  The appellant submitted that leave was not required to advance this objection in light of the objection to the evidence at trial.  Her Honour held that it was.  James and Hall JJ preferred to reserve the question of whether leave under r 4 was required ([16] and [120]), although Hall J considered Simpson J's reasons to be ""persuasive"" ([120]).  Her Honour's decision with respect to the scope of r 4 was cited with approval in Shepherd v R at [26].  
55In the present case, the objection to the four exhibits at trial was based on relevance, while the objection advanced on appeal is based upon s 137, the former having now been conceded (as noted at [29] above).  In my view the objection as to relevance cannot suffice to allow objections on any basis to be advanced on appeal without first obtaining leave.  To hold otherwise would be contrary to the purpose of r 4 and the discouragement of ""armchair appeals"" which that provision seeks to achieve (see Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62; 209 A Crim R 424 at [169]-[170]; Flanagan v R [2013] NSWCCA 320 at [69]-[72]).  It would also undermine basic principles of appellate review and the efficient administration of justice.  The decisions in Bin Sulaeman, Vickers and Shepherd support this conclusion.
56Accordingly, the appellant requires leave pursuant to r 4 to proceed with all four grounds of appeal.
Whether leave should be granted under rule 4
57In Papakosmas v R [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297, McHugh J articulated the following principles with respect to the application of r 4:
""There is no case for the grant of leave under r 4 unless the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the appellant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error of law or is satisfied that the appellant's conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice. Satisfying the Court that there is an arguable case is extremely difficult where the appellant has failed to object to evidence or failed to ask for a direction concerning evidence. In such cases, the trial judge has made no error of law because he or she has not been asked for a ruling. Consequently, an appeal can only succeed if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the admission of the evidence or the failure to give the direction has caused a miscarriage of justice, proof of which lies on the appellant. Where the evidence was admissible, but the trial judge had a discretion to limit its use, the burden on the appellant is greater: the appeal can succeed only if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the discretion would have been exercised in favour of the appellant and that, if it had, it is more likely than not that the appellant would have been acquitted. Any other view would mean that there was always a miscarriage of justice when the trial judge might have exercised a discretion in favour of the appellant"" (at [72]).
58In the present case the appellant must therefore demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice was, or at least may have been, occasioned by the admission into evidence of the four exhibits. 
59In ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266, Bathurst CJ provided the following summary of important considerations in relation to the operation of r 4 (at [148]):
""The requirements of r 4 are not mere technicalities. The Criminal Appeal Act does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted on one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which could or should have been raised at the first trial: R v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174; (2003) 139 A Crim R 340 at [94], citing with approval R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208; (2001) 123 A Crim R 310, 319. See also Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [170].
The appellant must establish that he or she has lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted: Picken v R [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [20]-[21].
A failure by counsel to take objection or to raise an issue on summing-up may be explicable by the fact that counsel said nothing hoping to gain an advantage at a later stage, or that counsel took no objection as, in the atmosphere of the trial, counsel saw no injustice as to what was being done: Germakian v R [2007] NSWCCA 373; (2007) 70 NSWLR 467 at [10]-[13]; Sanchez v R [2009] NSWCCA 171; (2009) 196 A Crim R 472 at [58]-[61].
An unexplained failure to take the point at the trial is usually a reasonably reliable indicator of the fairness and adequacy of the summing-up: Tekely v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [88], [130].""
60The appellant has not in my view demonstrated that he lost ""a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted"" by the admission into evidence of the four exhibits.  Whether unfair prejudice might have arisen from the admission of those exhibits must be considered in the context of the trial as a whole and in conjunction with the body of evidence of which they formed a part: Aytugrul v The Queen [2012] HCA 15; 247 CLR 170 at [30].  The Crown case at trial was that the appellant was motivated by the prospect of financial gain to remove William Metlej from his position of control of the Metlej family business so that Joseph Metlej could assume his place, giving the appellant greater access to the company.  One aspect of that case was that Joseph was a vulnerable and impressionable person ""liable to be influenced by a person purporting to be a friend"" (Judgment of 21 March p 2, quoted above at [21]).  
61By the time that the four exhibits were tendered, oral evidence had been given by Joseph Metlej, Maratos and Martin that the appellant had held himself out on various occasions to be an undercover agent with the AFP or otherwise working covertly for the police (Transcript pp 225-8 (Joseph), pp 431-2 (Maratos), 598, 606-7, 640, 660 (Martin)).  The exhibits were tendered for the purpose of providing some corroboration of this evidence.  The appellant's sensible withdrawal on appeal of his objection to them based on relevance recognised that they were capable of doing this.
62The conclusion that trial counsel did not regard the items as unfairly prejudicial is supported by the terms of his final address to the jury (quoted above at [27]) in which he made no attempt to dissuade the jury from making any improper use of the exhibits.  He simply sought to contradict the Crown's case that they were relevant to corroborate the evidence of the Crown's principal witnesses, contending that they would be of little, if any, use to the jury.
63The Crown referred to the purpose of the exhibits in its closing address (see [25] to [26] above).  The trial judge did likewise (see [24] and [28] above).  His Honour warned the jury on a number of occasions of the caution with which the evidence of Joseph Metlej, Maratos and Martin should be approached, and the need to seek verification of their respective accounts in the independent evidence.  His Honour stated:
""you would be very cautious for reasons I have explained ... to accept any of their evidence standing alone.  You would be looking, and you will be looking no doubt when you deliberate, particularly to see whether outside of their three bodies of evidence there are other things independently which support their various stories"" (Summing-Up pp 43-4).  
64In these circumstances, it must have been abundantly clear to the jury why the four pieces of evidence were admitted.
65The appellant submitted that the risk of misuse of them by the jury was highlighted by the Crown's closing address when the Crown stated that the exhibits ""speak volumes.  Volumes in terms of supporting what Mr Joseph Metlej says about Christopher Poniris passing himself off as a policeman"" (Transcript p 3, quoted at [26] above; written submissions at [45]).  However, once those items were ruled to be admissible, the Crown was entitled to rely upon them in support of its case and in support of the evidence that the appellant was passing himself off as a police officer.  The weight to be accorded to the exhibits was a matter for the jury, as the Crown acknowledged in its closing address (Transcript of 22 March, p 5), and reasons for attributing little weight to those items were a matter for defence counsel to advance in closing address.
66There was clearly room for two views as to the weight that should be given to the items:  the defence said little and the Crown said much.  It was for the jury to choose between these views.  Accepting (as the appellant now does) that the items were of at least some relevance, I do not consider that acceptance by the jury of the Crown's submissions concerning the weight to be attached to them could have constituted misuse of the evidence.  That would have involved the items' use for the purpose for which they are accepted to have been relevant and a decision as to how cogent they were in fulfilling that purpose.  The latter was quintessentially a matter for the jury.
67It is well established that evidence is not unfairly prejudicial merely because it strengthens the Crown case (see Papakosmas at [91]).  Rather, the prejudice contemplated by s 137 is prejudice that is unfair ""because there is a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some unfair way"": R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 at 139 per Hunt CJ at CL; see also R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228 at [72] per Spigelman CJ (Simpson and Adams JJ agreeing).  As stated by McHugh J in Festa v The Queen [2001] HCA 72; 208 CLR 593 at [51], evidence is unfairly prejudicial under s 137:
""... only when the jury are likely to give the evidence more weight than it deserves or when the nature or contents of the evidence may inflame the jury or divert the jurors from their task.""
68The tender of the four items in question in the present case did not give rise to such a risk.  The purpose for which they were tendered was made plain to the jury by the closing addresses of both the Crown and the defence, and by the terms of the trial judge's summing-up.  There is no reason to conclude that the jury did more than accept the Crown submissions concerning the items, a course that was open to it.
69In these circumstances, the appellant has not established that a miscarriage of justice, which would provide a basis for a grant of leave under r 4, may have occurred.  Moreover, it is highly likely that an application at trial under s 137 to exclude the four items would have failed.  The evidence would have been found to possess some probative value and not be such as might be misused by the jury so as to cause unfair prejudice to the appellant.
GROUND 2:  THE JUDGE FAILED TO ADVISE THE JURY ON THE LIMITED RELEVANCE OF EXHIBIT Y IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS JUDGMENT ON THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE EXHIBIT
70The appellant accepts that r 4 applies to this ground.  The appellant must therefore establish that a miscarriage of justice was, or at least may have been, occasioned by such a failure.  
71Exhibit Y was the bundle of documents concerning the appellant's firearms licence. It was admitted into evidence in the following circumstances.  
72Detective Nestorovic, through whom the exhibit was tendered, was asked by the Crown whether the name ""Con Adams"" appeared on any of the documents comprising Exhibit Y (Transcript p 695).  After responding in the affirmative, Detective Nestorovic complied with a request by the Crown to mark with ""Post-it"" notes any pages upon which the name ""Con Adams"" appeared.  The evident basis upon which that exhibit was placed before the jury was to draw some link between Con Adams and the appellant.  The fact that the trial judge did not in terms later advise the jury of this ""limited relevance"" of the item in accordance with his judgment on admissibility was not therefore of significance because the purpose of the tender would have otherwise been apparent to the jury from what occurred at the time of tender.  In any event, as I have concluded above (see [68]) and reiterated below in relation to Ground 4, the purpose for which Exhibits W, X, Y and AA were tendered was made clear to the jury by counsels' addresses and the trial judge's summing-up.
73The appellant submitted that the manner in which the Crown addressed the jury in relation to Exhibit Y went beyond the trial judge's ruling on admissibility.  He pointed to the passage in the Crown's closing address quoted at [26] above in support of his submission.
74I reject this submission.  I do not consider that the Crown went beyond relying on Exhibit Y to demonstrate a connection or association between the appellant and Con Adams.  This was the basis upon which the exhibit was admitted into evidence by the trial judge's judgment of 21 March 2012.
GROUND 3:  THE TRIAL JUDGE FAILED TO DIRECT THE JURY OF THE LIMITATIONS [ON USE] OF THE EXHIBITS W, X, Y AND AA
75The trial judge was not requested to give the direction the subject of this ground of appeal.  Nor was he requested to give any direction concerning potential misuse of the items or alternate scenarios that may have been open on the evidence, nor was any redirection sought by defence counsel after or in the course of the summing-up.  This supports the view that, in the context of the trial, fairness did not require that such directions be given.  While his Honour did not refer in his summing-up to the limited basis upon which exhibit AA, being the helmet, was admitted (as to which see [23] above), the jury had been advised at the time of its tender of the limited use to which it could be put: namely, to show some ""connection or association"" between the appellant and Sgt George Adams (see [24] above).  As his Honour noted to the jury at that time, ""[t]here's no suggestion that he stole the helmet or anything.  It's just to show that there was some connection with George Adams"" (see [24] above).  Defence counsel, having conceded that point with his Honour (Transcript p 680), made no attempt in his closing address to warn the jury against impermissible use of the item (Transcript p 39 as quoted at [27] above).  Furthermore, what I have said above concerning the four items and Exhibit Y in particular (see [62] to [64], [68], [72]) indicates that the jury would have been well aware of the purpose for which the items were sought to be used.
76For these reasons, I do not consider that the appellant has established any deficiency in the trial judge's directions to the jury.  As a result, leave to raise Grounds of Appeal 2 and 3 should be refused.
GROUND 4:  THE JUDGE ERRED IN FAILING TO PROPERLY DIRECT THE JURY ON THE QUESTION OF A MOTIVE TO LIE
77In relation to this ground, the appellant submitted that it was necessary for the trial judge to direct the jury that a rejection of a motive to lie on the part of Joseph Metlej, Maratos and Martin would not lead to a conclusion that those witnesses were telling the truth.  The appellant pointed out that each of the three main witnesses was the subject of significant cross-examination on his motive to lie about the appellant's involvement in the joint enterprise.  That motive was said to be to obtain and retain the benefit of an indemnity, in the case of Martin and Maratos, and, in the case of Joseph Metlej, to minimise his sentence.  The appellant submitted that in these circumstances the ""motive to lie direction is fundamental to the onus of proof"" and that ""it is so fundamental to a fair trial, particularly when the motive to lie played such a large part in the trial"" that a failure to give the direction occasioned a miscarriage of justice (written submissions at [75]).  The appellant did not seek such any such direction at trial.
78The appellant relied in support of its submission upon the following statement by Latham J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Hidden J agreed) in Doe v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 203; 187 A Crim R 328 at [58]:
""Where the defence case directly asserts a motive to lie, and the issue has accordingly featured in the addresses of counsel, a miscarriage of justice may arise if the summing up gives undue emphasis to the issue of motive (""the central theme""), or goes beyond the asserted motive and poses the question at large, and the summing up does not contain full, firm and clear directions on the onus of proof, including a direction that the accused bears no onus to prove a motive to lie and that rejection of the motive does not justify a conclusion that the evidence of the witness is truthful.""
79Doe, and the cases upon which it relied, concerned convictions for sexual assault offences and an impermissible invitation to the jury to question why the complainant would lie.  Such an invitation arguably reverses the onus of proof by placing a burden on the accused to demonstrate why the complainant would lie.
80In the present case, the potential unreliability of the three relevant witnesses was squarely canvassed in the appellant's cross-examination of them, by the Crown itself and in the trial judge's directions to the jury.  In addition to his thorough directions concerning onus and standard of proof, the trial judge instructed the jury that ""it is not for the accused to establish the reason or reasons why the witness was lying"" (Summing-Up pp 1-2, 8-9).  At no stage was the jury invited to reason that a rejection of the asserted motives would lead to the conclusion that the three witnesses were telling the truth. 
81In these circumstances, I do not consider that it was necessary for the direction referred to by the appellant to be given.  I would therefore refuse a grant of leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely on this ground.
CONCLUSION AND ORDERS
82I propose the following orders:
(1)Refuse leave to the appellant to rely on any of his four grounds of appeal.
(2)Appeal dismissed.
83ADAMSON J:  I agree with Macfarlan JA.
84BELLEW J:  I agree with Macfarlan JA and the orders his Honour proposes.

		05 June 2014",2014-06-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704971,Imnetu v R [2014] NSWCCA 99,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  This matter comes before the Court pursuant to a referral by a judge of the Court pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (""Appeal and Review Act"").  The referral was consequent upon an application for an inquiry into the sentence imposed on Mr Imnetu, pursuant to s 78(1) of the Appeal and Review Act.  The referral to this Court is to be dealt with ""in the same way as if the convicted person had appealed against the conviction or sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), and that Act applies accordingly"": Appeal and Review Act, s 86.
2The language of these provisions, all contained in Pt 7 of the Appeal and Review Act, give rise to a number of questions, including the following:
(a) whether the procedural requirements of the Criminal Appeal Act, relevantly with respect to leave and extensions of time, apply;(b) whether the person the subject of the referral is required to file a notice of appeal (or application for leave to appeal) with grounds;(c) whether there are limits on the scope of the proceedings given the referral of ""the whole case"" to the court, and(d) how s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act applies and, in particular, whether, and if so when, the court may have regard to post-sentencing events.
3The details of the trial and first appeal and the circumstances of the offending have been sufficiently recounted by Fullerton J.
Jurisdiction on a referral(a) procedural requirements4In Carlton v R [2014] NSWCCA 14, the Court (RA Hulme J; Ward JA and Harrison J agreeing) held that the requirements with respect to leave and extension of time did not apply: at [38].  The reasoning underlying that conclusion, as a matter of statutory construction, is persuasive; however it may be necessary to consider such questions separately in relation to new grounds, not the subject of the inquiry.  GAR v R (No 2) [2010] NSWCCA 163, which reached a tentative conclusion that the requirements of s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act applied generally, should not be followed.
(b) notice of appeal5The second question, namely whether a notice of appeal is required, might be thought to fall within the same reasoning.  Indeed, so much was accepted in Carlton at [21] and [36], applying the reasoning in A reference by the Attorney General for the State of New South Wales under s 77(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 re the Conviction of Frederick Lincoln McDermott [2013] NSWCCA 102; 303 ALR 143 at [16] (Bathurst CJ, Johnson and Button JJ agreeing).
6The practice of filing a notice of appeal appears to have been adopted in recent cases (including the present), possibly for the administrative convenience of the Registry.  Accepting that such a document is not required, there remains a question as to its effect if filed.  Thus the notice in the present case identified as the sole ground of appeal, error on the part of the sentencing judge in applying the provisions of Pt 4, Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""Sentencing Procedure Act"") in contravention of the correct principles identified by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.  That ground reflected the ground raised in the application for an inquiry under s 78 of the Appeal and Review Act.  The practical significance of filing a notice of appeal arises primarily in circumstances where the appellant seeks to agitate grounds other than those which were the subject of the application for inquiry.  That issue turns upon the answer to the next question.
(c) referral of ""the whole case""7The third issue requires identification of the subject matter of the referral, which is to be treated as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act.  Section 79(1)(b) provides for referral of ""the whole case"".  Section 86 provides for the Court to deal with ""the case so referred"".  It is possible that in some cases the Court will not be satisfied that the ""doubt or question"" which was sufficient to found the referral (pursuant to s 79(2)) involved error on the part of the trial judge, once the issue raised is fully addressed.  On the other hand, the Court might be satisfied that there was other error which would warrant intervention if the matter were dealt with as an appeal, but which did not form part of the ground for referral.
8The answer to the question must depend upon what is meant by the phrase ""the whole case"", read in its statutory context.  The same language is to be found in s 26 of the Criminal Appeal Act, as originally enacted.  (It was not found in the provisions of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) which formed a second source of the provisions now in Pt 7 of the Appeal and Review Act.)
9Where no issue was raised on the application for an inquiry with respect to the conviction, it would be incongruous to suppose that once the matter reached the Court of Criminal Appeal, the appellant was at liberty to challenge the conviction.  That may follow from the mandate in s 86 to deal with the case so referred as if the person had appealed against the ""conviction or sentence"".  However, there is no doubt that where a specific challenge is raised as to either conviction or sentence, it is clear that the whole matter must be before the Court of Criminal Appeal in order that the relevant orders can be set aside, if that course is warranted.  That purpose is satisfied by referring ""the whole case"" to the Court.
10On the other hand, it may be doubted, uninstructed by authority, that in respect of a sentence (if that is the matter which was the subject of the inquiry) the appellant is entitled to raise grounds of appeal unrelated to the matter which gave rise to a doubt or question and thus led to the referral.  It would not seem to be consistent with the purpose of Pt 7 to allow satisfaction of the precondition to a further appeal to permit re-litigation of the case on grounds which formed no part of the application for an inquiry.
11This issue was not determined in Carlton.  RA Hulme J stated that if an appellant ""seeks to raise additional grounds, I tend to agree with Giles JA in Kearns that a Court is required to consider them unless they are thought to be frivolous or vexatious"": at [39].  However no final view was expressed, because the point was not argued.  In Kearns v R [2011] NSWCCA 103; 213 A Crim R 150, Giles JA (with whom Latham J agreed) stated at [23] that the Court was aware that the grounds of appeal went beyond the matters raised in the petition for review.  No firm conclusion was reached as to whether leave was required in respect of the additional grounds; nor was there any separate discussion of whether they could be raised.  The suggestion that they should be considered if not ""frivolous or vexatious"" was an adoption of language used by Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Mickelberg v The Queen [1989] HCA 35; 167 CLR 259 at 312, and adopted in the joint reasons in Mallard v The Queen [2005] HCA 68; 224 CLR 125 at [11] (Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ).
12Two further aspects of those cases should be noted.  First, both cases (together with R v JJT [2006] NSWCCA 283; 67 NSWLR 152 in which they were applied) involved referrals based on fresh evidence said to cast doubt upon the original convictions.  It is inevitable in such cases that the whole case relating to the conviction must be considered in order to determine the weight and effect of the new evidence.  As noted in Mallard at [10], ""the words 'the whole case' embrace the whole of the evidence properly admissible, whether 'new', 'fresh' or 'previously adduced', in the case against, and the case for the appellant.""  The error on the part of the Western Australian Court of Appeal in Mallard was identified as the adoption of ""serious inhibitions"" in carrying out that exercise: at [9].
13Secondly, the joint judgment in Mickelberg suggested that a ground of appeal could properly be excluded as vexatious or frivolous ""on the basis that it had already been determined on the merits after full opportunity for argument"" (that was in the earlier appeal): at 312.
14These considerations do not, however, permit departure from the broad statements of principle by the High Court and, in particular the approval in Mallard of the abandonment of a line of contrary authority with respect to the English provision (in equivalent terms) stating that the jurisdiction conferred on the court was that of ""a general right of appeal to the Court of Appeal on any ground [upon] which he wishes to rely (whether it be of law or fact or mixed law and fact), without need to obtain the prior leave of that court"": R v Chard [1984] AC 279 at 289 (Lord Diplock).
15Despite that language, this Court appeared to consider that leave was required in respect of an additional ground in R v JJT, at [89] (McClellan CJ at CL, James and Simpson JJ agreeing).
16Rothman J in Kearns adopted a somewhat different approach to the majority.  He accepted that the question of leave with respect to the additional grounds depended upon the proper interpretation of the phrase ""the whole case"": at [112].  He referred to three cases in which a further appeal was sought on the basis of new evidence casting doubt on the original conviction, namely Mickelberg, Mallard and R v JJT.  He further noted, correctly, that in each the ground for inquiry required that the new evidence be assessed against the whole of the evidence in order to determine whether there had been a miscarriage of justice.  Rothman J concluded:
""117 In the case now before the Court, no ground was raised in the petition other than a miscarriage of justice based upon the allegation that the judge was asleep.  It was not suggested that any ruling was incorrect.  Nor was it suggested that the summing-up was deficient.  Further, it was not suggested that the result was unreasonable.  The petition raised one matter.  The justiciable controversy was whether, because the judge had fallen asleep during the trial, there had been a miscarriage of justice. 
118 In resolving that justiciable controversy, it would be necessary to examine the trial, in its entirety, for evidence of inattentiveness or otherwise supporting (or excluding) the allegation of inattentiveness, or any resulting miscarriage. 
119 But the controversy is defined by the pleadings, in this case, the petition and the reference.  The 'whole case' is the whole of that controversy. The reference replaces, where it may otherwise have been required, the grant of leave by the Court or the issue of a certificate by the trial judge. 
120 After reference, any ground of appeal that is not within the justiciable controversy referred is to be treated in the same way as if it were an appeal under s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act.  The alternative construction would lead to some anomalies.""
17It is not necessary to decide whether that conclusion should be accepted. Even if the ""whole case"" is to be identified by reference to the ground relied on in seeking an inquiry, it does not follow that other grounds could not be relied upon, or if able to be relied upon, that leave is required.  Nor was there consideration of whether a ground which involved a question of law only, within s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, would nevertheless require leave.  There will be a further question in virtually all cases raising additional grounds, namely whether an extension of time is required, which would involve factors similar to those relevant to leave.  On the one hand, a purposive construction might suggest that the subject matter of the appeal on referral was properly confined to the justiciable controversy defined by the application for an inquiry and the referral.  On the other hand, the weight of authority is to the contrary.
18In Carlton, the issue might have called for resolution; the appellant submitted that the majority in the first appeal erred because they had adopted an erroneous approach to the standard non-parole period contrary to Muldrock, but also a failure to take proper account of the appellant's mental illness: Carlton, at [63].  It was not clear whether the second ground was related to the Muldrock error, which was the basis of the inquiry, or independent of it.  The matter was ultimately determined by application of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.  The issue does not arise in the present case because no ground was raised beyond the Muldrock error, the subject of the inquiry.
(d) application of s 6(3)19The fourth question concerns the proper application of s 6(3) to a Pt 7 referral.  In particular, it requires consideration as to how the Court should deal with evidence of post-sentence events.  
20The operation of s 6(3) in respect of an appeal against sentence was carefully examined by this Court in Douar v The Queen [2005] NSWCCA 455; 159 A Crim R 154 (Johnson J; McClellan CJ at CL and Adams J agreeing).  It is now not in doubt that the process of determining an appeal may comprise two or three steps.  First, the court must determine that an error of the kind identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504-505 has been established: for that purpose it may be possible to conclude only that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.  In that case, the finding of error will include the conclusion that some other sentence is warranted in law, with the result that the court will quash the sentence and pass such other sentence as it determines to be appropriate.  By contrast, if a specific error is identified (of a kind which is not immaterial in the sense that it could not affect the outcome) the court must then proceed to a second stage of determining whether another sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed.  That step will require consideration of the likely effect of the identified error on the sentence passed which, not being manifestly excessive, is within an acceptable range.  Douar is authority for the proposition that reference to evidence of post-sentencing events is only appropriate after a relevant error has been determined and the court is proceeding to re-exercise (or is considering re-exercising) the sentencing discretion.
21There are two additional qualifications which appear to be assumed rather than expressed in the authorities.  The first is that when this Court comes to re-exercising (or considering whether to re-exercise) the sentencing discretion it does so on the basis of findings of fact and inferences drawn by the sentencing judge, to the extent that they are unaffected by the error identified on appeal.  That point was illustrated by Sperling J (Giles JA and Hidden J agreeing) in R v Burke [2002] NSWCCA 353 at [88], in a passage cited with approval in Douar at [123].  Where the error is the failure to order that an offender be released on the expiration of a non-parole period which is not more than three years, such an order would properly be made without the need (or, it is suggested, the power) to resentence the appellant afresh.  Similarly, there is no reason in principle why the court, in a case where a Muldrock error has been identified, should reassess the objective seriousness of the offending where no separate error attended that assessment by the sentencing judge.
22The second point of qualification is that subsequent events may lead to a variation in the sentence which should have been passed at the time of the original sentencing, in circumstances where assumptions as to likely events were proved wrong, or where unforeseen events have come to pass.
23The further evidence commonly placed before the Court by way of affidavit from the appellant or others with knowledge of his incarceration, simply gives a history of that incarceration.  However, if that material merely demonstrates circumstances within the usual range of expectations, it cannot properly affect the resentencing process.  By contrast, where the further evidence indicates that the conditions of imprisonment have proved significantly more onerous than those assumed or expected at the time of sentencing, or that the appellant has subsequently been diagnosed with a serious illness, that may warrant a lesser sentence than that which would have been imposed at the time of sentencing, other things being equal.
24It may appear anomalous that such factors could result in a lesser sentence where error is otherwise established in the sentencing process, but not in circumstances where the subsequent events exist but no call for resentencing arises.  In the latter case, the offender is limited to whatever administrative relief may be available (including possibly under Pt 7).  
25There is no reason why the principles applicable to sentencing appeals generally, in these regards, should not apply on a referral under Pt 7.
Approach to resentencing26The mitigating circumstance which formed the basis of the referral was the failure to accord proper weight to the standard non-parole period.  If it were correct that the sentencing judge (and this Court on the first appeal) erred, it was because determinative weight was given to the standard non-parole period in breach of the principles later established in Muldrock.  
27The sentencing judge (Newman AJ) identified the principles to be applied in accordance with then accepted authority in this Court: par 33.  He noted submissions as to certain mitigating factors, including that the offender's parents and most of his siblings lived in Belgium, a circumstance which would make his incarceration ""particularly hard"".  The trial judge then stated that ""countermanding this submission to a significant degree"" was the fact that his brother and sister-in-law lived in Australia and that he had no psychological problems of significance.  Having particular regard to the finding that the crime fell above the mid-range of objective seriousness for the offence, he concluded that ""the fact that his parents and certain of siblings live overseas [is] not in this case sufficient to constitute special circumstances which would cause the Court to deviate from imposing the standard non-parole period.""  
28The reasoning set out above on the part of the sentencing judge (which was not challenged on the first appeal) is sufficient to demonstrate that undue weight was given to the standard non-parole period.  The question is how one assesses what sentence would have been imposed if that error had not arisen.  That is an exercise of some complexity.  First, it is not possible simply to look to the range of sentencing for murders committed prior to 1 February 2003, when the standard non-parole period provisions commenced: as to the temporal element, see Sentencing Procedure Act, Sch 2, Pt 7, cl 45(1) inserted by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002 (NSW), Sch 3 [9].  That is because, given proper weight, the standard non-parole period may well have affected the pre-existing sentencing range.  On the other hand, it is not appropriate to adopt the sentencing range which existed after that date without knowing whether it was affected by the approach to standard non-parole periods found to be erroneous in Muldrock.
29These considerations would suggest that the correct approach might involve three steps, namely:(a) identifying a range of sentencing for murder with respect to offences committed prior to 1 February 2003;(b) identifying a comparable range for offences committed thereafter, and(c) identifying the extent to which any increase in sentencing might be ascribed to the effect of the standard non-parole period, properly considered in accordance with the principles established in Muldrock.However, the Court was not provided with assistance along those lines.
Sentencing for murder30Sentencing for murder has been restructured several times over the years since the abolition of the death penalty in 1955: Crimes (Amendment) Act 1955 (NSW), s 5.  In its first phase, a mandatory sentence of penal servitude for life was imposed which was not subject to variation under s 442 of the Crimes Act.  The first element of flexibility was introduced in 1982, allowing s 442 to operate where the offender's ""culpability for the crime is significantly diminished by mitigating circumstances"": Crimes (Homicide) Amendment Act 1982 (NSW), amending s 19.  
31In 1989 s 19 was replaced by new s 19A which provided for imprisonment ""for the term of the person's natural life"" but removed any restriction on the operation of s 442: Crimes (Life Sentences) Amendment Act 1989 (NSW), Sch 1(4).  Prior to 1989, persons convicted of murder could be released on licence, granted by the Governor and, from 1983, only on the recommendation of the Release on Licence Board: Crimes (Further Amendment) Act 1983 (NSW), inserting new s 463(5).  It was not uncommon in the 1970s and 1980s for prisoners to apply for licences after serving 12 years, or sometimes less: see, eg, Johns v Release on Licence Board (1987) 9 NSWLR 103; Rendell v Release on Licence Board (1987) 10 NSWLR 499.
32Since 1996, the sentence of life imprisonment is reserved for the most serious forms of culpability: Crimes Amendment (Mandatory Life Sentences) Act 1996 (NSW) Sch 1, and see now, Sentencing Procedure Act, s 61(1).  
33Provision for an offender to be released on parole was introduced by the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966 (NSW).  The structure of a sentence involving a non-parole period has been varied on a number of occasions since that Act was repealed in 1983.  With the commencement of the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW), there has been a general requirement that the non-parole period be not less than 75% of the total sentence.  The introduction of a system of standard non-parole periods commenced with respect to offences committed after 1 February 2003.  
34In May 2010 the Judicial Commission of New South Wales published Monograph 33, The Impact of the Standard Non-parole Period Sentencing Scheme on Sentencing Patterns in New South Wales.  It compared sentencing in two periods, namely that from 3 April 2000 to 31 January 2003 (before the standard non-parole period provisions) and from 1 February 2003 to 31 December 2007 (after the introduction of the standard non-parole period).  With respect to offences of murder which went to trial on a not guilty plea, there were 51 cases in the ""pre-period"" and 33 in the ""post-period"": p 26, Fig 1.  The median full term sentence increased by almost 28% (from 18 years to 23 years) and the median non-parole period increased by almost 18% (from 14 years to 16.5 years).  There do not appear to be reliable post-Muldrock figures which might indicate what proportion of the increase resulted from a correct use of the standard non-parole period and what proportion revealed an illegitimate use.
Application of principles35The seriousness of the offending is undeniable: it was a carefully planned and brutal murder.  Further, it was part of a joint criminal enterprise, of which the co-offender (who escaped the jurisdiction) was the ringleader.  However, although the applicant may be legally responsible for all of the shocking acts of violence against the deceased, it is not possible to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he personally inflicted any particular injury.  That factor is relevant to moral culpability which must be distinguished from legal responsibility, for the purpose of sentencing.
36The applicant was young (being 22 years of age at the date of the offending), was without other criminal convictions and was described by the sentencing judge as a person of past good character with above average prospects of rehabilitation: par 30.
37In the absence of detailed assistance, the following considerations must operate at a level of generality.  On the one hand, it is not in doubt that the enactment of a standard non-parole period for the offence of murder increased minimum periods of imprisonment by some years.  What is almost a matter of speculation is the extent to which the increases resulted from according the standard non-parole period an illegitimate and determinative influence in the sentencing process.  Given its proper role as a guidepost, there is no doubt that the standard non-parole period could properly have resulted in an increase in minimum custodial terms.  On the other hand, there are a significant number of cases in which persons convicted of murder after a trial, where the offence was committed at a young age, received non-parole periods of less than 20 years.
38In these circumstances, the matter is one of impression, about which minds might well differ.  I would propose that the sentence be set aside and that the applicant be sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 years with a balance of term of six years.  The total sentence would therefore be 24 years to date from 22 July 2003.  The applicant would be eligible for release on parole on 21 July 2021.
39FULLERTON J:  On 1 July 2005 the appellant was convicted after trial before Newman AJ and a jury of the murder of Shoukat Ali Mohammed.  
40On 26 August 2005 he was sentenced to 26 years and 8 months with a non-parole period of 20 years against a maximum penalty of life imprisonment to which a standard non-parole period of 20 years applied.
41On 30 June 2006 an application for leave to appeal against sentence was granted but the appeal dismissed.  An appeal against conviction was dismissed on the same date (Imnetu v R [2006] NSWCCA 203). 
42The evidence led at trial from which the facts were found for sentencing purposes is conveniently summarised in [2]-[16] of the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal as follows:
""[2] The Crown case against the appellant was that he was party with Basheeruddin Mohammed (""Ben"") in a joint criminal enterprise to kill Shoukat Ali Mohammed (""the deceased""). The evidence as to motive was not entirely clear. However, the deceased had put up a $20,000 bond for Ben as a condition of Ben's obtaining a bridging visa allowing him to remain in Australia. The deceased's own bridging visa was about to expire which meant that he would shortly have to leave the country. 
[3] The Crown case was that the deceased was killed in the appellant's bedroom in a unit he shared with others at 13/187 Cleveland Street, Redfern, at some time between 2.13 pm and 8.15 pm on 29 June 2003. The primary mode of death was strangulation although the deceased was also given a large dose of heroin and was violently assaulted with a baseball bat, suffering a severe head injury. In the evidence of Dr Botterill the cause of death was given as strangulation with opiate intoxication described as a ""significant contributing condition."" 
[4] Ben did not stand trial with the appellant. He had left the country on 17 July 2003 after his visa had been cancelled. 
[5] The case against the appellant was wholly circumstantial. Evidence of the movements of Ben, the appellant and the deceased on 29 June 2003 was available from video surveillance footage in the car park basement at the Cleveland Street premises. 
[6] The appellant was with Ben when they left the premises at 12.38 pm and went to a ""Rebel-sport shop"" in Broadway where Ben purchased a baseball bat and sleeping bag. The deceased made a telephone call from his mobile phone to Ben's phone at 12.45 pm. After first buzzing at the front door Ben and the appellant are seen returning to the appellant's premises through the underground car park with Ben carrying a parcel at 1.38 pm. At this time the appellant is also seen adjusting a surveillance camera in the underground car park. 
[7] At 2.25 pm Ben is seen leaving the premises. At 2.31 pm the deceased drives into the underground car park in his motor vehicle with Ben in the passenger seat. Both are seen approaching the internal lift. This is the last occasion the deceased is seen alive. 
[8] At 3.09 pm the appellant is seen entering the underground car park from the elevator. Ben joined the appellant for some two minutes and then leaves. The appellant is observed to walk into the view of camera 2, look up at it, and then move back from it. At 3.11 pm the appellant is seen standing near the fire stairs and doing a little dance. At 3.13 pm Ben is seen wearing a white top and the appellant a black top. 
[9] At 3.17 pm the appellant went back to the lift and returned to his unit. At 4.06 pm Ben and the appellant re-entered the car park. Ben is now wearing a dark top having changed from his white top. Both appear to be doing some form of surveillance. They also both approach the deceased's motor vehicle. During this sequence the motor vehicle is moved and returned and cameras are again interfered with. The appellant said he moved the cameras so that Ben could not be seen changing the number plates on the deceased's car. At 4.28 pm the appellant's flatmate, Mr Legarth returned home. On the Crown case the murder may and most probably had already taken place in the appellant's bedroom. The Crown submitted that the deceased had, at least, already suffered head injuries by this time. 
[10] At 5.09 pm Ben left the building through the front door and returned through that door at 6.06 pm. At 6.54 pm Ben left the building through the underground car park and returned shortly after at 6.59 pm with a wheelie bin which he took into the lift. 
[11] At 7.53 pm Legarth left the building. Legarth made no mention of a wheelie bin in his evidence and it was the Crown case that this could have been brought into the flat while he was showering. 
[12] It was the defence case that the first the appellant knew of the killing was when he came out of the shower, at or about 7.53 pm, when he saw the deceased in the wheelie bin in front of the exit door and that he was thereafter forced by the co-accused to assist in disposal of the body. 
[13] At 8.15 pm the appellant exited the lift, walked around and then went back into the lift. At 8.18 pm both exit. Ben was pushing a wheelie bin. Cameras are again interfered with. A few minutes later they re-enter the car park and enter the elevator. Some time later they are seen leaving in the deceased's vehicle. The vehicle was disposed of. 
[14] The evidence established that the deceased had been orally administered a large dose of heroin (he was not a drug user), had been violently hit over the head and then strangled with an electrical cord which was later found in the appellant's bedroom. Blood was subsequently identified on the carpet of the appellant's bedroom. 
[15] The Crown case was that the appellant and Ben were engaged in a ""joint criminal enterprise."" It was put that the jury could infer that the appellant was involved from at least the time of purchase of the baseball bat and sleeping bag, that he acted as a lookout in the basement car park, that he attempted to move the surveillance cameras on three occasions to avoid detection and that he was involved with the disposal and removal of the body of the deceased. The Crown also relied on mobile phone calls from the appellant to Ben and Legarth, which were made while both were at the premises and which were not answered by either of them. This was said to be a method of communication between the appellant and Ben and a method whereby the appellant tested whether Legarth was still in the unit. 
[16] There was also some evidence from which it could be inferred that the shirt worn by Ben got blood on it when the deceased was assaulted with the baseball bat, Ben took the shirt off and was then lent another, larger, dark shirt by the appellant. Ben is seen in the dark shirt at 4.06 pm.""
43The sentencing judge made the following findings as to the appellant's subjective circumstances:
""[26]  ...First, he is a very young man.  He is 24... He is a Belgium national, albeit of Eritrean extraction.  He came to Australia in August 2001 on a student visa.  His brother had migrated to this country in 1999.  His brother is married and, indeed, his sister-in-law gave evidence at the trial as to the prisoner's character.  On coming to this country the prisoner commenced and finished a business management course in this city.  At the time of the commission of this offence he was working as a room attendant in a city hotel.
[27]  He has no criminal convictions and is regarded by character witnesses called at the trial as being a person of good character who lived a normal life for a person of his years.  The only negative factor in his past is his use of cannabis.  Indeed, there was evidence that he and Basheeruddin had intended to go out during the course of the afternoon of 29 June 2003 to purchase cannabis.
[28]  His parents still live in Belgium.  Unfortunately his mother has been diagnosed with cancer, a matter that, naturally enough, the prisoner finds very distressing.
[29]  Since he has been in prison the prisoner has participated successfully in prison programs and has conducted himself properly in custody.
[30]  Taking all these matters into account I have considered sentence on the basis that the prisoner is a person of past good character with above average prospects of rehabilitation.""
44The sentencing judge approached the standard non-parole period consistent with R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 as summarised by the decision of Simpson J in R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; 150 A Crim R 575, which he set out at length in his sentencing reasons.  He also noted that a finding of special circumstances could allow a departure from the standard non-parole period that would otherwise be imposed following his finding that the offence was above the mid range, but was not satisfied that the appellant's status as a foreign national was sufficient in itself for a finding of special circumstances, as to which he said at [34] of his sentencing reasons:
""... In my view the fact that his parents and certain of his siblings live overseas are not in this case sufficient to constitute special circumstances which should cause the Court to deviate from imposing the standard non-parole period.  I say this particularly in the light of my finding that this crime indeed falls above the mid-range.  I should also add in this regard that I do, as I have already indicated, accept the submission put on behalf of the prisoner by Ms McSpedden that Basheeruddin was the ring-leader in these events.  I have determined to set the standard non-parole period rather than a longer period because of this factor together with the prisoner's past good character, his good prospects of rehabilitation, his youth and the fact that most of his family reside overseas.  Whilst, as I have said, this latter factor does not constitute special circumstances, it is a factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate non-parole period.""
45One of the grounds of the appeal against sentence in 2006 was that the sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the objective gravity of the offence at above the mid range.  Given the appellant's complicity with a co-offender in what McClellan CJ at CL described as a ""premeditated and vicious killing"" (a murder which Latham J, in a separate judgment, described as involving a relatively high degree of planning and in which the appellant played a pivotal role), the characterisation of the appellant's culpability as above the mid range was not found to admit of error.  In dealing with a further submission advanced by the appellant that the evidence supported a finding that he did no more than act as a lookout and a decoy and not that he was actually involved in the murder, Latham J said as follows at [54]: 
""Not only did the appellant jointly engage with Ben in doing all that was necessary to carry out the murder and to avoid, as far as possible, detection, but he provided the premises where the offence might be committed without the risk of intervention by others. I do not regard a finding by his Honour that Ben was ""the leader of these criminal activities"" as in any way detracting from the objective gravity of the appellant's role. Similarly, the absence of evidence capable of establishing who administered the heroin to the deceased, who struck him with the baseball bat and who strangled him does not equate to the proposition that the appellant did not participate in those activities. Given the length of time during which the appellant and Ben were in each other's company, and in the company of the deceased, inside the unit when the injuries were undoubtedly inflicted, his Honour was entitled to find that the acts leading to the deceased's death were committed in concert.""
46A separate ground of appeal concerned whether it was open to his Honour to regard the degree of planning involved in the murder, and the fact that it was committed in company, as features of aggravation under s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), it being submitted that the proviso in s 21A(2) applied as both factors were elements of the offence.  That ground of appeal was also rejected.  McClellan CJ at CL held that they were not elements of the offence of murder for the purposes of s 21A(2), but merely descriptive of how this particular murder was carried out and that the sentencing judge was entitled to take both matters into account in characterising the seriousness of the offence and informing an appropriate sentence.  Latham J considered that the circumstance of aggravation in s 21A(2)(e) (where the offence is committed in company) reflects the criminality inherent in the commission of an offence by the combined force of two or more offenders and does not equate with a joint criminal enterprise which is a basis of criminal liability. 
47Following the decision in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39, (2011) 244 CLR 120 the appellant sought an enquiry into his sentence under s 78(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) on the grounds that there was a doubt or question as to circumstances having the potential to mitigate sentence, because undue weight was accorded to the standard non-parole period contrary to the decision in Muldrock.  Although there was no reference in the Court of Criminal Appeal to the sentencing judge's application of s 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, or to his Honour's approach to sentence for an offence where a standard non-parole period applied in accordance with R v Way, since disapproved of in Muldrock, Latham J was satisfied that it was implicit in the disposition of the ground of appeal that alleged error in the assessment of the offence as above mid range that the Court of Criminal Appeal saw no error in that approach.
48On 19 December 2013 her Honour granted the application and referred the matter to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) on the basis that the sentencing judge and the Court of Criminal Appeal applied sentencing principles that have since been discredited.  
49The sole ground of appeal is in the following terms. ""The sentencing judge erred in his consideration of the standard non-parole period in light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120.""
50There was no challenge to the sentencing judge's finding that the offence was above the middle of the range of objective seriousness or the views expressed by McClellan CJ at CL and Latham J in the Court of Criminal Appeal as to the nature and extent of the appellant's complicity in the murder.  As RA Hulme J observed in Carlton v R [2014] NSWCCA 14 at [78], an assessment of objective seriousness referable to a mid range offence does not run counter to Muldrock.  The question is whether in undertaking the re-sentencing exercise, enlivened by a finding of Muldrock error, the imposition of a lesser sentence is warranted at law as provided for in s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.   That exercise requires that all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles are taken into account to inform the positive opinion provided for in the section (see Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284; see also RLS v R [2012] NSWCCA 236 at [98]; and ZZ v R [2013] NSWCCA 83 at [97]).  
51The approach to sentence mandated in Muldrock requires a synthesis of all factors bearing upon an appropriate sentence for the murder of the deceased, including the objective gravity of the appellant's offending, the impact of any aggravating factors, the appellant's subjective circumstances and the legislative guidance offered by the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period, without the latter being prescriptive or exerting undue influence in the determination of an appropriate sentence.  
52In determining whether another sentence is warranted at law, it is also necessary to consider the evidence relied upon by the appellant concerning his custodial conditions and his conduct as a prisoner since he was sentenced in October 2008 (see R v Douar [2005] NSWCCA 455; 159 A Crim R 154 at [123] where Johnson J considered the admissibility of evidence for the purposes of s 6(3) adopting the principled approach to that question in R v Burke [2002] NSWCCA 353 at [82]-[92]).  The relevance of post-offence conduct in cases where a Muldrock error has been conceded or established will vary from case to case.  In Ali v R [2014] NSWCCA 45 the appellant's acceptance of criminal responsibility and expressed remorse for the offending hitherto denied over many years, coupled with his efforts to obtain psychological help to provide insight to his offending, including having completed 11 of 14 sessions in the CUBIT preparatory program before he was advised by the Legal Aid Commission that his sentence was being reviewed following the High Court decision in Muldrock, were amongst factors which led the Court to conclude that a lesser sentence was warranted in law.  In Grant v R [2014] NSWCCA 67 the appellant's deteriorating health whilst serving the sentence under review also attracted the intervention of the Court.
53The appellant is currently 33 years of age.  He has spent 10 years and 8 months in custody, including a period on remand following his arrest for this offence.  He has been punished for a breach of prison discipline in May 2012 when he was found with three USB devices which contained music, television shows and a wrestling training video.  He expressed a desire to acquire tertiary qualifications in engineering.  However, because he is serving his sentence as a foreign citizen he does not receive any assistance from the Australian government and the Belgian government does not provide financial support to their citizens who are studying overseas.  He is unable to appeal to his family for financial support.  The successful completion of a range of TAFE courses was confirmed by his instructing solicitor who annexed to his affidavit a large number of certificates of achievement.  The appellant has worked in various jobs within the prison system and, at the time of these proceedings, is the head sweeper of his wing at Lithgow Correctional Centre.  Aside from an older brother who lives in Sydney and who visits every two or three months, his other family members, including his parents, live in Brussels.  His mother has visited on three occasions (in 2008, 2011 and 2013) and other family members were either at his trial or have visited since that time.
54The fact that the appellant has committed himself to study and has not breached prison discipline other than one relatively minor breach in May 2012 (notably not an offence of violence or associated with drug use), is to be commended.  However there is nothing in the evidence upon which he relies for present purposes which does more than endorse what the sentencing judge predicted to be his sound prospects of rehabilitation.  I also note that although the appellant has not taken the additional step of acknowledging responsibility for the murder or expressing any remorse for it, he does indicate a willingness to participate in the Violent Offenders Rehabilitation Program when it is offered to him.  He is of course nine years older than his age at the time of sentence and ten years and eight months older than when he murdered the deceased.  The mere passage of time, and what appears to be his maturation over that period, is not of itself of any significant weight of the question of re-sentence. 
55For my part, despite the findings that are still able to be made in the appellant's favour operating in mitigation of sentence, and to a lesser extent his personal circumstances as a foreign national, the continuing relevance of the standard non-parole period and the maximum penalty as legislative guideposts for a murder of this level of objective seriousness, persuade me that no other sentence than that which was imposed by the sentencing judge is warranted in law.   
56The order I propose is as follows:Appeal against sentence dismissed.
57RA HULME J:  I agree with Fullerton J.

		05 June 2014",2014-06-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704976,R v Briggs (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 851,"Judgment
1A joint application has been made by the parties for a view to be conducted in the course of this trial for murder.  Having heard brief submissions, I have come to consider that it would be appropriate to approve such a course.  
2The background is that the accused is facing a single count of murder said to have been committed on 26 December 2012.  The Crown case is that, on Christmas Eve of that year, the accused attended at the home of the deceased and inflicted a severe beating upon him that included the use of a baseball bat.  The deceased died two days later.  Two witnesses, a Mr Costin and a Mr Ryan, were outside and heard and saw something of what was occurring.  In their statements, they have provided a description of the general layout of the streetscape.  They have also provided evidence identifying the voice of the accused as being the same voice as was heard to say a number of potentially inculpatory things from within the apartment block.
3Accordingly, the facts in issue are whether the accused voluntarily did an act that caused the death of the deceased with one of the two requisite intentions for murder.  I have been informed by the parties that it is not expected that there will be a dispute about whether the accused voluntarily did an act that caused the death of the deceased.  It seems that the real issues in the trial will be whether the Crown has proven one of the two necessary mental elements of murder, and whether the Crown has disproven self-defence.  
4In support of the application, defence counsel submitted that an appreciation of the size of the apartment is important to his case.  That is because, he explained, the apartment is really quite small, and the various photographs and plans that will be tendered in the Crown case do not permit one fully to appreciate that fact.  He explained that part of his case will be the proposition that some of the injuries seen to the body of the deceased could have been caused by the deceased coming into contact with structures and items within that confined space, rather than by the direct infliction of violence by the accused.
5The Crown Prosecutor did not gainsay the validity of that submission.  Furthermore, he submitted that it is important for the jury to understand the layout of the streetscape in general.  As well as that, if there is to be an attack on the voice identification evidence, it will be important for the jury to have an appreciation of distances and any obstacles to hearing.  
6Furthermore, the Crown Prosecutor informed me that, other than furniture, the scene has changed little. 
7Finally, he expressed his confidence that the jury would be able to be comfortably insulated by way of the work of the police and the sheriff's officers.  
8Turning to analyse s 53 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), I propose to review briefly the subsections in the order in which they appear in the statute.
9As for s 53(1), an application has been made for an inspection by both parties.  Each party accepted, of course, that it remains a matter for my discretion.  
10As for s 53(2)(a), both the Crown and the accused will be given a reasonable opportunity to be present.  To be clear, the accused is perfectly entitled to be present and, if he wishes to be present and yet is absent, the view will not take place: see R v Jamal  [2012] NSWCCA 198.  I am told by his counsel that he does not wish to be present.
11As for s 53(2)(b), of course the jury and I will be present at the view.  
12I have taken the following matters into account.
13As for s 53(3)(a), the Crown Prosecutor and defence counsel and their solicitors will be present.  The accused will not be, on current indications.  There are sound reasons why an accused person who is in custody may choose not to be present, and to leave the conduct of the view to his solicitor and counsel.  His absence by choice, in those circumstances, does not lead me to consider that the view should not be granted.
14As for s 53(3)(b), in my opinion the view will assist the jury to resolve issues of fact and to understand the evidence.  I refer to the three matters raised by the parties above.  Quite apart from those matters, in my experience as counsel and as a judge, attendance at an alleged crime scene very much assists one to comprehend the plethora of evidence about that scene that I expect will be led in the trial, and to appreciate the scene as a whole.
15As for s 53(3)(c), neither party submitted that the view could be unfairly prejudicial, misleading or confusing, or could cause or result in undue waste of time.  
16As for the latter, I am told that the proposed location is a drive of five minutes from the courthouse.  
17As for the view being misleading, I am told that the scene is little changed.  I do not doubt that the parties, if necessary, will formally lead evidence of, and explain in address, any difference between the scene as it is today and as it was in December 2012.  (I have taken that into account with regard to s 53(3)(e) as well.)
18I see no basis for fear of unfair prejudice.  
19In short, in light of the foreshadowed issues in the trial, including the elements of murder that will truly be in dispute, I consider that the conduct of a view will soundly assist the jury in discharging its function as the tribunal of fact.  
20It is for those reasons that I accede to the joint application of the parties.  
21My order then is that the joint application for an inspection in the form of a view in Armidale is granted.  
22The parties may liaise with my Associate informally with regard to logistical aspects of the preparation for the conduct of the view.

		01 July 2014",2014-06-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704978,R v Briggs (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 852,"Judgment
1Defence counsel has taken objection to a small portion of the foreshadowed evidence of the witness David Ryan.  The evidence is contained in the statement of the witness of 24 December 2012, which became voir dire exhibit D.  
2To state things succinctly, the Crown allegation is that the accused inflicted fatal violence on the deceased on 24 December 2012.  Although the witness does not claim to have seen the violence actually inflicted, he gives evidence of alighting from a vehicle in Brown Street, Armidale.  As he did so, he heard ""yelling and screaming"" from a male from inside a house, along with smashing and thumping sounds.  
3Although only the penultimate sentence of [5] of voir dire exhibit D is the subject of objection, it is necessary to set out the whole of [4] and [5] in order to understand the objection.  I have emphasised the sentence under consideration for convenience.
[4] When we heard the commotion, Matthew and I decided to walk closer to the house to check and see what's going on inside.  Just before we reached the front of the house, I saw a male of Aboriginal appearance, less than 6 feet in height, with an oversized belly and he had short hair with the sides shaved and a goatee for his facial hair walk towards the front entrance of the house.  I saw that he was wearing a yellow coloured singlet, grey coloured stubby shorts and thongs.  I observed that his singlet had discolouration which appeared to be some spilt liquid and I saw specks of red colour on his singlet which I thought was blood.  I heard this male person yelling and screaming.  At the time, I was looking at him from the side of the house and I was about 20 metres away from him.  
[5] As I continued watching this male person, I observed that he was heavily intoxicated.  I know this because he had slurred speech and he was stumbling as he walked back inside the house.  I would also describe this male person as aggressive based on his demeanour.  At that time, he had his chest puffed out, breathing heavily and he was talking loudly.  
4The submission of defence counsel is, in short, that the evidence is opinion evidence, and therefore inadmissible pursuant to s 76 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (""the Act""); that it is not expert opinion evidence, and is therefore not admissible pursuant to the exception to the rule of exclusion that is contained in s 79 of the Act; and, finally, that the evidence does not fall within the exception provided for lay opinion evidence contained in s 78 of the Act.  That section is a follows: 
78   Exception: lay opinions
The opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion expressed by a person if:
(a)  the opinion is based on what the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived about a matter or event, and
(b)  evidence of the opinion is necessary to obtain an adequate account or understanding of the person's perception of the matter or event.
5As I understand it, defence counsel accepted that s 78(a) of the Act had been made out.  The crux of the objection was the proposition that the evidence of the opinion of Mr Ryan that the accused was ""aggressive"" is not ""necessary to obtain an adequate account or understanding of [Mr Ryan]'s perception of the matter or event.""
6The learned Crown Prosecutor submitted that the second leg of the section had been established.  Although he accepted that Mr Ryan is in a position to give evidence of the primary facts that led him to form that opinion (the puffed out chest, the heavy breathing, the loud talking, and, perhaps, the yelling and screaming referred to in [4]), nevertheless, those primary descriptions did not adequately convey the import of the evidence of the witness about the demeanour of the accused.  
7In response to my query as to whether or not the section is in truth directed towards circumstances in which a witness can describe something that he or she perceived (for example, the speed of a vehicle; or the drunkenness, age, or mood of another person), but is unable to perceive or describe or remember the multitude of tiny observations that went to make up that single ultimate observation, the Crown Prosecutor submitted that it would be anomalous indeed for a party to be able to adduce such evidence more readily when less underlying detail is available.    
8There is force in that submission of the Crown Prosecutor.  However, in Lithgow City Council v Jackson [2011] HCA 36; 244 CLR 352 at [45] and following, the judgment of the plurality (in which Gummow and Crennan JJ separately agreed with regard to the analysis of s 78) repeatedly focused on the foundation of the admission of such evidence, both at common law and pursuant to the section, as being the impracticality of a witness giving evidence of the multitude of primary observations that underpin the observation ultimately made: see [45]-[46], [51], [54] and [57]. 
9At [45] the plurality said:
... The usual examples are age, sobriety, speed, time,distance, weather, handwriting, identity, bodily health and emotional state, but a thorough search would uncover very many more. The problems which arise in examples falling into this category would have been reduced, though not completely solved, if, at the time of the observation, the observer had foreseen that one day he or she would be questioned by a police detective or a barrister, for then the observer might have made some conscious contemporaneous attempt to sort out the primacy facts so as to facilitate their future recollection and expression. But in many cases, to endeavour to describe the primary facts underlying the inference may be ineffective or misleading without stating the inference. The reason why it is very difficult for the observer is that it is almost impossible to separate the inferences from the primary facts on which they are based, and often very difficult to identify and recollect the primary facts themselves. [Footnotes omitted]
10At [46] the plurality extracted a portion of the judgment of Gibson J in Cornwell v Green (1823) 10 Serg & Rawle 14 at 16, subsequently approved by Wigmore: 
There are cases where a single impression is made by induction from a number of others; as, where we judge whether a man is actuated by passion, we are determined by the expression of his countenance, the tone of his voice, his gestures, and a variety of other matters: yet a witness speaking of such a subject of inquiry, would be permitted directly to say whether the man was angry or not ... I take it, that wherever the facts from which a witness received an impression are too evanescent in their nature to be recollected, or are too complicated to be separated and distinctly narrated, his impressions from these facts become evidence."" [Footnotes omitted]
11The plurality also quoted a portion of the judgment of Loomis J in Sydleman v Beckwith (1875) 43 Conn 9 at 12-14, which was also approved by Wigmore: 
... the principle rests:""[O]n the ground of necessity, where the subject of the inquiry is so indefinite and general as not to be susceptible of direct proof, or where the facts on which the witness bases his opinion are so numerous and so evanescent that they cannot be held in the memory and detailed to the jury precisely as they appeared to the witness at the time ...The very basis upon which ... this exception to the general rule rests, is that the nature of the subject matter is such that it cannot be reproduced or detailed to the jury precisely as it appeared to the witness at the time."" [Footnotes omitted]
12At [51] the plurality said:
The function of s 78(b) is to make up for incapacity to perceive theprimary aspects of events and conditions, or to remember theperception, or to express the memory of that perception.
13At [54] the plurality said:
The word ""necessary"" is not directed to meeting difficulties that arise where it is impossible or inconvenient to call the person propounding the opinion as a witness. It is not analogous to the provisions permitting evidence of hearsay statements where better evidence is unavailable (eg, ss 63 and 65 of the Act) or where to call better evidence could cause undue expense or undue delay or would not be reasonably practicable (s 64 of the Act). Section 78 is not a ""best evidence"" provision, permitting reception of the evidence if there is no better evidence. The word ""necessary"" is instead directed to a relationship internal to the evidence of the perceiver - the relationship between the perceiver's perceptions and the perceiver's opinion.
14At [57] the plurality said:
...Indeed the whole point of the common law rule is that it cures the difficulty that an observer may be confident about a conclusion reached from observations without being able to perceive, remember or state the primary materials which led to it. There is nothing in s 78(b) to suggest any different position.
15Here, there is no difficulty of perception, observation, or recollection in the witness giving evidence of the primary observations that led to him expressing the ultimate lay opinion about the demeanour of the accused.  His statement details the three (and possibly four) primary observations that led him to his conclusion about that topic.  And that statement was made, at the most, two hours after the events in question.
16Furthermore, I consider it important that the section speaks of the necessity of the evidence, as opposed to, perhaps, the desirability or the appropriateness of its receipt.  
17I accept that it would be desirable, from the Crown's perspective, for the jury to have the conclusion that Mr Ryan drew from the things that he perceived about the person and conduct of the accused.  I also accept that it could be of assistance to the understanding of the jury of the events of 24 December 2012 to receive the lay opinion evidence.  
18However, in the circumstances, I do not consider it necessary for that evidence to be admitted in order to obtain an adequate account or understanding of what Mr Ryan perceived.  
19As was said in discussion with the parties, it would remain quite open to the Crown Prosecutor to submit that the jury would infer without difficulty from all of the primary things observed by Mr Ryan that the accused was indeed aggressive at the time that witness observed him.  
20However, I am not persuaded that the test contained in s 78(b) of the Act has been made out by the Crown.  Accordingly, oral evidence in accordance with the third sentence in paragraph 5 of the statement of Mr Ryan of 24 December 2012 will not be permitted in the trial.

2704982,SHR v R [2014] NSWCCA 94,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  I agree with the orders proposed by Fullerton J.  I also agree with her reasons.  I set out what I considered the principled approach to sentencing for 'old' offences in MPB v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 at [4]-[33].  
2The error in specifying indicative sentences in accordance with s 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), while not determinative of the outcome of the appeal, caused confusion in this case and was apt to lead to a misreading of the outcome for other purposes.
3FULLERTON J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence imposed by Woods DCJ on 6 September 2012 after he adhered to pleas of guilty entered on 20 July 2012 to the following offences:
(1)Sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61D(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), maximum penalty 8 years imprisonment (since repealed).
(2)Robbery with an offensive weapon, contrary to s 97 of the Crimes Act, maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment.
(These offences relate to an assault on LG committed on 10 July 1989.) 
(3)Sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61D(1) of the Crimes Act, maximum penalty 8 years imprisonment (since repealed).
(4)Robbery with an offence weapon, contrary to s 97 of the Crimes Act, maximum penalty 20 years imprisonment. 
(These offences relate to an assault on MS committed on 15 December 1989.) 
(5)Sexual intercourse without consent, and in company, contrary to s 61D(1B) of the Crimes Act, maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment (since repealed)
(6)Steal from person, contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act, maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment. 
(7)Sexual intercourse without consent, and in company, contrary to s 61D(1B) of the Crimes Act, maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment (since repealed)
(These offences relate to an assault on AS committed on 18 January 1990.) 
A further offence of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61D(1) of the Crimes Act (since repealed) was taken into account on a Form 1 attached to count 1. 
4The offences were committed against three women in unrelated incidents between 10 July 1989 and 18 January 1990 when the applicant was aged between 16 years and 3 months and 16 years and 9 months.  He was aged 39 at the time of sentence.
5In 2010 the police were notified by the ""Cold Case Justice Project"" that the applicant's DNA profile matched the DNA profile of the offender in each of the three incidents.  On 16 June 2010, whilst in custody for unrelated offences, the applicant was charged with the offences the subject of counts 3 and 4.  On 13 September 2010, after being released to bail on those offences, he was charged in relation to the offences the subject of counts 5, 6 and 7.  He was charged in relation to counts 1 and 2 on 19 May 2011.  
6Pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), Woods DCJ imposed an aggregate sentence of imprisonment of 14 years to date from 11 September 2010 with a non-parole period of 10 years.  The statutory ratio between head sentence and non-parole period was varied by six months after his Honour found special circumstances under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.   
7The applicant relied upon the following grounds of appeal:
Ground 1:  His Honour failed to take into account the applicant's youth and immaturity at the time of the commission of the offences. 
Ground 2:  The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive.
8The applicant's written submissions in reply identified a potential error in the way his Honour dealt with the applicant's pleas of guilty in the imposition of an aggregate sentence under s 53A, s 53A(2)(b) requiring the sentencing judge to account for the pleas of guilty in the specification of the indicative sentence for each count rather than applying the discount to the aggregate sentence.  Although the applicant did not seek leave at the hearing of the appeal to amend the grounds of appeal, the Crown accepted that if the sentencing judge did not comply with s 53A(2)(b), and that error was shown to be material to the individual indicative sentences, or any of them, then consideration would need to be given to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).    
9The following schedule sets out sentences indicated by his Honour referable to the maximum penalties that applied in 1989/1990.  It also includes an indication of those sentences both in compliance with the obligation under s 53A(2)(b) to apply the discount for the plea of guilty and without that discount being applied:  
OffenceMaximum penalty as at the date of the offending Indicative sentenceStarting point if indicative sentence included 20% discount for plea of guilty as required by s 53A(2)(b)Adjusted indicative sentence if 20% discount for plea of guilty was applied as required by s 53A(2)(b) Ct 1: s 61D(1) + Form 1. 8 years 6 years  7 years 6 months 4 years, 9 months 18 days Ct 2: s 97 20 years 4 years5 years 3 years, 2 months, 12 days. Ct 3: s 61D(1) 8 years 5 years 6 years 3 months 4 years Ct 4: s 97 20 years 4 years 5 years 3 years, 2 months, 12 days.Ct 5: s 61D(1B) 10 years 6 years7 years 6 months4 years, 9 months 18 daysCt 6: s 94 14 years 3 years 3 years 9 months 2 years, 4 months, 24 days Ct 7: s 61D(1B) 10 years 6 years 7 years 6 months4 years, 9 months 18 days
The agreed facts for sentencing purposes 
10Counts 1 and 2, together with the offending the subject of the Form 1, concern offending on 10 July 1989.  At that time the applicant was 16 years and 3 months of age.  The victim, LG, was aged 18.  She was walking home sometime after 4.45pm when the applicant grabbed her from behind, placed one hand over her mouth and the other around her waist and said, ""Don't make a noise"".  She screamed.  The applicant said, ""Shut up I've got a knife and I will kill you"".  He presented a pocket knife before dragging her into a nearby park.  The applicant then took about $13 out of her wallet.  (This conduct attracted the armed robbery charges the subject of count 2.)  
11The applicant then started to put his hand up LG's skirt.  She falsely protested that she was pregnant in an unsuccessful attempt to deter the applicant from assaulting her further.  She started crying.  The applicant said, ""Shut up or I'll hurt you"".  The applicant then pulled off her underwear and put his fingers in her vagina and tried to kiss her.  When a person living nearby went outside his home to calm his barking dog the offender placed both hands over the victim's mouth.  Thereafter he again put his fingers into the victim's vagina before putting his penis into her mouth.  The conduct grounded the offence of sexual intercourse without consent on the Form 1.  When the victim struggled for breath the applicant grabbed her by the hair and banged her head onto the ground.  The applicant then inserted his penis into her vagina (count 1). 
12After about five minutes of sustained sexual intercourse the applicant said, ""Don't move and don't make a noise because I've still got the knife and I will hurt you"".  He then used LG's clothing to tie her feet together and her hands behind her back.  He stuffed her stockings in her mouth.  After examining the contents of her wallet the applicant announced that he knew where she lived and that if she screamed he would come back and get her.  LG waited for about ten minutes, untied herself and reported the assault to police.  
13Counts 3 and 4 concern unrelated offending on 15 December 1989, when the applicant was aged 16 years and 8 months.  The victim, MS, aged 38, was home alone with her two children, aged 4 years and 10 months, when she was confronted by the applicant standing over her bed.  MS screamed and the applicant said, ""Be quiet, I've got a knife"".  The applicant then tied MS's hands behind her back and demanded her wallet from which he removed between $10 and $15.  This constituted the robbery the subject of the fourth count. 
14After returning to the bedroom, the applicant said he did not want to hurt her and she should not make any sound.  The baby cried and MS indicated it was her baby making the noise.  The applicant then removed MS's pants and inserted his penis into her vagina (count 3).  Sometime during the assault the applicant called MS a ""fucking slut"".  After a short time he obtained a tea towel and tied her ankles together.  Before he left he said, ""If you call the police, I'll keep coming back.  Wait ten minutes, I want to get away"".  The applicant then left the premises.  Thereafter MS attended the hospital and the police station. 
15The offending the subject of counts 5, 6 and 7 occurred on 18 January 1990 when the applicant was aged 16 years and 9 months.  The victim, AS, aged 25, was walking home at about 11.20pm when a hand was placed over her mouth and her head was pulled back by her hair.  She felt a second person holding her arms behind her back.  The two men then pushed her into a laneway.  Assuming the men intended to rob her, AS said, ""Just take my bag but give me my keys"", whereupon the men pushed her into another darker laneway.  She was directed not to scream.  She was then pushed to the ground and her skirt and underwear removed.  One of the men (not the applicant) placed his hands over her mouth and said, ""Spread your legs.  I don't want him to have to kill you"".  The applicant then ripped off her blouse and bra, and kissed her vagina before inserting his penis into her vagina.  This conduct grounded the laying of count 5.  The other male said, ""Hurry up, I want her too"", whereupon the applicant pinned her to the ground while the other male inserted his penis into her vagina.  This conduct grounded count 7.  AS immediately reported the matter to the police before attending the hospital.  The applicant took the victim's handbag, the subject of count 6. 
16Victim impact statements from each of the three women were tendered.  Each described the severe and enduring impact of the assaults, including the impact on their social and personal relationships, their heightened fear and anxiety, episodes of depression, and disruption to their employment. 
The applicant's case 
17The applicant did not give evidence.  A report of clinical psychologist Mr Champion of 25 July 2012 was tendered.  He interviewed the applicant in custody on 24 July and obtained his medical and psychosocial history although, it would appear, with limited supporting information.  Mr Champion also administered a range of recognised psychometric tests and reported upon the applicant's intellectual functioning.
18The applicant reported repeated hospital admissions for injuries of various kinds, including a voluntary admission sometime in 2009 under the Mental Health Act 2007 (NSW) where he remained for a period of some months.  He was treated with antipsychotic medication.  The applicant reported a family history of schizophrenia.  He also had a hospital admission in 1997 after a serious drug overdose.  At the time of report he was being managed on antidepressant medication and methadone.  Mr Champion expressed the opinion that the applicant's underlying poor physical and mental health was likely the result of chronic alcohol and polysubstance abuse from a young age.  Mr Champion expressed the opinion that the integrity of the applicant's neurological system could not be assumed, although without access to his medical records it was difficult to confirm whether there was any underlying brain injury as a consequence of alcohol-related brain damage.
19The applicant reported a history of abuse of various medications in his teenage years, including benzodiazepines and painkillers.  He also reported first using cannabis at age 13 on a spasmodic basis.  He started using amphetamines at age 14 (his older brother being an abuser of that drug) and inhaling and smoking amphetamine with cannabis until the age of 20 when he began using heroin.   
20The applicant was assessed as being in the borderline intellectually disabled range which Mr Champion reported was consistent with the applicant's presentation and a history of placement in special education classes at primary school for children assessed to have mild to borderline intellectual disability.  Upon testing he had a reading age of about 7 years rendering him essentially illiterate.  Mr Champion noted that the aetiology of the applicant's intellectual limitations was unknown.  
21The applicant attended a number of different primary schools and left high school at the beginning of Year 10.  He struggled thereafter to find any permanent work.  Broken periods of incarceration also negatively impacted upon his prospects of stable employment.  In Mr Champion's view, the applicant's social and educational deprivation would likely have impacted adversely upon his language-based cognitive development, as revealed on testing. 
22The applicant grew up on an aboriginal Mission in Taree, a place Mr Champion observed was known at that time for its disadvantage and social dysfunction.  The applicant was one of six children.  His parents separated when he was about 10.  His father was an alcoholic.  His mother moved to Sydney whilst his father stayed in Taree.  The applicant moved between Sydney and Taree but became progressively disconnected from his family which led to further substance abuse under the influence of what Mr Champion described as his ""subcultural peers"".  The applicant described himself as ""a very angry individual at that time"".  He reported having been sexually abused when he was about 12 or 13 which Mr Champion considered would likely have contributed to his adjustment problems and mood disturbance as an adolescent.  
23Mr Champion resolved to the opinion that the applicant's intellectual limitations and conduct disorder, secondary to social disadvantage, family dysfunction and substance abuse, were probably present at the time of the offending and would likely have compromised his capacity for sound judgment and foresight of the consequences of his actions.  Mr Champion expressed the opinion that a combination of the abuse of medication, illegal drugs and alcohol could be expected to lead to disinhibition and impaired personal control.
24Mr Champion reported that although the applicant did not resile from his pleas of guilty it was difficult to obtain a detailed account from him about the offences.  He did, however, tell Mr Champion that he believed that he was affected by either alcohol or drugs and that he committed the robbery offences because he was living on the streets and associating with the people he met there.  
25The applicant also spoke openly of his regret for his actions and said he felt disgusted with himself, being a man now aged 40 and looking back on his life.  He said that the sexual offending just ""weren't me"" and that he was going through an ""angry stage"" because his mother and father had separated and he was living on the streets.
26At the time of sentence the applicant had six children with his first child born of a transitory relationship when he was 18.  Since that time he has had three further children, again in casual relationships.  At the time of sentence he had a relationship of seven years standing to which two children have been born, then aged three and four years.
27Mr Champion considered that the applicant was at risk of institutionalisation given his custodial history, his lack of sophistication and limited intellectual functioning.  Mr Champion identified a need for the applicant to be referred to a mental health team for psychiatric oversight and treatment, and monitoring by an alcohol and other drugs service when released to parole.
Proceedings and Remarks on Sentence 
28His Honour found that the objective seriousness of the sexual assaults against each of the three women was significant, warranting the imposition of sentences in the upper range of sentences relative to sentences which were imposed for similar offending proximate to the date of offending.  A schedule of comparative cases was tendered by consent.  Most of the sentences imposed in those cases were imposed after September 1989 when the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW) displaced the operation of the Probation and Parole Act 1983 (NSW).  
29However, counts 1 and 2 (and the offence on the Form 1) were committed when the sentencing regime under the Probation and Parole Act prevailed.  That regime which had the effect of reducing the non-parole period imposed by the Court by reason of the system of remissions administered by the parole authorities.  Counts 3 to 7 were committed following the passage of the Sentencing Act where, after the abolition of the system of remissions, the minimum term imposed by the Court as part of the sentencing order was to be served prior to an offender being considered for release to parole.  In addition, all but one sentence on the schedule was passed prior to passage of the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1989 (NSW) which had the effect of substantially increasing the maximum penalty for conduct formally charged as an offence against s 61D(1) of the Crimes Act from 8 years to 14 years and conduct previously charged as an offence against s 61D(1B) of the Crimes Act from 10 years to 20 years.  The sentencing judge did not refer to any cases on the Schedule but did note that the sentence he would impose would be ""somewhat less"" than if he was sentenced under current sentencing practices.  He did indicate that he would endeavour to sentence the applicant referable to the sentencing practices at the time of the offending in accordance with R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368; 130 A Crim R 481 and that was likely to result in a lower aggregate sentence than would be the case were sentences for similar offending imposed under the prevailing sentencing standards.  The second ground of appeal questions whether that approach was followed.
30His Honour also noted that the each woman was assaulted where she was vulnerable to attack, either being at home alone (in the case of MS) or walking home alone (in the case of LG and AS) and that they were each demeaned and traumatised by the assaults.  He also noted that the offences involved threatening language, threats of violence and the infliction of actual violence in addition to the violence inherent in the sexual assaults.  These findings were unchallenged.  With regards to the robbery and steal from person offences (counts 2, 4 and 6), his Honour considered that they also constituted serious offending, attracting the imposition of ""heavy sentences"" relative to sentences imposed for offending of that kind in 1989/1990.  The findings as to objective seriousness were not the subject of challenge.  
31The first ground of appeal challenged what was said to be his Honour's apparent disregard for the applicant's youth at the time of the offending as a factor operating in mitigation of sentence.  
32His Honour acknowledged the report of Mr Champion and what it revealed about the application of the principles enunciated in Fernando v R (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 which he was satisfied operated in the applicant's favour in mitigation of sentence.  His Honour also took into account what he described as the applicant's low intelligence which he accepted lessened his moral culpability to some extent.  On the appeal it was submitted that the combined influence of these factors and the applicant's youth ought to have resulted in indicative sentences significantly lower than those specified by the sentencing judge which has translated into an excessive aggregate sentence. 
33His Honour noted what he described as the applicant's extensive criminal history which commenced in June 1989 when he was dealt with in the Children's Court for a catalogue of property offences, including break, enter and steal, with offending of a similar kind continuing in 1992 and 1995.  In 1999 he was convicted in the District Court for one offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm of a police officer.  That was the first conviction for an offence of violence (the applicant being at that time 26 years of age).  No further offence of violence was committed until 2008 when he was convicted of common assault and sentenced to imprisonment for 6 months.  He was convicted of a further offence of common assault and occasioning actual bodily harm in 2010 which also attracted a prison term which he was serving at the time he was charged with the offending the subject of counts 3 and 4.   
34Importantly for present purposes, there were no offences involving the infliction of sexual violence after the offending the subject of the sentence appeal.  Although his Honour described the applicant's offending in 2008 and 2009 as ""domestic"", including stalking and intimidation and a breach of an apprehended violence order, he observed that those offences, while not trivial, did not approach the gravity of the offences for which the applicant was being sentenced.  Although his Honour found that the offences committed in the six months between July 1989 and January 1990 were uncharacteristic of the applicant's criminal offending as an adult, nonetheless his criminal history deprived him of the benefit of being sentenced as a person of prior good character.  That finding is also not challenged.  The approach is, in principle, consistent with authority: MPB v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 at [32]-[33]. 
Did his Honour err by announcing indicative sentences prior to the application of the discount for the plea of guilty?
35In imposing an aggregate sentence, his Honour was obliged to comply with s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  That section is in the following terms:
""53A Aggregate sentences of imprisonment
(1) A court may, in sentencing an offender for more than one offence, impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to all or any 2 or more of those offences instead of imposing a separate sentence of imprisonment for each.
(2) A court that imposes an aggregate sentence of imprisonment under this section on an offender must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, the following:(a) the fact that an aggregate sentence is being imposed,(b) the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence (after taking into account such matters as are relevant under Part 3 or any other provision of this Act) had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence.
(3) ...
(4) ...
(5) An aggregate sentence of imprisonment is not invalidated by a failure to comply with this section.""[Emphasis added.]
36Significantly for present purposes, s 53A(2)(b) requires indicative sentences to be specified after relevant matters under Part 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act have been taken into account.  Part 3 includes s 22, which is in the following terms:
""22 Guilty plea to be taken into account
(1) In passing sentence for an offence on an offender who has pleaded guilty to the offence, a court must take into account:
(a) the fact that the offender has pleaded guilty, and
(b) when the offender pleaded guilty or indicated an intention to plead guilty, and
(c) the circumstances in which the offender indicated an intention to plead guilty,
and may accordingly impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise have imposed.
(1A) A lesser penalty imposed under this section must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.
(2) When passing sentence on such an offender, a court that does not impose a lesser penalty under this section must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, its reasons for not doing so.
(3) Subsection (2) does not limit any other requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.
(4) The failure of a court to comply with this section does not invalidate any sentence imposed by the court.""
37His Honour indicated that although the pleas of guilty were not entered at the earliest opportunity, he would allow a discount of 20 per cent.  He then made the following observations: 
""Save for the fact that I am sentencing in the aggregate under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the sentences which I would have imposed individually for the counts on the indictment would have been as follows: 
For the sexual assault offence, count 1, and taking into account the matter on the Form 1, six years imprisonment; count 3, five years imprisonment; count 5, six years imprisonment; count 7, six years imprisonment. As for the robberies; count 2, I would have imposed four years imprisonment; for count 4 I would have imposed four years imprisonment; for count 6 (the steal from person offence), I would have imposed three years imprisonment. 
Those sentences are hypothetical. There is a principle familiar to those practicing in the criminal courts that, where there is a multiplicity of charges, it may turn out to be an inappropriate result if you simply add together all the possible penalties. There are cases where you could end up with hundreds of years. Such outcomes are not appropriate and one must look at the totality. Nonetheless, even allowing a discount of twenty per cent, which I do, the offender is sentenced as follows:
Sentenced to imprisonment for fourteen years, to date from 11 September 2010, that sentence to expire on 10 September 2024. I set a non-parole period of ten years, to date from the commencement of the sentence and to expire on 10 September 2020.""[Emphasis added.]
38The applicant submitted that the requirement to discount the indicative sentence for the pleas of guilty is not a mere legislative formality.  It is the indicated sentence that informs the principle of totality, a consideration which has continued application in the imposition of an aggregate sentence.
39In R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 219 at [56] RA Hulme J discussed the importance of compliance with s 52A(2)(b) and at [58] stated:
""The importance of proper compliance with the requirement to indicate the separate sentences that would have been imposed arises for at least four reasons. First, it assists a sentencing judge in application of the totality principle, an important factor in the assessment of the aggregate sentence to be imposed. Secondly, it exposes for appellate review how it is that the aggregate sentence was arrived at: see R v Brown at [17] per Grove AJ. Thirdly, it allows victims of crime and the public at large to understand the level of seriousness with which a court has regarded an individual offence. Fourthly, it assists this Court to assess an appropriate new aggregate sentence if one or some of the underlying convictions are quashed on appeal.""
40Whilst the announcement of an indicative sentence is not itself amenable to appeal on grounds of manifest excess or severity (see Truong v R; R v Le; Nguyen v R; R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 36 at [227]), s 53A does not relieve the sentencing judge of the obligation to assess the criminality for the separate offending inherent in the individual counts.  It follows that if there is patent error in the appointment of an indicative sentence that may reveal error in the aggregate sentence ultimately imposed (see R v Brown [2012] NSWCCA 199 at [17]).  Subject to the situation where error in the specification of an indicative sentence is patent (for example where it exceeds the maximum sentence or where the sentence approximates a worst case where the facts do not support that finding), a challenge to the sentence does not involve scrutinising the indicative sentences for error, but whether the aggregate sentence is sustainable.  In PD v R [2012] NSWCCA 242, Beech-Jones J observed at [44] (with Basten JA and Hall J agreeing), that for this Court to intervene the applicant must demonstrate that any error in the specification of an indicative sentence (which would necessarily include breach of the obligation to indicate individual sentences in compliance with s 53A(2)(b)) is material to the outcome.  
41Even if it is open to find that his Honour did not discount the indicative sentences by 20 per cent (a conclusion which I find irresistible in light of his Honour's sentencing remarks extracted above) the Crown submitted that it is clear that his Honour applied a discount of 20 per cent for the pleas of guilty before the aggregate sentence was imposed which, in effect, neutralised the error.  The Crown further submitted that the aggregate sentence is not rendered invalid merely by the failure to apply the discount to the indicative sentences (the language of s 53A(5)).  Neither is another sentence warranted in law under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act given that a significant degree of accumulation between the indicative sentences was called for to reflect the totality of the offending and the aggregate sentence imposed in this case reflects that finding.
42In Brown, Grove AJ (at [35]) noted that in the exercise of the power under s 53A the process of accumulation is notional.  Nonetheless, the extent of the need for accumulation can inform the question of whether the aggregate sentence is the product of a sound sentencing exercise.  The sentencing reasons in this case do not expose his Honour's rationale in partially accumulating the indicative sentences, however, given the repetition of serious offending over a six-month period, I accept that a lengthy aggregate sentence was inevitable.  The applicant's counsel did not submit otherwise.  The real question is whether the aggregate sentence is excessive in the sense that it is unreasonable or plainly unjust.  
43While I am persuaded his Honour did treat the pleas of guilty contrary to the way mandated by s 53(2)(b), I am not persuaded that the aggregate sentence was necessarily infected by that error such as to compel the positive finding that another sentence is warranted in law.  What remains to be considered is whether the sentencing exercise miscarried on other grounds.
Ground 1: His Honour failed to take into account the applicant's youth and immaturity.
44The applicant's counsel submitted that, even assuming that the discounts for the pleas of guilty were taken into account in accordance with s 53(2)(b), the length of the indicative sentences relative to the applicable maximum penalties compels the conclusion that his Honour did not give sufficient weight to the applicant's youth at the time of the offending which has translated into an excessive aggregate sentence. 
45Counsel submitted that the evidence led on sentence compelled a finding that the combined effect of the applicant's youth and his emotional and psychological immaturity at the time of the offence contributed significantly to his offending.  This, it was submitted, not only reduced the need for the aggregate sentence to reflect general deterrence, but it should also have attracted a finding that the gravity of the overall offending was ameliorated in contrast with the way the offending would be viewed were the offences committed by an adult (see KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51; 182 A Crim R 571, per McClellan CJ at CL at [23]).  
46In KT v R at [22], McClellan CJ at CL also emphasised that rehabilitation is an important factor when sentencing a juvenile offender.  This is said to be in recognition of the capacity for a young person to reform and better conform to society's norms.  Self-evidently, given the passage of time between the applicant's offending and sentence, and the further offending for which he had been charged and sentenced in the interim, the importance of imposing a sentence that took this applicant's prospects for rehabilitation into account did not carry particular weight in the sentencing exercise.  For the same reason, personal deterrence was also said to be less significant than would be the case were the applicant to have been sentenced closer to the time of the offending.  That said, although the applicant had not achieved rehabilitation in the conventional sense at that time of sentence, he had not committed any offences of a violent sexual nature since 1990 nor any offences where weapons were involved.  This was said to add further weight to the submission that the applicant's biological age and his immaturity, and what Mr Champion identified as the applicant's tendency to impulsivity, contributed to the degree of violence inherent in the offending for which he stood to be sentenced.  
47The Crown acknowledged that the applicant's youth at the time of the offending was a factor to be taken into account on sentence but submitted that it was entitled to little weight given that the overall offending, in particular the repeated sexual assaults, was indistinguishable from offences committed by an adult (see the discussion in KT v R per McClellan CJ at CL at [24]-[25] and in the authorities referred to in the judgment of Hall J at [103]-[104]).  The Crown submitted that in this case the gravity of the sexual violence inflicted on each of the three women, including in each case the application of force and threats of harm coupled with the fact that there was some degree of planning involved in the commission of the offences, reinstated the need for general deterrence and retribution to feature predominantly in the sentences indicated and the aggregate sentence imposed, as distinct from those principles being subordinated by the applicant's youth.  
48I accept that submission.  The weight to be afforded to the applicant's youth was one of the factors to be taken into account in a sentencing exercise which, as his Honour noted, required him to balance out competing considerations in the interests of achieving a just result.  The fact that he did not express any concluded view as to the part which the applicant's youth played in the repeated course of offending or in the commission of any of the individual offences, or refer to any of the authorities where youth is considered as a mitigating factor, does not persuade me that he failed to take the applicant's youth into account or to give it appropriate weight.  His Honour's observation that each offence involved threats or the application of force, ""as it almost inevitably does in sexual assault cases involving adults"", would tend to suggest that he regarded the applicant's repeated sexual offending as committed in the way an adult offender might behave, a finding which I consider open to him. 
49I would dismiss the first ground of appeal.
Ground 2: The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive.  
50In support of this ground, one of the submissions advanced was that by the combined operation of ss 3 and 17 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW) all of the offences were capable of being dealt with in the Children's Court as none were serious children's indictable offences (as defined).  The maximum applicable penalty at the relevant time were the matters dealt with in the Children's Court was an order committing the offender to the care of the relevant Minister for a period of two years.  Section 28 of the Act displaces the jurisdiction of the Children's Court where a juvenile is over 21 at the time of charge.  As noted, the applicant was aged 37 when he was charged with counts 3-7 and aged 38 when charged with counts 1 and 2.  While it was open to the applicant to ask what might have happened had he been arrested and dealt with expeditiously after the offending, the answer is that he would not have been dealt with by the Children's Court but according to law, pursuant to s 18(1)(a): BT v R [2012] NSWCCA 276 at [15]-[23].  
51As noted above, the sentencing judge accepted that he was obliged to sentence the applicant relative to the sentencing standards that applied at the time of the applicant's offending, and that the schedule of cases for offences committed contrary to s 61D(1) and s 61D(1B) between 1985 and 1996 provided by the applicant's solicitor (with which the Crown agreed) were a helpful guide.  A schedule of what I consider the most closely comparable cases extracted from the schedule is annexed to this judgment.  The applicant submitted, however, that the indicative sentences far exceeded any of the cases of comparative seriousness on the schedule and an excessive aggregate sentence has resulted.  Counsel submitted that conclusion necessarily follows if the indicative sentences were not discounted by pleas of guilty as required by s 53A(2)(b), where against a maximum penalty of 8 years for counts 1 and 3 sentences of 7 years and 6 months and 6 years and 3 months were indicated, and, against a maximum penalty of 10 years for counts 5 and 7 sentences of 7 years and 6 months were indicated. 
52Counsel argued that even assuming the aggregate sentence was discounted for the pleas of guilty, an aggregate sentence of 14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years was manifestly excessive when compared with sentencing patterns of 20 years ago, in particular given the combined impact of the mitigating features present in the applicant's case, including his youth and immaturity, his deprived and dysfunctional upbringing and his compromised intellectual capacity.  
53The Crown submitted that the aggregate sentence imposed upon the applicant was not excessive considering the violence and threats of violence inflicted on three women in separate incidents.  The Crown submitted that the aggregate sentence, although severe, aligned with the findings of the sentencing judge that each of the offences were towards the higher range of penalties that would have been imposed for offending between 1989 and 1990.  
54For my part, having regard to the applicable sentencing standards at the time of the offending as reflected in the summary of cases attached (the utility of which is moderated to some extent by the fact that the extent of redirection for the pleas of guilty cannot be readily identified and where most cases relate to sentences imposed after trial), and after taking into account the applicant's youth and subjective circumstances, the applicant's offending should not have attracted the severity of sentences indicated or the aggregate sentence imposed.  In the result, I am satisfied that the aggregate sentence was excessive and that the applicant should be re-sentenced.  
55After giving full weight to the objective seriousness of the offending, and after taking into account the applicant's subjective circumstances and other factors relied upon in mitigation of penalty in the context of the sentencing standards that applied between July 1989 and January 2000, I would specify indicative sentences in accordance with following schedule:   
OffenceMaximum penalty as at the date of the offending Indicative sentence after applying a 20% discount for plea of guiltyCt 1: s 61D(1) + Form 1. 8 years 3 years  Ct 2: s 97 20 years 2 yearsCt 3: s 61D(1) 8 years 4 years Ct 4: s 97 20 years 2 years Ct 5: s 61D(1B) 10 years 4 years 6 monthsCt 6: s 94 14 years 2 years Ct 7: s 61D(1B) 10 years 4 years 6 months
56The variations from the sentences indicated by the sentencing judge in the Schedule above reflect both the need to comply with s 53A(2)(b) and my best attempts to retrieve applicable sentencing practices at the time of offending.  Although count 1 necessitates taking the offending on the Form 1 into account, the sentence imposed would have been subject to the Probation and Parole Act, a factor relevant to the time likely to be served, though not relevant in fixing the sentence: Rosenstrauss v R [2012] NSWCCA 25 at [12]-[16]; MPB at [19].  The vast majority of the cases to which the sentencing judge and this Court were referred indicate terms of imprisonment which tended to increase after the Sentencing Act passed into law.  I have reduced the adjusted indicative sentence for count 1 set out in [9] above for that reason.  
57The indicative sentences I propose for counts 5 and 7 have also been reduced from the adjusted indicative sentence in the Schedule at [9] for the reasons already given.  They are, however, more serious than counts 1 and 3 being committed in company, as reflected by the higher maximum penalty, and attract a higher indicated sentence than counts 1 and 3 for that reason.  
58I am conscious of having made a significant reduction in the indicative sentences for counts 2 and 4, both counts of armed robbery.  Although we were not provided with any comparative cases for armed robbery, I consider that the armed robberies committed by the appellant against two of the three women, were they stand alone offences, would not have attracted the length of sentence as indicated by the sentencing judge.  The armed robbery offences were not the subject of any submission from the Crown or the applicant's counsel on the appeal, that offending being subordinate to the serial sexual assaults.
59After applying the principle of totality and after a finding of special circumstances, with what I regard as appropriate weight being given to the risk that the applicant will suffer the effects of institutionalisation and the need for him to be supervised for an extended period on parole, I would impose an aggregate sentence of 12 years to date from 11 September 2010 and to expire on 10 September 2022.  I would set a non-parole period of 8 years to date from the commencement of the sentence and to expire on 10 September 2018.
60The orders I propose are as follows:
1. Leave to appeal granted. 2. Appeal allowed. 3. Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court. 4. In lieu, sentence the applicant to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 12 years, to date from 11 September 2010, comprising a non-parole period of 8 years and balance of term of 4 years.  The earliest day on which the applicant will become eligible to be released on parole is 10 September 2018. 
61DAVIES J:  Based on the present approach to sentencing, the aggregate sentence which the sentencing judge imposed was entirely appropriate.  Further, making the necessary adjustments to the indicative sentences by reason of s 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), those indicative sentences would, for offences now committed, be entirely appropriate.  
62As the Sentencing Judge rightly observed, the objective seriousness of the offences was significant and he correctly characterised them as being towards the higher range of penalties that ought to be imposed for those offences.  In my opinion, and even taking into account the Applicant's subjective circumstances as Fullerton J details, the circumstances of each of the rapes called for significant punishment.
63However, the Sentencing Judge was bound by R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; (2002) 54 NSWLR 368 to sentence the Applicant in accordance with sentencing practice at the time the offences were committed, that is in 1989 and 1990.  It is apparent that his Honour endeavoured to carry out that task, but the difficulty is highlighted by what Spigelman CJ said in R v PLV [2001] NSWCCA 282; (2001) 51 NSWLR 736 at [94].  The Chief Justice there made reference to the difficulty in determining what would have been done at a time 20 years or more earlier.  Of course, it was made clear in MJR that, notwithstanding the difficulty, that was the course that must be followed for the reasons given in the various judgments in MJR.  
64I am persuaded by the close analysis carried out by Fullerton J of the cases referred to in the schedule to her Honour's reasons that the aggregate sentence imposed by his Honour and the indicative sentences that he identified were manifestly excessive having regard to the date of the commission of the offences.  This is no criticism of his Honour who had a difficult task to perform.  A schedule of cases was provided by counsel then acting for the Applicant but, it seems, his Honour was given little assistance as to how those cases might inform his Honour of sentencing practices at the time.  
65Accordingly, I agree with the reasons of Fullerton J and the orders that her Honour proposes.  

SCHEDULE OF COMPARATIVE CASES
R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12The appellant was convicted after trial for six counts of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61D and one count of forcible abduction of a woman contrary to s 89.  The appellant, who was the victim's employer, drove the victim to a location, and had sexual intercourse with her and struck her to the face.  The next evening the appellant arrived at her home.  She attempted to leave but he grabbed her by the hair, hit her a number of times to the face, kicked her in the chest and abducted her in his car where he forced her to perform fellatio, and twice had intercourse with her.  He returned to his home where he forced her and his girlfriend to perform oral sex on him and on each other.  There is no reference in the judgment to the offender's subjective circumstances.  The appellant was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment for each count, to be served concurrently, with a non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment. 
R v Tainsh (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 4 August 1988, unrep) The applicant pleaded guilty to eight counts, including six counts of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to 61D(1), and one count of break and enter and committing sexual intercourse without consent.  The appellant broke into the victim's bedroom and committed multiple sexual assaults including vaginal intercourse, digital anal intercourse, and multiple acts of forced fellatio.  The appellant was 24 years old.  The appellant's childhood was characterised by domestic conflict.  He had a criminal record including offences of violence.  The applicant demonstrated a ""marked degree"" of remorse and contrition.  For the offence of breaking and entering a dwelling house with intent, the appellant was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.  For five of the offences contrary to s 61D(1) the appellant was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment, to be served wholly concurrently.  For the sixth offence contrary to s 61D(1) the appellant was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment.  For an offence of stealing the appellant was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment.  The sentencing judge imposed an effective sentence of 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months.  The Court of Criminal Appeal found that the sentences did not exceed the legitimate bounds of the discretionary range and dismissed an appeal against sentence.  
R v Nikolovski; R v Alam (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 5 December 1990, unrep) The appellant was convicted after trial of three counts of threatening to inflict actual bodily harm by means of an offensive weapon with intent to have sexual intercourse (s 61C), three counts of sexual intercourse without consent (s 61D) and one count of common assault (s 61).  The victim, aged 16, and her companion accepted an offer to have coffee with the appellant and two other men in the appellant's apartment.  After the victim refused to have sexual intercourse with one of the men, the appellant returned to the room with a rifle and told the victim to remove her clothes.  The appellant and the two other men had sexual intercourse with the victim, after which the appellant pointed the rifle at the victim and said he was going to kill her.  The sentencing judge imposed concurrent sentences, with the effective sentence being 5 years 3 months, with a minimum non-parole period of 4 years.  Enderby J observed (Loveday and Hunt JJ agreeing) that the sentences were ""light"" but not outside the range available to the sentencing Judge.  An appeal against conviction and a crown appeal against sentence were both dismissed.
R v Williams (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 15 August 1991, unrep)The appellant was convicted of two counts of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61D(1).  The appellant threatened the victim that if she did not have sexual intercourse with him he would ""use a knife"".  The appellant left the lounge room and the victim heard cutlery rattling in the kitchen.  The appellant returned, put his fingers in the victim's vagina, and then performed cunnilingus.  The appellant demanded that the victim perform fellatio but she refused.  He stopped when he heard a car approaching next door.  The victim climbed out of her bedroom window and ran to her neighbour's house for assistance.  When the victim returned to the premises she found a knife wrapped in a tea towel in the lounge room.  The sentencing Judge found the offences to be ""extremely grave"".  The appellant, aged 33, did not express remorse, had a lengthy criminal history including offences of violence, and what his Honour described as an ""unhealthy attitude to females"".  The appellant was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment on both counts, to be served concurrently, with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months.  An appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
R v Palmer (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 4 September 1992, unrep) The appellant was convicted after trial of six counts of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61D(1), and one offence of indecent assault contrary to s 61E(I).  The appellant assaulted the victim some time around 3am in Kings Cross, including digital and penile penetration, cunnilingus and forced fellatio.  The victim twice tried to escape by running away but the appellant caught her and continued to assault her, at one point threatening to kill her if she did not comply.  The appellant had a criminal record but not for offences of violence or sexual violence.  He was on parole at the time of the offences.  For each of the six offences contrary to s 61D(1), the appellant was sentenced to 5 years and 8 months imprisonment, with an additional term of 2 years, to be served concurrently.  For the indecent assault offence the appellant was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment to be served concurrently.  His Honour observed that but for approximately 3½ months pre-sentence custody, he would have imposed minimum terms of 6 years.  The Court of Criminal Appeal found that the sentences were ""heavy"" and at the ""upper end"", but with regards to the totality of the criminality involved, not outside the discretionary range. 
R v Page (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 17 June 1993, unrep)The appeal was commenced after trial against conviction and sentence for five counts of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61D, and one count of indecent assault contrary to s 61E.  The appellant followed the victim before detaining her and dragging her to a nearby park where he committed the six offences.  The Court of Criminal Appeal described the offences as involving ""disgusting acts extending, according to the complainant, over a period of about an hour"".  The victim was in fear of her life.  The appellant continued to threaten the victim, before she managed to escape from the appellant.  The appellant had no relevant prior record and no record of sexual offending.  He had experienced abuse as a child at the hands of his father and stepfather, and was mildly brain damaged at the time of the offence.  The appellant was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment with an additional term of 16 months for each of the offences contrary to s 61D, and 6 months imprisonment for the offence contrary to s 61E, each sentence to be served concurrently.  On appeal against the severity of the sentence, Sully J (with Dunford J and Handley JA agreeing) found that the offences were ""outrageous breaches of the law"" and that the sentences imposed were entirely justified. The appeal against conviction was dismissed. 
R v Scerri (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 28 June 1994, unrep)The applicant was convicted of eight offences relating to three separate instances of sexual offending on three separate victims.  The applicant approached M and made a number of threats to injure him.  The applicant took M to a shed on a property and committed an act of fellatio on him (count 1 - s 61D).  The applicant continued to threaten M and his family, after which he had anal sexual intercourse with M (count 2 - s 61D).  The applicant told M to remain in the shed, which he did for some hours due to fear that the applicant would kill him or members of his family.  In a separate incident the applicant tackled L and hit him three or four times on the back of the head with a rock (count 4 - s 61C).  The applicant led L into a toilet block in a park and committed oral and anal sexual intercourse on him (counts 5 and 6 - s 61D).  The applicant then returned L's wallet to him, from which he had removed $20 (count 7 - steal from person, s 94).  Counts 8 and 9 relate to the victim C.  The applicant approached him and punched him in the nose several times, breaking his nose (count 8 - s 61B).  The applicant then had anal sexual intercourse with C (count 9 - s 61D). 
The applicant had a disadvantaged upbringing, being sexually abused as a child.  A pre-sentence report assessed the applicant as having behavioural problems in urgent need of clinical intervention.  The sentencing judge sentenced the applicant to 2 years imprisonment for counts 1, 2, 5 and 6 (contrary to s 61D); 4 years and 6 months imprisonment for the s 61C offence (count 4), 1 year imprisonment for the steal from person offence contrary to s 94 (count 7), 6 years and 6 months imprisonment for the s 61B offence (count 8), and 3 years imprisonment for the s 61D offence the subject of count 9.  His Honour partially accumulated the sentences resulting in a total effective sentence of 16 years comprised of a minimum term of 12 years, with an additional term of 4 years.  The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the appeal against sentence, Carruthers J observing (with Finlay and Badgery-Parker JJ agreeing) that the sentence imposed was ""heavy"", but well within a legitimate sentencing discretion being proportionate to the objective circumstances of the offending.

		03 June 2014",2014-06-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704984,R v Smith (No.3) [2014] NSWSC 771,"Judgment - Disputed Identification Evidence
1The Crown has sought leave in the re-examination of Mr Jason Stein to lead identification evidence.  Counsel for the accused opposes the introduction of the identification evidence on the basis that the evidence has little, if any, probative value, and there is significant unfair prejudice to the accused if the evidence is admitted.
2For the reasons which follow, I have decided to reject the evidence, and accordingly, dismiss the application of the Crown.
The Indictment
3The accused, Mr Graham Smith, has been indicted in the following terms:
""for that he, on 20 January 2013, at Claymore, in the State of New South Wales did murder Joshua George.""
The accused has pleaded not guilty.  
4In opening her case to the jury, counsel for the accused informed the jury that the principal issue which the jury would be required to determine, was whether, at the time he deliberately shot the deceased, Mr Joshua George, the accused was acting in self-defence.  
5To date, the accused's case has been conducted in a way which reflects this statement of the principal issue.  
6Accordingly, it is not in dispute in the course of the trial that the deceased was shot and killed by the accused.  Nor it is in issue that he did so with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm.  
Some Uncontroversial Facts
7The shooting occurred in Gidley Crescent, Claymore at about 1.30pm on 20 January 2013.  In the relevant area, houses that backed onto Gidley Crescent had their street address as Salvana Way.  
8The fatal shot was fired from a .22 calibre rifle, and only one shot was fired.  The bullet entered the deceased's body at a position slightly above the sternal notch, and continued on a path through the body damaging major organs and causing the death of the deceased in a very short space of time.  
9The accused left the scene and was not apprehended for about four days.  
10At the time of the shooting, the deceased had been seen walking along Gidley Crescent in the company of two people, Mr Grant Perkins and Ms Jamaine Ronayne.  It is the Crown's case that another male, Mr Jarryd Perkins, was also present at the scene of the shooting.  The accused's case is that he was confronted by both Mr Grant Perkins and Mr Jarryd Perkins, as well as Ms Ronayne and the deceased.  
11A few minutes before the shooting occurred, a witness, Mrs Hotz, saw a male walking along a pathway in front of her home, which is a short distance from Gidley Crescent.  The male figure she saw was carrying a rifle, wearing blue gloves, was dressed in green football shorts and a pale blue top, and was wearing a cap.  She described the figure as having a ponytail, or rat's tail, hairstyle.  The accused accepts, and his counsel has admitted to the jury, that the figure seen by Mrs Hotz was him.  
Context for the Identification Evidence
12The identification evidence which is intended to be led by the Crown, arises in the following context.
13Mr Stein has given evidence that, shortly prior to the shooting of the deceased, he drove along Gidley Crescent from Dobell Street towards Read Way.  As he did so, he drove past three people walking in single file along Gidley Crescent in the same direction as he was travelling.  It is accepted by the Crown and the accused that these people were the deceased, Mr Grant Perkins, and Ms Jamaine Ronayne.
14Shortly after passing these three people, Mr Stein observed a figure appear in front of his car, having emerged from a pathway on the right hand side of Gidley Crescent in the direction of his travel.  The pathway from which this figure emerged is the continuation of the pathway along which the accused was seen walking by Mrs Hotz.  If the accused was walking towards his home at 25 Salvana Way, which is his case, then he would have emerged onto Gidley Crescent where the figure seen by Mr Stein emerged.
15Mr Stein has given evidence that the figure was wearing a blue ""hoodie"" or hooded jumper, and was wearing jeans.  He saw that this figure was pulling down a pair of blue gloves on his hands.  He said that the figure was of a man of medium build.  
16In his evidence, Mr Stein did not give any description of any facial features of the figure, although he did say words to the effect that the person had a vacant look on his face.  The male passed quite close to his motor vehicle.  Mr Stein also said that the person appeared to be holding something underneath the jumper, under his left elbow. 
17Mr Stein said that when he saw this male, there was a distance of about 20-30 metres between the male and the group of people whom he had driven past, of which group the deceased was a member.  
18Having seen the male figure, Mr Stein then turned his motor vehicle into Read Way to drop his mother off at her home.  A short time later, within a matter of one or two minutes, he heard a rifle shot and then heard a female screaming very loudly.  He walked quickly to Gidley Crescent and saw the male in the blue hoodie jump the fence of a house located in Gidley Crescent opposite Read Way.  
19In his evidence in chief, Mr Stein was not asked to, and did not, make any identification of this male person.  In cross-examination, Mr Stein agreed that the male whom he saw, was not wearing clothes of the description which the accused had been seen wearing by Mrs Hotz in the minutes before the shooting occurred, in particular green football shorts and a pale blue T-shirt..  
20The accused was not apprehended at the scene nor on that day.  By the time he was apprehended, he had changed clothes.  There is no other evidence of any observation of a male wearing a dark blue hoodie and jeans at the scene in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.  
21It has become apparent in the course of the conduct of the trial, that it is the accused's case that the male in the blue hoodie seen by Mr Stein, is Mr Jarryd Perkins.  The Crown intends to submit to the jury that the male in the blue hoodie was the accused.  Thus, the identification of the male figure has assumed importance in the factual matrix which will be before the jury.  
The Evidence of Identification
22The Crown wishes to lead evidence that, in the course of the afternoon following the shooting, Mr Stein, whilst at work and using his computer, saw an article on MSN News which contained a report of the shooting, and also a photograph of the accused. The photograph had been circulated by the police as being of a person whom the police were seeking with respect to the shooting.
23It is anticipated by the Crown that Mr Stein will say that when he saw that photograph of the accused on the internet, he had some or all of these reactions:
""... it brought tears to my eyes ...""
""... I pretty much shit myself when ... shit, that's the guy...""
""... when I saw it I thought, I couldn't believe how well I'd described him to the detectives last night ...""
""... it was the hair ... the stockiness of the guy ... his build ...""
""... the eyes and the hair did it every time.  It was sticking out ... like a Herman Munster, sort of haircut ...""
""... once I saw that photo on MSN, I literally nearly had tears in my eyes, that's how close I described him last night.""
24In his statement, from which this identification evidence would be drawn, Mr Stein went on to say that he was attracted by the blue gloves (a feature not shown in the photograph), and that he did not notice whether the person had a goatee beard, or any facial hear, nor did he notice whether the person had any tattoos on his neck.
25The photograph shows the accused from the neck up, as a man with facial hair and a ""Ned Kelly"" style tattoo on his neck.  Other than by reference to his face, the photograph does not show the nature of the accused's build, in particular whether he is ""stocky"".  
26This evidence, if admitted, would be the only positive evidence of the identity of the man in the blue hoodie and jeans.  
Legal Principles
27Identification evidence of the kind and nature which is intended to be led, is notorious for the problems and difficulties which can arise.  Such identification evidence can be unreliable.  Caution is always to be exercised in admitting this evidence, and once admitted, juries must be given directions about using the evidence unhesitatingly: see s 116 of the Evidence Act 1995.  
28When a person sees, or is shown, a single photograph rather than a photo array from which one photograph is chosen, it is obvious that an identification arising from that single photograph may be unreliable.  As well, where the photograph is associated with the description that the person is wanted by the police, albeit for the provision of assistance, those difficulties are magnified.
29As Gibbs CJ said in Alexander v The Queen [1981] HCA 17; (1981) 145 CLR 395 at 400, in relation to a single photograph identification process:
""... it would be unfair and improper to show to a witness, ... a single photograph of a person who is said to be the suspect, and it would be unsafe to act on evidence of identification given in those circumstances.""
30Attention must also be paid to the judgment of Stephen J in Alexander at 409, where his Honour describes the phenomenon known as the ""displacement effect"" which is relevant here.  In R v Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 37 at [80], the Court described the displacement effect in the following terms:
""The displacement effect refers to the risk that a witness who has seen a photograph of someone may unconsciously have his or her memory reinforced by the photograph as distinct from his or her earlier observation of the person in the flesh; and that that displaced memory may be the basis of a later in-court or other identification made in the presence of the accused person.""
31It is the existence of this effect upon which the accused relies here, even though Mr Stein may not accept its existence.  
Discernment
32In this case, because Mr Stein had seen a single photograph which identified a person, shortly after the shooting, whom the police were seeking to interview, there is a real risk that Mr Stein has, entirely unconsciously, substituted that image in the photograph for the image in his mind of the face of the person whom he saw in the blue hoodie.  After all, he did not see anyone else who could have been the shooter, and Mr Stein also saw the person leaping the fence at the scene.  
33Accordingly, it is easy to see that, quite unintentionally, Mr Stein may have associated the male in the blue hoodie as being the shooter, and that he has then associated the photograph circulated by the police as being that person.  
34Because the association caused by the displacement effect is unintentional, it cannot be expected that Mr Stein, if cross-examined about it, would necessarily understand what has occurred.  Accordingly, any cross-examination of Mr Stein by counsel for the accused is more likely than not to result in an affirmation of the evidence of identification, rather than anything else.  
35As well, there are some other matters to be noted.  They are these:
(i)The article and photograph displayed on the internet are not available to the parties.  Although, it can be demonstrated in evidence what photograph, on the balance of probabilities, was likely to be the one seen by Mr Stein.
(ii)The identification evidence arises in the course of reexamination, after Mr Stein has given a clear description of clothes which the figure was wearing, which description is wholly inconsistent with the clothes which the accused was seen wearing shortly prior to the shooting.
(iii)Whether this figure seen by Mr Stein was, or was not, the accused, does not directly impact upon the Crown case, which is that at the time the fatal shot was fired, the accused was standing behind the paling fence of No. 25 Salvana Way, looking out onto Gidley Crescent.  In other words, it is not the Crown case that this figure, even if it was the accused, fired the fatal shot whilst standing on Gidley Crescent where Mr Stein saw him.  
36The highest that the probative value can be put for the Crown is that the accused, prior to firing the fatal shot, has changed his clothes, perhaps in order to conceal his appearance.  However, since the accused admits firing the fatal shot, but asserts that he did so in self-defence, the fact that he may or may not have changed his clothes seems to me to be of little, if any, probative value.  
37The identification of the male figure is a piece of evidence of relevance.  Accordingly, assuming that it was an appropriate piece of evidence, and in admissible form, the Crown would be entitled to lead it.
38However, having regard to the nature of the evidence, its relatively low probative value, and the very high risk of unfair prejudice to the accused, in light of the matters which I have discussed above, I have not been persuaded that I should exercise my discretion to permit the Crown to lead it.  
39On the contrary, I am persuaded that by the application of s 137 of the Evidence Act, I must reject the evidence because the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused from the admission of such evidence, far outweighs any probative value which the evidence may have for the prosecution case.  It follows that leave to adduce the evidence must be refused because the evidence is inadmissible.
Order
40I make the following order:
(1)Leave to further re-examine Mr Stein with respect to his identification of the figure on Gidley Crescent is refused.

		22 July 2014",2014-06-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704986,Application by Simon Monteiro pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 710,"Judgment1Simon Monteiro (""the applicant"") makes application pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (""the Act"") for an inquiry into the sentences imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Norrish QC in the District Court of New South Wales in respect of offences contrary to sections 61J, 195(1)(a) and 117 of the Crimes Act 1900.    
2The applicant was found guilty by a jury of the offence contrary to s. 61J.  He had earlier pleaded guilty to the other charges.
3The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s. 61J is 20 years imprisonment.  The offence carries a standard non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment.  
4Judge Norrish QC sentenced the applicant as follows:
(i)in respect of the charge contrary to s. 61J, imprisonment for 11 years with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months;
(ii)in respect of the charge contrary to s. 195(1)(a), a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years and 8 months;
(iii)in respect of the charge contrary to s. 117, a fixed term of 1 year and 9 months.
5The overall term of imprisonment which was imposed was one of 12 years and 3 months, with a non-parole period of 7 years and 9 months.
6The applicant has submitted that the matter should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal as an appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  He has argued that there is a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance, namely that the sentence imposed upon him was infected by error in light of the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.
7The principles which apply to an application such as this is are set out in full in The Application of Victor Makarov pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2013] NSWSC 1468 at [5]-[6].
THE APPLICANT'S SENTENCE8The sentencing judge delivered lengthy sentencing remarks in which he canvassed all of the relevant factors.  He noted (at ROS 32) that most of the submissions ""centred on the issue of the standard non-parole period for the aggravated sexual assault offence"".  He concluded (at ROS 40):
""...that the conduct here does reach to the cusp of the mid range of the (sic) seriousness but I am not prepared to conclude that it does fall within the mid range. But it is very close.
Noting the factors to be taken into account under s. 21A to which I will return in a moment, I am required, as the Court of Criminal Appeal says, to note of course that the standard non-parole period can still take its place as a reference point, a benchmark, a sounding board, a guidepost along with other assistance from statistics, judgments of other courts and the like. It can have direct relevance as a reference point to be compared with a sentence which is provisionally reached after an assessment has been made of the relative seriousness of the subject offence and of the various aggravating and mitigating factors as well as any other subjective factor that may be present. The reference point has an important role to play in ensuring consistency in sentencing.""
9Immediately prior to those observations his Honour had made reference to, and quoted passages from, the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168.  
10The applicant appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal against both his conviction and sentence.  The Crown also appealed against what was said to be the manifest inadequacy of the sentence (see Monteiro v R; R v Monteiro [2011] NSWCCA 113).  Simpson J (with whom Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) and Price J agreed) dismissed both the applicant's appeal against his conviction and the Crown appeal.  In respect of the applicant's appeal against his sentence, leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was dismissed.  Simpson J (at [240]) said the following:
""As I understand it, the Crown bases its appeal substantially upon the degree to which the non-parole period imposed (6 years and 6 months) departs from the standard non-parole period (10 years). This is a case in which, because the appellant was convicted after trial, Pt 4 Div 1A directly applies: see R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168. The standard non-parole period is to be imposed unless the sentencing judge finds that there is a basis for departure"" (my emphasis).  
SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES11It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the standard non-parole period applicable to the offence contrary to s61J was a dominant factor, both before the sentencing judge and before the Court of Criminal Appeal.  It was further submitted that error was apparent in both proceedings, constituted by the fact that primary significance was given to the standard non-parole period.  
12In terms of the approach of the sentencing judge, it was submitted that notwithstanding his Honour's references to the standard non-parole period having been used as benchmark, it was apparent from a reading of the whole of the sentencing remarks that he had adopted a two-stage approach to sentencing, which was erroneous in light of the decision of the High Court in Muldrock.  It was further submitted that the same approach had been adopted by Simpson J in the passage set out in [10] above.  
13It was submitted on behalf of the Attorney-General that a doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstance could not arise by reference to any Muldrock-type error.  However, as Johnson J pointed out in  The Application of Joy Lorraine Knight pursuant to s. 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act [2014] NSWSC 285 at [17], such a submission cannot be sustained in light of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Sinkovich v Attorney-General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383.  
14It was further submitted on behalf of the Attorney-General that the sentencing judge had assessed all relevant factors and had specifically stated that he had regard to the standard non-parole period as (inter alia) a benchmark.  It was submitted that in these circumstances no error had arisen.  Particular reliance was placed in this regard upon the observations of Davies J (with whom Whealy JA and Rothman J agreed) in Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 at [26] and following.  It was further submitted that the sentencing judge had not treated the standard non-parole period in any way which might be regarded as mandatory.
15However, counsel for the Attorney-General took a different position in respect of the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Counsel accepted that it was apparent that ""the CCA judgment was infected by Muldrock error"" and that in the circumstances ""it would be open to this Court to consider that there is a 'sense of disquiet' concerning the sentence imposed"".  It was further accepted that in the event that error were found, there was no discretionary basis upon which to refuse to consider the application.  Counsel's submissions concluded by expressly accepting that there was sufficient evidence of Muldrock error to justify the application being granted.  
CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSION16In Muldrock (supra) the High Court concluded (at [25]) that it was an error to categorise s. 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as being framed in mandatory terms which required a court to use the standard non-parole period as the starting point for determining whether an offence was appropriately assessed as being in the middle of the range.  The Court further concluded (at [26]) that it was a mistake to give primary, let alone determinative, significance to the standard non-parole period, and that the correct approach in sentencing for an offence for which a standard non-parole period was prescribed was to identify all relevant factors (including any prescribed standard non-parole period) and make a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence.
17Further, (at [28]) the Court rejected the adoption of a two-stage approach to sentencing, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, followed by an inquiry as to whether there were matters justifying the imposition of a non-parole period which was longer or shorter than that prescribed.
18In arriving at these various conclusions, the High Court held that Way (supra) had been wrongly decided.
19In my view, no error arises from the remarks of the sentencing judge in the present case.  A reading of those remarks as a whole makes it plain that his Honour had regard to all relevant factors, and used the applicable standard non-parole period as a guide or yardstick.  Such an approach is perfectly permissible and entirely consistent with the decision in Muldrock (see Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [43] per Johnson J).
20However, as counsel for the Attorney-General expressly accepted, there was error in the approach taken by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  As previously noted, Simpson J expressly stated that the standard non-parole period was to be imposed unless a conclusion were reached that there was some basis upon which to depart from it.  In making that observation her Honour was, of course, dealing with the matter in accordance with the decision in Way.  The High Court concluded in Muldrock that Way was wrongly decided.  In particular, the High Court concluded that it is erroneous, in a case to which a standard non-parole period applies, to ask (as her Honour did) whether or not there are circumstances which warrant a departure from it.  In my view, it is clear that the standard non-parole period was used in a determinative way which, in light of the decision in Muldrock is no longer permissible.
ORDERS21For these reasons I am satisfied that error has been made out, and that such error gives rise to a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance, the existence of which warrants a referral of the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
22I therefore make the following orders:
(i)The application is granted.
(ii)The matter is referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

2704989,R v Bennett [2014] NSWDC 61,"Judgment

Summary of the facts.

Introduction

1The accused is charged with an offence of sexual intercourse without consent allegedly committed upon the complainant on the 11th of April 2011. He was arraigned on that charge and pleaded that he was not guilty. He elected that he be tried by judge alone. The Crown consented and so the issue as to whether the accused is guilty or not is for me to decide. In this judgment ,I will deliver my verdict and the reasons for it.

2In what follows I will not use the name of the complainant. Instead I will describe her in those terms. I fully appreciate that describing a human being who has made an allegation of sexual assault as ""the complainant"" is impersonal and could easily offend. I wish to make it clear that I have referred to the complainant in that manner to protect her privacy. This judgment will be published on the internet and I have no wish to cause any further distress to the complainant beyond that she has already experienced.

Summary of evidence

3In 2010, the complainant was estranged from her husband. She had established a sexual relationship with the accused. He had booked a holiday to go to Vietnam in March 2011. In the period leading up to his departure he and the complainant discussed a particular issue of considerable concern to the latter, namely the nature of their relationship. 

4The complainant desired that their relationship was such that neither party would feel free to have sexual contact with anyone else, but the accused's desire was to the contrary. And so in the days before the accused's departure the question arose as to whether the accused would have sex with anyone else whilst in Vietnam.

5Fortunately for me in deciding the guilt or otherwise of the accused, the complainant was a prolific sender of text messages, to some of which the accused would respond. Thus there is a record of significant parts of the discussions between the complainant and the accused on the topic of his fidelity. It is undeniable that the complainant had a fervent desire that the accused would remain faithful to her whilst he was in Vietnam, but was deeply suspicious as to whether that was likely to be the case. 

6The accused and the complainant travelled down to Sydney from the Central Coast where they lived in separate houses on the night before the accused departed for Vietnam. They stayed in a hotel near the airport. Once the accused left Australia his mobile telephone was incapable of receiving voice calls or messages. Thus whilst the complainant tried to call him, and sent an extraordinary number of text messages to him whilst he was in Vietnam, he received none of them whilst he was there. 

7On the day of his return to Australia the complainant travelled down to Sydney in the company of her friend Annette Seaburn. The complainant did not drive and so she asked Ms Seaburn whether she would drive to Sydney with the complainant in order to collect the accused from Sydney International Airport. The accused did not expect to see the complainant at the airport and was surprised upon his exit from customs to find her waiting there for him together with Ms Seaburn. The three of them went to have a coffee. One of the questions uppermost in the complainant's mind was whether the accused had been faithful to her whilst he was away. She asked him about this and although the accused said he had been faithful, the complainant clearly did not believe him. At one stage the accused separated from the complainant and Ms Seaburn, heading towards the railway station to get a train back home. The accused said it was his decision to do so because he was sick of being questioned about whether or not he had been faithful whilst away, the complainant said it was her decision to effectively abandon him at the airport because she formed the view that he had been unfaithful to her, but it probably doesn't matter much which version is accurate. The important point is that the complainant was deeply concerned about the accused's faithfulness and did not believe his denials.

8In any case there was a change of heart and the complainant and Ms Seaburn eventually reunited with the accused and the three of them drove north. They went to Wyong where the accused's car was parked. He and the complainant got into his car, drove to his home, then went to a club where they had drinks (the complainant does not drink alcohol) and dinner and then returned to the accused's home. It is common ground that whilst at his home an act of sexual intercourse took place. The accused says it was consensual but the complainant's evidence is that after saying ""no"" the accused forced her to perform fellatio on him.

9It is also common ground that shortly after the intercourse occurred the complainant called for a taxi. It came, and she went home. Thereafter the complainant sent a number of text messages to the accused and he sent some to her. In one of those text messages the complainant alleged that the accused had forced her to perform oral intercourse upon him. The accused did not reply to this allegation. The complainant made a further allegation by way of text message the following day. This time the accused did respond by way of text message, denying that the intercourse was non consensual. 

10In another message the accused effectively ended the relationship and told the complainant that she was better off without him because he had only lasted a week on holidays before having sex with someone else.

11The complainant told two friends that she had been forced to perform fellatio on the accused the day after that event allegedly occurred. She refused a suggestion that she go to the police about the matter, at least partly on the basis that the accused was himself a police officer.

12The complainant did not cease sending text messages to the accused. As well as the allegations I have referred to earlier she sent messages asking the accused to repay money that he owed her, and other messages in which she complained about the way he had behaved towards her. As well as such electronic messages it was an agreed fact that the complainant had sent letters to the accused in which she repeated her allegation that he had forced her to perform fellatio upon him.

13It was also an agreed fact that on 12 July 2011 the complainant telephoned the NSW Rape Crisis Centre and said (amongst other things) ""I was dating a police officer for 6 months...He forced me to do oral sex on him"".

14There was no complaint to police for some time. What led to the police being informed was that the accused spoke to another police officer in an attempt to obtain an Apprehended Violence Order against the complainant. At the same time as the accused made his allegations he informed the officer that it was possible that the complainant would respond by making an allegation against him that he had sexually assaulted her. This proved to be the case. The complainant did, at this stage, tell police of her allegations. The accused was arrested in August 2012 and charged with the present matter.

15The accused has no criminal convictions.

Relevant Principles of Law

16At this stage I will set out some important matters of law. They are the sorts of things that I would tell a jury were this a trial where the jury decided the guilt or otherwise of the accused.

Decide the case according to the evidence

17I will determine all the relevant issues of fact according to the evidence. The evidence in this case was made up of what witnesses said in Court and the evidence which has been tendered. I have made no enquiries of any kind about anything that came up in this trial. 

18The complaint gave evidence through closed circuit television. Adducing evidence by those means is standard procedure. I did not draw any adverse conclusion against the accused because the evidence was given in that way, nor did I give the evidence any greater or lesser weight because it was given in that way. 

19Although I had the benefit of seeing the witnesses give their evidence I fully appreciate that in many cases it is extraordinarily difficult to assess whether a witness is telling the truth or not from the way the person behaves while giving evidence. I will comment on some aspects of the complainant's demeanour later in this judgement. At a very broad level, the accused's behaviour in the witness box was unusual. Evidence was led as to why that may have been, but at a more fundamental level an unusual appearance impression in the witness box often says very little about whether the witness is doing his or her best to tell the truth or not.

No emotion

20I have decided this case coldly and unemotionally. Were there a jury I would instruct them to ignore any feelings of sympathy or any other emotion that they might feel in deciding whether or not the accused is guilty of the charge he faces. Both the Crown and the accused are entitled to my judgment free from prejudice and sympathy. 

21There is no doubt that some of the accused's behaviour towards the complainant could be described as unchivalrous and ungentlemanly. Of course, I do not take this into account as a matter pointing to guilt. I mention it for two reasons: firstly to illustrate the proposition I have set out above; and secondly because of the possibility that such conduct has provided the complainant with a motive to make a false allegation of sexual assault and may, at least in part, have caused the observed distress the day after the assault was alleged to have occurred about which evidence was given by the complainant's friends. These are matters to which I will return.

Character

22As I have already mentioned, there was evidence that the accused has no criminal convictions. I will take such evidence into account in two ways. Firstly, the absence of any history of conduct such as alleged against him in this trial, or any criminal conduct at all, makes it less likely that he would have committed this offence. Secondly, the absence of criminal convictions supports the credibility of the evidence he gave in Court.

23Of course the character of the accused in this respect is just one of the many matters I will take into account in deciding my verdict. People without criminal convictions are not incapable of committing offences, after all everyone who has ever been convicted of a criminal offence was at some stage a person with no prior convictions. Nor are people with no criminal convictions incapable of lying in court.

24Despite these considerations, it remains the case that the evidence that the accused has no criminal convictions is a matter in his favour for the reasons I have mentioned above.

Onus of Proof

25The most important and fundamental principle of law which I apply concerns the onus and standard of proof. Because this is a criminal trial, the burden of proving the guilt of the accused is placed firmly on the Crown. The accused starts from the position that he is presumed innocent and that presumption continues until the Crown satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty.

26What the Crown must prove, and prove beyond reasonable doubt, are the ingredients or essential facts contained in the charge arising from the indictment. In the circumstances of this trial, where the accused agrees that sexual intercourse took place, and where if the circumstances in which it took place are as described by the complainant the accused must have known that she was not consenting, then there is only one real issue for me to decide. That is whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused grabbed the complainant's pony tail and forced her head down so that his penis went into her mouth. Of course the corollary of that is that if it is reasonably possible that the intercourse took place as the accused described it then he must be acquitted.

Motive to Lie

27The accused's case is clearly that the allegation made by the complainant is a lie.

28He has raised for my consideration the suggestion that the complainant had various motives to lie:


He allowed her to perform consensual oral sex on him before he told her that he had been unfaithful to her in Vietnam.
Simply the fact that he was unfaithful to her in Vietnam.
Because he ended the relationship with her.
Or a combination of any or all of the above.

29The accused does not have to prove anything in this trial and that includes a reason that the complainant would lie. If I reject the motives put forward by the accused, that does not necessarily mean that the complainant is telling the truth. 

30After all, there might be motives to lie which no-one knows about. If I reject the motives that the accused has suggested to me, then I cannot say ""well the offences must have occurred"". I must still be satisfied of the truthfulness and reliability of the complainant and the Crown must still prove to me that the accused committed the offence beyond reasonable doubt. 

31If I reject the motives to lie put forward by the accused, I must remember that the absence of evidence of a motive for lying is not proof that there was no motive for lying. Absence of evidence as to a motive to lie is irrelevant and adds nothing to the reliability of the complainant or other evidence in the Crown case.

32The accused can't be expected to see into the mind of the complainant and be held accountable for failing to discover whatever motive there may be for the complainant to tell a false story.

Single Witness

33One matter which flows from the high standard of proof which is placed upon the Crown concerns the circumstance that the Crown case relies almost exclusively on the evidence of a single witness, namely the complainant. Accordingly I have scrutinised her evidence with great care. Before I could convict the accused I must exercise caution because the Crown case depends on me accepting the reliability of the evidence of a single witness namely the complainant. 

34Of course that does not mean that I am not entitled to convict the accused based on the evidence of the complainant alone. What it does mean is that I should exercise caution and scrutinise the evidence of the complainant carefully in deciding whether it satisfies me of the truth and accuracy of what she said. 

35It is notorious that offences such as the one alleged in this trial are usually committed in private and so it is commonly the case that the Crown is forced to rely on the evidence of a single witness. But the standard of proof, proof beyond reasonable doubt, is not watered down because offences such as these usually occur in circumstances where no one is present to corroborate the complainant's version. 

Analysis of the relevant circumstances.

36What I will do now is to discuss a number of circumstances relied on by the Crown on the one hand and the accused on the other as suggesting that guilt has either been proved or has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. In a large part these circumstances relate to the conduct of the complainant. Many circumstances, so the Crown suggests, demonstrate behaviour which is consistent with the actions of a person who had been sexually assaulted in the way the complainant said she had been. Some circumstances reveal behaviour which are only consistent, so says the Crown, with that having occurred. On the other hand the accused points to circumstances which he says are consistent with the allegation being false and some circumstances which are said to be only consistent with it being false. 

37As I set these circumstances out it is important to understand that it is not simply a matter of counting up the number of circumstances suggesting guilt and the number or circumstances suggesting that guilt has not been proved. Especially in a case where the prosecution has to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt it can be the case that a single circumstance pointing to innocence can trump a large number of circumstances pointing the other way.

Fear of disease

38Support for the complainant's version and thus the prosecution case can be found in her expressed attitude towards the possibility of contracting a sexually transmitted disease from the accused after he returned from Vietnam. The complainant gave evidence that one of the things that occupied her mind while she was being forced to perform oral sex on the accused was thoughts of where the accused's penis had been whilst he was away. She gave evidence that she contemplated that he may have had, for example, anal sex whilst on holiday. The Crown relies on this as a circumstance suggesting that the complainant would not have consented to performing oral sex upon the accused at all, let alone the very day that he returned from overseas. 

39There is evidence which establishes that the complainant's concern about the possibility of catching some form of disease from the accused was not a recent invention. Indeed the evidence established that well before the accused went on his holiday, the complainant was concerned about the possibility of disease. On 20 March 2011 the complainant sent a text message to the accused saying (I will insert some punctuation to make the meaning clearer) 

No. Vietnam then me - it will neverrrr happen. Me of all ppl, miss paranoid of germs n disease, ewwww. Makes me sick to think of it really, lol.""

40As well there is the evidence of Ms Seaburn that the complainant was phobic about germs and considered Vietnam a dirty country, similar concerns having been spoken about by the complainant with Ms Gold. 

41The accused gave evidence that, whilst the complainant says that she was paranoid about germs, she wasn't. I reject that evidence. It is inconsistent with the text messages to which I have referred. It is inconsistent with the evidence of the complainant's friends Ms Seaburn and Ms Gold. And it was not suggested in cross-examination of her friends that they were either lying or mistaken about this matter.

42Although the accused's admission by text that he had had sex with someone in Vietnam came after the complainant performed fellatio on the accused (and so that admission can not have been in the complainant's mind at the time of the sexual act), when she met him at Sydney airport the complainant was of the view that he had not been faithful to her. The accused's evidence was that despite his denials to her at the airport, he believed that the complainant believed he had been unfaithful, forming this opinion from both her facial expression and constant questioning of him. 

43Thus the complainant's evidence that when she was being forced to perform oral sex on the accused she felt disgusting, thinking where his penis had been whilst in Vietnam, is entirely consistent with her earlier expressed attitude. This supports the complainant's evidence that she did not consent to performing oral sex upon the accused.

44There are two things to say about this circumstance at this stage. Firstly, it could be weighty evidence to support the crown case. Secondly, its weight diminishes considerably if it is possible that over the course of the day they spent together, the complainant altered her view as to the likelihood that the accused had been unfaithful.

45The accused gave no evidence of any conversation in which, for example, he persuaded the complainant that he had remained faithful. But on the other hand he relies on the very circumstance that the complainant remained in his company from the time they left the airport until she got a taxi home from his place, with the complainant unable to account in evidence for what occurred during a significant part of the afternoon. He also relies on the apparent change in attitude on the part of the complainant after he sent the text message to her in which he confesses infidelity (text message of 12/4/11 at 6.35pm ""I wasn't good in Nam... I lasted a week) as demonstrating that remaining in his company for the afternoon of 11 April 2011 is behaviour very inconsistent with a belief that he had had sex with someone whilst away overseas.

46I will return to this issue later as I analyse the evidence as a whole.

Observations of the complainant as she gave evidence

47I closely watched the complainant as she gave evidence and whilst I fully acknowledge the difficulties that human beings have in identifying whether a person is lying or not, I do take into account such things as the obvious distress exhibited by the complainant as she gave her evidence, particularly as she described the actual act of sexual intercourse which forms the basis of the charge faced by the accused. She appeared to find it disgusting that the accused placed his penis in her mouth, and then ejaculated in her mouth in circumstances where she was thinking about where his penis had been during his trip overseas. Her display of disgust appeared genuine. 

48I should make it clear that it could not be the case that the mere act of fellatio was what had disgusted her. The evidence was that such sexual acts were a part of their consensual sexual relationship. The accused himself gave evidence to that effect and indeed made reference to such acts in one of his text messages to the complainant.

49At one stage in cross-examination it was suggested to her that as well as the oral sex forming the basis of the allegation brought against the accused, she had also performed fellatio on the accused earlier that day, before they went to the club for drinks and dinner. I watched the complainant particularly carefully during this period of questioning (I had advance notice that questions about this were going to be asked because of a s 293 Criminal Procedure Act application properly made by Mr Goldsworthy). The complainant was emphatic in her denial that she had performed oral sex on the accused on the afternoon of 11th April 2011 and she appeared quite surprised by the suggestion that such an event had taken place. Her surprise did not appear to me to be in any way feigned.

Immediate complaint to some and lack of complaint to another

50Although it was some time before the complainant made an allegation to police, and the circumstances of that complaint need to be borne in mind, it is the case that from very soon after she left the accused's premises she was alleging that he had forced her to perform oral sex upon him. At 8.43 pm on 12 April 2011 the complainant sent the accused a text message which included these words ""then u forced my head down to suck your dick when I said no! "". Despite the seriousness of this allegation there is no record of the accused responding to it. It may well be that he did not read it given the number of text message he received from the complainant.

51Later, on 13 April 2011 the complainant again made an allegation to the accused when she sent a text message to him at 6.36 pm saying ""u also know u FORCED me to suck your dick, when have I said no before ? "" This time the accused did answer the allegation when he sent a text message two minutes later saying ""I didn't force u to do anything. I think with your size and strength u are able to stop."" One minute later the complainant replied to this text message by saying ""hahaha are u saying I didn't say no ???? swear on ya 2.5 kids life ??"". There was apparently no response to this. 

52Given the number of text messages sent by the complainant to the accused, and the way in which they were stored on his older model Nokia mobile phone, not too much should be made of the fact that the accused did not apparently respond to the first allegation quoted above and did not respond to the request that he swear on the lives of his 2 children and the child yet to be born. What is perhaps more important is the circumstance that very shortly after the complainant says she was sexually assaulted, she was complaining about that to the accused. Her behaviour in sending those text messages was entirely consistent with the actions of a woman who had been sexually assaulted shortly beforehand. 

53But of course it was not only the accused to whom the complainant complained. The evidence established that the day after the assault was alleged to have occurred the complainant told Annette Seaburn and Danielle Gold (in separate conversations) what had happened the night before. Ms Seaburn's evidence was that the complainant had complained that ""He...grabbed her hair and forced her head down and was forced to suck him off"". Ms Gold's evidence was that the complainant told her that in response to a demand that she have sex with the accused,

She said no she wouldn't and she'd repeated that a few times. He had said it again that she would and then he had put his hand on the back of her head and grabbed her hair and forced her head down as he took his penis out and made her give him oral sex.

(I do not regard it of much significance that Ms Gold's recollection was that the complainant told her that these events happened in her home rather than that of the accused.)

54In assessing the weight to be given to the complaints to her friends, it is important to consider whether it is possible that the complaints were false allegations prompted by the accused's confession of infidelity. In assessing that issue, matters of timing become important. If the complaints came before the accused's confession they are much more supportive of the crown case than if they come afterwards. The converse is true as well, and the accused relies on the circumstance that at the time the complainant complained to Ms Seaburn, she appeared to have ""actual knowledge"" of infidelity, the accused having confessed such to her (see T:145).

55Another matter the accused relies on concerns a lack of complaint. The accused points to the circumstance that the complainant failed to tell her estranged husband about what she said had just occurred despite the fact that she was exchanging text messages with him fairly regularly over the course of the evening of 11 April 2011 (I will discuss below the way the complainant described the accused in those messages). 

56The complainant sent 26 text messages to her estranged husband in the period of about two hours immediately after she called the taxi to pick her up from the accused's house. None of these messages contained any complaint of the alleged assault.

57Given that delay in complaint is raised by the accused I should remind myself that there may be good reasons why a person in the complainant's position would delay making a complaint. In cross-examination the complainant explained why she had not told her estranged husband what the accused had done. She said that if she had, her estranged husband would have gone straight around to the accused's home and killed him. Whilst there is perhaps some exaggeration in that answer, it is not at all surprising that the complainant might fear a violent reaction from her husband which would scarcely do anybody any good.

58As well as what the messages did not say, the accused points to what they did say as being inconsistent with the sexual assault having occurred. This concerns the way the complainant referred to the accused in those text messages sent to her estranged husband soon after the assault was alleged to have occurred. 

59In analysing the content of these messages it must be borne in mind that, as the messages reveal, there was something of an acrimonious relationship between the complainant and her estranged husband at the time, with the complainant at times, anxious to insult and abuse him. So, complimentary things said about the accused in those messages have to be seen in that light. But even taking that factor into account the complainant's conduct in describing the accused in the way she did is a factor pointing to the accused's innocence. For example from exhibit 4


Message 5960 ""Shaun is innocent compared to that dead CUNT Mark"".
Message 5963 she describes the accused as ""an innocent party"".
Message 5988 ""he certainly acts better that u...""
Message 6011 ""he has a lot more morals than u""

60In the context of a bitter dispute with her husband the use of the word ""innocent "" may well mean, as the complainant suggested, that the accused was not responsible for the predicament that her estranged husband finds himself in, but suggesting to her estranged husband that the accused acts better than he does and that he has a lot more morals than him are surprising things to say about a person who has just sexually assaulted her.

61Whilst the explanation offered by the complainant for her failure to tell her estranged husband what she said the accused had done to her might explain an absence of complaint, that circumstance does not explain why she would speak about the accused in positive terms.

The messages to the accused on 12 April 2011.

62At 2.48 pm on 12 April 2011, the day after the alleged assault, the complainant sent an SMS to the accused saying ""seems like u don't want to know me now u back? Did I do something wrong"" this is, in my view, an unusual thing to say to a man who had less than 24 hours before forced the complainant to perform oral intercourse upon him. The message has the flavour of the complainant being ignored which is inconsistent with how I would have expected the complainant to have acted if the events of the previous evening were as she described.

63The complainant explained some of her text messages on the 12th of April 2011, and in particular their polite nature, by saying that she was keen to get her money back - a figure of between $500 and $800 was mentioned. On one view it would be unusual for a woman who had been sexually assaulted to remain focused on getting some money back from the accused and remaining polite to him because of that. On the other hand even $500 is a not insignificant amount and it is not unknown for people to hide their true feelings to others in such circumstances.

64Also inconsistent with having just been sexually assaulted is the text message at 6.33 pm. Again it appears that the complainant is asking the accused to pay more attention to her asking ""what have I done now"". Again this is more consistent with a complaint about being ignored than with the complainant's suggestion in evidence that these text messages refer to the money that the accused owed her. 

65A very short time later, at 6:35pm, the accused responded with the confession of infidelity referred to above (""I wasn't good in Nam... I lasted a week) which led to a dramatic change in the tone of the text messages sent by the complainant. This change of attitude is important, as I will discuss later.
Deletion of text messages by the complainant

66It is immediately apparent when exhibit 5 is compared with exhibit 6 that not all text messages sent by the complainant from her mobile phone were still stored on that phone when she handed it to police. The complainant gave evidence that from time to time when her phone memory became full she would delete messages randomly so as to free up some storage space. The suggestion was made to the complainant in cross-examination that she had deleted messages which were not helpful to her case. Unfortunately, although she handed her mobile phone to police, no attempt was made by them to recover any deleted messages. Nor did the accused produce his phone which might have contained some of the deleted messages.

67It was, in the absence of any knowledge as to what was contained in the deleted messages, difficult to discern whether messages had been deleted randomly as the complainant said or with particularity as was alleged in cross-examination. Certainly those messages which remained gave no hint to there being some particular messages which would have been unhelpful to an acceptance of what the complainant says the accused did to her. On the other hand one might have thought that if messages were to be deleted randomly then the easiest thing to do would be to delete a group of messages, but what the complainant appears to have done is deleted a message, skipped over the next message or so and then deleted another message. 

68Perhaps the most important feature demonstrating that the complainant has not deliberately deleted messages unhelpful to her case from her phone is the circumstance that if that was the complainant's motivation there are many many messages she would have deleted.

69Ultimately I was unable to determine why the complainant had deleted particular messages. It is possible that she had deleted particular messages which were unhelpful to her cause but that is as high a finding as I am able to make.

Call to rape crisis centre

70As mentioned above, it is an agreed fact that on 11 July 2011 the complainant made a call to the NSW Rape Crisis Centre in which she made a complaint consistent with what she now says occurred. This is a matter which supports a finding that the complainant had a genuine belief that she had been sexually assaulted by the accused. 

71This is especially the case where the call to the rape crisis centre was quite remote from other complaints of wrongdoing made by the accused to her friends and, more importantly, to police. If the complaint to the rape crisis centre came at about the time complaint to the police was made, there could have been a suggestion that it was part of the complainant's attempt to bolster her own credibility, but that was certainly not the case. The complainant had made it clear to Ms Seaburn that she would not be making a complaint to police because the accused was a police officer. The only thing which appears to have prompted a change of mind was the accused's attempt to obtain an AVO against her.

72So the evidence establishes that the call to the rape crisis centre is most unlikely to have been part of a cunning plan by the complainant to act in the manner a genuine victim of sexual assault would be likely to act. The reason for that call could really only have been in connection with a desire for assistance from the rape crisis centre. For that reason I consider that there is substantial support for what the complainant says to be found in the circumstance that she made a call to the rape crisis centre when she made it. 

The complainant spent the day with the accused on his return.

73The evidence established that had the complainant wished to, she could have quite easily declined to spend as much time with the accused as she did on the day he returned from Vietnam. Once she, her friend Annette Seaburn, and the accused had arrived at Wyong where the accused's car was, she could have easily asked Ms Seaburn to drive her home. She could have asked the accused to have driven her home at any time that day, but the evidence was that she did not do so. To the contrary she bought some vitamins for him at a shopping centre, went to his home, and went out to dinner with him before returning to his home. She spent the whole of the afternoon and a significant part of the evening with him. 

74That is inconsistent with her evidence that she formed a strong belief from the accused's body language that he had been unfaithful to her whilst he was in Vietnam. The complainant's evidence was that she stayed with him to keep on good terms so that he would repay her the money that he owed her. I accept the submission made on behalf of the accused that it would have been an easy matter for her to say to the accused ""you must be tired why don't you drop me home and have a sleep"" which would have been a polite way of declining to spend time with the accused. That she said nothing of this kind, but did remain in his company for many hours upon his return from Vietnam, does tend to suggest that either she was not firmly of the belief that he had been unfaithful to her whilst in Vietnam, or that her belief that he was unfaithful to her did not cause her to want to permanently end the relationship she had with him, or perhaps that she wished to maintain a non-sexual friendship with the accused.

75On one view the fact that the complainant spent so much time with the accused on the day he returned from Vietnam is inconsistent with her having a belief that he had been unfaithful to her whilst on holiday. On the other hand it was common ground between the accused and the complainant that she had such a belief, the accused forming that opinion by the look on her face and that she continually asked him the same question over and over again, the accused agreeing with the proposition that ""it was quite obvious she didn't believe you"". (T:184.29).

76This leads to what is perhaps the most important aspect of this case - in the hours leading up to the intercourse the subject of this charge, did the complainant ever moderate her views as to whether the accused had been unfaithful to her whilst overseas? I have already touched on this issue when discussing the evidence regarding the complainant's attitude to disease, and it is an issue to which I will return later when analysing the evidence as a whole.

The circumstance in which the allegation is made known to police

77What led to the allegation being made to police, and thus the accused facing trial, was his complainant about the complainant's behaviour. At the time he made that complaint to another police officer, he suggested that his complaint may prompt an allegation in return that he had sexually assaulted the complainant. This is conduct which is inconsistent with guilt. It would be strange for him to complain about behaviour of the complainant in circumstances where, as he said to the police, she may well retaliate by making an allegation of sexual assault, if that allegation was true.

Facebook messages to ""Girlfriend Mel""

78It was common ground that over a period of time the complainant had sent a number of facebook messages to a person she referred to as ""girlfriend Mel"". This was a person with whom the accused had been having a relationship of a sexual nature. The complainant referred to her as ""girlfriend Mel"" to distinguish her from the accused's former wife, also named ""Mel"". 

79The messages to girlfriend Mel are clearly designed to portray the accused in a bad light. It was the clear intention of those messages that the recipient of them think substantially less of the accused. Thus in the messages the complainant tells girlfriend Mel that:


The accused had made them both pregnant at the same time.
The accused had given another woman a sexually transmitted disease.
The accused had told the complainant that he does not like having sex with girlfriend Mel.
The accused had told the complainant that he does not love girlfriend Mel or like her.
The accused had slept with others in Vietnam.
The accused was a ""pro liar"".
The accused talks about girlfriend Mel ""like a dog.""

80It is remarkable that in those messages, which commenced soon after the complainant says she was sexually assaulted by the accused, she makes no reference to the accused having sexually assaulted her. According to the complainant she thought that Mel deserved to know things about the accused. An obvious question to ask is why she would stop short of making an allegation that he had sexually assaulted her when, as was clear, she was doing her best to denigrate the accused in the eyes of girlfriend Mel. 

81In her evidence the complainant provided some explanation. She testified that she did not think that she would have been believed, saying ""I wouldn't even think she would believe that from him"". She said ""I didn't think that was for me to bring to her"". She explained that the things she did tell girlfriend Mel were matters about which she had evidence, such as by forwarding text messages which she had received from the accused in which he was less than complimentary about Mel. In some of the facebook messages she did precisely that.

82Whether her motivation in sending these messages was to make girlfriend Mel fully aware of the conduct of the accused as a means of assisting her or as a way to denigrate the accused, it is remarkable the complainant would ignore one of the most serious things that could be said about a human being, namely that he had forced a woman to have sex against her will. The explanation offered by the complainant does go someway to making the omission less remarkable, but even so, I regard this aspect of the evidence as worthy of close consideration.

83In undertaking that close consideration I do have to analyse the significance of the circumstance that the complainant would fail to make the allegation to a particular person when she had already complained to the accused himself in two text messages (and would continue to make such allegations by letter), to her friend Annette Seaburn and to her friend, Danielle Gold. Failure to complain to a particular person is less significant than failure to complain at all. 

Distress on the part of the complainant 

84There is no doubt that when the complainant told Ms Seaburn and Ms Gold what the accused had done to her she was very distressed. Indeed she was shaking, she was crying and she was hysterical. The Crown relies on this as support for the truth of the allegation made by the complainant. The Crown says that such signs of distress are entirely consistent with the truth of the allegations being made by the complainant.

85In order to evaluate this argument, it is important to consider whether there are other circumstances which may have prompted the complainant to be distressed. There is the obvious one that the accused had told her that their relationship was over. As mentioned earlier this depends on whether complaint came before or after the text message of 6:35pm. But there is also another circumstance which would add to the complainant's distress. As is clear, and despite the accused's evidence, the complainant appears to have been very concerned about the prospect of the accused being unfaithful to her in Vietnam because of the risk that he would catch some form of disease which would be transmitted to her. I have to consider the possibility that at least part of the complainant's distress the following day is that she learnt, through an admission by the accused that he had had sex in Vietnam after she had voluntarily performed oral sex upon him. 

86Another explanation worthy of consideration for the observed distress might be that the complainant was upset at the termination of their relationship by the accused. There are circumstances which would suggest that the complainant might take the end of the relationship badly. For example she clearly missed the ability to communicate with the accused whilst he is in Vietnam. The records from her mobile phone carrier show that the complainant sent either a text message or tried to call him on 66 occasions while he was away. The significance of that level of communication is increased by the circumstance that no text message was sent or telephone call made by the accused while he was overseas.

Alleged ""physical impossibility""

87There were some aspects of the physical nature of what the complainant alleged which were said by Mr Goldsworthy to be physically impossible. His submissions were at times based on the complainant's movements while giving evidence and, as part of that, demonstrating how she and the accused moved. At other times, for example when he submitted ""she must have voluntarily opened her mouth"", his submissions were based on the description of events given by the complainant. 

88I regard none of Mr Goldsworthy's submissions on this aspect of the matter as carrying much weight at all. The idea that a sexual assault complainant is expected to be able to remember precisely who did what and when is one which does not find much favour with me. And the suggestion that a complainant alleging forced fellatio could simply have kept her mouth closed, is one which deserves to be discarded. 

Consideration

89There is no doubt that the relationship between the complainant and the accused was volatile. It is also clear that, as evidenced by many text messages sent by the complainant, she was a person who was prepared to make threats, in particular directed at her estranged husband, his brother Mark, and the accused. In those circumstances the possibility that the complainant has fabricated the allegation of forced sexual intercourse must be closely considered. 

90As I explained earlier my task is not to simply count up those circumstances pointing to a verdict of guilty and those pointing to a verdict of not guilty and see which option has more circumstances. Not all circumstances carry the same weight. Some point strongly in a particular direction, some are less important. And especially when the onus and burden of proof are factored in, a single circumstance pointing to innocence can trump a large number of circumstances pointing the other way.

91I regard the complainant's well established (despite the accused's evidence) phobia about disease coupled with her obvious belief that the accused was unfaithful to her whilst overseas, as being particularly significant. That she would voluntarily perform unprotected fellatio upon the accused (he says twice) on the very day he returned to Australia is not a version of events that I consider to be reasonably possible unless the complainant has for some reason changed her mind about whether the accused was unfaithful to her. 

92It is common ground, as I have mentioned earlier, that on the morning of 11 April 2011 the complainant believed the accused had been unfaithful to her whilst in Vietnam, with the accused relying on the complainant's facial expressions and constant badgering of him on this issue at the airport. That is a particularly important circumstance relied on by the Crown suggesting that the complainant would not voluntarily consent to any form of sexual activity with the accused on the very day he returned. However I have to consider whether it is possible that something happened during the course of the day such that the complainant changed her mind. If she did of course then that makes it much more likely that the sexual intercourse which took place that evening was consensual. 

93It is notable that the accused did not suggest that there had been any further conversation on this topic after they left the airport, and indeed his response to the suggestion the complainant would not have voluntarily consented to sex with him in those circumstances was simply to say that the complainant was not as obsessive about hygiene as she suggested she was (evidence given by the accused which I have had no hesitation in rejecting for reasons identified elsewhere in this judgment).

94However there are still three puzzling aspects to the complainant's behaviour which may be thought to be inconsistent with a belief that the accused had been unfaithful. Firstly why did she spend the rest of the day with him if she believed he had been unfaithful to her? She had many opportunities to avoid his company which she could have taken advantage of. Her explanation that she wanted to ensure that he repaid the money which he owed her is unsatisfactory given the ease with which she could have, politely made up any excuse to avoid being with him. Other explanations, such as a desire to continue to have a relationship whether sexual or non sexual, with the accused, do not take account of the dramatic change in the complainant's behaviour after the accused confessed his infidelity by text message.

95Secondly her actions that day went beyond simply remaining in his company. To the contrary she spent more money on him, buying him vitamins and dinner. The sums involved were small but the fact that she bought those items for him is inconsistent with the belief that he had been unfaithful to her whilst on holidays. 

96And thirdly and perhaps most importantly there is the complainant's reaction after he sent a text message to her saying ""I wasn't good in Nam- you are better off without me - I lasted a week."" The actions of the complainant thereafter do not appear to be those of a woman who has simply had the unfaithfulness of her partner confirmed. They are more consistent with the actions of a woman who had been deceived.

97As regards this 3rd matter, the Crown acknowledges the change in behaviour of the complainant before and after that text message. It is apparent in her text messages to the accused (which I have already discussed), and her change of attitude towards her estranged husband. Whereas previously the complainant had been abusive towards her husband, in a text message sent only 42 minutes after the accused's confession of infidelity, the complainant asks her husband to visit her, saying 24 minutes later ""I want to talk, not argue"".

98The importance of this dramatic change of behaviour towards both the accused and her husband is this: What apparently prompts the change is the accused's confession of infidelity. This tends to suggest that the complainant did not have a belief in the accused's infidelity beforehand. This, in turn is, as I have mentioned numerous times before in this judgment, highly relevant to the likelihood that the complainant would have consented to sexual activity with the accused on 11 April 2011.


Decision

99 I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the accused's guilt before I can return a verdict of guilty. The Crown relies almost exclusively on the evidence of the complainant to proves its case and so I must be cautious before convicting the accused, examining the evidence of the complainant very carefully in order to be satisfied that the Crown has proved its case to the high standard required in a criminal trial.

100When I perform that task I am left with a reasonable doubt about the accused's guilt. Accordingly I find him not guilty.

		03 June 2014",2014-06-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704990,Application by Darush Majid pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 709,"Judgment1Darush Majid (""the applicant"") makes application pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (""the Act"") for an inquiry into the sentences imposed upon him by Judge Puckeridge QC in the District Court on 18 December 2008.  
2On 22 April 2008 a jury returned a verdict of guilty in respect of each of three counts against the applicant.  The first two counts alleged offences of aggravated sexual assault upon a victim aged 15 years.  Each of those offences was contrary to s. 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 NSW and each carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
3The third count of which the applicant was found guilty was an offence of detaining for advantage contrary to s. 86(1)(b) of the Crimes Act.  That offence carried a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.  No standard non-parole period was prescribed.
4The applicant was sentenced by his Honour as follows:
(i)in respect of count 1, a period of 12 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 9 years;
(ii)in respect of count 2, 14 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment; and
(iii)in respect of count 3, a fixed term of 8 years imprisonment.
5The total effective sentence was one of 14 years and 6 months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months imprisonment.
6The applicant has submitted that the matter should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal as an appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  In making that application the applicant has argued that there is a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance, namely that the sentence imposed upon him was infected by error in light of the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.  The principles which apply to an application such as this are set out in full in The Application of Victor Makarov pursuant to s. 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 NSW [2013] NSWSC 1468 at [5]-[6].
THE APPLICANT'S SENTENCE7It is not necessary for the purposes of the present application to set out the circumstances of the applicant's offending.  The sentencing judge did so at some length (at ROS 1 - 5) before finding (at ROS 6) that the applicant had admitted his guilt following the jury's verdict, and had expressed remorse for his actions.  His Honour took this into account along with evidence given by the applicant as to difficulties he had experienced in his youth (commencing at ROS 11).  His Honour also took into account (at ROS 13-15) two psychological reports which were tendered before him.
8His Honour concluded (at ROS 15) that the offending was ""serious"" and noted (at ROS 16) that in respect of count 1 it was aggravated by the fact that the applicant was in a position of authority.  He also concluded (at ROS 16) that the emotional harm to the victim of the offending was ""substantial"".  His Honour then said (at ROS 16):
""I do take into account in balancing the mitigating factors the remorse which the offender has now expressed. I also take into account his background and the evidence which he has given as to events which has (sic) occurred in his past life, and the evidence and history which he gave to Mr Tim Watson-Munro. Consideration of that evidence is such however that I accept the submission that has been made by the Crown that whilst his background and his drug abuse may have had some effect on his impulse control he, the offender, knew that what he was doing was wrong. I accept that the offender by his admission now of guilt and from what has been stated in his statement to the court, exhibit 1, accepts responsibility for his actions and for the wrong which he has committed on the victim"".
9His Honour concluded (at ROS 17-18): 
""It had been put on behalf of the offender that the offence (in count 1) was not in the mid range of objective seriousness. The offence subject of the first count and the offence the subject of the second count carries (sic) a standard non-parole period of ten years. It is in relation to that standard non-parole period that the court was addressed as to whether the offence fell in the mid range of seriousness or not. I accept in relation to the offence (in count 1), balancing those matters which I have previously considered and with the absence of calculated planning by the offender, that it does not fall within the mid-range but not significantly below it. The offender took advantage of a young person and ought to have known better. I would consider that the appropriate sentence in relation to the first count would be a period of imprisonment of twelve years and a non-parole period of nine years.
I have taken into account the background of the offender and taken into account the effect of what he observed and saw in the turmoil in Afghanistan and the effect of what occurred when a bomb went off in the vicinity of his home. Having taken that into account, I do not consider that there should be any further discount in respect of that non-parole period of nine years.
In respect of the second count which as I have stated is of a more calculated nature I consider that in the circumstances of that offence a standard non-parole period should apply. The sentence in relation to that offence will be a period of a imprisonment of fourteen years with a non-parole period of ten.
In respect of the third count, again I have taken into account the vulnerable position of the victim and that the purpose of the detention was to obtain an advantage, namely sexual gratification. I will (sic) consider the period of imprisonment appropriate for that offence would be a period of imprisonment of eight years. In view of the non-parole period which I have set in respect of the first and second count, I do not propose to impose a non-parole period"".
10His Honour then proceeded to impose the sentences that I have previously outlined.
11The applicant sought leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the sentences imposed and advanced five separate grounds in that regard.  The Court of Criminal Appeal found that the sentencing judge had erred in calculating the head sentence in respect of the second count.  Leave to appeal against sentence was granted, and the sentence of imprisonment on the second count was quashed.  The remaining grounds of appeal were dismissed.  The effect of the Court's orders was that the total term imposed in respect of the second count was reduced from one of 14 years imprisonment to one of 13 years and 4 months imprisonment (see Majid v R [2010] NSWCCA 121).
12One of the grounds advanced by the applicant before the Court of Criminal Appeal was that the sentences were manifestly excessive.  In determining this ground Johnson J (with whom Simpson and McCallum JJ agreed) said the following (at [63]):
""[63] The Applicant, then aged 25 years, committed separate and serious sexual assault offences upon a 15-year old girl. Having regard to the employment relationship between the Applicant and the victim, the offences constituted a breach of trust on the part of the Applicant. The Applicant used force and penile/vaginal intercourse took place on both occasions. The standard non-parole period had direct application to this case as the Applicant was convicted after trial. The sentencing Judge assessed the first sexual assault offence as not falling within the mid-range but not being significantly below it, and the second sexual assault offence was assessed as lying within the middle of the range of objective seriousness, so as to attract application of the standard non-parole period. These assessments with respect to objective seriousness were not challenged in any ground of appeal. 
[64] The second offence involved a repeated sexual assault offence against the victim committed about a month after the first offence. Both were serious offences involving the taking of the victim to an isolated place so that the Applicant could use her, without her consent, for his own sexual purposes. 
[65] The Applicant's criminal history revealed a range of offences for which non-custodial sentences had been passed. It may be inferred that the Applicant's troubled and traumatic childhood in Afghanistan had been taken into account in his favour on sentence on more than one occasion. However, by December 2006, the Applicant had been living in Australia for 13 years and had been raised and educated here and was in gainful employment. 
[66] The application and operation of the standard non-parole period provisions to the sentencing of the Applicant assist an understanding of the length of the sentences imposed. It has not been demonstrated that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust (my emphasis).""
THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES13On behalf of the applicant it was submitted that the standard non-parole period was a dominant factor, both at first instance and on appeal, and that the outcome in each case was ""heavily influenced by the prevailing approach mandated by R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 to the sentencing of offenders for standard non-parole period offences"".  
14It was submitted, in particular, that Johnson J's reference to the standard non-parole period having ""direct application"" was a clear error.  In this regard, reliance was placed on the judgment of the High Court in Muldrock (supra) at [29] as well as the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Achurch v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 117 at [70].15Finally, it was submitted that the present case was a clear example of both the sentencing judge, and the Court of Criminal Appeal, giving determinative significance, in respect of counts 1 and 2, to the application of the standard non-parole period.  This, it was submitted, was evident from the remarks of the sentencing judge extracted at [9] above, and from the observations of Johnson J at [63]-[66].
16Counsel for the Attorney-General submitted that a doubt or question as to any mitigating circumstance could not arise by reference to a Muldrock type error.  However as Johnson J pointed out in The Application of Joy Lorraine Knight pursuant to s. 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act [2014] NSWSC 285 at [17], such a submission cannot be sustained in light of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Sinkovich v Attorney-General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383.
17Counsel for the Attorney-General further submitted that careful consideration needed to be given to the role that the standard non-parole period played in the sentencing process, both at first instance and on appeal.  It was submitted that merely showing that the sentencing judge had sentenced, pre-Muldrock, by following the dictates of Way was not sufficient to demonstrate error, and that what was required to be ascertained in such a case was whether reliance on Way had sufficiently infected a sentence with error, such that intervention was warranted (see generally Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 172).
18It was submitted that the sentencing judge had considered the entirety of the objective and subjective features of the case before reaching his conclusions and that there was accordingly no error in that regard.  In respect of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, counsel for the Attorney-General appeared to acknowledge that Johnson J's reference to the standard non-parole period having ""direct application"" was of some significance.  However, it was submitted that it was necessary to read and consider that observation in light of the entirety of the judgment and that when such an approach was taken, it was evident that Johnson J had done nothing more than view the standard non-parole period as benchmark.  
19Finally, it was submitted that there was nothing arising out of the judgment of Johnson J which indicated that his Honour had adopted a two-stage approach to the question of sentence.  
CONSIDERATION20In Muldrock (supra) the High Court concluded at [25] that it was an error to categorise s. 54B(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as being framed in mandatory terms which required the court to use the standard non-parole period as the starting point for determining whether an offence was appropriately assessed as being in the middle of the range.  The Court also concluded (at [26]) that it was a mistake to give primary, let alone determinative, significance to the standard non-parole period and held that the correct approach was to identify all relevant factors (including any prescribed standard non-parole period) and make a value judgment as to the appropriate sentence.
21Further (at [28]) the Court specifically rejected the adoption of a two-stage approach to sentencing, commencing with an assessment of whether the offence falls in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, followed by an inquiry as to whether there are matters justifying the imposition of a non-parole period which is longer or shorter than that prescribed.
22In arriving at these conclusions, the court held that the decision in Way (supra) was incorrect.
23In my view, there is nothing within the remarks of the sentencing judge in the present case which would indicate that he gave primary or determinative significance to the standard non-parole period, or that he engaged in a two-stage approach to sentencing.  As I have outlined, his Honour spent some considerable time identifying the entirety of the aggravating and mitigating factors before arriving at what he considered to be an appropriate sentence.  Indeed, his Honour (at ROS 17) expressly noted that he had balanced all of the matters to which he had previously referred in arriving at a conclusion as to the appropriate sentence.  
24In support of the submission that error was demonstrated in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, the applicant placed some considerable reliance upon the decision in Achurch (No 2) (supra).  In particular, the applicant drew attention to the fact that in that case, an observation as to the direct applicability of the standard non-parole period had also been made at the time of the sentence being imposed.  It was submitted, in effect, that because the Court of Criminal Appeal had found error in that case, the same conclusion should be reached in the case of the applicant. 
25I am unable to accept that submission.  It reflects an approach which disregards those authorities which make it clear that when determining whether or not there has been a Muldrock-type error, the entirety of the judgment in question must be considered.  An approach which has, as its focus, an isolated passage or statement is an erroneous one (see for example Black v R [2013] NSWCCA 265).  
26In my view, when the judgment of Johnson J is read as a whole it becomes evident that the entirety of the circumstances were taken into account in reaching the conclusion that the sentences imposed upon the applicant were not manifestly excessive.  There is nothing in the Court's judgment which would indicate that the standard non-parole period was used in a determinative (and thus impermissible) way, or that a two-stage process of sentencing was undertaken.  
CONCLUSION27For the reasons set out above I am not persuaded that there was any Muldrock- type error, either when the applicant was sentenced or when he was subsequently dealt with by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  
28Accordingly I do not entertain any doubt or question as to the existence of a mitigating circumstance in the applicant's case.
ORDERS
29For the foregoing reasons I make the following order:
(i)The application is refused.

		15 July 2014",2014-06-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705005,R v Hines (No 1) [2014] NSWSC 701,"Judgment

1The accused Allan John Hines has been arraigned on an indictment containing three counts. The first charge is that he did murder Aaron Jones. The second and third counts are counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on two different victims, namely Teegan Jones and Caylan Jones. Mr Hines' trial is due to commence in Broken Hill on 23 June 2014. 

2By notice of motion dated 4 May 2014 the accused seeks orders;

(1)For severance of the indictment and separate trials;

(2)That count (2) - the charge of assaulting Teegan Jones - be severed from the indictment and that there be a separate trial with respect to that count;

(3)That count (3) - the charge of assaulting Caylan Jones - be severed from the indictment and that there be a separate trial with respect to that count.

3The accused relies on evidence contained in an affidavit of his solicitor Rebecca Ellen Mitchell and a bundle of documents which became exhibit 1 on the notice of motion. Exhibit 1 contains a copy of the indictment, the Crown case statement, an expanded summary of the evidence prepared by Mr Wilson SC who appears for the accused, a chart which compares the evidence of the crucial witnesses, a chronology, and a number of statements and interviews of the relevant prosecution witnesses.

4There is little dispute between the parties in relation to the approximate chronology of events and the issues which will arise at the murder trial. The major issue at the trial, at least in respect of count one, will be whether the accused had the necessary intention to justify a conviction for murder. The parties also anticipate that two other issues will arise for the jury's consideration. First, whether the accused acted in self defence and, more particularly, whether he should be convicted of manslaughter (not murder) on the basis of excessive self defence: cf s 421 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Secondly, whether he should be convicted of manslaughter (not murder) on the grounds of provocation: cf s 23 Crimes Act. 

5There will be no dispute at the trial that the act causing death was the act of the accused and, in particular, his act in producing a knife and ""stabbing"" Aaron Jones. A perusal of the statements of the eyewitnesses shows that there are a variety of accounts as to precisely how the stabbing occurred. One of the crucial witnesses is Teegan Jones (the alleged victim in count 2). 

6The questions that lie at the core of the issues to be decided by the jury concern Mr Hines' state of mind at the time that the deceased was killed. It is in that context that the present application falls to be determined.

7The tragic events took place in the town of Wilcannia in the early hours of 19 February 2013. On 18 February 2013 there was a large and significant funeral in the town. A number of people had gathered at the premises where the accused lived with Teegan Jones and at nearby homes. 

8The precise timing of events is unclear. However what is clear is that the fatal incident took place at around 1:25 am. In the course of a dispute which arose for reasons that are of no present relevance, both the accused and the deceased produced weapons. It is the Crown case that Mr Hines was the real aggressor. However, there seems to be little doubt on the evidence that the deceased uttered provocative words to the accused and swung a piece of iron at him. In that act, he fell to the ground. The accused then either fell on him or jumped on him and in the course of that action, whatever it was, the knife entered the deceased's body. It was this wound that caused his death. 

9Immediately before that fateful moment, and as Mr Hines approached the deceased, a child at the premises (Caylan Jones) attempted to intervene. As he did he was cut with the knife. This is the incident that gives rise to count (3). There is no suggestion that the wound to the child was caused deliberately but, if count (3) goes to the jury, the Crown will submit that his actions were reckless in the sense required for proof of the intention of an assault: see for example, R v Venna [1976] QB 421 at 428-429. 

10It can be seen that the incident giving rise to count (3) was immediately proximate to the events giving rise to the murder. Mr Wilson concedes that the evidence relating to the wounding of the child is admissible in the murder trial. However, he submits that count (3) should be severed from the indictment even though evidence upon which it is based will be heard by the jury. He says that holding a joint trial with respect to that count would prejudice or embarrass his client in his defence: cf s 21(2)(a) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).

11The issues surrounding the application to sever count (2), that is the assault of Teegan Jones, are very different. That alleged assault occurred some time earlier. While the timing is not precise the parties agree that the evidence tends to suggest that the incident giving rise to the count (2) occurred at approximately 10:30 pm, that is around 2 ½ hours before the stabbing of the deceased. So it is that Mr Wilson takes objection to all of the evidence of the assault of Teegan Jones and to associated acts of aggression which allegedly occurred at about that time. The statements of the relevant witnesses are provided in the defence bundle. There are various versions of what happened but the prosecution case is that he was angry, that he was yelling at people trying to get them to leave his home, that he threw some chairs about and that he struck Teegan Jones both with his fist and then across the back with a chair. 

12Mr Wilson submits that the evidence of the incident at 10:30 pm is not relevant to the issues to be determined by the jury in respect of the murder charge. Alternatively, he submits that its probative value is not great in terms of proof of the murder charge and any such probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice: s 137 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). 

13It is common ground that if the evidence of the assault on Teegan Jones is inadmissible, the inevitable outcome will be that I would order the severance of count (2). Mr Wilson also submits that, even if the evidence is admissible, the count should be severed from the indictment for much the same reasons that apply to count (3). 

14I have been taken to a number of cases where questions of acts of violence or sexual violence, other than the act charged, have been admitted on the basis that those acts are relevant to, or probative of, issues that arise in respect of the charged act. Some of those cases involve allegations of uncharged sexual acts in cases where the primary allegation is an allegation of sexual assault or similar: see Bull v The Queen (2000) 201 CLR 443; LJW v R [2010] NSWCCA 114, Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277. Other cases involve allegations of violence: see O'Leary v The King (1946) 73 CLR 566; R v Adam (1999) 106 A Crim R 510; TWL v R [2012] NSWCCA 57. 

15It is important to interpolate that the Crown eschews any reliance on the evidence of the assault on Teegan Jones as tendency evidence: cf s 97 Evidence Act. Rather, the Crown submits that the evidence is what is sometimes called ""transactional"" evidence and that, in the present case, it is relevant to Mr Hines' state of mind at the time of the incident that caused the death of Aaron Jones. Mr Wilson submits that if that evidence is admitted, it is inevitable that the jury will engage in some form of tendency reasoning. The Crown Prosecutor conceded that there was some risk of tendency reasoning but that this would apply in any similar case and that it could be cured by careful directions to the jury. 

16The Crown Prosecutor places particular reliance on a series of cases in which other acts have been admitted in order to establish the state of mind of the accused at the relevant time. In particular he relies on the decision of the High Court in O'Leary v The King (supra). In essence, the Crown's position is that the state of mind of the accused at the time he allegedly assaulted Teegan Jones is relevant to the state of mind that he had at the time that Aaron Jones was killed. He says that to understand the actions of the accused at the time of the killing, it is essential for the jury to understand that his conduct at that time was preceded by other violent and aggressive behaviour. 

17He relies on the fact that in O'Leary v The King, the High Court held that evidence of violent acts by the accused earlier during the day was admissible in proof of a charge of murder. However, the case of O'Leary v The King was very different because the issue at the trial was essentially whether the accused was the person who had committed the act causing death. However, there is little doubt that such evidence may also be relevant to the state of mind of the accused: see, for example, LJW v R (supra) and TWL v R (supra).

18The various authorities to which I have been taken establish that conduct of an accused person prior to the critical event is often admissible in order to establish the state of mind at the time of the critical event. A clear example of that principle can be found in the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in TWL v R where it was held that the actions of the accused who had said ""let's go after people and start fights"" was ""directly relevant to the existence of the alleged joint criminal enterprise"" between various people to assault the victim: per MacFarlan JA at [43]. Similar statements of principle, based around the judgments of the High Court in the case of O'Leary v The Queen are to be found elsewhere: see, for example, R v Adam (1999) 106 A Crim R 510 at [27] and [30] and R v Mostyn (2004) 145 A Crim R 304 at [126]-[124].

19Various descriptions are given to this kind of evidence when it is not adduced as tendency evidence. Phrases such as ""transactional"", ""context"" and ""relationship"" evidence are sometimes used. However, such labels ought not to distract from the true question of whether the evidence ""if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of a fact in issue"": s 55 of the Evidence Act. As Callinan J said in Tully v The Queen [2006] HCA 56 230 CLR 234 at [141]:
""It is because the terms 'relationship evidence' and 'background evidence' tend, as does so-called 'contextual evidence', to elude definition, or, equally undesirably, to be referred to by judges and prosecutors imprecisely, that the concepts which these terms are assumed to embrace, need careful examination.""

20On an analysis of the various cases, it is clear that the admissibility or otherwise of such evidence will depend on the particular facts and circumstances of the case. It is critical to identify with some precision the issues to which the evidence is said to be relevant. As I have said, in O'Leary v The King the issue was more about identification than it was about the state of mind of the accused. However in TWL v R the evidence went directly to state of mind and whether the accused had engaged in a joint criminal enterprise with his co-offenders.

21It is clear from the cases that the question is not a question of timing or immediate temporal proximity. Rather, the question is whether there is a relevant connection between the acts which occurred earlier (or indeed later) and the issue to which those acts are directed. Another way that the Crown put the argument is that the actions of the accused (and his state of mind) cannot be sensibly understood if the jury is not made aware of the earlier assault. 

22In the present case there is important evidence that comes from police officers who saw and spoke with the accused between the time of the incident involving Teegan Jones (10:30 pm) and the time of the alleged murder (1:20 am). Mr Wilson relies heavily on that evidence to argue that there is a demonstrated break in the chronology of events, such that the Crown's reliance on the evidence as going to the accused's state of mind must fail. 

23As I have said, Mr Wilson goes so far as to suggest that the evidence is not relevant. The test for relevance is set out in section 55 of the Evidence Act (see above at [19]). I am of the view that the evidence is relevant. Even allowing for the passage of 2 ½ hours between the time of the assault on Teegan Jones and the time of the stabbing incident, it seems to me that the evidence of the accused's behaviour 2 ½ hours earlier is capable of affecting an assessment of what was in his mind when Mr Jones was stabbed. I am of that opinion, even though the evidence of the police officers shows that at around 12:30 pm and 1:10 am the accused was in good spirits and appeared to be calm. 

24However I do accept the submission that the evidence of the police officers reduces - and reduces to a significant degree - the probative force of the evidence. As I have said the incident involving Teegan Jones occurred at around 10:30 pm. The learned Crown Prosecutor very fairly conceded in argument that there is a ""dearth"" of evidence as to the accused's behaviour between 10:30pm and 12:30 am-1:00 am when he had a friendly conversation with the police officers. 

25In terms of the danger of unfair prejudice, Mr Wilson points to the fact that the incident involving Teegan Jones was an incident which took place in the context of a domestic relationship and the introduction of the evidence may require the accused to explore the nature of that relationship in circumstances where such exploration may be prejudicial because there are other matters currently before the Local Court. I gather that these are other allegations of domestic violence. Mr Wilson also points to the fact that Teegan Jones, who is the sister of the deceased and the domestic partner of the accused, is to be the critical witness in the Crown case as to intention in the murder charge. He submits that the jury will be distracted from a proper analysis of her evidence, and the evidence of various other witnesses to the fatal incident, if the jury is at the same time, considering the question of whether she herself was the victim of an assault. That is a submission which goes more to the question of severance than it does to the question of admissibility but it does provide some colour to the suggestion of unfair prejudice. 

26More fundamental to the question of prejudice is the concern that, in spite of direction, the jury will use the evidence to engage in some form of tendency reasoning. In HML v The Queen; SB v The Queen; OAE v The Queen [2008] HCA 16; 235 CLR 334, Hayne J said at [113]:
""The foundation for the rule excluding evidence of other discreditable acts of an accused is that, despite judicial instruction to the contrary, there is a risk that the evidence will be used by the jury in ways that give undue weight to the other acts that are proved.""

His Honour went on at [116]: 
""Secondly, and more fundamentally, the foundation of the general exclusionary rule is that use of the evidence cannot be segregated in the manner suggested. The very risk to which the general rule of exclusion is directed is the risk that the evidence will be misused. Judicial directions about use of such evidence have not hitherto been seen, and should not now be seen, as solving that problem. The possible uses to which evidence of other acts (which does not meet the Pfennig test) may be put are inevitably so intertwined that they cannot be sufficiently disentangled to give useful instructions to the jury. And even if the various uses of such evidence could be disentangled, that would leave unaddressed and unanswered the further difficulty that the jury may attach more significance to the evidence of other acts than they should.""

27In the same case, Gleeson CJ said at [12]:
""The reason for the exclusion is not the irrelevance of propensity, but its prejudicial effect. In this context, prejudice means the danger of improper use of the evidence. It does not mean its legitimate tendency to inculpate. If it did, probative value would be part of prejudicial effect. It is the risk that evidence of propensity will be taken by a jury to prove too much that the law seeks to guard against.""

28There are many similar statements of principle. Mr Wilson relies, for example, on the statement in Phillips v The Queen (2006) 225 CLR 303 (at [79] that:
""Criminal trials in this country are ordinarily focused with high particularity on specified offences. They are not, as such, a trial of the accused's character or propensity towards criminal conduct"". 

He also points me to cases such as Sutton v The Queen (1984) 152 CLR 528 and De Jesus v The Queen (1986) 61 ALJR 1. 

29Another example is found in Tully v The Queen (supra) where Callinan J said (at [146]):
""It is important, in my opinion, that both parties and trial judges pay close attention to any attempt to tender evidence of uncharged acts. If it truly is, as I think it was in Gipp and may have been, if anything, here, propensity evidence, and it is tendered without adverting to its true character as such, the prosecution may obtain the benefit of its prejudicial effect without the disadvantage of the strictures that apply to evidence of that kind.""

30I accept that the evidence sought to be led has a legitimate use beyond mere tendency or propensity reasoning. But the danger that the evidence will be misused is a real one. 

31I have concluded, taking all of these matters into account, that the evidence is relevant but that its probative value is significantly reduced by the evidence of the police officers who spoke to the accused in the 2 ½ hours or so between the relevant events. This is not a case like O'Leary v The King where various acts of violence were relied upon to prove the identity of the culprit. In O'Leary v The King there was evidence of three occasions when the accused had acted violently in the course of what was described as ""a drunken orgy"". The other participants in that drunken orgy had not behaved violently whereas the accused had done so.

32As I have said, the absence of any evidence as to the accused's conduct between the time of the alleged assault on Teegan Jones and the time that the police spoke to the accused makes it difficult to determine that his conduct was continually aggressive throughout that period of time. In fact it is impossible to come to that conclusion. While I accept the learned Crown Prosecutor's submission that admissibility does not turn on there being a continued and unbroken course of conduct, the evidence of the police officers provides a critical gap in the evidence as to the accused's conduct, disposition and state of mind. 

33Having come to the conclusion that the evidence is relevant but that its probative value is not as great as it might otherwise be, it is necessary to weigh the probative value of the evidence against the risk of unfair prejudice. Apart from the inherent risk of unfair prejudice involved in trying together allegations of violence which are independent of each other, there is also the risk that the jury will engage in tendency reasoning in spite of the Crown Prosecutor specifically eschewing any reliance on the evidence to establish a tendency towards violence and the most careful directions in the course of the trial and summing up. While it is generally accepted that juries will follow the directions given by trial judges, the existence of discretions to exclude evidence such as this and the power of the courts to order separate trials shows that that principle cannot be taken too far.

34I also accept Mr Wilson's submission that, in attempting to rebut the suggestion that his state of mind was aggressive for the period from 10:30 pm until 1:10 am, the accused may be forced to provide some explanation for his relationship with Teegan Jones which will disclose that it was other than a loving, caring and peaceful relationship. In that sense the kind of prejudice which arises is relevantly ""unfair"" for the purposes of the application of s 137 of the Evidence Act. 

35I have reached the conclusion that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. Having come to that conclusion, the provision in s 137 is mandatory. It provides that I ""must refuse to admit the evidence adduced by the prosecutor"". 

36Accordingly I find that the evidence of the assault on Teegan Jones and the surrounding acts of violence is inadmissible. Having reached that conclusion it follows that I must make an order severing count (2) from the indictment. I propose to do so.

37I turn then to the issue surrounding count (3) in the indictment. There is no doubt that the evidence of count (3) is admissible in the trial. In fact it forms part of what once was called the res gestae. Mr Wilson concedes as much. He attempted to articulate various bases upon which the conduct of the trial would be unfair if the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm of the child Caylan Jones remained on the indictment. This included the fact that the charges themselves were very different in terms of their seriousness: cf R v Barton [2004] NSWCCA 229. It also included the fact that the victim of count (3), be an 11 year old child, would cause prejudice to the accused. 

38To determine this question I must apply the provision of s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act and consider whether the accused will be ""prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the indictment"".

39The Crown Prosecutor very fairly raised the fact that he would be relying on ""recklessness"" to prove the mens rea for the assault charge in count (3). He asked me to consider whether the different mental elements may give rise to prejudice. That could be a matter of concern if it were to be contended by the Crown that the mens rea in respect of count (1) (the murder charge) involved a consideration of reckless indifference to human life. If that were the Crown case, the jury would be confronted with two different definitions of recklessness. However that is not the Crown case. The Crown case is that the accused acted either with an intention to kill or an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm.

40In those circumstances no confusion will arise in the mind of the jury by introducing the concept of recklessness in the context of the assault charge.

41The witnesses to the two offences are the same. The acts giving rise to those two offences took place within seconds of one another. In my view, it is clearly a case that ordinarily would be determined by way of a joint trial. I am unable to discern any relevant embarrassment or prejudice in the conduct of the accused's defence to either the assault charge or the murder charge. Accordingly I can see no basis upon which I could conclude that s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act requires an order to sever count (3). 

42For those reasons, I make the following orders: -
(1)Count (2) is to be severed from the indictment and there is to be a separate trial in respect of that count.

(2)The evidence of the events giving rise to the allegation in count (2) is excluded. 

(3)The application for severance of count (3) is refused.

		28 July 2014",2014-06-03 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705015,Police v DH [2014] NSWChC 3,"Judgment

Brief Background

1Around 9pm on Christmas Eve, 2013, the accused young person, aged 17, was with a male companion in a parked car at a park located beside the Shoalhaven River at North Nowra. It was dark and they were the only persons in the car park.

2Police (Sgt D and S/C B) were patrolling the area and had decided to carry out a check of the park due to prior intelligence involving illicit drug use in the park.

3The police saw the parked car and decided to investigate. I do not propose to go into detail about the events that followed, as this may become the subject of subsequent proceedings. For present purposes, it is sufficient to record that the accused young person and her companion were not involved in any wrongdoing in the vehicle. Words were exchanged between the police and the occupants of the vehicle, and this resulted in both the young person and her companion being searched and arrested. Nothing of an illegal nature was detected during the search of the persons or the vehicle. Both were taken back to the police station, and the young person was charged with the three charges currently before the Court, namely, assault police, hinder police and resist police.

4These charges attracted a plea of not guilty and are listed for hearing before the Nowra Children's Court in July 2014.

The subpoena

5Mr Robinson, solicitor for the young person, has issued a subpoena requiring the NSW Police to produce, inter alia:
""(h) all complaints made whether in writing or in any other way (telephone, personal attendance etc) which have been noted or recorded in any document, together with any annexures for such complaints, in relation to Sgt [D] and / or S/C [B] to the Superintendent, Shoalhaven Area Command, for the Commissioner or any other member of the NSW Police Force in the period 1 January 2012 to 1 March 2014"".

Application to set subpoena aside

6The Crown Solicitor's Office, acting on behalf of the Commissioner of Police, has filed an application to set aside this paragraph of the subpoena. The basis of the application was two fold and is contained in a letter from the Crown Solicitor's Office dated 7 May 2014, which states ""[the Commissioner] objects to paragraph (h) of the subpoena on the grounds that it lacks a legitimate forensic purpose and pursuant to s 170 of the Police Act...."" 

7The application to set aside paragraph (h) was contested and was listed for hearing at the Nowra Children's Court on 29 May 2014. Mr Chrysostomou was briefed to appear on behalf of the Crown Solicitor's Office and Mr Boland was briefed by Mr Robinson to appear on behalf of the accused young person.

8Prior to the hearing the parties held discussions with the aim of resolving the issues pertaining to the subpoena. These were not successful, but Mr Chrysostomou informed the Court that if the scope of the subpoena was narrowed to seek production of material concerning the two named officers limited to sustained complaints of dishonesty or use of excessive force, then the objection to the subpoena would not be maintained.

9Mr Boland indicated that the defence were not willing to accept this offer, as they were in possession of information that would suggest the existence of material that would be relevant and would fall outside such a narrowing of the subpoena.

10The hearing of the application to set aside the subpoena then proceeded with both parties making submissions, including written submissions by Mr Boland.

Claim for privilege - section 170 of the Police Act

11It is convenient to deal with the second of the grounds contained in the Crown Solicitor's letter, namely that the documents sought to be produced under the subpoena were privileged in accordance with s 170 of the Police Act. Mr Boland submitted in his written submissions that the section has no application to the material sought under the subject subpoena, because what was sought in the subpoena was ""all complaints made...."", a class of documents specifically excluded by s 170(2)(a).

12Section 170 provides: (with emphasis added)
170 Certain documents privileged 
(1) A document brought into existence for the purposes of this Part is not admissible in evidence in any proceedings other than proceedings: 
(a) that concern the conduct of police officers, and 
(b) that are dealt with by the Commissioner, by the Industrial Relations Commission or by the Supreme Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction to review administrative action. 

(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to or in respect of: 
(a) a document comprising a complaint, or 
(b) a document published by order of, or under the authority of, the Presiding Officer of a House of Parliament or either House, or both Houses, of Parliament, or 
(c) a document that a witness is willing to produce. 

(3) Subsections (1) and (2) do not operate to render admissible in evidence in any proceedings any document that would not have been so admissible if this section had not been enacted.

13Mr Chrysostomou did not challenge this submission.

14In respect of this ground, I am satisfied that having regard to the precise terms of the subpoena, in seeking the production of ""all complaints made whether in writing or in any other way"", that the privilege provided by s 170 has no application to the ""complaints"" material covered by the subpoena.

Legitimate forensic purpose

15This leaves the remaining ground relied on by the Crown Solicitor, namely that there is a lack of a legitimate forensic purpose in seeking the material, that is, that the subpoena is a mere fishing expedition.

16In relation to the legitimate forensic purpose relied up on behalf of the accused young person, Mr Boland submits that in respect to the current proceedings, there are two such purposes, and he set these out in his written submissions as follows:
""In broad terms, inspection of the complaint material is submitted to be necessary for the [young person] to give proper consideration to:
(a)The ""credit"" of the prosecution witnesses making the criminal accusations against her.
(b)The ""tendency"" of prosecution witnesses, together or individually, to engage in acts of unlawful or otherwise improper violence while purportedly in the execution of their duty.""

Credit of witnesses

17In relation to the question of reliance on subpoena material to attack the credit of prosecution witnesses, Mr Chrysostomou submitted that the scope of the subpoena was too wide, and relied on the decision of Liristis v Gadelrabb [2009] NSWSC 441. In that case Brereton J said, in paragraph 5:
""...one of the fundamental distinctions between the processes of subpoenas for production and discovery is that subpoenas, unlike discovery, may be used to obtain documents relevant only to questions of credit, for the purpose of assisting cross-examination as to credit. It is true that in Fried v National Australia Bank (2000) 175 ALR 194, Weinberg J in the Federal Court of Australia said that it was inappropriate to permit a subpoena to stand which does little more than to trawl for documents that may be used to impugn the credit of a particular witness. I do not disagree with that observation, but that is not to say that it is inappropriate to permit a subpoena to stand that seeks documents that may be used to impugn the credit of a particular witness, as distinct from merely trawling for such documents. The concept of ""trawling"" in this context is the same as that of ""fishing"". It is not fishing to seek documents when there are reasonable grounds to think that fish of the relevant type are in the pond or, as has been expressed in other cases, that it is ""on the cards"" that relevant documents (even if they are relevant only to credit) will be elicited by the subpoena"".

18Mr Chrysostomou submitted that the terms of the subpoena in the subject proceedings are too wide, that they amount to a fishing expedition, by using the words ""all complaints"". He submitted that it would be more appropriate if the subpoena was limited to ""all sustained complaints relating to the use of excessive force"". He submitted, as I understand his submissions, that having regard to the amount of police activity in carrying out their duties generally on a daily basis, it is not ""on the cards"" that a subpoena framed in the terms of the subject subpoena would capture only material relevant to the forensic purpose relied upon by the accused young person, and accordingly the subpoena, as framed, is too wide and amounts to a fishing expedition in respect of other matters.

Tendency evidence

19In relation to the second forensic purpose identified by Mr Boland in his submissions, that is ""the tendency of prosecution witnesses, together or individually, to engage in acts of unlawful or otherwise improper violence while purportedly in the execution of their duty"", Mr Chrysostomou submits that in seeking to rely on tendency evidence, it is necessary for the accused young person to establish the threshold question of probity, having regard to the provisions of s 97(1)(b) of the Evidence Act.

20The relevant parts of that section provides:
Section 97 The tendency rule 
(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless: 
(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and 
(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 

21Finally Mr Chrysostomou submitted that if the defence is aware of specific instances, then the subpoena should be narrowed to include such specific instances, and in relation to the fishing metaphor, the defence should use a fishing rod and not a net. He submits, in applying the decision in Attorney General for NSW v Dylan Chidgey [2008] NSWCCA 65, that the defence have not shown that it is ""on the cards"" that the documents will materially assist the defence. Mr Chrysostomou submitted that it is only suspicion and conjecture that the material sought will materially assist the defence, and accordingly, the subpoena is too wide and should be set aside, or should be fine tuned and can be narrowed as indicated above.

22In his written and oral submissions, Mr Boland for the accused young person, submitted that the credit of the two police officers involved in these proceedings will be central to the defence case. He said that the case involves two kids doing nothing wrong, there were no drugs or other criminal activity, however they were pulled out of their vehicle and assaulted by the police. Mr Boland gave the Court details of some recent information that had come to the attention of the defence in relation to the unlawful activities of one of the police officers involved, and that this increases the likelihood that it is ""on the cards"" that the subpoena will unearth material that will materially assist the defence.

23In relation to Mr Chrysostomou's submission concerning the issue of tendency, that it is necessary for the accused young person to establish the threshold question of probity, having regard to the provisions of s 97(1)(b) of the Evidence Act, Mr Boland submits that this submission is wrong. Mr Boland submits that in relation to documents being sought under subpoena, that the test is set out in Alistair v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 404, namely that it is ""on the cards"" that the documents will materially assist the defence, and that the Evidence Act has no application.

24I accept Mr Boland's submission in this regard, and I find that at the current pre-trial stage of the proceedings, when considering issues relating to the production of material under subpoena, the provisions of s 97 of the Evidence Act have no relevance or application.

The Law

25Mr Boland submitted, relying on the decision in Waind v Hill and National Employer's Mutual General Association Ltd [1978] 1NSWLR 372, that the handling of documents pursuant to a subpoena was a three step process, the first being obedience to the subpoena and bringing the documents to the court. There is no need to further explore this issue, because Mr Chrysostomou has produced the documents, on behalf of the NSW Police Force, to the Court. In this regard, four bundles have been received by the Court, namely a redacted and an un-redacted bundle in relation to each named police officer. The redacted bundle contains a copy of the documents with the names of complainants etc being edited out.

26Mr Boland's written submission correctly sets out the relevant law in relation to the need to establish a legitimate forensic purpose for the production of material under subpoena. Mr Chrysostomou did not challenge the correctness of Mr Boland's submissions in this regard.

27It is convenient to reproduce Mr Boland's written submissions in relation to the Law relating to Legitimate Forensic Purpose:
In Attorney General for NSW v Dylan Chidgey [2008] NSWCCA 65, Beazley JA (with James J and Kirby J agreeing) stated at [80]: 
""This Court has already stated what the test is and in my opinion, should continue to apply that test in accordance with the language used in the form in which it has stood since Alister v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 404 (at 414) and R v Saleam (1999) 16 NSWLR 14.""

The relevant passage of Gibbs CJ in Alister is extracted at [68] of Chidgey as follows:
""Just as in the balancing process the scales must swing in favour of discovery if the documents are necessary to support the defence of an accused person whose liberty is at stake in a criminal trial, so, in considering whether to inspect documents for the purpose of deciding whether they should be disclosed the court must attach special weight to the fact that the documents may support the defence of an accused person in criminal proceedings. Although a mere 'fishing' expedition can never be allowed it may be enough that it appears to be 'on the cards' that the documents will materially assist the defence.""

At [64] of Chidgey, Beazley JA approved the test articulated in R v Saleam [1999] NSWCCA 86:
""The test for determining whether a party is required to produce documents pursuant to a subpoena was stated by Simpson J (Spigelman CJ and Studdert J agreeing) in Regina v Saleam [1999] NSWCCA 86 at [11], in the following terms:
""The principles governing applications [for an order that documents not be produced] are no different from those governing applications for access to documents produced in answer to a subpoena. Before access is granted (or an order to produce made) the applicant must (i) identify a legitimate forensic purpose for which access is sought; (ii) establish that it is 'on the cards' that the documents will materially assist his case. So much was established in earlier proceedings brought by this applicant: R v Saleam (1989) 16 NSWLR 14, per Hunt CJ at CL; see also R v Ali Tastan (1994) 75 A Crim R 498 per Barr AJ, as he then was"".

Beazley JA also observed at [70] of Chidgey:
""The Attorney General indicated that Simpson J's formulation in R v Saleam [1999] represented the commencement of a line of authority in which the test for the production of, or access to, documents, was specifically stated as comprising two steps: a legitimate forensic purpose and that it was ""on the cards"" that the documents would materially assist the case. However, in stating the test in this specific ""two step"" way, her Honour did not state any new principle. As I have already stated at [64], in the authorities that preceded R v Saleam [1999], including Alister, the courts, in determining whether access would be granted to documents sought on subpoena, have always applied a test that involves determining whether each of the factors identified by Simpson J have been established"".

Subpoena too wide - fishing expedition 

28In response to the assertion that the subpoena in this case is drafted to wide, Mr Boland submitted it has been deliberately limited in its scope and as such is not too wide nor is it a fishing expedition. The subpoena is limited to legitimate unprivileged complaints by members of the community regarding unlawful or improper conduct; the subpoena is addressed specifically to the Commissioner and not to the Ombudsman or the Police Integrity Commission.

29The Court notes the limited time period covered by the subpoena, namely the period 1 January 2012 to 1 March 2014.

Adjudication

30It is conceded that the Prosecution case will depend entirely on the evidence of Sgt D and Sen Const B. During the submissions made in relation to the subpoena in this case, the Court has been provided with a copy of the statements of these two witnesses.

31The defence case will be that the accused young person was doing nothing wrong and was not committing any offence when she was confronted by the police on this night, removed from her vehicle and eventually arrested and charged by the police. 

32The defence contend that the police officers, or at least one of them, has a certain reputation - the details of which are set out on pages 8 and 9 of Mr Boland's written submissions, and I do not intend to repeat them here.

33I am satisfied, having regard to the circumstances of this case, as set out above, and also having regard to the written submissions of Mr Boland, all of which have not been incorporated into this judgment (the submissions are on file), that the defence have established that there is a legitimate forensic purpose in seeking the documents set out in the subpoena. If such documents exist, they may enable the defence, in the context of the circumstances of this case, to test the credibility of the two prosecution witnesses, including perhaps demonstrating a tendency of these police to in engage in overzealous or otherwise unlawful conduct while purportedly in the execution of their duty as police officers. I am also satisfied that it is ""on the cards"" that the documents sought under the subpoena, if they exist, will materially assist the defence case, having particular regard to the circumstances of the prosecution case.

34I find that paragraph (h) of the subpoena in this case is not too wide and does not amount to a fishing expedition; that a legitimate forensic purpose has been demonstrated, and that it is on the cards that the document will materially assist the defence case. Accordingly the application to set aside the subpoena is dismissed.

35Having made this finding, I have approached the second step in the procedure set out in Waind, namely the use to be made of the documents that have been produced to the court under the subpoena, namely whether to allow inspection of the documents by the defence in this case. 

36I have had the opportunity to inspect the documents that have been produced, and I have come to the conclusion, without having read the documents but noting the nature of the editing or redactions, that it is appropriate that the redacted versions of the documents relating to each of the police officers named in the subpoena be made available for inspection by the defence. If there is a need, which I doubt, for the un-redacted versions to be made available for inspection by the defence, then an application in that regard can be made to the Court.

2705017,Ferris v Atherton [2014] NSWDC 272,"Judgment


	
	This is an appeal which requires me to unravel what happened in the Local Court.
	
	
	The learned magistrate was wanting to deal with the case with appropriate expedition and fairness and in accordance with the guidelines which are provided. But it seems to me, with respect, that the case went off the rails at one stage. The question for me remains whether I should nevertheless allow the appeal.
	
	
	I should start at the beginning. Peter Ferris and Jed Atherton were both involved in the Parramatta Basketball Association. They had a serious falling-out. Mr Ferris approached the Local Court and issued an application for an apprehended personal violence order. That application was issued under the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007. Once that application was issued, Local Court Practice Note Number 2 of 2012 applied to the preparation and conduct of the case. I will come back to that practice note.
	
	
	The case came on before her Honour Magistrate Stapleton sitting in the Downing Centre on 28 October 2013. The primary decision appealed against is recorded at T 23 of the transcript (which became exhibit A in the appeal before me). There her Honour ordered that the proceedings be dismissed pursuant to Local Court Rule 4.4, on the ground that there was no reasonable prospect of success.
	
	
	Mr Ferris was the applicant and was represented by Mr S Brennan of counsel before her Honour and before me today in the appeal. Mr B Rosic of counsel appeared for Mr Atherton before her Honour and again before me today.
	
	
	I earlier referred to the case going off the rails. By that I mean that the basis upon which her Honour dismissed the proceedings, namely Local Court Rule 4.4, was in my respectful opinion misconceived. As Mr Brennan pointed out, the part in which Rule 4.4 of the Local Court Rules 2009 appears does not apply to “proceedings commenced under the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007”: see Rule 4.1. Her Honour also made reference to the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules - specifically UCPR 13.1. But that seems to me to be, with respect, an error and the reference should have been to UCPR 13.4. Indeed, in her reasons her Honour quoted (at T21.19) what appears to be an extract from UCPR 13.4(1)(b).
	
	
	I enquired of Mr Rosic how her Honour could determine the case by reference to the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules. Mr Rosic took me to s 86(2) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act which provides that “the Rules made for the purposes of this Act may adopt, with or without modification, the provisions of any Rules made under the Civil Procedure Act 2005.” Mr Rosic’s argument is that her Honour had adopted UCPR 13. However s 86(2) does not provide for a judicial officer to adopt the rules but for “The Rules” themselves - which are made under the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 - to adopt any Civil Procedure Act rules. Mr Rosic was not able to take me to any such rule which provided for an adoption of UCPR 13. No doubt that is because it does not exist.
	
	
	Because her Honour was determining the case by reference to notions of summary dismissal she made references to “taking the plaintiff’s case at its highest”: see T 21.40. Her Honour further said that it is “no light decision to summarily dismiss a matter on the day on which it was fixed for hearing”: see T23.07.
	
	
	I engaged Mr Brennan and Mr Rosic in the hearing of this appeal in a good deal of discussion about just what had occurred before her Honour. It appeared clear to me that, for the reasons I have just given, her Honour did not have the power to act under either the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules or Pt 4 of the Local Court Rules.
	
	
	It is relevant to make an observation about an aspect of the case at this point. In the statement of Mr Ferris he said the basis for his application was a telephone call. Threatening words were used to him in that call. There seems to be no issue that the words were indeed threatening. In his statement, which was exhibit 1 before her Honour and which became part of exhibit 1 before me, Mr Ferris said that he “recognised the voice as Jed Atherton’s”. That is significant because one of the conclusions of her Honour (at T23.15) was that there was “no basis upon which I can judge the strengths of the voice identification by the applicant.” Her Honour added that the content of the conversation did not assist either. I take that to be a reference to Mr Ferris’ account that he referred to “Jed”. There appeared to be no acknowledgment or acceptance by the caller that he was Jed, but nor was there any challenge by the caller to being addressed as Jed.
	
	
	It is now appropriate to return to Local Court Practice Note Number 2 of 2012. It was issued by his Honour the Chief Magistrate on 24 April 2012 and has since been amended. Clause 6.2 of the Practice Note provides that “unless the Court otherwise orders, a witness’ evidence in chief at a hearing must be given by written statement”. Clause 6.3 provides for the Court giving directions about service of such statements, being statements “of the oral evidence that the party intends to adduce in chief on any question of fact to be decided at a hearing”. Clause 6.6 provides for a significant consequence of the statements being served. The statement “is to stand as the whole” of the witness’ “evidence in chief” and “the party may not adduce from that person any further evidence in chief” except by leave of the Court. When the proceedings are first before the Court for directions, a timetable is given to the parties which provides for service of the statements and emphasises at the foot that it is “important to comply with the above timetable. If statements are not exchanged prior the hearing date, it will be necessary to seek leave of the Court to give oral evidence.”
	
	
	Returning to the voice identification question, her Honour was alert to the significance of such evidence early in the proceedings. Over T3-4 there is discussion about voice recognition evidence. Her Honour also indicates (at T4) that she is aware of disposing of the case efficiently so that it does not “take more time than is strictly necessary”. Her Honour makes reference to the appropriate factors which are relevant to that observation. Her Honour then observes that the “case will be conducted strictly in accordance with the Practice Note in terms of evidence-in-chief and the like”. Her Honour then adjourned for a period of time.
	
	
	When her Honour returned, Mr Brennan tendered two exhibits, namely, the statement of his client, Peter Ferris, and a statement by his client’s wife, Catherine Ferris. The transcript then notes (at T8.40) that there was discussion as to witnesses to be called. Mr Brennan called his client “to give some additional evidence, that is about the calls made after the date of the date for filing”. Mr Rosic objected because he had no notice of it. There was some discussion about the nature of the evidence. Her Honour had observed after Mr Rosic’s application, in accordance with her earlier indication, that “the Practice Note permits such evidence to be called with leave”. She heard the parties and then determined to “refuse the application on the basis that there has been no notice given to the defendant of this further allegation, notwithstanding that it was in the applicant’s case that these two further phone calls were made.” The reference is to telephone calls after those referred to in the statements.
	
	
	Her Honour then asked Mr Brennan whether there was any further documentary evidence to tender and Mr Brennan answered, “No, there’s no more documentary evidence.”
	
	
	Mr Rosic then indicated that he wanted to approach the case “firstly by tendering some material and making a no cause of action submission”. That submission was with respect misconceived and it seems to me led her Honour into the error to do with the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules and the Local Court Rules. Mr Rosic went into evidence by tendering further exhibits which comprised, amongst other things, the telephone records. In effect, they demonstrated that his client’s telephone showed no record of a call to Mr Ferris and the number from which the offending calls originated was that of a stranger. Again, Mr Rosic indicated (at T16) his “submission is that there is no cause of action”.
	
	
	Her Honour then heard argument based upon the assumption that she was entering into the determination of a case where it was claimed that there was no reasonable cause of action. Nevertheless her Honour indicated that she took Mr Ferris’ “case at its highest”. Her Honour then made the ruling which is the subject of the challenge about which I have heard argument.
	
	
	Mr Brennan complains that he was given no opportunity to supplement the evidence of his client. He might have called evidence to the effect that his client still entertained some apprehension of violence. He probably would have called evidence to supplement his client’s assertion that he recognised the voice of Mr Atherton. I can understand Mr Brennan’s sense of grievance. Matters proceeded fairly quickly and, as I have said, they were proceeding according to the wrong legal parameters.
	
	
	For reasons which I now give, I am of the opinion that I should dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	It seems to me that what in effect her Honour determined was the hearing of the case. The Practice Note envisages that these cases are to be conducted on the papers, so to speak. Any oral evidence is to be the subject of a leave application. It obviously puts pressure on the applicant to make sure that their case is complete before hearing in case they fail to obtain leave to supplement their statements.
	
	
	Procedurally, it seems to me that her Honour was aware of the significance of the Practice Note. Her Honour heard an application to supplement the evidence and dismissed it. There would have been an opportunity for Mr Brennan to ask that the evidence be supplemented in a way additional to the way that he asked for. He was on notice of the issue about voice identification. Having said that, I can understand, as he now points out, that matters moved fairly quickly and according to the wrong legal parameters as I have said.
	
	
	In hearing the case again on the material before her Honour, as I do, and determining it as a final hearing, I would reach the same conclusion as her Honour did. There was an assertion by Mr Ferris that he had recognised the voice, but no basis laid for that assertion. The test is on the balance of probabilities. It may not have taken much more evidence to tip the scales in favour of Mr Ferris, but to my mind he has not convinced me on the balance that it was Mr Atherton. There was also the evidence tendered on behalf of Mr Atherton about his phone and the phone from which the calls were made. That I take into account as well in reaching the opinion that I do.
	
	
	In other words, taking the evidence as complete, as I think her Honour did, but applying the test provided by s 19 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that an apprehended personal violence order ought to be made against Mr Atherton.
	
	
	For those reasons I propose to dismiss the appeal.

		20 February 2015",2014-05-26 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705019,Ferris v Atherton (No 2) [2014] NSWDC 273,"Judgment


	
	I now turn to the question of the costs of the appeal which I have just dealt with. Mr Brennan is also appealing against her Honour’s order that his client pay Mr Atherton his costs as agreed or assessed.
	
	
	There is a preliminary issue about the test which should be applied. In my judgment in Mahmoud v Sutherland [2013] NSWDC 140, I referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Mahmoud v Sutherland [2012] NSWCA 306. The reason I referred to the Court of Appeal’s decision was that the Court of Appeal in that case, which involved an application for a apprehended personal violence order, determined the question of costs in accordance with s 99(3) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007. The test applied by their Honours in that case would require me not to award costs against Mr Ferris “unless satisfied that the application was frivolous or vexatious”.
	
	
	For reasons which I set out in my judgment in Mahmoud v Sutherland, I respectfully suggested that the Court of Appeal had overlooked the significance of the word “domestic” in s 99(3) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act. But, in accordance with precedent, I am obliged to follow the Court of Appeal’s decision.
	
	
	Mr Rosic urges me to conclude that the application by Mr Ferris was both frivolous and vexatious. He argues that it was vexatious because it was motivated by other litigation not directly connected with these proceedings. The other litigation concerned an industrial issue. Mr Brennan argues that such an alleged motive was never aired nor had his client had any opportunity to refute it. I think Mr Brennan is right in that regard. I do not regard the application as being vexatious.
	
	
	Mr Rosic took me to the judgment of Button J in Cunningham v Cunningham [2012] NSWSC 849 where his Honour helpfully considered the meaning of “frivolous or vexatious” at [63]. Mr Rosic particularly relied upon the reference to a matter being “without substance”. I do not regard Mr Ferris’ application as being frivolous. The full expression quoted by Button J was “without substance or groundless or fanciful”.
	
	
	Mr Ferris put on evidence in the form of statements by him and his wife to the effect that these calls had been made. For reasons that I have given, I did not accept, on the balance of probabilities, that the caller could be shown to be Mr Atherton. However, in my opinion, the application was far from being without substance or groundless or fanciful. The evidence was there before her Honour and before me. A determination was made - based on its weight and persuasiveness - against Mr Ferris.
	
	
	In the event that I am wrong about the test being whether or not the application was frivolous or vexatious I would determine it in accordance with s 99(2) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act “in accordance with Division 4 of Part 2 of Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986”. Counsel agree that the relevant provision is s 213(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act which provides that a “court may at the end of summary proceedings order that the prosecutor pay professional costs to the registrar of the court for payment to the accused person if the matter is dismissed or withdrawn”. The “amount of professional costs is to be the amount that the Magistrate considers to be just and reasonable”.
	
	
	Whether or not I make an order is a matter for my discretion. Guidance can be obtained from the High Court’s decision in Latoudis v Casey (1990) 170 CLR 534. The Court of Appeal considered that case in Ohn v Walton (1995) 36 NSWLR 77. Gleeson CJ observed (at 79) that the “point of Latoudis v Casey is that the purpose of an order for costs is to indemnify or compensate the person in whose favour it is made, not to punish the person against whom it is made”. His Honour went on to observe that when “legislation confers a power to order costs it is, in the absence of any contrary indication, to be understood as conferring a power to be exercised for that purpose”. His Honour went on to say the following -
	


“Two things follow:

“1. The usual rationale of making a costs order is that it is just and reasonable that the successful party should be reimbursed for costs incurred, in the absence of grounds connected with the charge or the conduct of the proceedings which make it unjust or unreasonable that there should be such reimbursement.

2. The test of whether an order for costs should be made against an unsuccessful plaintiff or complainant, is not whether he or she has done anything to warrant punishment. It is whether, in the circumstances, the defendant or respondent should be compensated”.

I respectfully adopt those observations in approaching the decision in this case.


	
	Mr Brennan points out, following from my earlier judgment, that her Honour misconceived the test which her Honour was to apply. I think that there is some force in that argument. As I observed, the case was not determined in accordance with the appropriate legal parameters. Mr Brennan in addition argued that his client was not heard. I think there is less force in that argument because his client had an opportunity to be heard. As I earlier observed, I think - because of the haste of the proceedings - that it may have been overlooked that a point should have been taken about the sufficiency of proof identifying the caller. Mr Brennan pointed out that his client, when he took out the application, was unrepresented. Mr Brennan had come into the case at a later stage.
	
	
	Mr Rosic, on the other hand, pointed out that his client was successful. It was obvious from the evidence that identification was a central issue. Leave was sought and refused. Mr Ferris ought to have complied with the Practice Note and the Rules. Her Honour made a similar observation.
	
	
	As to Mr Brennan’s point about the incorrect legal parameters along which the case proceeded, he pointed out that the outcome was correct and it did not matter so much that her Honour was not assisted by reference to the correct test.
	
	
	There was, indeed, non-compliance with the Practice Note. That has been a significant basis of my decision. On the other hand, there was some misapprehension about the impact of the Practice Note. I need to take into account that Mr Ferris was unrepresented at the earlier stages. I need also to take into account the fact that Mr Ferris made use of the legislation because of his apprehension that he might be exposed to personal violence. The Act is available for use by members of the public to deal with such an apprehension. Section 10 of the Act points out that its object “is to ensure the safety and protection of all persons who experience personal violence outside a domestic relationship”. It emphasises that it is a means ensuring that access to courts “is a safe, speedy, inexpensive and simple as is consistent with justice”.
	
	
	I need to take into account on the other hand that Mr Atherton has been brought to Court and needed to be represented in these proceedings which ultimately proved unsuccessful.
	
	
	Weighing these matters up, it seems to me that Mr Ferris should bear some part of the costs of Mr Atherton. He has brought him to Court and required him to defend the application. On the other hand Mr Ferris has made use of legislation designed to assist with his sense of personal security. As it turned out, the proceedings were not “inexpensive and simple” as is consistent with justice. Her Honour was not assisted as much as she could have been by Mr Rosic on behalf of Mr Atherton. Although Mr Atherton has been ultimately successful, I do not think he should be compensated 100% for his costs.
	
	
	In the circumstances I propose to make an order similar to the one which her Honour made and which her Honour said that the Court of Appeal had regarded as appropriate in Garde v Dowd [2011] NSWCA115, but adapted to reflect my opinion about the extent to which Mr Ferris should pay Mr Atherton’s costs.
	
	
	My order is that Mr Ferris pay one third of Mr Atherton’s costs as agreed or assessed.
	


HIS HONOUR: Anybody seeking a costs order or anything for today? Anything else?

BRENNAN: I won’t trouble the Court with submissions, but I think I should seek it, having largely succeeded. I think it’s inherent of the structure what your Honour just said, but that order to pay a third is only if it goes to the Court of Appeal and--

HIS HONOUR: Well I’ve said that if the correct test is, as the Court of Appeal said, frivolous and vexatious then you have succeeded. I’m sorry, you are quite right--

BRENNAN: Just to make it clear that that’s provisional.

HIS HONOUR: No, thank you, you are quite right, Mr Brennan, I will revise what I have said.


	
	I just made an order. I withdraw that order, because of what Mr Brennan has just said. I overlooked the fact that I was considering this way of determining the costs question only in the event that I am wrong on the test being frivolous and vexatious. For the reasons that I have given, were I to determine the costs in the alternative way proposed I would order that Mr Ferris pay one third of Mr Atherton’s costs as agreed or assessed.
	


So that is an opinion rather than order.


	
	The order is that Mr Atherton’s application for Mr Ferris to pay his costs is refused.
	


HIS HONOUR: I think that’s right isn’t it?

ROSIC: It is, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, because I have refused it on the primary test, but if I am wrong then I have indicated what my position would be. Anything else?

BRENNAN: I do apply for costs for today, your Honour.

ROSIC: So do we then. The appeal was dismissed, an order wasn’t made so we’ve been wholly successful in respect of that.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, but I think each party should pay their own costs.

ROSIC: May it please the Court.


	
	Finally, each party is to pay their own costs of this appeal.

		19 February 2015",2014-05-26 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705022,Sinkovich v R [2014] NSWCCA 97,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  The background and circumstances of this case sufficiently appear from the judgment of R A Hulme J.  There are three factors which lead me to conclude that a lesser sentence is warranted.
2First, whilst the categorisation of the objective seriousness of the offending as ""slightly above the midrange"" for that offence may be accepted, it is infected with the inevitable imprecision of such terminology.  Thus, that phraseology may be apt to describe an offence which is above ""the mid-range"" narrowly defined, but within ""the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" more broadly defined.  How the trial judge (Conlon DCJ) intended it is not known, although the use of the term ""midrange"" might indicate the narrower approach.
3Secondly, because the standard non-parole period is a guidepost without specific or determinative consequences, it is appropriate to consider how it relates to the maximum penalty, being another relevant guidepost.  It has been commented upon over several years that there is no clear pattern between the standard non-parole periods and maximum penalties identified in the table following s 54D of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"").  Thus, applying the relationship between non-parole period and balance of term identified in s 44(2), the standard non-parole period of 10 years would be accompanied (absent special circumstances) by a balance of term not exceeding three years four months.  Such a sentence would be two-thirds of the maximum penalty available.  If the offence were thought not to merit a sentence which involved such a high proportion of the maximum penalty available, the weight to be given to the standard non-parole period should be diminished.  In the present case, that factor was of significance: the applicant was facing his first period of incarceration and a criminal record involving only fines, the most recent of which pre-dated the present offending by more than 30 years.
4Thirdly, the trial judge, noting that the applicant was 54 years of age and would be serving his first custodial sentence, made a finding of special circumstances permitting him to exceed the statutory proportion of the non-parole period specified in s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act.  There was no challenge to that finding.  It was an appropriate one in this case.
5Bearing in mind these considerations, and the matters referred to more generally by RA Hulme J, I agree with the orders he proposes.
6FULLERTON J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
7R A HULME J:  This appeal arises from a referral to the Court by Latham J on 18 December 2013 pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).
8On 6 July 2009 the appellant was found guilty by a jury of two offences:
Count 1: Knowingly take part in supply of methylamphetamine at Minto on 12 June 2008
Count 2: Supply not less than commercial quantity of methylamphetamine at Minto between 29 June and 5 July 2008.
9Count 1 is contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) for which there is prescribed a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units.  Count 2 is an offence contrary to s 25(2) and the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years and/or a fine of 3500 penalty units.  The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) also prescribes a standard non-parole period in respect of the offence in count 2 of 10 years.
10On 6 November 2009 his Honour Judge Conlon SC passed sentence as follows:
Count 1: Imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 4 July 2008.
Count 2: Imprisonment for 13 years with a non-parole period of 9 years commencing 4 July 2009.
11The total effective sentence is one of 14 years with a minimum custodial component of 10 years.  The appellant will become eligible for release on parole on 3 July 2018.
Facts
12The appellant appealed against the severity of his sentences to this Court but the appeal was dismissed:  Sinkovich v R [2011] NSWCCA 90.  The principal judgment was written by Hoeben J (as his Honour then was).  The facts of the appellant's offences were described in his Honour's judgment at [7]-[14].  Briefly they were that on 12 June 2008 the appellant drove a co-offender, David Lowe, to a location where Lowe met with a police undercover operative and supplied to him 27.2 grams of methylamphetamine in exchange for $2700.  That offence constituted count one.  
13There were subsequent supplies by Lowe to the undercover operative and negotiations for the supply of a larger amount referred to as an ""elbow"" (a pound of methylamphetamine).  They culminated on 4 July 2008 when Lowe and another person again met with the undercover operative and supplied to him 443.8 grams of methylamphetamine in exchange for $32,000.  This is the offence that constituted count two.  Arrests were effected shortly after.  
14Telephone intercept material that was before the sentencing judge indicated that the appellant organised the acquisition of the drugs to on-supply to Lowe.  In one of the intercepted conversations there was reference by Lowe to the appellant as being ""the boss"".  Such material persuaded the sentencing judge that the appellant and Lowe were in the business of drug trafficking and that the appellant ""was slightly above Lowe in the hierarchy"".
Findings on sentence
15The learned sentencing judge made a number of findings which merit reference at this point.  His Honour found:
Lowe was substantially involved in drug trafficking and the appellant had a similar involvement.
The offence in count 1 fell within the ""mid-range for offences of this type"".
The offender was an integral part of the supply, allowing Lowe to conduct the actual transaction.
 The offence in count 2 ""falls slightly above the mid-range"".
The appellant did not have any significant history of criminal offending.  
He had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation although he had not shown any remorse.
Subjective circumstances
16The appellant was aged 54 at the time of sentencing.  The judge referred to him having ""only a minor criminal record"".  He had a history of employment until he was required to cease business in order to pay costs associated with a marriage breakdown.
17In 2003 he had become the sole carer of his four children after his wife developed a serious mental illness and the Department of Community Services removed the child from her care.  At the time of the offences the appellant was receiving a parenting payment.  
18The appellant's youngest two children, who were then aged 10 and 14, were being cared for by their 21 year old sister at the time of sentence.  A psychologist concluded that the appellant was suffering from a range of symptoms of an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (severe) related to his worry that he had failed his children.
19The appellant had previously been the president of the Wollongong chapter of the Rebels Motorcycle Club but had retired some years before the offence.
Ground of appeal
20There is a sole ground of appeal:
The sentencing judge erred in the application of the standard non-parole period legislation in light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120 with respect to count 2.
21The Crown conceded that this ground should be upheld.  It is based upon the following from the sentencing judgment:
""In respect of count 2, a standard non-parole period of ten years applies.  Section 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that a court is to set the standard non-parole period fixed for the offence, unless the court determines there are reasons for setting a non-parole period which is either longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period.  In accordance with the decision in R v Way one must ask whether reasons exist for not imposing the standard non-parole period.  That question is to be answered by considering the objective seriousness for offences of the relevant kind.  This assessment includes consideration of the applicable circumstances of aggravation and mitigation provided for in s 21A(2) and s 21A(3) and also having regard to the general provisions of s 21A(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.""
22The appellant contends that the above extract shows that the sentencing judge used the standard non-parole period as a starting point; adopted a two-stage approach to sentencing; and regarded the standard non-parole period as having determinative significance.  These matters complied with the correct approach described in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168.  However that approach was held to be erroneous in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [25]-[28].
23This Court was in error (it can be said with the benefit of hindsight) in effectively endorsing the correctness of the approach taken by the sentencing judge:  see, for example, Sinkovich v R at [51].   
24The Crown concession that there was error is soundly based and I would uphold this ground.  
Is a lesser sentence warranted: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act
25There remains a question as to whether some other sentence whether more or less severe is warranted and should have been passed:  s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
26It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that if he had been sentenced at first instance in accordance with the principles in Muldrock, his sentence would have been appreciably less.  
27Reference was made to statistics compiled by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales in relation to sentencing for offences against s 25(2) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act in support of a proposition that the sentence is in the top two per cent of all sentences imposed upon offenders in the period July 2006 to June 2013.  There is a well recognised limitation on the utility of drawing comparisons with sentencing statistics.  However, this tends to confirm the finding by this Court on the previous appeal that the sentence for the count 2 offence was ""towards the upper end of the range"": Sinkovich v R at [38], [62]. 
28A table of other cases in which significant sentences had been imposed for an offence against s 25(2) was annexed to the written submissions for the appellant.  The utility of referring to those cases is quite limited given that most of them involve sentencing for multiple offences, often with additional offences taken into account on a Form 1 document.  A further difficulty arises from the fact that many of them involved pleas of guilty for which there was a reduction of sentence, commonly of 25 percent. All that I glean from these cases is that they provide some further support for the conclusion that the sentence is a comparatively heavy one.
29The Crown contended that no lesser sentence was warranted.  It sought to rely upon various matters emerging from the judgment of this Court in the earlier appeal.  Some of the matters are of no assistance in that they were conclusions reached in an environment where R v Way was thought to correctly reflect the approach to sentencing in standard non-parole period cases.  Matters that are legitimate to have regard to now are:
The sentencing judge found that the objective seriousness of the offence in count 2 was ""slightly above mid-range"".  It was held by this Court that there was no error in that conclusion:  Sinkovich v R at [46].
The Court described the appellant's subjective case as ""relatively modest"": at [50]
30The Crown submitted that issues of deterrence, both specific and general, were of particular significance in the context of sentencing in a serious drug supply offence.  So much may be readily accepted.  It also submitted that the standard non-parole period ""had real relevance as one of the statutory guideposts"" given the finding by the sentencing judge as to the level of objective seriousness of the offence. 
31An affidavit affirmed by the appellant was read at the hearing of the appeal.  It refers to various difficulties he has endured because of his inability to progress towards a minimum security classification because of the length of his sentence.  He has found the conditions in maximum security to be very harsh and he has not had available to him participation in various programs because he is less needy of them than other inmates.  He also speaks of the difficulties being separated from his children who have had to fend for themselves, the eldest having to look after the younger ones.  Reference is also made to him having maintained his physical and mental health, having worked hard and stayed out of trouble.  He says that he has received excellent work and conduct reports throughout his sentence.
32I would not want to be thought to be downplaying the harshness of the appellant's custodial experience; that is acknowledged.  But in my view the affidavit does not convey anything that was not foreseeable at the time of sentence or that the administrative arrangements in relation to classification and the like have not been ordinary incidents of the sentence imposed.  Counsel accepted in the course of oral argument that the concerns the appellant had in relation to his family are ""confirmatory of some of the matters that [the sentencing judge] covered"". 
33There is no challenge to the findings of the sentencing judge concerning the objective seriousness of the two offences.  That is particularly significant in relation to count 2 where the finding was that it was ""slightly above the mid-range"".  The appellant's subjective case was previously described as ""modest"" and the new material provided in the affidavit just referred to does not alter that assessment.
34The maximum penalty of 20 years and the standard non-parole period of 10 years in respect of the count 2 offence are the legislative guideposts that must be taken into account: Muldrock at [27].  I accept the emphasis the respondent placed upon the importance of these guideposts: see, for example, AB v R [2013] NSWCCA 273 at [87]; Koh v R [2013] NSWCCA 287 at [106].  Where an offence is found to be in the middle of the range of objective seriousness the standard non-parole period may have greater significance:  Filippou v R [2013] NSWCCA 92 at [116].
35The non-parole period imposed for the s 25(2) offence was 9 years following a finding special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  Without such a finding the non-parole period would have been at least 9 years and 9 months.  The standard non-parole period is 10 years.  In my view that reflects an assessment of sentence that gives too much weight to the standard non-parole period.  If one avoids regarding it as having primary or determinative significance, it follows that a lesser sentence is warranted.
Re-sentencing
36The error revealed in this appeal is solely concerned with the sentence on count 2.  On re-sentencing, the sentence imposed in respect of count 1 should be maintained.
37The assessment of a new sentence for count 2 should include consideration of the unchallenged finding of the sentencing judge as to its objective seriousness; the various purposes of sentencing but particularly the need for general deterrence; and the applicant's insignificant prior record and reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.
38I propose that there be the same degree of partial accumulation of the sentence for count 2 upon the sentence for count 1, namely 1 year.  
39The Crown said nothing in opposition to the finding of special circumstances made by the sentencing judge being maintained if the Court moved to re-sentence.  What I propose will yield a non-parole component of the total effective sentence that is of the same proportion as in the original sentencing structure.
40The new sentence I propose for count 2 is one of 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months.  That will yield a total effective sentence of 12 years with a non-parole component of 8 years and 6 months.
Orders
41I propose the following orders:
(1)Allow the appeal.
(2)In respect of the sentences imposed in the District Court on 6 November 2009 maintain that which was imposed for count 1 but quash that which was imposed for count 2.
(3)In lieu, sentence the appellant in respect of count 2 to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 3 years and 6 months.  The sentence will date from 4 July 2009; the appellant will become eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 3 January 2017; and the total term of the sentence will expire on 3 July 2020.

2705024,R v Wasson [2014] NSWCCA 95,"Judgment
1GLEESON JA:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
2R A HULME J:  Mark Anthony Wasson was found guilty by a jury of an offence of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon.  He was sentenced by his Honour Judge Maiden SC in the District Court at Newcastle on 8 October 2013 to imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 1 year.  The sentence was specified to commence on 3 July 2013.  The respondent will become eligible for release on parole on 2 July 2014.  The Crown appeals against that sentence.
3The offence is contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years.  
4In sentencing the respondent for this offence the judge took into account a further offence listed on a Form 1 document of knowingly making a false statement contrary to s 307(B)(1) of the Crimes Act (an offence for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 2 years and/or a fine of $2,200). 
5The ground of appeal first notified by the Crown was that ""the sentence pronounced was manifestly inadequate"".  However, after a transcript of the proceedings on sentence became available, the Crown's position was revised to contend two grounds:  (1) that the judge had no or insignificant regard to general deterrence in determining the non-parole period, and (2) that the non-parole period was manifestly inadequate.  There is now no complaint of manifest inadequacy concerning the total term of the sentence.
The proceedings on sentence
6The proceedings on sentence commenced on 3 October 2013 and continued the following day. The Crown tendered a bundle of documents that included two Pre-Sentence Reports and material relating to the sentencing of a co-offender on 9 March 2012 by his Honour Judge Toner SC.  For the respondent there was tendered a psychiatric report by Professor David Greenberg, a brief medical certificate concerning the respondent's partner and some testimonials.  There was no oral evidence.
7The Crown Prosecutor informed his Honour that the facts found in the sentencing of the co-offender were the same as those established in the respondent's trial (in other words he was to be sentenced on the same objective facts).  It was conceded by the Crown that the starting point adopted by Toner DCJ for the co-offender of 4 years before discounts for his plea and assistance should not be exceeded in respect of the respondent.  The Crown also conceded that a finding of special circumstances was open to be made (s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)).  Counsel for the respondent indicated that he was ""content"" with a starting point of 4 years. 
8The only remaining issue was one concerning s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (assistance to authorities).  Counsel for the respondent tendered ""a packet"" in relation to that issue and the Crown Prosecutor indicated that he did not contest what it contained.  The judge asked if there was an issue about ""what percentage should I allow there"".  The prosecutor said ""it's only worth 5 or at the outside 10 percent"" and defence counsel replied that he would ""be arguing more like 15 or 20 but your Honour can read the information"". 
9This was the extent of the submissions made on sentence.
Judgment on sentence
10The judge imposed sentence the following Tuesday (8 October 2013).  His Honour's judgment occupies three pages of transcript.
11The judge noted in the first paragraph of the transcript the charge; the verdict of guilty; the maximum penalty; and the Form 1 matter.  He then turned to the facts:
""The facts of this matter were that on 2 April 2011 the offender with his co-offender ..., attended a service station and did rob that service station, taking cash.  The facts were that [his co-offender] was armed with a small pistol and by small pistol, most likely .22 calibre, and he was driven to the service station by this offender.
[The co-offender] pleaded guilty before his Honour Judge Toner on 9 March 2012 and was also sentenced for other matters.  In respect of this particular matter, his Honour found that it should carry a head sentence of four years and one month, before discounts were applied; discounts for the plea of guilty and also for information giving rise to this offender.
[The co-accused] was a well known drug user and a long time criminal with a lengthy history and there is no doubt in my mind that his disclosure of Mr Wasson being a co-offender was done eagerly to gain maximum benefit by way of discount in assisting the authorities.  The offender Wasson maintained his innocence and denied that he had given [his co-offender] the pistol and that, at the time that he took him to the service station he was unaware that any robbery was to be undertaken by [his co-offender].""
12His Honour then turned to the respondent's subjective case and the issues of parity and assistance to authorities:
""This offender has had an unfortunate upbringing and has been using illicit substances for many years, most prominently cannabis and alcohol.  However, since forming a relationship approximately 12 years ago he been of great assistance to his partner who has a difficult medical condition which, as the evidence discloses, she continues to need him because she is prone to faint and require transportation to hospital.  She is presently awaiting an operation and there is no doubt that her situation, in terms of her health, is compromised whilst the offender is not at home.
In recent times this offender, but for one matter in 2012 of goods in custody, appears to have seen the light.  His last offence of any significance being a break and enter in 2006.
The reports speak of a person who is otherwise a decent person and, despite his difficulty, has provided support to his partner and family.  He has not had the benefit of a long education and because of injury has been unable to work for a period of time which he says has given rise to his use of cannabis and other drugs from time to time.
I am obliged to consider the parity of sentencing, and I propose to start this matter at a head sentence of four years.  I am unable to give any discount for any plea, however I have read the material in respect of the matter under s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  In terms of that matter involving offenders that this court has dealt with, that information although on the face of it straightforward, as I understand the facts in respect of those persons I can see why the officer in charge says it was of assistance.  That was a matter which involved a number of criminals, a robbery of criminals by another criminal, not this offender and the officer in charge has accepted that matter and in respect of that I propose to give this offender, a discount of 10% for that assistance.
I have also had the helpful report of Professor Greenberg who indicates that this offender does not suffer from any psychiatric illness but is diagnosed with having poly substance dependent disorder most likely in respect of cannabis and a chronic adjustment order with depressed mood, that is depression and understandable in circumstances with what difficulties both he and his partner have had to deal with in recent times.
The Court is of the view that this is a matter where special circumstances apply and, notwithstanding the need for general deterrence in respect of the matter which will be dealt with in the head sentence, I propose to give a shorter period of time in custody with recommendations that he deal with his substance issues.""
13His Honour then announced the sentence in terms that I have set out earlier.  He recommended that a copy of Professor Greenberg's report be ""sent with the papers"" and that the respondent ""undertake such courses as recommended by Justice Health and Corrective Services"". 
Further as to the facts of the offence
14On the hearing of the appeal the respondent took no issue with the summary of facts set out in the Crown's written submissions.  It included the following matters that are relevant to the seriousness of the offence:
The robbery was the respondent's idea.
The respondent provided the pistol to the co-offender. 
15As can be seen from the above quotation from the sentencing judgment, Maiden DCJ simply noted that the respondent denied these matters.  He did not otherwise make findings that the respondent now concedes were appropriate and, implicitly at least, concedes were relevant to an assessment of the seriousness of the respondent's offence.
Ground 1 - insufficient or no regard to general deterrence in setting the non-parole period
16The Crown's position in relation to this ground is quite straightforward.  In final paragraph of the extract from the sentencing remarks set out above it is plain that his Honour only sought to have regard to the need for general deterrence in setting the head sentence and not the non-parole period.  That such an approach is wrong is apparent from the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 where (at [65]) his Honour stated that the non-parole period of a sentence must reflect ""all of the circumstances of the offence and the offender - including the objective gravity of the offence and the need for general deterrence"".
17Although not strictly relevant to this ground, it is pertinent to observe that the judge expressed no view about the objective gravity of the offence.  The consensus as to the four year starting point did not obviate the need for him to have made some assessment as it was relevant to the setting of the non-parole period as well. 
18Counsel for the respondent submitted that this Court would not be satisfied that the asserted error is made out on a fair reading of the remarks as a whole.  (Aside from summarising the first paragraph and the pronouncement of orders, I have set out the entirety of the sentencing judgment above).  Reference was made to the challenging task of District Court judges with busy lists and being ""faced on a daily basis with an almost unending onslaught of serious and complex sentencing exercises"": Tabuan v R [2013] NSWCCA 143 at [28] (Harrison J). 
19The observation of Harrison J in Tabuan v R should not be taken too literally.  There is no doubt that District Court judges face a daunting work load and there are serious and complex sentencing exercises that arise from time to time.  But to be frank, to say that this is ""an almost unending onslaught"" is rather a colourful flourish when it is borne in mind that sentencing in serious criminal cases is the everyday task of that Court.  And for the respondent to invoke this observation in what was a fairly straightforward sentencing exercise is rather inapt.
20Counsel sought to characterise his Honour's statement as being intended to convey that he recognised the need for general deterrence to be reflected in the non-parole period but found it appropriate to reduce the non-parole period for the reasons he identified.  I see this as a valiant attempt to defend what must be regarded as an obvious error of principle in his Honour's approach to the sentencing exercise.  
21I would uphold the first ground of appeal.
Ground 2 - manifestly inadequate non-parole period
22The Crown did not challenge the finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the setting of a parole period that exceeded one-third of the non-parole period.  It did, however, challenge the degree of variation of the usual proportions so that the non-parole period represented approximately 27 percent of the total term.
23It was acknowledged that the degree of variation of the ratio between non-parole period and total term following a finding of special circumstances is discretionary: Spark v R [2012] NSWCCA 140 at [34] (Fullerton J).  It was also pointed out, however, that this Court's intervention will usually be invoked only if the non-parole period is either manifestly inadequate or excessive: R v Simpson at [73] (Spigelman CJ).
24The Crown submitted that the 1 year non-parole period in this case did not adequately reflect the objective gravity of the offence and it appeared that the judge had placed disproportionate weight on the respondent's subjective circumstances: R v Ceissman [2004] NSWCCA 466 at [25]. 
25It appears from the sentencing remarks that the basis for the finding of special circumstances was the need for the respondent to address his substance abuse issues.  The Pre-Sentence Report indicated that he would benefit from a period of supervision with strategies that would include ""referral to and monitoring of alcohol and other drug counselling"". Professor Greenberg reported that the respondent's ""primary psychiatric difficulties are his significant, continuous and persistent history of chronic illicit substance and alcohol dependence/abuse associated with significant personal difficulties"".  The latter is primarily a reference to the history that his long-standing partner had experienced five miscarriages from 2000 with the most recent in April 2013.  The respondent told Professor Greenberg that he became depressed after each of them.  He sought assistance for the first time in July 2013 and was prescribed antidepressant medication.
26It was Professor Greenberg's opinion that:
""Mr Wasson should continue with [his] medication as prescribed by his treating doctor.  He should abstain from all drug and alcohol substances for an indefinite period.  Further use of these substances may exacerbate his personality problems.  He may benefit from drug and alcohol counselling to assist him in abstaining from these substances.  He may benefit from psychological counselling with regard to his claims of grief issues.  He should continue with further follow up by his treating doctor.""
27Whilst acknowledging those opinions and recommendations, the Crown submitted that there was no evidence supporting a conclusion that a period of 2 years 9 months under parole supervision was justified.  A more modest reduction in the non-parole period would have still allowed for a sufficient period to meet the purposes identified by the judge and would have left the non-parole period as a more adequate reflection of the objective seriousness of the offence and the need for general deterrence.
28Section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides in subs (2) that the parole period must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period unless there are special circumstances.  In this case, the parole period is close to three times of the non-parole period.  It is accepted that there were special circumstances justifying some departure but there is a complete absence of reasons given for such a dramatic departure.  In the Crown appeal in R v Thomas [2007] NSWCCA 269 there were sentences of 3 years 5 months and 3 years 6 months, each with non-parole periods of 1 year 6 months for two robbery offences (s 96 and s 97 Crimes Act).  The following from the judgment of Basten JA concerning the extent of the reduction of the non-parole periods is apposite to the present case:
[30] ... A custodial period constituting less than half the appropriate sentence itself requires justification. The obligation imposed by s 44(2) to provide reasons for the decision that there are special circumstances, when taken with the general obligation of a Court to give reasons for its decisions, should be understood as requiring some explanation of the reason for the degree of departure from the standard relationship, at least in the case of such a significant departure as that adopted in this matter. The objective elements of the offence indicate that a non-parole period of less than two years was manifestly inadequate.
29The primary submission for the respondent was that given there is no issue about the judge finding special circumstances and reducing the non-parole period, whilst it is lenient it cannot be said that it is manifestly inadequate.  Reference was made to authority for the proposition that an adjustment of the statutory ratio of non-parole and parole periods is discretionary; but the Crown acknowledges this.
30Reference was also made to general principles concerning Crown appeals, principally those discussed in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462.
31Submissions were made about the respondent's role in the offence and it was contended that his culpability was lower than that of the co-offender.  I do not accept this, given that the robbery was the respondent's idea and he provided the gun and the transport. In any event, this analysis fails when regard is had to the consensus between the prosecution and the defence (which the judge accepted) that there should be the same starting point for the total term as that adopted for the co-offender.
32Counsel also referred to aspects of the respondent's subjective case to which the judge referred.  He had experienced an ""unfortunate upbringing"".  Drug and alcohol abuse was a long-standing feature of his life and it had been exacerbated by the depression he had endured as a result of the multiple miscarriages by his partner.  His record did not involve any prior full-time custody and his last significant conviction was in 2006.  The judge found that he had ""seen the light"".  There were testimonials that supported his Honour's finding that he was ""otherwise a decent person"" who had ""provided support to his partner and family"".  
33Aside from the finding about the respondent having ""seen the light"" (a bold finding given the respondent did not give evidence), I accept the force of the subjective case.  But it cannot subsume a proper reflection of the objective gravity of the offence in both the head sentence and the non-parole period: see, for example, R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at [15]; R v Simpson at [65].
34It was submitted that the finding of special circumstances was ""purposeful"" (R v GWM [2012] NSWCCA 240 at [114]) and was of benefit to the respondent and, in turn, the community.  But there is more at stake than simply providing such a benefit.  GWM involved a Crown appeal in respect of a sentence of 5 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months.   Johnson J accepted that a variation in the statutory proportions was ""purposeful"" but almost immediately he added:
[118] As the decision of this Court in R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 (at 718 [65]) makes clear, the adjustment of the statutory ratio, after considering factors relevant to the fettered sentencing discretion, must lead to the imposition of a non-parole period which constitutes the minimum period which the offender should spend in custody having regard to all objective and subjective circumstances, including the objective gravity of the offence and the need for general deterrence. The non-parole period should constitute the least period which the Respondent ought be required to serve for his crime before being eligible for parole, having regard to all the purposes of punishment and not simply his rehabilitation: Hejazi v R [2009] NSWCCA 282 at [36].[119] A finding of ""special circumstances"" was both open and appropriate in this case. However, I am satisfied that the extensive variation of the statutory ratio in this case (from 75% to just over 50%), taken with the quantum of the non-parole period itself (32 months), demonstrates that disproportionate weight has been given to the subjective circumstances of the Respondent: R v Ceissman [2004] NSWCCA 466 at [25].[120] The circumstances of this case which warranted variation of the s.44(2) ratio, although capable of supporting a finding of ""special circumstances"", were incapable of supporting a finding leading to the imposition of a non-parole period just over 50% of the head sentence. The non-parole period imposed, in my view, failed to reflect the seriousness of the offence and the need for general deterrence: Maglis v R [2010] NSWCCA 247 at [28].
35Submissions were made by both the Crown and respondent concerning the sentencing of the co-offender and the principle of parity.  The co-offender's sentencing was complicated by quite a number of features including additional offences; contrition; an element of disclosure of otherwise unknown guilt (R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604); mental illness reducing moral culpability and the need for general deterrence; and a finding of more onerous custodial conditions.  A comparison of the sentences is also complicated by errors in the formulation of the orders: individual sentences were imposed but erroneously only a single non-parole period; and a finding of special circumstances was not reflected in the overall sentence. 
36The only thing I conclude from an examination of the case of the co-offender is that I do not accept the submission that increasing the non-parole period in the respondent's case will create unacceptable disparity.
37I am of the view that the non-parole period set by Maiden DCJ is manifestly inadequate.  It does not remotely reflect the objective gravity of the offence; pays no heed to the importance of general deterrence; and appears to have been disproportionately influenced by sympathy for the respondent's subjective circumstances.  Unless there is good reason for this Court to exercise its residual discretion the non-parole period should be set aside and replaced with one of 2 years and 3 months.
Residual discretion
38The Crown submitted that intervention and re-sentencing was justified in this case.  It referred to the recent summary of relevant principles in the judgment of Adamson J in R v O'Connor [2014] NSWCCA 53:
""[85] This Court retains a residual discretion in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act to refuse to interfere in a sentence, even if error has been demonstrated and manifest inadequacy established: Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293; Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462. 
[86] This Court is obliged to consider the exercise of the residual discretion: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37 at [24]; Reeves v The Queen [2013] HCA 57 at [10], [12], [60]-[61].  ... [88] Although the principal purpose of the determination of a Crown appeal is to give guidance to sentencing judges, the sentence actually imposed on the respondent is still of considerable importance. The need for specific deterrence in the present case would not be served by an exercise of the residual discretion. 
[89] Nor indeed would the need for general deterrence be fulfilled were the residual discretion to be exercised. The general deterrence of a sentence is not to be measured solely by reference to its effect on putative offenders. One of the purposes of incorporating an element of general deterrence in a sentence is to ensure that sentences accord with legitimate community expectations and that public confidence in the administration of justice is maintained: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [82] per McHugh J. ...""
39Counsel for the respondent submitted that there were ""compelling discretionary reasons"" why the Court would exercise its discretion not to intervene.  Four affidavits were read at the hearing.
40The respondent's affidavit includes a claim that he now has insight into the effect that abuse of alcohol and drugs has had upon his past behaviour.  In the time since he was notified of the Crown appeal he has completed two relevant rehabilitation programs; he has attended weekly Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings; and he has re-engaged with religion and has attended weekly counselling with the prison chaplain.  The respondent expressed concern for his family, particularly his partner who has the care of their two young sons.  Both his mother and his partner have been diagnosed with serious illnesses which has had a variety of affects, including limiting their ability to visit him.
41Affidavits affirmed by the respondent's partner and mother confirm their medical problems.  His partner was diagnosed with cervical caner after he went into custody last October.  She underwent a course of chemotherapy and has been told that it was successful in arresting the cancer.  She has experienced depression for which she is on medication.  She attributes this, in part, to the respondent being in gaol and her having to care for the children.  One practical hardship she is experiencing results from medical advice not to drive which makes shopping and taking the children to school a challenge.
42After the respondent was sentenced his mother, who lives on her own, was diagnosed with pneumonia and lung cancer.  She has been through courses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy with various side effects.  She was told last New Year's Eve that she had a very aggressive form of cancer and she said that the doctor told her she had six to nine weeks to live (as to which see below).  She had to undergo further radiotherapy when spots were discovered on her brain.  She was recently told that these spots were not cancer but her situation was still terminal and there was the prospect of the existing cancer spreading.  It was her understanding that her son feels helpless ""that he is not able to be there for me and scared something will happen to me before he is released"".  As with her daughter-in-law, the respondent's mother also has received medical advice that she should not drive.   She is not well enough to travel for two hours on public transport to visit him and, since he was transferred to St Heliers she has only been able to visit him a couple of times.
43The Crown read an affidavit of Ms J Ramsay, solicitor which annexed the respondent's visitor records at St Heliers Correctional Centre.  They demonstrate that his partner was a regular visitor, with their two sons, until her last visit in mid-February 2014.  His mother was an occasional visitor and had visited him since he transferred to St Heliers in November 2013 five times at approximately monthly intervals.  On the last two occasions she brought the respondent's children.
44At the hearing of the appeal the respondent's legal representatives were granted leave to file further material relating to the condition of his mother, particularly as to her prognosis.  A letter under the hand of Dr A Bonaventura, Director of Medical Oncology at Calvary Mater Newcastle was filed on 20 May 2014.  It confirms the condition and advises that treatments were completed a few weeks ago.  Mrs Green will be reassessed for response in about a month's time.  The letter concludes:
""Although the aim of treatment is potentially curative only about a third of patients achieve a complete response.  Most patients have recurrence of their cancer and the median survival is approximately 12 months.  A small subset of patents (20%) have survival longer than 3 years.""
Conclusion
45Both grounds of appeal should be upheld.  The non-parole period imposed is clearly inadequate.  However, I am persuaded that in the exceptional circumstances of this case the Court should exercise its discretion and refrain from intervention.  The concern the respondent must have for the plight of his partner but more so his mother is real.  It renders the circumstances of his incarceration significantly more onerous.  A sympathetic response is justified.
46The respondent will become eligible for release on parole in under 6 weeks time.  Intervention in the terms I have proposed (extension of the non-parole period until October 2015) would see a continuation and likely exacerbation of the undoubted anguish the respondent must feel through the likely deterioration of his mother and possible demise within that period.
47In the joint judgment of French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen it was said (at [43]) that ""the guidance afforded to sentencing judges by allowing [a Crown] appeal should not come at too high a cost in terms of justice to the individual"". 
48An issue was raised during the hearing about an error in the calculation by the sentencing judge of the discount for assistance.  The effect is that the sentence reflected only a 6.25 percent discount rather than the 10 percent intended.  The period involved is less than 2 months of the parole period.  In all of the circumstances I do not believe that justice requires any intervention to correct this relatively minor discrepancy.
49I propose the following order:
Crown appeal dismissed.
50CAMPBELL J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.

		28 May 2014",2014-05-26 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705025,Tan v R [2014] NSWCCA 96,"Judgment
1LEEMING JA:  I agree with R A Hulme J.  Although Muldrock error was conceded, his Honour's reasons demonstrate that no lesser sentence is warranted, with the result that no extension of time should be granted for this application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
2FULLERTON J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
3R A HULME J:  The applicant, Chin Lai Tan, was found guilty by a jury and was sentenced by his Honour Judge Bennett SC in the District Court at Sydney on 11 June 2010 for an offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of heroin. 
4The offence is contrary to s 25(2) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and, because a large commercial quantity was involved, the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life and/or a fine of 5000 penalty units.  There is also prescribed by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) a standard non-parole period of 15 years.
5The learned judge imposed upon the applicant a sentence of 15 years 3 months and 18 days with a non-parole period of 10 years.  The sentence was specified to commence on 17 February 2009 so the applicant will become eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 16 February 2019.
6The applicant filed a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal on 3 December 2013; well outside of the time limits provided by the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) and the Criminal Appeal Rules.  Accordingly he also applies for an extension of time.  I will deal with that issue later and first look at the potential merit of the application.
Facts
7The facts of the offence were dealt with by the sentencing judge at some length in his sentencing judgment from which I draw the following summary.
8A joint State and Federal police investigation had co-offenders Lawrence Yong Shun Loh and Chuan Tat Kho under surveillance.  On 16 January 2009, Loh and Kho left their rented apartment at Chatswood and travelled to the City where they went to a café.  Loh sat at a table on the footpath while Kho went inside.  The applicant arrived with a trolley case and sat with Loh.  Kho emerged and sat with them.  After about 10 minutes they all got up and Kho took the case and wheeled it away with the applicant and Loh following.  Kho hailed a taxi while the applicant and Loh conversed. A taxi arrived and Kho lifted the case into the boot.  He and Loh entered the taxi and the applicant walked away.  The taxi was stopped by police.  Loh and Kho were arrested.  The trolley case was seized.   The police were under resourced and were unable to follow the applicant.
9Loh and Kho were taken back to the Federal Police Headquarters.  Loh provided officers with the combination and they were able to open the case which was found to contain 13.999 kilograms of heroin with a purity of 70 percent.  The large commercial quantity of heroin is 1 kilogram so this was 14 times that amount.
10Expert evidence before the court was to the effect that the purity of the drug was greater than would be found in street level transactions which are usually in the range of 20 to 30 percent.  The ultimate street value of the drug was within a range of $14.5 to $20.3 million.
11The applicant was arrested at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport on 17 February 2009 as he was about to leave the country.  
12Despite his defence at trial, the applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings in which he admitted his involvement in the transaction with Loh but he claimed, in effect, that he was only brought into it on the morning of the day it took place on the promise of payment of $3000 if he delivered the trolley case.  The trial judge was, understandably, doubtful of that version.  There was evidence of telephone contact between the applicant and Loh on some 40 occasions in the preceding 15 days.  Further suspicion arose from the circumstances of the applicant's accommodation which was rented in a false name with the involvement of a third party.
13The judge said:
""As the Crown has conceded, it is not possible to determine precisely where this offender is positioned within the organisation of individuals who combined to bring this heroin to the market.  However, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was at a level greater than that which he would have the court accept.""
Assistance
14The judge then devoted the following section of his sentencing judgment to a question of whether the applicant was entitled to some benefit on sentence for his offer of assistance to authorities.  It revolved around his explanation for his involvement in the offence and his claim that he was recruited on the morning of the transaction by another person.  The judge considered that the reliability of the applicant's account was highly questionable.  He considered that this aspect might be of benefit to the applicant in terms of demonstrating contrition in finally admitting the offence in the sentence proceedings but found that this was qualified by minimisation of his own role.
15The judge also found that the assistance might be of benefit to the applicant in terms of a discount on sentence granted pursuant to s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  Although he held reservations about the significance, truthfulness, reliability and completeness of the information, he thought it had ""at least some intelligence value"".
Personal circumstances of the applicant
16The applicant lived in Malaysia and was aged 22 at the time of sentence and 21 at the time of the offence.  He had no prior criminal record.  He has no family in Australia.  He is married and has two young daughters.  He had received two visits from his wife since his arrest but the judge took into account that the prospects of future visits by his wife and children were remote.
17The applicant's father is ill and his mother cares for him.  The applicant has limited education because of his need to leave school and work to support the family after his father's illness arose.
18He worked in a trade involving scrap metal until a downturn in the market for that commodity occurred in 2007 and he found he was unable to support his family.  He claimed that he decided to come to Australia in December 2008 in order to study and find work but after he arrived he found those opportunities were limited.  The judge noted, however, that he was on a tourist visa with no prospect of it ever being extended so that he could pursue those goals.  However, the judge said that he ""cannot come to the view beyond reasonable doubt that his sole purpose in coming to this country was to participate in this crime"". 
19The judge found that his late acknowledgement of guilt was ""some demonstration of contrition"", albeit qualified by his minimisation of his role.  He also accepted that the applicant was of good character; had no previous convictions; had good prospects of rehabilitation; and had a low likelihood of offending in the future.  One can also divine that the judge took into account that imprisonment would be more onerous for the applicant on account of his family being overseas; his family including as it does his wife, his young daughters and his aging parents, one of whom was ill.
Grounds of proposed appeal
1. The sentencing judge erred in the application of the standard non-parole provisions contrary to the decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39.
2. The sentencing judge erred in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.
3. The sentencing judge erred in finding as an aggravating factor that the offence was part of an organised criminal activity.
4. The sentencing judge erred in finding as an aggravating factor that the offence was committed without regard for public safety.
5.  The sentencing judge did not take into account the youth of the appellant in determining an appropriate sentence.
6. As a result of the sentences that have been imposed upon the co-offenders based on the principles of parity of sentencing the appellant has a justifiable sense of grievance.
7. The sentence that was imposed was manifestly excessive.
Ground 1 - Muldrock error
20The Crown conceded that there was error and that this ground should be upheld.  It is apparent from the reasoning of the sentencing judge that he approached the issue of the standard non-parole period in the manner required by this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168, since disapproved by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.  The Crown's concession is appropriate.  That gives rise to the question whether a lesser sentence is warranted: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act.  It is appropriate to deal with the other grounds, but relatively briefly.
Ground 2 - error in assessment of objective seriousness of the offence
21It was contended that there was no proper foundation for the judge to find that the objective seriousness was in the middle of the range for this type of offence.  It was submitted that the applicant's role was more important in the assessment than the quantity of the drugs involved.  It was contended that he was no more than a courier.  He was not a principal in the enterprise.
22In my view the Crown's submissions in reply are correct. The applicant was more than a courier.  He was a foreign national present in this country on a tourist visa who within a relatively short time after his arrival was living in accommodation under a false name.  He was in frequent contact by telephone in a period of a fortnight with the person to whom he ultimately provided 14 times the large commercial quantity of heroin with a significant level of purity.
23The assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence is principally one for sentencing judges to determine; an assessment with which this Court will not interfere unless it is apparent that the finding of a judge was simply one that was not open to be made: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] (Spigelman CJ) and [46] (Simpson J). 
24In my view, for the factors identified above, it was open to the judge to make the finding that he did as to the relative seriousness of the offence.  This ground has no merit.
Ground 3 - error in finding the offence was ""part of organised criminal activity""Ground 4 - error in finding the offence was committed ""without regard to the safety of the community""
25The judge agreed with a submission made by the Crown that the seriousness of the offence was aggravated by it being ""part of organised criminal activity"" and was committed ""without regard to the safety of the community"".
26It is technically possible for an offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of heroin to be committed without the first factor being involved but it is likely that would be a rare case. But whether a particular offender is part of the ""organised criminal activity"" is of significance.  An offender may be engaged as a courier and kept ignorant of and at arm's length to the criminal organisational aspect of the enterprise.  That is not entirely the case here.
27The second factor is inherent in the offence but the degree to which it applies may be greater than what is inherent.  When that is the case it is permissible to take the matter into account: see, for example, Mansour v R [2011] NSWCCA 28 at [50] (Price J).  The potential harm to the community of supplying 14 kilograms of heroin is significantly higher than supplying the 1 kilogram threshold for the large commercial quantity.  I see no error in this being regarded as an aggravating factor, although care would need to be taken that there is no double counting in the assessment of the seriousness of the offence by having regard to both quantity and potential harm.  The two are inextricably linked.  
28Whether the sentencing judge took these matters into account to a degree beyond what the facts of the case warranted is difficult to determine from the reasons alone.  The ultimate guide is the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence and I find no difficulty with that assessment.
29I would reject these grounds.
Ground 5 - error in not taking into account the applicant's youth
30The judge reviewed the entirety of the personal circumstances of the applicant and I have summarised the matters to which he referred.  The applicant's age was but one of the factors.  
31This was not a case in which the age of the offender demanded that considerations of rehabilitation should be given greater prominence over the need for general deterrence.  And the judge did take into account that the offender was a foreign national who would be serving a sentence a great distance from his young wife and small children.  He took this, and the age and health of his parents, into account in setting the total term of the sentence as well as in finding special circumstances that reduced the non-parole period to one that was 65 percent of the total term of the sentence. 
32I do not accept that the sentencing judge was in error in not making greater allowance for the applicant's age in the assessment of the sentence.
Ground 6 - parity
33The starting point for the sentence imposed upon the applicant before the 15 percent allowed for his assistance to authorities was 18 years. 
34Lawrence Yong Shun Loh was sentenced by Bennett DCJ a little over four months later on 28 October 2010.  The starting point adopted for his sentencing was 16 years.  An allowance of 12.5 percent was made for his plea of guilty and he was sentenced to imprisonment for 14 years.  
35Loh appealed against his sentence but the appeal was dismissed:  Loh v R [2013] NSWCCA 339. One ground of appeal asserting Muldrock error was upheld.  The other ground concerning parity in relation to the sentencing of Chuan Tat Kho by his Honour Judge Berman SC on 14 September 2012 was rejected.  Kho was sentenced to 12 years (no discounts were factored in).    It was held (at [44]) that the involvement of Kho in the offence was less than that of Tan and Loh, thus affirming a finding that Berman DCJ had made that a lesser sentence for him was warranted.  For this reason I would reject the argument of the applicant insofar as it concerned the sentencing of Kho.
36The judge assessed the objective seriousness of the offences committed by the applicant and Loh as equivalent.  The difference in the starting points adopted must lie in the assessment of their subjective circumstances.
37Loh had an additional offence on a Form 1 document taken into account but the judge considered that it would have a ""marginal impact on the sentence to be imposed"".  The applicant had his youth to be considered (Loh was aged 41).  Loh had provided some assistance to authorities which was not reflected in any quantified reduction of his sentence but led to a more favourable finding as to his remorse.  
38Bennett DCJ was well aware of the approach he had taken and the matters he had taken into account in the sentencing of the applicant by the time he came to sentence Loh.  He referred to such matters at some length.  It is pertinent to note that it was said in R v Swan [2006] NSWCCA 47 at [71] that ""this Court should be cautious before determining that one of the offenders has a justifiable sense of grievance just because of the different sentencing outcomes"".  That was said by reference to sentencing by the one judge of two offenders on the same occasion.  The same must apply when the same judge sentences offenders on different occasions, particularly as in the present case when specific regard was had to the approach earlier taken in the sentencing of a co-offender.
39It is also pertinent to note that for there to be a justifiable sense of grievance the disparity must be ""gross"", ""marked"" or ""glaring"":  see the discussion by Howie J in England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [61]-[67]. 
40Counsel for the applicant advanced arguments under this ground that extended to a comparison of the non-parole periods imposed upon the co-offenders, particularly as to the extent to which the represented a percentage proportion of the total term.  It is the actual length of the potential parole period of a sentence that is more significant than percentage proportions of the non-parole and parole periods: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [58]; Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 at [41]-[42].  Any disparity in the non-parole proportions of the sentences is not of any significance.
41Acknowledging that the sentencing judge was fully cognisant of the sentencing of one offender when he sentenced the other, the difference in outcomes is explicable on the basis of his instinctive synthesis of various subjective features in the respective cases and the weight to be accorded to them.  In these circumstances I cannot accept that any sense of grievance experienced by the applicant can be characterised as objectively justifiable.  This ground should not be upheld.
Ground 7 - manifest excess / s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act
42It is unnecessary to determine ground 7.  Because of the merit in ground 1 it is necessary to consider the question posed by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act: whether some other sentence whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed. 
43In my view, the answer to that question is clearly in the negative.  I agree with the assessment of the sentencing judge concerning the relative seriousness of the offence (he found ""middle of the range"").  The applicant had a number of favourable subjective features to be taken into account.  He was (generously in my respectful view) allowed a discount of 15 percent on account of his assistance to authorities (which was of minimal, if any, value).  He had been found guilty after trial and so was not entitled to any added element of leniency that might have been extended if he had pleaded guilty. 
44It remains necessary after Muldrock to pay heed to the maximum penalty provided by Parliament (life imprisonment) and the standard non-parole period (15 years) as the legislative guideposts.   Assessed against those guideposts I am unpersuaded that a lesser sentence is warranted.  (It follows that ground 7 would fail.)
Extension of time
45I return to the fact that the Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal was filed on 3 December 2013.  Materials relied upon to support the application for an extension of time provide quite an incomplete explanation for the long periods of inactivity by both the applicant and his legal representatives in bringing the matter before this Court.  For example, the applicant filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal soon after he was sentenced but then did nothing to pursue it for some two years.  A lawyer became involved in about September 2012 but nothing much happened after that until well into 2013.  I accept that language difficulties and the applicant being held at a gaol away from metropolitan Sydney posed some problems but by no means does that provide an adequate explanation for the inordinate delay.
46I have assessed each of the grounds of appeal and found only one has technical, but not practical, merit.  In these circumstances, an extension of time should be refused.
Order
47I propose the following order:
Extension of time in which to apply for leave to appeal against sentence refused.

		28 May 2014",2014-05-26 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705029,Convery v R [2014] NSWCCA 93,"Judgment
1SIMPSON J:  I agreed with the orders of the Court for the reasons stated by McCallum J.  
2ADAMS J:  I agreed with the orders of the Court for the reasons set out in the judgment of McCallum J.  I wish, however, to add the following remarks.  This case presents, in a stark way, a conundrum with which sentencing judges have to deal in many cases where an offender has serious mental problems of one kind or another and causes serious injury to the victim.  Often that injury is the more serious because of the irrational judgment and lack of self control of the offender.  Here, the victim was a police officer who was attacked by the offender because she was doing her duty, making the offence even more serious.  The applicant had stopped taking her medication and her symptoms were exacerbated, perhaps induced, by methylamphetamine and alcohol.  Her addiction to drugs commenced in early childhood, as shown in the history set out by McCallum J.  In light of her long-standing schizophrenia and damaged intellect (her overall intellectual functioning was in the Very Low range, at a level less than 1 per cent of her peers), it is not reasonable to treat her taking of drugs as though, despite her addiction, she was making a real choice about it.  
3In the end, it must be moral culpability that determines the correct level of punishment.  Of course this necessarily involves the commission of the particular acts themselves, which were very serious indeed.  As Dr Furst concluded, the applicant was aware of the wrongness of her actions.  She had some, though limited, ability to control her actions.  These factors justified the imposition of punishment, which must also involve the protection of the public and, in particular, police officers.  Not surprisingly, when not affected by illicit drugs, her behaviour has been reported on positively and there have been times when, assisted by almost daily contact with case-workers from The Crossing (a long-term, intensive case management service for homeless young persons), she has been able to maintain her tenancy of public housing and address her drug and alcohol use and mental health needs.  She had disengaged a little time before the offence.  This support continues to be available for her on release.  She was able to give evidence in the sentencing proceedings and appeared to be quite articulate.  She expressed remorse for the offence, saying she felt disgusted with herself.  It appears she had tried to have a blood test so she could reassure the officer that she had no diseases.
4The offences were committed on 1 April 2012, when she was arrested and she has been in custody ever since.  Whether, in light of the applicant's mental state at the time of the offence, a sentence which would have resulted in further imprisonment was either necessary or desirable is a matter which has been overtaken by events.  She has been in prison since 1 April 2012, though she was managed in the Mental Health Screening Unit at Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre for about three months, then in a ""step down"" unit (for an unknown period) where she continued to receive psychiatric treatment and support; return to the mainstream was unsuccessful for a time.  The Court was required to consider what now should be done, given that it was necessary to re-sentence her.  In my view the appropriate course was to make orders which will permit her release on parole as soon as is practicable.  It is obvious that a period of supervision is essential.  
5McCALLUM J:  Amanda Convery sought leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon her in the District Court after she pleaded guilty to an offence of assaulting a police officer occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s 60(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.  On 27 May 2014, the Court allowed the appeal, reserving its reasons.  These are my reasons for joining in the orders made.
6Ms Convery pleaded guilty to two offences.  One was an offence of using an offensive weapon to commit an indictable offence (actual bodily harm) contrary to s 33B(1)(a) of the Crimes Act.  The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 12 years.  It carries no standard non-parole period.  The learned sentencing judge imposed a fixed term of two years for that offence.  There was no appeal against that sentence.  The sentence commenced on 1 April 2012 and accordingly Ms Convery has finished serving that sentence.
7The second offence was the offence of assaulting a police officer occasioning actual bodily harm.  The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 7 years.  The offence carries a standard non-parole period of 3 years under s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (item 5 of the Table).
8There were two grounds of appeal.  They were that the sentencing judge erred in failing to allow the applicant a discount for the plea of guilty and that both the sentence for the offence against s 60(2) and the aggregate sentence were manifestly excessive.  The Crown accepted that the first ground was made out and that the appeal should be allowed on that basis.
9The matter presented the sentencing judge with an extremely difficult task.  The objective seriousness of the offences was high but the offender, an Aboriginal woman, had a compelling subjective case.
10The circumstances of the offence were that, at about 5am on 1 April 2012, two police officers were performing traffic control duties next to Redfern Police Station, guiding traffic and pedestrians past a large crane parked in the street.  Ms Convery was walking along the street singing, swearing and holding a glass tumbler.  She was well-affected by alcohol and drugs and had not taken her anti-psychotic medication for some time.  She was approached by police and told that she could not drink on the concourse of the station.  For about an hour, Ms Convery remained on the concourse, shouting and swearing at the two police officers and beckoning for them to come to her.  She called them ""white cunts"" and ""white dogs"".  At times, she was blocking pedestrian access to the station.
11Eventually one of the police officers went to where Ms Convery stood.  Ms Convery asked why the other officer (which was the victim, Constable Flood) had not come over as Ms Convery was ""going to smash her"".
12Constable Flood then went over to Ms Convery.  She asked her to quieten down and informed her that, if she did not, they would have to arrest her.  Ms Convery reacted angrily.  She took a syringe from her dress and stabbed Constable Flood approximately 1cm from her left eye.  As she did so, she also punched Constable Flood to the face a number of times causing severe pain to her nose and bruising and swelling.  Ms Convery was arrested immediately.  She was too affected by drugs and alcohol to be interviewed by police.
13The offence had a devastating effect on Constable Flood.  In a victim impact statement she read at the proceedings on sentence she was anxious to dispel any apprehension as to the nature of her approach to Ms Convery.  She said that she was simply concerned for Ms Convery's safety and well-being.  Constable Flood explained that she had, prior to the assault, been actively engaged in community policing in Redfern and enjoyed strong relations with Aboriginal leaders in that area.  Fortunately, she has been sensible enough not to perceive the offence as one which should impair those relations but she is nonetheless extremely traumatised.  She had several months of anxiety as to whether she may have contracted any disease from the syringe, with which she had not only been punctured but also scratched down the length of her cheek.      
14Ms Convery was then aged 22 years.  The evidence before the sentencing judge revealed that she had an appalling background of violence and deprivation.  The circumstances of her upbringing were such as to deprive her of any real opportunity for normal development.  She was introduced to petrol sniffing at the age of five.  Her parents separated when she was seven and she has not seen her father since.  At the age of nine she was introduced to cannabis by a well-meaning uncle who thought it would be less harmful to her than sniffing petrol.
15Throughout her childhood she was sent from relative to relative.  In unsettled family circumstances, she was subjected to sexual abuse, violence and other forms of emotional and physical abuse and neglect over an extended period.  Her only employment has been as a sex worker.  She began hearing voices at the age of 13 and has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.  An aspect of her delusional thinking is fear of police.  Her intellectual functioning is borderline.  A psychiatrist has expressed the view that her petrol-sniffing may well provide an organic explanation for her low level of intellectual functioning.  She has an extensive history of drug and alcohol abuse.
16There were several reports before the sentencing judge as to the applicant's mental state.  A Mental Health Nurse who assessed the applicant on 2 April 2012, the day after the offence, formed the view, in consultation with Professor Greenberg (a consulting and forensic psychiatrist) that the applicant would be found to be a ""mentally ill person"" in accordance with s 14 of the Mental Health Act 2007, requiring care, treatment and control.  
17There was also a report from Dr Furst, a forensic psychiatrist, who had assessed the applicant's mental health at a later point in time.  Amongst other things, he reported:
[The applicant] recalls ""sitting there for ages"" on the day in question.  She said that she was ""trying to control myself"" but a voice said, You've got to do it."" She also claimed that the voices were saying ""Bash her or something"" and that she believed Steven [a friend of her uncle, who had sexually abused her] was trying to kill her at the time. 
She acknowledged drinking alcohol (about one 6-pack) and using ""ice"" (about one gram) on the night ... stating she was ""singing and swearing to myself because of the ice.""  [The applicant] said that she was ""worried about Police in general"" at the time.  She said that the officer in question ""embarrassed her at first"" when she tried to walk through the traffic but had to walk around.  She then thought to herself, ""This bitch needs a hiding ... her attitude.""  
She regretted her actions, stating, ""I didn't mean to do it ... I should have walked home.""  She has spent a lot of time thinking about her actions since her arrest, feeling angry with herself and expressed remorse.  She said, ""I feel very sorry for what I've done.  I've normally got a big heart.  I don't go round harming people.""  
She was relieved that the victim's blood tests for Hepatitis C were apparently negative.  She also said, ""I wasn't thinking at the time ... I was on ice and thinking stupid things.""
18Dr Furst considered the applicant's post-arrest paranoid thoughts, psychiatric treatment and medication.  He was of the opinion that the applicant had a long history of paranoid schizophrenia with only borderline intellectual function.  As to her mental state at the time of the offence, Dr Furst considered that she was acutely intoxicated by both alcohol and crystal methylamphetamine and was exhibiting psychotic symptoms.  He noted that she was found to be psychotic on the day after the offence and thought she remained psychotic when he interviewed her.  
19Dr Furst concluded that the applicant ""probably suffered from a relapse of her schizophrenia at the time [of the offence] and was acutely psychotic as well as acutely intoxicated"".  However, he thought ""it was more likely than not that she was aware of the wrongfulness of her actions"" and that her statements to the police before the offence ""indicated some knowledge of the wrongfulness of her actions and potential consequences for her actions"".  Dr Furst concluded that the applicant was disinhibited and that her judgment was impaired at the time of the offence because of her schizophrenia and acute intoxication, together with her chronic low level of function in the community and limited mental intellectual abilities which would tend to make her more impulsive.
20There was also evidence before the sentencing judge of the support that could be made available to Ms Convery upon her release from custody.  The judge raised the question whether he should ""be the person that makes the decision as to the conditions of her parole"", presumably alluding to the terms of s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (which requires the Court to make a parole order when imposing a term of imprisonment for 3 years or less).  Counsel for the applicant appeared to acknowledge that the structure of any sentence of less than 3 years would not allow adequate time for supervision on parole.
21As already noted, for the offence of using an offensive weapon to commit an indictable offence, the judge imposed a ""fixed term"" (that is, one in which the court declines to set a non-parole period as allowed under s 45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act).  The term of the sentence was two years commencing on 1 April 2012.  
22For the offence of assaulting a police officer occasioning actual bodily harm, his Honour sentenced Ms Convery to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and a balance of term of three years and six months, giving a total sentence of five years and six months.  That sentence was fixed to commence on 1 October 2012, six months after the first.  
23The aggregate sentence was accordingly a total sentence of six years with an aggregate non-period of two years and six months.  In describing that as the aggregate non-parole period, I am assuming his Honour intended that a so-called ""fixed term"" (not an expression used in the Act) should be equivalent to the non-parole period for that offence, in accordance with the prevailing law.  The correctness of that approach has been doubted: see the remarks of R A Hulme J in Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 at [56] to [58] where his Honour noted that s 45 simply permits the court to decline to set a non-parole period.  Hulme J observed that neither s 45 nor its predecessor conferred, in terms, any discretion to reduce a sentence by not including within it an additional term or parole period.  There is force in those observations.  Extra-curially, the sentencing judge in the present case has expressed his agreement with them, evidently accepting however that the prevailing law is that a fixed term will represent the non-parole period for the offence: see ""The Art of Sentencing"", a paper presented by Judge Peter Berman SC at the Local Court Conference in 2013.
24In any event, it is clear enough from the judge's remarks on sentence in the present case that his Honour intended to impose sentences of an aggregate non-parole period of two and a half years and a total aggregate sentence of six years (ROS at 7).  
25The judge noted that the effective non-parole period would be ""less than half"" the total term.  Based on the aggregate of the sentences, the non-parole period is indeed 42 per cent of the total.  His Honour accepted that this was unusual but said that these were ""very special circumstances"", finding that it was in the interests of the community that Ms Convery be supervised and closely watched for an extended period while she is on parole.
26In my respectful opinion, the sentence reflected a careful exercise of discretion in which acutely competing considerations were anxiously balanced.  Unfortunately, however, his Honour omitted in his remarks on sentence to refer to Ms Convery's pleas of guilty.  It was common ground that she had pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.  Absent some contrary consideration, that would ordinarily have entitled her to a discount of 25 per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of the pleas, in accordance with the principles stated by this Court in R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2009) 49 NSWLR 383.
27It may be assumed that judges in this State are aware of the decision in Thomson and Houlton (the sentencing judge in fact appeared as counsel in that case).  A consideration of the length of the head sentence reveals, however, that a discount of 25 per cent cannot have been applied.  The head sentence was five years and six months.  If that were the sentence reached after applying a discount of 25 per cent, the starting point would have been 7 years and 4 months, which is more than the maximum penalty for the offence.
28There does not appear to be any reason why his Honour would not have allowed a discount.  Although the allowance of a discount is within the sentencing judge's discretion, a decision not to allow it in a case such as the present would have to be explained.  I do not think that is what the judge had in mind.
29Further, as noted by the Crown, there does not appear to be any basis for concluding that his Honour intended to start at or close to the maximum penalty for the offence.  The Crown did not submit that this was the worst category of case.  The judge's acceptance that the applicant's moral culpability for the offence was reduced on account of her personal circumstances militates against that analysis of the sentence imposed.
30In all the circumstances, the only available conclusion in my view is that the sentencing judge erred in the mathematical aspect of determining the appropriate sentence, either overlooking the step of applying the discount or miscalculating it.  In reaching that conclusion, I do not intend any criticism of his Honour, acknowledging the immense sentencing workload of the District Court.
31Patent error having been established, it remained necessary to consider, pursuant to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, whether any lesser sentence was warranted.  On the evidence before this Court, I was of the opinion that a lesser sentence was warranted, having regard especially to the maximum penalty of seven years, the applicant's reduced moral culpability and her entitlement to a discount of 25 per cent for entering a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity.  
32I considered that the appropriate course was for this Court to intervene so as to impose approximately the sentence that would have been produced had the sentencing judge turned his mind to the calculation of the discount based on a starting point of five years and six months.  In that event, the total sentence would have been in the order of four years and two months.  The Crown submitted that this Court should preserve the ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term for that individual sentence.  That ratio was 36 per cent, which would give a non-parole period of eighteen months, but that overlooks the structure of the sentences.  In my view it is clear that his Honour, having structured the sentence so as to include a fixed term, was more concerned with the aggregate ratio.  I did not think it was appropriate to preserve the exact ratio of the individual sentence in the circumstances.  To do so would have eliminated any accumulation between the two sentences.  His Honour thought some degree of accumulation was appropriate and that view was plainly open.
33I considered that the appropriate sentence was a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of twenty months commencing on 1 October 2012 and a balance of term of thirty months giving a total individual term of four years and two months.  The result is that the applicant will first be eligible for release to parole on 1 June 2014.  The aggregate sentence on that basis gives an aggregate non-parole period of two years and two months (previously two years and six months) and an aggregate total term of four years and eight months (previously six years).  The ratio of those terms is 46 per cent, which means that the aggregate non-parole period remains less than half the total, as his Honour intended.  The applicant will still have a considerable period of supervision on parole.  
34For those reasons, the orders I proposed were:
(1)That leave to appeal be granted.
(2)That the appeal be allowed.
(3)That the sentence imposed at first instance for the offence of assaulting a police officer occasioning actual bodily harm be quashed and in lieu thereof that the applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of twenty months commencing on 1 October 2012 and expiring on 31 May 2014 and a balance of term of thirty months expiring on 30 November 2016.

		29 May 2014",2014-05-26 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705034,WA v R [2014] NSWCCA 92,"Judgment

1THE COURT: The applicant pleaded guilty to manslaughter, contrary to s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), on the twelfth day of his trial for murder. The sentencing judge accepted that he had offered to plead guilty to manslaughter at an early stage, and allowed a discount of 25% for the plea. On 26 October 2012, the applicant was sentenced to a term of 8 years imprisonment commencing on 23 November 2009, with a non-parole period of 6 years. This is an application for leave to appeal against that sentence.

Factual background

2The applicant shot and killed Mr Slobodan Simic on 2 August 2009 on a public street, following an altercation involving the applicant's brother and cousin. Each of those men pleaded guilty to manslaughter, and had earlier been sentenced to terms of imprisonment of 6 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 4 years, and 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months, respectively.

3The sentencing judge proceeded on the basis of a statement of agreed facts, supplemented with some findings based on evidence adduced at the trial (the defence took no objection to that course). The essential facts may be summarised as follows. On the evening of Saturday 1 August 2009, the applicant's car was set on fire. On the following Sunday morning, there was an altercation between the applicant's brother and cousin, and the deceased, who lived some 200 metres from the applicant, in Cabramatta West. The applicant's brother and cousin went home, armed themselves with a baseball bat and a machete, and returned to where the deceased was staying. 

4At this time, the applicant armed himself with a loaded semi-automatic .22 calibre rifle which had been shortened with a degree of skill and was fitted with an effective silencer. The sentencing judge was not satisfied that the applicant loaded the gun himself, but was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was aware it was loaded. 

5The applicant stayed some distance away from his brother, his cousin and the deceased. The deceased was unarmed. A fight ensued. A friend of the deceased entered the scene armed with a machete, which was swung and connected with the baseball bat. The brother and cousin suffered no injuries, but turned and ran back towards the applicant.

6At some stage, the applicant fired four rounds from the rifle. All were fired in the direction of the deceased. None was fired into the air. One narrowly missed a neighbour. One struck the deceased in his back and penetrated his heart. The deceased died in hospital shortly afterwards. The sentencing judge was satisfied that the shots were fired ""very much towards the end of the confrontation or perhaps just after it had ended"".

7After the shooting, the applicant, his brother and his cousin fled. The brother and cousin were arrested the same day. The applicant escaped, and was not arrested until 23 November 2009. He has been in custody since then. Hence, when sentenced on 26 October 2012 with effect from 23 November 2009, he had served just short of half of the non-parole period.

8The applicant was 16 years and 10½ months old when the killing occurred. When sentenced, he was 20 years and 1 month old. The sentencing judge directed that he serve as a juvenile offender until the day he turned 21. At the time sentence was imposed, there remained just under 11 months before the applicant turned 21.

Procedural background

9A Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed on 6 November 2012, which lapsed on 5 May 2013. There was a grant of Legal Aid on 10 December 2012. However, a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal (including proposed grounds and submissions) was filed only on 17 January 2014. The applicant had turned 21 some four months earlier, and had been transferred to an adult correctional facility.

10The Crown opposes the application for an extension of time. It observes that ""[t]here appear to be considerable periods of time when no action was taken, despite Legal Aid being granted on 10 December 2012"".

11The applicable principles are well established. In all cases in which an extension of time is sought, as this Court (constituted by Hoeben CJ at CL, Johnson and Bellew JJ) said in Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 at [53]:

""all relevant factors need to be considered - the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the interests of the community, the interests of the victim and whether, if an extension of time were refused, substantial injustice would result. This last factor will inevitably require an assessment of the strength of the proposed appeal although as Etchell made clear, that assessment can be carried out in a 'more summary fashion' than would be done in an application for leave to appeal that was brought within time.""

Those principles have very regularly been applied: see (for example) Alpha v R [2013] NSWCCA 292 at [1]-[2], [15] and [80]-[81]; Golossian v R [2013] NSWCCA 311 at [27]-[28]; Outram v R [2013] NSWCCA 329 at [18]-[24]; Simon v R [2013] NSWCCA 328 at [23]; Jawish v R [2014] NSWCCA 62 at [7]-[9]; Miles v R [2014] NSWCCA 72 at [55]-[63]. 

12Further, in Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [8], Johnson J said, in a passage which has likewise been regularly applied:

""the Court will usually require some satisfactory explanation as to why an appeal was not brought within the time allowed.""

13After judgment was reserved in this matter, special leave was granted in Kentwell v The Queen and O'Grady v The Queen [2014] HCA Trans 113, following a hearing during which a challenge was made to some of the decisions referred to above, notably, Abdul. Nevertheless, we propose to apply the principles reproduced above, for the following reasons.

14First, those principles represent the settled approach of this Court. Secondly, they were expressly invoked by the Crown's written submissions (paragraph 6), and were not disputed by the applicant's written submissions in reply, or in oral address. Thirdly, those principles insist on regard being had to the merits of the proposed appeal (""inevitably""), and the decisions illustrate that although the merits may be dealt with ""in a more summary fashion"" than in circumstances where no extension of time was required, nevertheless in most cases the merits remain the Court's primary consideration. Fourthly, the approach is directly informed by the principle of finality (especially, by what was said in Etchell v R [2010] NSWCCA 262; 205 A Crim R 138 at [19]-[24]), and there is nothing in more recent decisions of the High Court to detract from that principle's continuing application in this area. Indeed, the force of the principle of finality is reinforced by the reliance placed upon it by all five members of the Court in Achurch v The Queen [2014] HCA 10 at [36] and [42]. Fifthly, to the extent that it is contended that an application requiring a substantial extension of time should be treated identically to one brought within the time limits imposed by the Legislature (a proposition which appears to have been central to the applications for special leave granted in Kentwell and O'Grady), we would respectfully disagree. Some weight must be given to statutory time limits; to do otherwise is to flout the legislative command. As was said in Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62; 209 A Crim R 424 at [38]:

""The time limit for the bringing of an appeal to this Court under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 reflects the principle of finality in litigation: R v Unger [1977] 2 NSWLR 990 at 995-996; R v Gregory at [39]-[41]. There is provision for extension of time to appeal and this power should be exercised with the interests of justice in mind, given the usual consequences of conviction following trial on indictment. However, the longer time passes without an appeal being filed, the more solid ought be the expectation of the community, witnesses, victims and the families of victims that the criminal proceedings are over. This is a significant consideration to be taken into account on a leave application. Should an appeal against conviction succeed and a retrial is ordered, witnesses will be required to testify once again, with the further passage of time resulting from a delayed appeal having the potential to affect detrimentally the administration of justice.""

15The question of the extension of time arises acutely on this application, where by reason of the delay, the applicant has served almost three-quarters of the non-parole period of imprisonment. He was transferred to an adult correctional facility when he turned 21, almost a year after he had been sentenced and some 9 months after the grant of Legal Aid. Nevertheless, an important aspect of the proposed grounds of appeal contends that the whole of the non-parole part of the sentence should have been served in a juvenile institution. There was ample time for the leave application to be determined within the time established by legislation, and before the applicant turned 21. That invites an examination of the circumstances in which that time was permitted to elapse.

16The affidavit in support of the application does not provide a full explanation for the delay. It is made by an employed solicitor who says that she ""now has delegated carriage"" of the proceeding. The affidavit does not say when the solicitor first became involved in the proceeding. It does not identify the solicitor who presently has carriage of the proceeding. It does not identify who was involved in prosecuting the proceeding when the firm accepted instructions, in around November 2012.

17The affidavit identifies a deal of correspondence between 1 May 2013 and 7 January 2014, although the only letter annexed is one dated 20 June 2013. That letter is not signed, nor is its author identified. However it may be inferred (from the identifying initials) that the deposing solicitor did not at that stage have even delegated carriage of the proceeding. The affidavit contains no real explanation for the delay between 10 December 2012 (when there was a grant of Legal Aid) and briefing senior counsel on 1 May 2013. The only matter that is mentioned that took place in this five-month period was the receipt of a ""Non-Acceptance of Brief Form"" from the Public Defender's Office on 11 March 2013. There is no precise description of what was sent to that office, or when. There is no explanation at all of what happened in the eight weeks thereafter, before a brief was sent to senior counsel. 

18It appears that no request was made for copies of the transcripts and exhibits until May 2013, more than six months after the firm had been retained and had caused a Notice of Intention to Appeal to be filed. 

19There is no explanation of why it took until 10 January 2014 for the solicitor to have discovered that the Notice of Intention to Appeal had expired in May 2013. 

20In short, there is no satisfactory explanation of what must be regarded as substantial delay in circumstances where that delay (a) occupied the larger part of the unserved non-parole period of the sentence the subject of the proposed application for leave to appeal, and (b) caused this application only to be heard after the applicant had turned 21 and was transferred to an adult facility.

21It remains necessary to consider the strength of the proposed grounds of appeal, in exercising the discretion whether or not to extend time. Notwithstanding the regrettable and substantially unexplained delay, if appellable error were shown, the interests of justice would favour granting the extension that is sought. 

22In January 2014, a proposed Notice of Appeal with five grounds was lodged, accompanied by submissions developing them. The Crown supplied written submissions in response.

23On the afternoon before the application was listed for hearing, a document styled ""Applicant's Reply"" was filed by senior counsel newly briefed to appear. Helpfully, the document indicated that only one of the five proposed grounds of appeal was now pressed. It is fair to observe that, notwithstanding its title, in substance it amounts to a new submission in chief (it is a document of eight pages and does not purport to respond to the five paragraphs in the Crown's submissions which had dealt with the previous formulation of that ground); counsel candidly acknowledged as much. It is also fair to observe that it advances the applicant's case on that ground as effectively as may be done. 

24The sole proposed ground that is now pressed is that the sentencing judge erred in failing to find special circumstances. 

The sentencing judge's Remarks on Sentence relevant to special circumstances

25The sentencing judge had regard to the applicant's expressions of remorse, although his Honour said that it was noteworthy that he did not hear from him in the witness box, that he was on the run for some weeks after the offence, that when arrested he did not make a full confession of what he had done and that a report from juvenile justice said:

""whilst [the offender] expressed remorse at the consequences of his actions, he appeared to normalise the use of a firearm and level of violence in the current offence.""

26Nevertheless, the sentencing judge was satisfied that the applicant was remorseful. His Honour was plainly aware that at the time of the offence, the applicant was aged 16 years and 10 months, had been held in custody for almost 3 years, and was from a profoundly disadvantaged background, having been exposed from a very early age to many forms of abuse of alcohol, illicit drugs and criminality. His Honour said:

""so extensive was that exposure that, by the time of the offence, the offender regarded a life of crime and the abuse of illicit drugs as essentially normal. I am satisfied that his life has been almost completely bereft of appropriate role models. In particular, his mother has long struggled with a dependency on alcohol."" 

The sentencing judge recorded that the applicant had never had gainful employment, and had been abusing illicit drugs for some years prior to the shooting. He had a not insignificant criminal record, including a large number of property offences and offences involving violence (including resisting police, escaping police custody and stalking or intimidation). His Honour noted that the applicant was on probation when the offence was committed. However his Honour said that:

""the criminal record of the offender, although lengthy, does not demonstrate that he has been repeatedly sentenced to detention with no effect. Nor are the convictions for offences suggestive of violence of great seriousness.""

27His Honour referred to being impressed by the evidence of the applicant's aunt whom he described as ""someone who has been able to divorce herself from the criminality that engulfs the rest of the extended family of the offender"". The sentencing judge also referred to the good progress made by the applicant while in the structured environment of children's detention centres (including completing Years 10 and 11 of high school). 

28His Honour expressly had regard to the special principles contained in s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW), and noted that the offence was caused at least partly by the applicant's immaturity, combined with the powerfully antisocial upbringing to which he had been subjected through no fault or choice of his own, and that he was motivated by a wrong-headed desire to protect his brother and his cousin. However, his Honour also noted that the repeated firing of what his Honour described as ""effectively a semi-automatic pistol"" down a suburban street could hardly be described as the crime of a child, and that the applicant was almost 17 and had left school some time before. His Honour said expressly, ""had the offender not been a child at the time of the offence, the sentence would be substantially longer"": at [58]. 

29His Honour had regard to the sentences imposed upon the applicant's brother and cousin following their pleas of guilty to manslaughter. His Honour said at [61]:

""Despite the submission of defence counsel in this matter, it seems to me that any non-parole period imposed on the offender that was shorter than the non-parole periods imposed upon his brother and his cousin would, bearing in mind the brief overview of the objective and subjective features of their matters that I have provided, demonstrate erroneous disparity. I say that whilst taking full account of the age of the offender. The fact is that the brother and the cousin were involved in a violent and unacceptable confrontation with a fellow citizen and foresaw the possibility of something worse happening; in stark contrast, the offender sprayed bullets down a suburban street and took the life of that citizen.""

30His Honour directed a section of his reasons to special circumstances. Since that is the sole remaining proposed ground of appeal and it is submitted that that reasoning discloses House v The King error, it is convenient to reproduce that reasoning:

""62. Defence counsel submitted that special circumstances are made out, and that it would be appropriate to reduce the length of the non-parole period to some degree. He drew attention to the pressing need that the offender will have for assistance if he is to escape his upbringing, and the aspects of his personality that have been the result. It is also clear that the offender, upon release, will still be a very young man, with his whole life ahead of him. Finally, it is clear that this sentence will constitute the first substantial deprivation of liberty that the offender will have suffered in his life. There will be a very significant process of readjustment when he is released. The Crown Prosecutor did not resist the submission about special circumstances. 

63. The submission of defence counsel has a great deal of force. As I have said, the offender has already shown potential whilst in custody, and it is to be hoped that that is the starting point of a new life that will be able to be built upon when he is released. It is also true that, by the time he is released, the offender will have been cut off from the community for a substantial period, and his readjustment will be difficult and challenging. 

64. However, the sentence that I shall impose in a moment will feature a time on parole that is not insignificant. Furthermore, I have come to the view that to reduce any further the non-parole period that I propose to impose would not adequately reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and the moral culpability of the offender, even taking into account all of the subjective aspects, including his age. In that regard, I have considered what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in such cases as Maglis v R [2010] NSWCCA 247 and R v West [2011] NSWCCA 91. Of course, I have no intention of achieving a variation of the usual statutory ratio by impermissibly increasing the head sentence that I otherwise consider appropriate.

65. Having reflected on the matter, I do not propose to disturb the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period.""

31It was common ground before the sentencing judge that if a non-parole period were to be imposed that could result in the applicant not being transferred to an adult correctional centre, it would need to be no longer than 4 years and 3 months (that reflecting the date on which the applicant would become 21 years and 6 months of age and the operation of s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act). His Honour said at [67]:

""I do not consider that such a non-parole period would appropriately reflect the objective gravity of the crime of the offender, even taking into account his age at the time of the offence, his remorse, the utilitarian discount, and his background. I also consider that any such non-parole period would demonstrate erroneous disparity with regard to the sentences imposed upon his brother and his cousin.""

32However, his Honour did find, for the purposes of s 19(3)(a) of that Act, that special circumstances were established justifying the detention of the applicant as a juvenile offender up until the day he turned 21. His Honour said:

""I have made that finding on the basis of the need to avoid disruption to the progress that has already been made; the fact that he was not transferred to an adult gaol upon turning 18; the fact that he needs time to prepare himself for the transfer to an adult gaol when he turns 21; and the fact that I believe that it would be unduly harsh for him to be peremptorily transferred to an adult gaol on the same day that I impose sentence.""

Appellable error in failing to find special circumstances?

33Section 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) provides merely that the balance of the term of a sentence of imprisonment must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances. Thus the finding of special circumstances is a precondition or ""gateway"" or, as it has been said, a ""statutory fetter upon the sentencing discretion"" to the exercise of a discretionary power to impose a longer non-parole period: R v GDR (1994) 35 NSWLR 376 at 379.

34There was no obligation upon the primary judge to make a finding, although (as his Honour noted), it was common ground that a finding of special circumstances was available on the evidence. There was of course an obligation upon his Honour to resolve the submissions advanced before him. His Honour did so.

35Little attention was given in the written submissions to the nature of the role of an appellate court where the failure to make a finding of special circumstances is challenged. Senior counsel for the applicant, correctly, observed that it was not strictly a question of House v The King error in the exercise of discretion. Either the Court is satisfied that there are special circumstances, or it is not; cf Foley v Ellis [2008] NSWCA 288 at [3]; Finch v Telstra Super Pty Ltd [2010] HCA 36; 242 CLR 254 at [29]; DSG Holdings Australia Pty Ltd v Helenic Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 96 at [85]-[86]. However, counsel acknowledged that little turned on this aspect, especially having regard to the analysis by Spigelman CJ in Simpson v R [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [57]-[73], who concluded at [73]:

""The decision is first one of fact - to identify the circumstances - and, secondly, one of judgment - to determine that those circumstances justify a lower proportionate relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence. There are well known restraints on an appellate court from interfering with decisions of this character. As a practical matter there are unlikely to be many cases in which this Court will interfere unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive.""

36Accordingly, counsel for the applicant was content to proceed on the basis that it was necessary to identify House v The King error in the reasoning process leading to the failure to find special circumstances. It is convenient to proceed on that basis, without necessarily endorsing it. 

37The sentencing judge's reasoning process was said to disclose four errors of principle. The first error identified was in [65] of the sentencing judge's remarks, that his Honour did ""not propose to disturb the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period"". True it is that statute does not impose any particular ratio as a default position. However, it seems that the whole of the debate before the primary judge on this issue was directed to a finding of special circumstances so as to permit a ratio of less than 75%, which explains the judge's language. Such language is common in this area (see eg Simpson at [68] per Spigelman CJ (""justify a lower than statutory proportion"")). In any event, nothing turns on the point, for the sentencing judge gave the applicant the minimum non-parole period available absent a finding of special circumstances.

38The second submission advanced in support of the proposed ground of appeal was based on the reason given by the sentencing judge at [64] that ""the sentence that I shall impose in a moment will feature a time on parole that is not insignificant"". It is said that the primary judge did not make a finding that a parole period of two years would be sufficient to satisfy the considerations accepted by him to support a finding of ""special circumstances"". This does not disclose error.

39It was open to the primary judge to form the view that the two years on parole was not insignificant. Indeed, that is plainly the case. There is no requirement, expressly or impliedly, to make a further finding about the prospects of rehabilitation in that two-year period. The applicant's written submissions proceed to assert that ""[t]here is no line of authority in NSW supporting a general view that parole periods longer than two years are inappropriate"". This, again, does not address the question demanded by House v The King, which is whether error is disclosed by finding in this case that the two-year period on parole was not insignificant.

40The third alleged error identified in the applicant's submissions turned on the second sentence in [64]; it was that ""[t]he sentencing judge has, in substance, committed the reverse error to that of the sentencing judge in R v West [2011] NSWCCA 91 - given 'undue emphasis' to objective seriousness"". Once again, this does not disclose error.

41This sentence within the remarks of the sentencing judge must be read as a whole. The applicant's submission would have more force if the concluding words ""even taking into account all of the subjective aspects, including his age"" were omitted. Read as a whole, there is no undue focus on objective criminality. The submission in substance is merely an invitation to review the broad discretion conferred upon the sentencing judge on the merits. 

42The fourth alleged error identified is based on a passage in the sentencing judge's remarks which precedes the section on ""Special circumstances"", at [61] which is reproduced above. It is his Honour's conclusion that ""any non-parole period imposed on the offender that was shorter than the non-parole periods imposed upon his brother and his cousin would, bearing in mind the brief overview of the objective and subjective features of their matters that I have provided, demonstrate erroneous disparity"". This was said to be ""a particularly serious error""; it was said that the sentencing judge used the non-parole period imposed on the co-offenders as an effective starting point. 

43We accept that if that was what the sentencing judge did, it would disclose error. However, we respectfully disagree that the Remarks on Sentence should be read in the way for which the applicant contends. To the contrary, the submission reflects a misreading of the Remarks on Sentence read as a whole. 

44Although perhaps there is a measure of infelicity in this sentence of the sentencing judge's reasons, we consider that all that his Honour was doing, on a fair reading of those remarks, was (a) rejecting a submission which had been put based on parity, and (b) succinctly summarising the relative culpabilities of the applicant, his brother and his cousin, and emphasising the objective seriousness of the offence. Although one criticism made in writing (but not orally) was that the applicant (and not his brother nor his cousin) was a child, his Honour expressly (in the immediately following sentence in [61]), took ""full account of the age of the offender"". The point of the statement is manifest by the concluding sentence of the paragraph:

""The fact is that the brother and the cousin were involved in a violent and unacceptable confrontation with a fellow citizen and foresaw the possibility of something worse happening; in stark contrast, the offender sprayed bullets down a suburban street and took the life of that citizen.""

45The judge's reasoning reflects what Spigelman CJ described in Simpson v R [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [63] as:

""the ultimate constraint that the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence.""

46This Court heard elaborate argument developing this submission, not all details of which are summarised in the foregoing, although we trust that its essential aspects have been. We take that abbreviated course for two reasons.

47The first is that we are conscious that this is not an appeal, but an application to extend the time, and so it is not necessary, and arguably not appropriate, to address the submissions in the same level of detail as an application for leave to appeal against sentence which has been regularly brought. The second is that let it be assumed, favourably to the applicant, that some error be established in relation to special circumstances. Notwithstanding the bleak circumstances in which the applicant found himself, we do not consider that any lesser sentence (which in the present context means a finding of special circumstances and a smaller non-parole period) is warranted. We bear in mind that the applicant (a) had the benefit of backdating the whole of the sentence to the day he was arrested, (b) was in breach of the terms of his conditional liberty when the killing occurred, and (c) had received the benefit of a finding of special circumstances for the purposes of s 19(3)(a) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. 

48For those reasons, the applicant has failed to demonstrate a sufficiently arguable case to warrant the substantial extension of time required to bring this application. The interests to which this Court must have regard in the exercise of the discretion invoked by the applicant include not merely those personal to him, but also the interests of the community as a whole and of the victim's family. Leave to extend the time within which to appeal is refused.

2705039,R v Villalon [2014] NSWSC 727,"Ex TEMPORE Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Ms Manuell SC for the accused has asked me not to leave provocation to the jury. The first question is whether there is evidence which is capable of constituting provocation. The test has been summarised as being whether: 

""on the version of events most favourable to the accused which is suggested by material in the evidence, a jury acting reasonably might fail to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the killing was unprovoked in the relevant sense"": Stingel v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 312 at 334)


2In my view, there is abundant evidence of provocation, which arises from the testimony of the accused's relatives in the trial, together with the histories provided by the accused to the forensic psychiatrists.

3Ms Manuell submits that there is no evidence that is capable of satisfying the jury that the accused was an ordinary person. She points out that all of the evidence has been that the accused had an abnormality of mind at the time he killed the deceased. Ms Manuell contends that if provocation is left, the jury will be asked to put the evidence of mental illness out of its mind which Ms Manuell says is not possible. Ms Manuell is referring to the second part of the direction to the jury on provocation.



4If provocation is left, the jury would be directed that the law provides that an act causing death is an act done under provocation where:


1. The act is the result of a loss of self-control on the part of the accused that was induced by any conduct of the deceased towards or affecting the accused, and

2. That conduct of the deceased was such that it could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased whether the conduct of the accused occurred immediately before the act causing death or at any previous time.

5In my view, there is evidence from which the jury could capably conclude that the conduct of the deceased was such that it could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to form an intent to kill. The manner of the accused's attack upon the deceased manifests or speaks of a loss of self-control.

6Ms Manuell put to me that the accused does not wish to have provocation left to the jury for tactical reasons, as the focus of this trial has been on the partial defence of ""substantial impairment by abnormality of mind.""

7The difficulty is that the law requires me to leave provocation to the jury. Ms Manuell referred to James v The Queen [2014] HCA 6. However, the majority (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ) in James said at [31]:

""Discharge of the trial judge's role in ensuring fairness to the accused requires that the jury receives instruction on any defence or partial defence, provided there is material raising it, regardless of the tactical decisions of counsel. Amongst other things, this recognises the forensic difficulty of relying on inconsistent defences. The tactical decision not to rely on a defence or partial defence, whether objectively sound or otherwise, does not relieve the trial judge of the obligation to instruct the jury on how, on a view of the facts, a defence or partial defence arises."" (italics added) 


8It seems to me that provocation must be left to the jury.

		05 June 2014",2014-05-27 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705041,R v Bui and Tran [2014] NSWDC 204,"SENTENCE


1HIS HONOUR: Ba Hai Bui appears today for sentence in relation to a charge to which he pleaded guilty on indictment that he between 18 July and 9 August 2012 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales supplied a prohibited drug, namely, heroin in an amount not less than the commercial quantity for that drug. This is an offence contrary to s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. He asks me to take into account in sentencing him for that offence to another offence committed at Bonnyrigg on or about 7 July 2012 of supplying heroin in an amount of 693.4 grams which is not less than a commercial quantity for that particular prohibited drug and this likewise is an offence contrary to s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. 

2Tuan Anh Tran also pleaded guilty at the same time as Mr Bui to a charge alleging that he on 8 August 2012 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales knowingly took part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely, heroin in an amount not less than the commercial quantity for that drug. This is an offence under the same provision.

3These pleas of guilty were entered after the accused were arraigned in front of me and a voir dire examination was partially conducted, in respect of an indictment alleging against Mr Bui one charge of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of the drug heroin, which is now reflected in the Form 1, and another charge of supplying between 18 July 2012 and 9 August 2012 a quantity of heroin, namely, 2.449 kilograms being an amount not less than a large commercial quantity for that drug. Mr Tran had been arraigned and pleaded not guilty for the purposes of the voir dire, I hasten to say as the law requires, to a charge that he knowingly took part on 8 August 2012 to the supply of the prohibited drug heroin in the same amount as I have earlier outlined, being an amount not less than the large commercial quantity of that drug.

4The pleadings reflect what is self-evident from the facts particularly in relation to Mr Bui, that he was substantially involved in the supply of heroin in the commercial quantities outlined in the period of time between 17 July 2012 and 8 August. Mr Tran's pleadings, if I may call them that, specifically alleged against him knowingly taking part in the primary supply concerning Mr Bui but on the day of his arrest.

5In relation to the facts of the matters, I will come back to legal issues relevant to sentencing such as the maximum penalties and the like later, an agreed statement of facts was tendered. However, during the course of the sentence proceedings the Crown Prosecutor sought to supplement those agreed facts with further matters allegedly related to the circumstances of the police search of premises as I understand it controlled by Mr Bui and occupied by others including Mr Tran. This additional evidence I received in reply to the defence case for the reasons set out in the transcript. Those additional facts can only be relevant to Mr Bui in the context the circumstances in which they were tendered. 

6The agreed facts show that two people, Tommy Thai and his sister Huong Van Thai, entered into an agreement after some months of negotiation with undercover police officers to find somebody who would be able to provide them with two blocks of heroin. These two blocks of heroin were supplied by the prisoner, Mr Bui, for the cost of $100,000 each and each block weighed approximately 350 grams. The Thais had entered into an agreement with the two undercover operatives that the heroin would be supplied to the undercover operatives by the Thais and eventually that occurred on 18 July 2012 at a bottle shop in Guildford for the price of $224,000.

7After this supply, which is the matter the subject of the charge on the Form 1, there was discussion then about a further purchase of more blocks of heroin. In relation to the heroin supplied at the bottle shop this was analysed and the blocks of heroin respectively had a purity of 66.5 and 66%, quite a high percentage of purity, and the respective blocks weighed 347 and 346 grams or thereabouts. 

8The $100,000 for each block was provided to Mr Bui between 19 July and 21 July on two separate occasions and Ms Thai, that is Huong Van Thai, continued contact with the accused Bui in relation to the further supply of heroin. Ultimately the undercover officers entered into an agreement with the Thais after 18 July that the Thais would provide them ultimately with 20 blocks of heroin for the cost of $2.24 million. By 7 August 2012 it had been agreed between the Thais and the undercover police officers that the heroin would be handed over at a location described as a factory unit in Botany. The agreed facts state that on two separate occasions before 8 August Mr Bui supplied heroin in powder form which was ultimately less than one kilogram in total. The evidence in the agreed facts says that Ms Thai had attended Mr Bui's home over a number of occasions before 8 August 2012.

9The powder form heroin provided by Mr Bui was then rendered into block form similar to the blocks that had been supplied on 18 July. The agreed statement of facts that I was provided mistakenly refer to 18 June in that context. On 8 August 2012 the Thais, that is Tommy Thai and his sister, travelled from Cabramatta to Mr Bui's house where Mr Bui and Mr Tran then travelled onto a residence at Fairfield. The facts set out the travels of the parties and the changing of cars and the like which is of no real moment. Ultimately Tommy Thai and his sister drove to the factory unit in possession of the heroin that they were ultimately to hand over. It is important to note the heroin that they did hand over was a greater quantity than that had been provided by Mr Bui. The source of the other heroin is not disclosed in the agreed statement of facts.

10Mr Tran and Mr Bui also travelled to the factory unit but parked a short distance away from it. When Mr Tommy Thai and his sister went into the unit they met the undercover operatives. There was another undercover police officer present as I understand the matter. The sum of $784,000 was produced by the undercover operatives and Ms Thai produced seven blocks which contained heroin. The total weight of the heroin was 2.449 kilograms. One block had a purity of 64%.

11The police then arrested the two Thais and went outside the unit and arrested Mr Bui and Mr Tran who were waiting in the other vehicle. It would appear on the agreed facts that it's alleged that Mr Bui and Mr Tran were jointly in possession of seven fake blocks. When interviewed Mr Bui denied any involvement in the supply of heroin while Mr Tran admitted he was aware of the fake blocks and understood that he was to be paid a thousand dollars for transporting them. He denied any knowledge of heroin being involved in the transaction. 

12The maximum penalty for each of the offences on the indictment and the offence on the Form 1 is one of 20 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 3,500 penalty units. The offence has a standard nonparole period of 10 years imprisonment.

13Turning to their criminal histories, Mr Bui has a lengthier criminal history than Mr Tran. Mr Tran has one conviction for possession of prohibited drugs in 2012 for which he was convicted at the Gundagai Local Court on 3 September 2012 having been arrested on 28 July of that year. He was fined a thousand dollars. Mr Bui has convictions which include a conviction at the Liverpool Local Court on 9 September 2004 of supplying a prohibited drug for which he received a s 9 bond for a period of 12 months. He has a conviction at the Burwood Local Court for possessing a prohibited drug for which he received a 12 month good behaviour bond in April 2006. On 11 August 2009 he was convicted of possessing an unauthorised pistol and after being dealt with firstly in the Local Court and then on appeal to the Campbelltown District Court.  He received a sentence of eight months imprisonment which was suspended pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. For not keeping a firearm in a safe condition on the same date he was fined $1500.

14When police arrested Mr Bui and Mr Tran they ultimately went to the premises that Mr Bui lived in at the time of Mr Tran at Bonnyrigg. There are other people as I understand residing at the premises at that time. A number of items were found in those premises consistent with the indicia of the supply of drugs. This Court on 20 February 2004 ordered that $219,000 in cash found in a safe in the main bedroom be forfeited to the State. That cash would, primarily as I understand it be the cash that was provided to Mr Bui for the first supply the matter, on the Form 1. As I earlier indicated the Crown tendered a document which comprised part of the Crown case statement setting out various items that were found including the cash, various resealable bags, mobile phones and other items consistent as I said earlier with the indicia of drug supply in reply to matters asserted by Mr Bui in his history given to the psychiatrist. 

15In the case of Mr Bui and Mr Tran psychiatric reports were tendered prepared by the same psychiatrist. The least I could say about this is that I think this is not a particularly advisable course taken by the psychiatrist to agree to interview two people charged in relation to the same criminal enterprise. No issue was taken by the Crown in relation to this matter. I must say I was somewhat disturbed further to discover when I read more closely the facts in relation to Ms Thai, Ms Thai having been sentenced by the Chief Judge before this matter came before me, that in fact Dr Furst prepared a report in relation to Ms Thai too. I have earlier said in the absence of the prisoners that there must surely be some issue of conflict of interest that arises. I noted that the doctor dated his reports 17 March in relation to both Mr Bui and Mr Tran. In any event I am not criticising the solicitors for retaining Dr Furst. Separate letters of instruction were sent to him and separate solicitors are involved. I just cannot understand how a doctor could interview three people involved in the same criminal enterprise who are separately represented. I appreciate, of course, from my experience that Dr Furst is a medical practitioner of integrity and has a great deal of experience in assessing prisoners, including duties for the Justice Health organisation. 

16In relation to the offender Bui, he found no evidence of mental illness or any significant inherent mental disability. Both offenders gave some history of drug use. In Tran's case he claimed drug use only on occasions somewhat consistent with his criminal history such as it is having previously used amphetamines. The conviction in his record that I have referred to related to his possession of one gram of ""ice"", a form of methylamphetamine. 

17Mr Bui gave a history of heroin use from about 2005 to 2008 stating that he became dependent on the drug. He said that he had decreased his intake by 2012. He referred to the fact that he had had some outpatient counselling concerning his drug usage but he had never been admitted to a drug and alcohol rehabilitation unit. I point out in relation to the histories both prisoners gave and the psychiatric reports that neither prisoner gave evidence and thus the hearsay representations relating to their background and other matters have not been subject to the test that would have been provided if needs be by the Crown Prosecutor. 

18Mr Bui as I understand it was born on 21 November 1979 and is now 34 years of age. Mr Tran is substantially older but according to the records I have is coincidentally born on the same date in 1961. As I would calculate it he is now 52 years of age. Both men were born in Vietnam in different eras as reflected by their migration to Australia. Mr Bui migrated to Australia as an overseas student after finishing high school in Vietnam but he discontinued his studies in Australia. He was married in 2002 but apparently separated from his wife in 2005.

19Mr Tran, given his age, migrated to Australia in less salubrious circumstances having fled Vietnam by boat and came to Australia through Indonesia as a refugee. Mr Tran said that he had had a number of employments in a range of areas such as the construction industry as a welder. He had worked for the Post Office, he had worked for the Soul Pattinson's Pharmacy organisation, he had also run his own cleaning business. He said he had a significant industrial accident a number of years ago when he was extensively burnt. I do not know where this occurred. He could not work for 2½ years and received a modest compensation. 

20Mr Tran offered, in his examination by the psychiatrist no evidence of psychotic or suicidal ideation. His cognition was intact, he described himself as a Buddhist and said he was a positive person. He said, ""If I do good I get good, if I do bad I take the consequences."" 

21According to Dr Furst there were no clear indications for psychological counselling or drug and alcohol counselling although the doctor felt that Mr Tran would do well to undertake the Getting SMART Program within custody. He said the offender had a ""low risk of future offending and has good prospects of being successfully rehabilitated."" 

22With regard to Mr Bui Dr Furst diagnosed ""a substance use disorder."" In relation to the offence or offences that he is for sentence he has told the doctor that he had been using heroin, that he had met some ""bad friends"" that they had put a lot of pressure on him. He said, ""I had no money they would force me to do these things for money."" It was this amongst other aspects of the history that he gave his doctor that were tendered in the report that permitted the material relating to the search, previously not relied upon by the Crown, to be admitted into evidence in rebuttal.

23The agreed facts, themselves, one might have thought self-evidently made the representations made to the doctor by Bui a suspect at the very least. I do not accept Mr Bui's explanations for his involvement of this offence being solely attributable to any use of heroin by himself or any ""pressure"" put on him by the ""Thais"". I have approached the other claims of this prisoner, particularly about his regret for his actions and his remorse, with the same circumspection as I approach his claimed involvement in these offences. 

24Dr Furst reflected upon Mr Bui's history of childhood maladjustment, his addiction to heroin and what Mr Bui had claimed were ""financial difficulties associated with his drug use."" He went on to express views about his participation in the offending which to my view were outside the expertise of the medical practitioner and outside really the legitimate purpose of a psychiatrist's report. He made a finding, which I am prepared to accept, that the prisoner had low self-esteem and presented with depressed mood and had what he described as maladaptive coping skills. He said that these were factors that probably contributed to his offending behaviour although reliance upon the prisoner's representations is vital to their accuracy. The one thing I accept from the opinions of the doctor consistent with his qualifications and purpose in preparing reports for court was the finding of the doctor that the prisoner ""was aware of his actions"" and their ""wrongfulness."" Dr Furst recommended that the prisoner receive the benefit of vocational training, training in English, have sessions with a clinical psychologist and undertake drug rehabilitation and recovery programs. He suggested his maintenance on the methadone program. 

25As to the doctor's opinion as to the prisoner's risk of reoffending, I approach that assessment with considerable circumspection having regard to the prisoner's criminal history, having regard to the facts of the case where the seriousness of which is self-evident and the unreliability of the prisoner in the context of those facts. There can be no doubt that he and to some extent Tran have not told the full story of their involvement of this offending to the doctor and certainly haven't told the full story to this court. 

26One matter that is very relevant in this sentencing process, in the context of the responsibility to assess the objective facts and other relevant considerations, is the sentence that was imposed upon his Honour the learned Chief Judge Blanch J, the week before the matter came before me for trial. Part of the background of this matter is that the trial started before me as I said in the sense that I had to deal with pre-trial issues and then in the course of dealing with those pre-trial issues particular negotiations occurred between the parties leading to the plea to the altered indictment. 

27I accept in relation to this matter that it was anticipated that Ms Thai would give evidence against the prisoners, for that she received a substantial discount, and she received a discount for her pleas of guilty. She pleaded guilty in respect of the transaction on 8 August to the more serious charge of supplying a large commercial quantity of heroin which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment as I understand it as a standard nonparole of 15 years imprisonment. The facts of that matter and the earlier supply on 18 July for which she was charged had common features with the matters involving Mr Bui. I will come back to the remarks on sentence in relation to Ms Thai shortly.

28I had written submissions from all counsel which I have taken into account. Most of the submissions made by the learned Crown Prosecutor were uncontroversial but there were some particular matters in the learned Crown's written submissions that were taken issue by Mr Barker QC who appeared for Mr Bui and to a lesser extent by Mr Price appearing for Mr Tran. Mr Baker challenged on the facts of this case that his client was ""the principal of a well organised group"" and that the matter on the Form 1 confirmed that the prisoner engaged ""in this type of conduct over a significant period of time."" When the learned Crown Prosecutor was challenged as to this aspect of the matter the Crown's position really turned upon the meaning of the word ""significant"" in relation to the latter assertion. Ultimately the issue of the prisoner's role as the principal of a well organised group was confined to his role as the supplier to Ms Thai, there being no evidence that Mr Bui was in any way directing Ms Thai or was superior to her in any particular criminal group. She came to him obviously for the heroin, he was able to source it relatively quickly. With regard to his involvement in criminal conduct, of course, the facts provided to this court can only establish that he was involved in the supply of heroin over the period of time between just before 18 July and 8 August 2012. Whether this is a ""significant"" period of time or not is a matter upon which reasonable minds may differ. It certainly is a substantial period of time. 

29In addressing both the Crown and defence submissions in this regard there can be no doubt that Mr Bui's criminality is of a ""very substantial order."" The significance of the Form 1 matter in relation to the principal offence is that the principal offence cannot be regarded as an isolated incident. The material that was located at the house to which I have made reference confirms that finding. There can be no doubt in the context of the facts of the matter standing alone that the prisoner was substantially involved in the supply of heroin for profit on a commercial basis. 

30Dealing with the matter on the Form 1 just for the moment, in the context of only sentencing the offender for the principal offence, I bear in mind what was said about the treatment of Form 1 matters in the guideline judgment in this regard Attorney General's Application No1 (2002) 56 NSWLR 147. Of course, there have been a number of cases since about Form 1, matters but the matters that I advert to now are still the proper approach to dealing with such matters. In the guideline judgment it was held that the fact there is a matter or matters to be taken into account on a Form 1 will mean that greater weight should be given to the need for personal deterrence and the community's entitlement to extract retribution. The entire point of the process, as was pointed out by the learned Chief Justice, was usually to impose a longer sentence or to alter the nature of the sentence that would have been imposed if the principal sentence had stood alone. It was wrong to suggest that the additional penalty would be small, sometimes it will be substantial. However, he pointed out that the sentencing process is only concerned with the principal offence not to determine appropriate sentences for matters listed on a Form 1 or to determine an overall sentence would be appropriate for all offences and then apply a discount giving appropriate weight to the matters earlier referred to in the judgment. The Court agreed that deterrence and retribution are entitled to ""greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence."" 

31Of course, there are matters that will limit the extent to which this will occur including the maximum penalty for the offence, the principle of totality and the like. It is rarely appropriate for a sentencing judge to attempt to quantify the effect of the sentence from the principal offence of taking into account a matter or matters on a Form 1 offence. Matters on a Form 1 will have a significantly lower salience in the sentencing process for various reasons. But a judge must be careful to assess whether it is appropriate to proceed to sentence on the basis that may bring the administration of justice into disrepute by sentencing a person guilty of a course of criminal conduct on a ""manifestly inadequate, unduly narrow or artificial basis.""

32As I have earlier pointed out the Crown case is in respect of the events of 8 August that it was not Mr Bui who supplied all the drugs that were obtained by the ""Thais"", nor is he responsible for setting up the deals that were negotiated. He was seen, as I said earlier, on two separate occasions as a source for a substantial quantity of heroin. The source for him the prisoner has cast absolutely no light on at this time. I note that the heroin that he obtained for the ""Thais"" was of a very high purity and there would appear to be in all the circumstances little difficulty in him providing the substantial quantities of heroin that he did on more than one occasion. The prisoner could not in any way, even accepting that he was a user of heroin, be classified as some type of user dealer, merely trading in quantities of heroin to purchase or use drugs for his own use. The sum of cash in his possession, the quantities he provided, self-evidently rebut any assertion that may be made in that regard. Although it was not put on that basis in fairness to Mr Barker's helpful submissions. 

33The written submissions of the prisoner, Mr Bui, centred upon matters that really are not in dispute and are germane to the sentencing process. The context of the maximum penalty for the principal offence, the fact that it was submitted that the plea of guilty was entered at the first reasonable opportunity to plea to the particular charge and it was submitted the discount should be 25%. It was submitted on behalf of Mr Bui, amongst other matters, the mitigating factors arising under s 21A(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act included his remorse, his unlikelihood of reoffending and his good prospects of rehabilitation relying upon Dr Furst's report. 

34So far as some of these matters are concerned I cannot conclude on balance, as I am required to for finding mitigating matters, that the prisoner has good prospects of rehabilitation or is unlikely to reoffend. Whilst his plea of guilty implicitly carries with it an expression of remorse, the facts of the matter are that the prisoner's contrition or remorse is not such as to satisfy the requirements of that matter pursuant to s 21A(3). I bear in mind, of course, as I have said earlier the failure of the prisoner to provide full and frank description and detail about the circumstances of his access to the heroin that he was able to provide to the Thai's amongst other matters. Time in custody, as it was pointed out in the submissions, must be taken into account and, of course, as Mr Barker pointed out the issue of parity is of substantial importance in this matter. It is important in sentencing this prisoner to ensure that neither he nor Ms Thai, although I am not concerned about her directly, have any justifiable sense of grievance from my orders. 

35It was submitted on behalf of Mr Bui that he did not significant criminal history like Ms Thai, which is true. As I will point out at the conclusion of my remarks in distinguishing between he and Ms Thai, significantly Ms Thai was on parole for supplying heroin. The prisoner was not subject to conditional liberty. She pleaded guilty to three offences committed over a period of time including in respect of the events of 8 August, pleading guilty to a more serious offence carrying a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The prisoner Bui is not to be sentenced as having any responsibility for the totality of the heroin that she was able to supply to the undercover officers. 

36It was submitted on behalf of Mr Bui that a lengthy period of custody would lead to institutionalisation. This obviously is potentially so, but on the other hand the institutionalisation of an offender who commits serious crimes requiring great weight to be given to general deterrence and personal deterrence is not a matter that ultimately should affect the total sentence to be imposed though it may have some bearing, however, upon the fixing of a non-parole period. 

37It was submitted that Mr Bui needed access to drug and alcohol rehabilitation and it was submitted that I should make a finding of special circumstances. It was submitted that the non-parole period should be less than the standard non-parole period. I will come back to the issue of the relevance of the standard non-parole period in the context of the legislation and the remaining relevance of Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120. In this matter, I have determined in relation to Mr Bui that there should be a finding of 'special circumstances' because in my view the prisoner will need an extended period of parole supervision to assist him to adjust to community living. The term of imprisonment I am imposing upon him is the first term of imprisonment that he would actually serve of any substance. He will need professional assistance to adjust to community living if, in fact, he is interested in undertaking a course of rehabilitation rather than going back to being a drug supplier. Mr Barker submitted that the principal offence was in the middle range of objective seriousness, but by comparison to Ms Thai the prisoner's culpability was much less.

38Mr Tran's counsel skilfully kept a very low profile. He took issue with the Crown's analysis of Mr Tran's role submitting that the prisoner was not a ""trusted lieutenant"" and that his role was significantly less than Mr Bui and Ms Thai. This is self-evidently so in my view from the agreed facts and the pleadings. In my view, his offending is below what could be described as the middle range of seriousness of offending contemplated by the legislation. His criminality was limited to the events of 8 August when he played what could only be described as a minor role. He was not responsible for the provision of heroin to Thai or to Bui on the facts available to me. He was living with Mr Bui at his home as I understand it and his recruitment arose out of his association with Mr Bui in that context on the facts available to me. He offered no support to Mr Bui beyond that described in the pleadings and in the facts. Whilst he had knowledge of the fake blocks in the possession of himself and Mr Bui at the time of his arrest and whilst he would have had some knowledge of the importance of the transaction he was, it would seem to me, clearly to receive little financial benefit. He had no financial stake in the transaction for a start. The written submissions of Mr Price reflected upon his role to assist to deliver the fake drugs to Ms Thai if she felt there was a need to do so, if she felt that they were being set up or there was a robbery taking place. It was submitted on his behalf that he was entitled to the maximum discount for the utilitarian plea of guilty, he had pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity, as was conceded by the Crown. It was pointed out that he had spent the whole time in custody which, of course, will be taken into account. His mitigating factors arising under s 21A(3) of the Act included no significant record of previous convictions, expressions of remorse, good prospects of rehabilitation as well as unlikelihood of offending, relying upon Dr Furst's report, in the submission of Mr Price.

39In relation to Mr Tran, I am prepared to accept in the context of the terms of s 21A(3) that the prisoner has no significant record of previous convictions, notwithstanding his previous drug possession charge and that is consistent with his history of being a methylamphetamine user. I am prepared to accept, given his age and his prior criminal history, he is unlikely to reoffend and he has good prospects of rehabilitation. In the context of the circumstances of his plea I accept there is implicitly an expression of remorse but he does not, on balance, establish the remorse required pursuant to s 21A(3)(i). His plea of guilty, as with Mr Bui, is itself a mitigating factor. 

40It was submitted on behalf of the prisoner he should be seen as a person who might be categorised as (courier) on the basis of the doctor's analysis that the offending was, ""probably opportunistic and largely a consequence of his association with his co-offender"". It is helpful of the doctor to try and express some view about the character of his offending, however I am not sure it is within his expertise. His commission of this offence was as a consequence of his association with Mr Bui. The extent to which it was opportunistic, or not, I cannot determine because, amongst other things, it is not as if the offender was involved only for a matter of minutes. He agreed to travel a considerable distance across Sydney to participate in this crime. As I have said earlier, clearly his criminality is well below that of Mr Bui and further again well below that of Ms Thai. 

41It was submitted on behalf of the prisoner that the prisoner is an uncomplicated man with a work history and a strong work ethic. He had issues that needed to be addressed and it was submitted his offending was at the ""absolute bottom"". It was actually submitted the non-parole period should be less than two years. I could not agree the criminality is at the ""absolute bottom"", but it is at a low level in the scheme of matters contemplated by the section. 

42Part of the problem with the analysis submitted by learned counsel for the prisoner, is that Mr Tran does not explain - not that he has an obligation to - to this Court how he became involved with Mr Bui and why he should be living in a home with a man who was conducting a business, at least evidenced by the two transactions I am aware of, involving substantial supplies of heroin. The house had many items within it consistent with the indicia of supply. I do not blame Mr Tran for that. There is no evidence that what was found inside the house was his. But one might draw the conclusion he must have had some knowledge of Mr Bui's business at least at that time. There is no evidence Mr Tran was involved in any way with the agreements with the Thais to supply them heroin and as I said earlier, no role in sourcing the heroin and the like. 

43I turn now to the Crown's submissions, because as I said they helpfully, in the written form, covered a number of matters which really are not in dispute. The Crown's primary submission is undoubtedly correct; the assessment of the role of a particular offender was germane to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence for sentencing. The Crown referred to features of the matter, such as the character of the drug, its reasonably high purity and the amount of heroin involved, which of course is a relevant matter in assessing the objective criminality, particularly in the case of Mr Bui who was responsible for sourcing heroin to the Thais. In relation to this matter I have concluded, in the context of what he has pleaded guilty to, that his criminality falls at either the very top end of the middle range of objective seriousness or just above it. The middle range of objective seriousness, of course not being a 'narrow band' as the learned Chief Justice said in the decision of Way, which substantially was overturned by the High Court in Muldrock. I bear in mind, of course, in sentencing Mr Bui that he was able to supply this heroin, as I said, on more than one occasion for financial gain, which is what the Crown has submitted. The prisoner had knowledge, not only of what he was supplying and the quantity of it - he could not claim any ignorance of those matters - but there is the added factor of his physical presence at the factory unit to assist the Thais in the transaction when he was arrested with the seven fake blocks. A distinguishing feature between him and Ms Thai is that the prisoner Bui was not involved in the negotiations with the police. His offending is within the middle range of objective seriousness. 

44It was submitted by the Crown that Tran's presence at the property at Bonnyrigg reflected adversely upon him in assessing his criminality. As I point out earlier, the absence of any particularised activity on his part at the property ultimately means I could not draw any conclusion adverse to Mr Tran beyond reasonable doubt as submitted by the Crown. Notwithstanding his awareness of the presence of heroin and his physical presence at Banksmeadow in the possession of the fake blocks, I have already pointed out the absence of his involvement in other features of this matter. His role complying on 8 August just showed he was a person willing to assist the principals by his possession of the fake blocks in the knowledge some form of transaction for the supply of heroin was going on inside the factory unit over which he had no control. 

45There was some tension in relation to the Crown submission concerning the reference to Mr Tran being a ""trusted lieutenant"". I do not know where this expression came from. If it seeks to describe Mr Tran I regret to say it is really a case of hyperbole. There are no facts provided to show the prisoner bore any formal relationship with any ""organisation"" Mr Bui may have been concerned with, not that I can conclude he was associated with any particular organisation in any event. Mr Tran obviously was a friend. But as I have said, the facts and other available evidence do not establish he was ""a trusted lieutenant"" in the sense as I would understand those words, other than being present to assist Bui at the transaction. I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the Crown's categorisation of Mr Tran is accurate. As to what he did inside the co-accused's home would be complete speculation on my part. As I have said earlier, in my view the criminality of Mr Tran falls well below the middle range of objective seriousness. 

46That brings me to the relevance of Pt 4 Div 1B of the Act. I am required to have regard to the amended provisions of that part of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Section 54A(2) in its amended form now provides:

""For the purposes of sentencing an offender, the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the Table to this Division that, taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of the offence, is in the middle range of seriousness.""

47Section 54B(2) provides:

""The standard non-parole period for an offence is a matter to be taken into account by a court in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determine the appropriate sentence for an offender.""

48Those other matters of course are matters that might arise for example under s 21A(3) of the Act as mitigating factors, or mitigating factors available pursuant to s 21A(1). The repeal of the previously worded s 54B of the Act and the phrase ""is to set"" has left the matter now such that the Court is to have regard to the standard non-parole period, not as of determinative significance in the sentencing exercise, but one of a number of matters that are required to be considered in the context of the judgment of the High Court in Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357, particularly in the judgment of McHugh J at [51], having regard to the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v R earlier cited, for example between [20] and [29]. 

49I point out in this matter in sentencing both offenders I have made a finding of ""special circumstances"" which is a relevant consideration in the determination of the non-parole period. I have referred to Mr Bui's nonparole period. The adjustment in a percentage sense is greater for Mr Tran because his criminal history and other material before me leads me to the conclusion he has available to him better prospects of avoiding further offending and of rehabilitation. I am not saying for a moment Mr Bui is without redemption. Mr Tran likewise will need an extended period to adjust to community living. He will need some assistance I would imagine in relation to his choice of associates and perhaps in relation to drug usage and counselling in that regard. With regard to Mr Bui, of course in assessing him, noting his role in sourcing the heroin for the Thais, the quantity and the quality of the heroin in context and the fact the conduct was in the principal offence not uncharacteristic, I have already referred to the assessment of his offending by reference to the middle range of objective seriousness. 

50The Crown submitted the fake blocks were blocks created by one or other of the two prisoners. I note what was found on the search. I accept they attended Botany or Banksmeadow to assist the Thais in the supply of heroin and Mr Bui had an ongoing financial interest in the transaction. I could not conclude beyond reasonable doubt that either one of these prisoners created the fake blocks. It was interesting to note on the facts presented to me by the Crown, it was the Thais who created the blocks of heroin that were given to the undercover officers on 8 August, not Bui or Mr Tran. 

51Submissions were put concerning the Crown contention that the fact the ultimate supply of the drugs to undercover officers does not diminish the culpability of each of the offenders. It is an objective fact the heroin ultimately was not destined to the consumers with the consequent damage to individuals in the community. I wish to place on the record that commendation should be extended to the police for their thoroughness in this investigation. This investigation involved people who were substantially involved in the supply of prohibited drugs. 

52I return now to the sentences that were imposed on Ms Thai for the moment, because they are of considerable significance, notwithstanding the fact I was taken to a number of supposedly comparative sentences. I have borne in mind various comparative sentences that were drawn to my attention plus others I will refer to in a moment. In the context, particularly of setting an appropriate sentence for Mr Bui against which Mr Tran's sentence would be measured, the sentences imposed on Ms Thai are of considerable significance. The Crown points out firstly that Ms Thai was given what could be called an indicative sentence ultimately, being sentenced pursuant to the provisions of s 53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, of twenty-four years imprisonment with a fifty per cent discount for cooperation and pleas of guilty. The indicative sentence for the ""supply large commercial quantity"" offence on 8 August was eighteen years and for each of the other offences to which he pleaded guilty was twelve years. She had an additional charge to the two charges that might be said to be common to Mr Bui, of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, which of course carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. 

53At p 5 of his judgment the learned Chief Judge recites very briefly the fact that a significant quantity of methylamphetamine was found in her premises. This significantly aggravates, if I could use that expression, the totality of the criminality for which he was to be sentenced. The ""common"" offence on 8 August to the two offenders I am concerned with now, that she pleaded guilty, to had a greater maximum penalty. The learned Crown Prosecutor in his oral submissions said the starting point of any sentence to be imposed by Mr Bui would be, considering what the learned Chief Judge had indicated to be an appropriate sentence to which the prisoner Thai pleaded guilty to, supplying not less than the commercial quantity of heroin in July 2012. I have already dealt with the particulars of that. That is the offence which currently concerns the prisoner on a Form 1. 

54There are, as I have said earlier, some very substantial distinctions however to be drawn between Ms Thai and Mr Bui. There was firstly the fact she was on parole for supplying heroin. She committed the offences for which the Chief Judge sentenced her within a year of being released to parole. As I understand it she had been in custody a number of years before she had been granted parole. She was substantially involved in the trafficking of heroin. She was the person who was involved with her brother in negotiating with the police, arranging for heroin to be sourced, had access to sums of cash and sought to substantially profit from these transactions. The negotiations in the facts relating to her suggest Tommy Thai and then she were concerned with dealing with the police over a number of months before the events of July and August. 

55In the context of taking into account her sentence, I do so in the way in which the Court is required to, having regard to decisions such as the High Court judgment of Postiglione, (1997) 189 CLR 292, particularly the judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ (at 601), the general of principles in Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606 and the matters discussed in Court of Criminal Appeal decisions, such as the decision of Jimmy, [2010] NSWCCA 60. Rothman J in that judgment, where the three judges agreed but gave separate reasons, spoke of the concept of parity of sentencing as being another artefact of what is described as ""equal justice"" or the ""Aristotelian"" principle of justice, which, if I may paraphrase his words amounts to treating alike alike and unalike unalike to the extent of their unalikeness. Both in relation to the objective facts and subjective circumstances, even allowing for the serious criminality reflected against Mr Bui, there are distinctions to be drawn between him and Ms Thai. 

56With regard to aggravating factors to be taken into account in relation to the matter, I accept the Crown's submission of the aggravating factor of committing the offence I am to sentence each prisoner for was committed for financial reward. It is quite clear in my view Tran's financial reward was the lesser. 

57The issue of planning and involvement in organised crime looms in the background, but ultimately I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that was relevantly an aggravating factor beyond what is self-evident from the facts of the matter. As Howie J once pointed out, in relation to drug supply matters, there is clearly a degree of planning that must give effect to the principal offence without being of itself an aggravating factor as contemplated under s 21A(2). It must be fairly said this conduct, to which particularly Mr Bui has pleaded guilty, is not conduct that arises by happenchance. There were no other aggravating factors arising under s 21A(2) of the Act. 

58With regard to the particularisation of the role of the offenders, in fairness, the Crown generally accurately described what was self-evident from the agreed statement of facts.

59In sentencing the offenders I am required to have regard to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for the purposes of sentencing and ensuring that matters of general deterrence and personal deterrence are recognised as well as, the denunciation of the conduct of the prisoners, making them accountable for their actions. I am also required to have regard to the consideration of the prospects of their rehabilitation. These factors of sentencing, as the High Court said in Veen No 2, are guideposts that sometimes point in opposing directions but in a lesser extent I would think, particularly in relation to Mr Bui's matter.

60One matter I wish to finally deal with in relation to this matter is what discount should be given for the pleas of guilty. The Crown Prosecutor said in this Court, when the pleas of guilty were entered - and I wrote it on my copy of the indictment - that the pleas of guilty were entered at the first reasonable opportunity. In the course of oral submission the learned Crown Prosecutor obviously forgot that he had said that some weeks before. He sought to argue that the pleas of guilty were not entered at the first reasonable opportunity. There was some unhappiness at the bar table and I reminded the learned Crown of the fact that he had told me that this was conceded by the Crown. In the context of what the Crown was now alleging against the accused it is clear that this is so. Ultimately the Crown was prepared to accept his earlier concession and made no further comment about it, as he said in his own words.

61However, this does not necessarily lead to an automatic discount of 25% on the otherwise appropriate sentence. Anyone who closely reads the guideline judgment in relation to Thomson and Houlton, handed down 15 or 16 years ago, would know that this was so. I need not revisit that particular judgment. However, I have had brought to my attention since the sentence proceedings the decision of Morton ([2014] NSWCCA 8).

62The history of the matter is set out in various paragraphs of the judgment of the learned Chief Judge at Common Law, Hoeben J, but he goes on to discuss the matter in greater detail in principle from [30] onwards and refers to decisions such as Stambolis from 2006, Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 and other judgments.

63In this particular matter what is important to note by way of factual background, although I was given a very slim outline of relevant matters, the prisoners were committed for trial to this Court in relation to the matters - or largely in relation to the matters concerned with the charges in the indictment first preferred. They were presented with that indictment, they were required to plead to that indictment in order for me to deal with pre-trial issues. There was no indication of a willingness to plead to a lesser charge at that point. It was open to the prisoners if they so desired to offer to plead guilty to lesser charged at the committal, or write to the Director of Public Prosecutions and place on record their willingness to plead to the charges that were ultimately preferred.

64I hasten to say I am aware of cases decided by the Court of Criminal Appeal, let alone at first instance, where even though an accused person has been tried and found guilty of an alternative count, if the offer to plead to that alternative count was made before trial or at trial, discounts of up to 25% have been given notwithstanding that a trial was conducted.

65In the decision of Borkowski, Howie J talked about the fact that matters relating to the assessment of the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty, particularly after a person has been committed for trial, include where the offender has waited to see what charges are ultimately brought by the Crown, where the offender has delayed the plea to obtain some forensic advantage, or where there has been some type of plea bargain. I do not suggest there has been a 'plea bargain' in this matter, but there certainly were plea negotiations. The transcript reveals events that occurred before this court. 

66Whilst I accept that the prisoners have pleaded guilty to the charges preferred by the Crown at the first reasonable opportunity, in the context of what had occurred up until the time of the entering of those pleas, including the matters that I have already adverted to, in my view I could not provide a discount of 25% on the facts available to me. I will however provide the prisoners each with a discount of 20% on the otherwise appropriate sentence in accordance with the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton.  Noting the discussion of these matters in Morton v R where, admittedly in totally different factual circumstances but after plea negotiations relating to offences of supplying heroin including placing matters on a Form 1, the trial judge gave a discount of 15% which the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld.

67Having regard to those matters I have identified, namely the submissions of the parties taken into account, I will move to imposing the sentences that are to be imposed. Stand up please Mr Bui. In relation to the offence to which you pleaded guilty, the principal offence, taking into account the matter on the Form 1, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of 5 years 8 months to commence from 8 August 2012 and to expire on 7 April 2018. The balance of sentence you will be required to serve is 3 years and 6 months. As I said, that sentence takes into account the matter on the Form 1. Take a seat thank you very much; you are convicted of course of the offence to which you pleaded guilty.

68Mr Tran, in relation to the offence to which you pleaded guilty you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of a nonparole period of 2 years and 4 months. That sentence will date from 8 August 2012 and expire on 7 December 2014. The balance of sentence as I would calculate it is one year and 8 months, and the balance of sentence will expire on 7 August 2018. Take a seat thank you. I cannot direct that either of you be released to parole. Your release to parole will be a matter for the Parole Authority. It will depend of course on your performance in custody.

69SIMONE: A destruction of drugs order under s 39P, I think this is the finality of all matters your Honour.

70HIS HONOUR: I certainly would order that the drugs that have been seized would be destroyed. I would assume that someone else has made that order in any event. What's happened to Tommy Thai by the way?

71SIMONE: They have all been sentenced your Honour.

72HIS HONOUR: Right. I was never informed of the sentence imposed on Tommy Thai, when was he sentenced?
 
73SIMONE: It was only a couple of weeks ago. 4 April. It was after all these matters were finalised your Honour.

74HIS HONOUR: Ms Thai was sentenced 11 February 2014. The prisoners can be removed.

		08 December 2014",2014-05-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705052,R v Smith [2014] NSWSC 768,"JudGment - Application to Adduce Credibility Evidence

1Miss Traill, counsel for the accused, makes an application for leave to adduce evidence in the cross-examination of Mr Grant Perkins which would otherwise be contrary to section 102 of the Evidence Act 1995, namely, the credibility rule. 

2Miss Traill's application deals with five convictions commencing on the 28 January 2009 and concluding on 13 July 2012. The identified offences for which Mr Perkins was convicted in that period would, in my view, be properly regarded as offences which bespeak dishonesty. They are matters which affect the credibility of Mr Perkins and, consequently the reliability of his evidence, which is a most important factor in the case. 

3Mr Grant Perkins gives some evidence as to what he saw and heard at the time of the shooting. That evidence would, if accepted, be antithetical to the accused's case that, at the time of the shooting, he was acting in selfdefence.

4Accordingly, I am satisfied that cross-examination in respect of those five offences may or could substantially affect the assessment of the credibility of Mr Perkins.

1The proceedings were commenced by summons in February 2006, supported by an affidavit sworn by Mr Spark, the NSW Crime Commission's Assistant Director, Financial Investigations, who deposed to his suspicions that the defendant Jason David Tillot had engaged in a serious crime related activity, namely demanding property with intent to steal contrary to s 99(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), for reasons there explained.

3The parties now ask the Court to make a further order dismissing the application for a proceeds assessment order by consent, Mr Tillot having warranted that his only interests in property as at the date of signing the orders were those specified in the schedule to the order.

4Having considered the terms of the order sought and the circumstances in which they are pursued, I am satisfied that the Court's discretion should be exercised in the terms which the parties have agreed. 

5Accordingly, I make orders in the terms sought, with the result that the restraining order no longer remains in force and the proceeding are brought to an end.

2705057,R v Kostopoulos; R v Smith; R v Treffiletti [2014] NSWDC 360,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Leum Kostopoulos pleaded guilty at the Local Court, and again in this Court, to a charge of attempting to possess a commercial quantity of an unlawfully imported border controlled drug, namely amphetamine in Sydney between the dates of 20 July 2012 and 11 September 2012.
	
	
	The particulars in the Court Attendance Notice refer to what is described as consignment 1 and the attempt by the accused in the context of the matters set out in the Court Attendance Notice to collect a package that was known by the Customs officials and AFP to contain 1.3148 kilograms of pure amphetamine. I need not repeat the particulars themselves, I will deal with them in the facts. This charge also included his attempt to possess consignment 2, a further package to which I will refer to in the facts, which contained 1.0481 kilograms of pure amphetamine.
	
	
	Mr Smith’s charge, to which he pleaded guilty at the Local Court and in this Court, is more simply stated. He admits his guilt to an attempt to possess a substance, being a border controlled drug, namely amphetamine, the quantity being a commercial quantity, the commercial quantity being the commercial quantity relevant to the second consignment particularised in the Court Attendance Notice relating to Mr Kostopoulos, that is 1.0481 kilograms of pure amphetamine.
	
	
	Mr Treffiletti pleaded guilty to a charge of aid and abet an attempt to possess a commercial quantity of unlawfully imported border controlled drug, namely amphetamine. His aiding and abetting the attempt to possess the unlawfully imported border controlled drug is particularised as relating to the two consignments that are referred to in the Court Attendance Notice relating to Mr Kostopoulos.
	
	
	For reasons not explained to me, the consignments particularised in the Court Attendance Notice relating to Mr Treffiletti are described as consignment 4 and consignment 5, but in fact those consignments are consignments 1 and 2 as they are referred to in the other Court Attendance Notice. As far as I am aware, from the facts, there is no suggestion that Mr Treffiletti has been involved in consignments other than those particularised in the Court Attendance Notices.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for each offence to which the offenders pleaded guilty is life imprisonment and/or a fine of $825,000, and I accept, that the maximum penalty provides a yardstick and a basis for comparison between the matter before the court and what the Crown describes as “the worst case”. I would add perhaps the words, “and the worst offender”. The maximum penalty clearly indicates, that the crimes to which the respective prisoners have pleaded guilty are very serious offences and I have taken into account the matters that are averted in this regard in the Crown’s written submissions at paragraphs 9 and 10.
	
	
	The two consignments that I have referred to, arrived in Australia from France on 4 September 2012 and 6 September 2012. The roles of the offenders are, it might be said however, somewhat different. An important difference to bear in mind in the context of the various submissions made about the respective roles, particularly by Mr Kostopoulos and Mr Smith, is that Mr Smith is to be sentenced only in relation to his responsibility respect of the second consignment standing alone.
	
	
	His charge alleges the commission of the offence between 12 September and 13 September 2012, although it is to be pointed out that the facts reveal his involvement before those dates.
	
	
	In relation to the particulars relating to Mr Treffiletti, reference is made to the role of Mr Jordan Maharaj. When I heard the evidence in relation to this matter and the submissions over two months ago, Mr Maharaj was to face his trial. Whether his trial proceeded and what happened in that regard, I do not know. The matter was heard before me the week before I was to travel to Orange for three weeks and unfortunately for the prisoners I had five weeks of leave which required me to leave the jurisdiction. So, regrettably the sentencing of the three offenders has been delayed inordinately through no fault of theirs. I hasten to say, really through no fault of mine. But if I had remained in Sydney, of course I would have sentenced the offenders, at least the following week, if it was possible so to do.
	
	
	The three offenders, as I have mentioned, pleaded guilty at the Local Court. It was submitted by each of them and conceded by the Crown that a discount should be given to recognise the facilitation of the course of justice by those pleas of guilty. I do not wish to dwell upon the various written submissions that were made by the parties or oral submissions that were made, particularly on behalf of Mr Kostopoulos in this regard. But to my mind the matter is summed up, notwithstanding the fact that a Court has a discretion not to grant a discount in sentencing for Commonwealth matters by the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in the Director of Public Prosecutions (Commonwealth) v De La Rosa [2010] 79 NSWLR 1, particularly at [263] where his Honour said;
	


“An early plea of guilty will normally attract a discount of 25%, it will attract a lesser discount when it comes later in the pre-trial or trial process.”


	
	His Honour cites, of course, the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton, which is strictly only concerned with State matters and the “utilitarian value” of the plea of guilty. But in De La Rosa, involving a consideration in a very extensive manner of sentencing for importation offences of commercial and trafficable and marketable quantities of drugs, it was recognised that a discount for the plea of guilty is appropriate and in that case a discount of 25% was given upon the otherwise appropriate sentence. That will be the case here for each offender. 
	
	
	There are other contextual background matters that need to be taken into account. As I understand the matter Mr Smith and Mr Kostopoulos have both been in custody since their arrest on 12 September 2012. Mr Smith’s sentence, however, cannot date from that date because Mr Smith, at the time of the commission of the offence to which he has pleaded guilty, was the subject of parole. This was not a matter specifically addressed, as I remember it, two months ago. But in the discussion that has occurred today, I have referred counsel for the accused and the Crown to the particulars in the custody record which refer to the fact that the offender had a balance of parole of one year four months and nineteen days to serve, his parole being revoked in October 2012. Obviously I would not impose a sentence entirely accumulative upon the balance of parole, but in the context of principles set out in cases such as the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal of Callaghan from 2006, particularly the judgment of her Honour Simpson J, I have determined that the sentence to be imposed upon Mr Smith should commence part way through what has been served as the balance of that parole.
	
	
	I bear in mind, of course, the need to be cautious in this regard because committing serious offences whilst on parole for serious offences, is a matter of substance to be considered in the sentencing process adverse to the prisoner. As Simpson J pointed out in Callaghan judges should be careful not to “double dip” in that regard.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Kostopoulos, as I have already pointed out earlier in today’s proceedings, he committed the offence with which I am concerned whilst on bail for an offence for which he was subsequently sentenced to a term of five months imprisonment. Those other offences, of course, were unrelated matters and are considerably minor matters by comparison to the matter with which I am concerned now. The sentence imposed at the Local Court has been served by the prisoner in circumstances I will outline later. Of course, again, the prisoner should not necessarily receive a sentence from me that is entirely accumulative upon the five months imposed by the magistrate, albeit that the magistrate’s order did not date from 12 September, but dated from a later date.
	
	
	I have determined that the sentence I impose should date from 12 December 2012. That is recognising three months of custody referrable to the offending for which the offender received the five month sentence.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Treffiletti, he was in police custody on two occasions and I am prepared to give him in the ordinary manner recognition of two days in custody. But ultimately, in the context of the orders I propose to make, those matters are of no great moment. Of course, in fixing the non-parole period, as I am required to do in respect to the sentences for Mr Kostopoulos and Mr Smith I have regard to the various decisions, particularly cited in the written submissions that I have been provided, such as the High Court judgment of Hili and Jones, and of course, earlier High Court judgments of Power from the 1970s and the judgment in Bugmy, not the recent Bugmy decision, but the decision on appeal from the Victorian Court of Appeal.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Treffiletti, it is an important contextual matter to take into account that the offender was arrested in September and interviewed but then released. He was not re-arrested until April 2013. It is clear, and the Crown fairly concedes that it is so, that Mr Treffiletti would have been, over that period of time, in a considerable state of uncertainty having regard to the realisation that he had been arrested in relation to his alleged role in the attempt to possession imported prohibited drugs and knowing, of course, that other people had been arrested and charged and some of whom were in custody, such as Mr Kostopoulos and Mr Smith. Mr Maharaj had likewise been charged in the intervening period of time.
	
	
	The prisoner, Mr Treffiletti, was 18 years of age at the time of his arrest in mid-September 2012. He was born on 28 June 1984. He had thus just turned 18 years of age. 
	
	
	Mr Kostopoulos, as I understand it, is a young man himself. He was born on 26 September 1992 and thus was 19 years of age at the time of the offending, about to turn 20 years of age.
	
	
	Mr Smith, as I understand it, was born on 28 September 1984 and thus, at the time of his arrest, was 27 years of age, about to turn 28.
	
	
	There were two sets of agreed facts produced in relation to the matter, one set of facts related to Mr Kostopoulos and Mr Treffiletti, the other set of facts related to Mr Smith.
	
	
	I appreciate, of course, there are a number of authorities such as the High Court judgment in GAS and the Court of Appeal judgment of Chow that make it clear that a sentencing judge is not bound to accept the facts as agreed between the parties but in this matter there appears to me, save for some very minor matters, to be nothing about which the court should second guess what has been agreed.
	
	
	Of course, in sentencing an offender a judge is not entitled to take into account matters that would increase the criminality of the offender in respect of matters which are disallowed by the prosecuting authority. This is a matter about which I must be particularly careful in relation to Mr Smith. Mr Smith, of course, as I will point out, comes forward with far less favourable subjective circumstances that Mr Kostopoulos and of course, Mr Treffiletti, who had no prior criminal convictions. But as I have earlier pointed out, his involvement in what could be called the criminal enterprise with which I am generally concerned, is limited, albeit, that it is argued that his role in that limited respect is greater than that of Mr Kostopoulos.
	
	
	It is clear on the facts, common to all three accused, that the importation of the amphetamine particularised in the Court Attendance Notices, was organised by persons other than the three prisoners. Mr Treffiletti has absolutely no idea as to who the organisers are and I accept the evidence he has given about his role and his knowledge of relevant matters in these sentencing proceedings.
	
	
	As to the issue of their knowledge of the relevant “organisation”, if such a thing exists, concerned with the importations, I am not assisted at all by Mr Smith or Mr Kostopoulos. They did not give any evidence in this Court and provided no reliable version to the investigators.
	
	
	I point out that Mr Treffiletti, when first arrested, gave a lengthy interview to the police and endeavoured, as I understand it, to provide the police as much as he knew about his own involvement and also provided further information when rearrested. It is correct, as the facts reveal, that he indicated prior to his second arrest what appeared to be matters that might, on one view of it, increase his culpability, but which are explained by evidence he has given in this court.
	
	
	I accept his evidence in this court that in one respect, particularly in relation to an area of information set out in the Crown bundle, the information he was relating at that relevant time was information provided to him by others or by, particularly, Mr Maharaj and was information not within his direct knowledge.
	
	
	This is a bizarre case in some respects because the facts reveal, without telling me much more, albeit beyond what was hinted at in the submissions of Mr Treffiletti, that Mr Maharaj prior to the arrest of any of the offenders had gone to a police station, a State police station, to talk about the character of the importation and the enterprise in which he knew he was involved in, at least to some extent. It seemed on the face of it that whoever he spoke to at the police station fobbed him off. But perhaps, as is hinted in one of the written submissions, he put the authorities on notice of relevant matters that led to the arrest of the offenders.
	
	
	Mr Treffiletti was recruited by Mr Maharaj to open up a post office box in his own name, which he did at Five Dock. Mr Maharaj opened a post office box in his own name at Haberfield and a friend of theirs, Mr Milano, opened a post office box at Ashfield. As far as I am aware Mr Milano has not been charged with any offence.
	
	
	Mr Treffiletti was to be paid ultimately $500 for his involvement in his aiding and abetting the attempt to procure each of the two consignments. Although what he did in relation to each of the consignments was somewhat different. The prisoner Treffiletti did not know at the time that he agreed to open up the relevant post office box, that this was to be done for the importation of a particular drug or a particular quantity of drug.
	
	
	As I said earlier he, at that time, was very young. He had no prior criminal convictions and there is absolutely no evidence that he had any direct connection with any organised criminal elements, if there be such in this matter, connected to these drug importations. He was, to be frank, and I do not mean this unkindly of him, a youthful gormless cipher.
	
	
	The first of two consignments of liquid amphetamine, that I have referred to, arrived from France on 4 September addressed to the post office box at Five Dock. That contained 1.314 kilograms of pure liquid amphetamine concealed in wine bottles. The other consignment arrived on 6 September 2012 in Australia addressed to Mr Maharaj at the post office box that he had opened at Haberfield.
	
	
	Mr Treffiletti had opened the post office box at Five Dock on 20 July 2012 and had been told that expensive wine was to be imported by Mr Maharaj. He opened the box at the request of Mr Maharaj. He ultimately collected a retrieval slip for the consignment addressed to that post office box and he signed the retrieval slip and provided that to Mr Maharaj who ultimately gave it to Mr Kostopoulos to collect the package.
	
	
	Mr Kostopoulos had been told by Mr Maharaj that Mr Treffiletti could not pick up the package and thus Mr Kostopoulos went to the post office in early September with the retrieval slip, handed it over. He surprisingly, I suppose in one sense, supplied his own identification by providing his passport to retrieve the parcel. Clearly his identity was then established, bearing in mind that the AFP and the Customs officials were aware of the contents of the package, having intercepted it.
	
	
	He was told the parcel could not be found so he left the post office box. Unknown to him the consignment had been intercepted and identified as containing the liquid amphetamine. It is said that that liquid amphetamine had a street value of approximately $1.315 million and a wholesale value of approximately $409,500.
	
	
	Although the agreed statement of facts refers to a conversation between Mr Smith and Mr Kostopoulos on or about 6 September, I am not satisfied in context that the conversation has anything to do with the first consignment. In fact in the context of the pleadings and the other evidence in the case, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of Mr Smith’s involvement with the first consignment at all.
	
	
	Part of the background of this matter too, is that Mr Smith and Mr Kostopoulos were said to be members of the Rebels ‘Motorcycle Club’, if I could give it that title. Mr Kostopoulos was a ‘nominee’. This is the subject of some evidence by his parents, about which I will speak shortly. Mr Smith had been a full member for some years and had an association with the club over an extended period of time.
	
	
	It was submitted, based upon some hearsay representations made by Mr Smith, that he no longer was involved with the ‘Rebels’, as at September 2012. Ultimately, as the evidence in the case unfolded, there is really nothing about his association with that particular organisation that sheds any real light upon the circumstances of the importation or the attempt by him and Mr Kostopoulos to possess the methyl amphetamine. It provides an explanation for why Mr Kostopoulos and Mr Smith may know one another, but really nothing more.
	
	
	Of course one can have one’s suspicions about the matter, but there is absolutely no cogent evidence that the club itself or other members of the club were directly concerned with the importation or were anticipating to be beneficiaries of the importation. Ultimately nothing flows from the association of the offenders with the club and it might be thought that it does not do them much credit, but it is not a matter that reflects adversely upon their character.
	
	
	It goes without saying, of course, however, that both the prisoners had an opportunity to provide further information in this regard. Of course, no adverse finding can be made about their exercise of their right to silence in these sentence proceedings but, of course, they have not provided any information based upon their knowledge of relevant events that might fill gaps in the narrative which the court knows full well that they could fill.
	
	
	What is clear from the facts, however, is that Mr Kostopoulos became involved when a man referred to as Chris Curcuruto, who clearly had an involvement in the preparations for the importation, was gaoled on or about
	
	
	26 July and could no longer participate. It would appear, as I understand the evidence, that Mr Kostopoulos was recruited or asked to perform the role that he did because Mr Curcuruto could not do so. Whether it was by Mr Curcuruto or someone else, I do not know.
	
	
	Mr Curcuruto’s role is the subject of particular identification by the Crown in its written submissions which were most helpful and there is really no dispute by that by learned senior counsel, Mr Boulten, for Mr Kostopoulos in his submissions. Essentially, his role was to liaise with Maharaj who had organised Mr Treffiletti and Mr Milano and later liaised with Mr Smith about picking up the first consignment and the second consignment of wine bottles, with the role of passing them on to others.
	
	
	The second consignment of wine, which contained the liquid amphetamine when it was imported at least, was passed on by the prisoner to Mr Smith and I accept the fact that, to some extent, he took directions from Mr Smith in relation to that matter.
	
	
	If one was to categorise Mr Kostopoulos’ role, although labels are sometimes unhelpful, he was responsible for preparations for the consignments that he picked up, albeit that he ultimately did not pick up either the first or second consignment himself, and he was to perform the role of a ‘warehouser’ in ensuring that the relevant prohibited drugs were delivered to those who were responsible for what I assume would be their ultimate distribution. The drugs were not imported into Australia for altruistic or medical purposes.
	
	
	The second consignment with which Mr Smith was concerned solely, as I said earlier, arrived on 6 September. This consignment was picked up by Mr Maharaj on 11 September 2012. He held onto the package and, whilst it was in his custody, spoke to Mr Treffiletti about matters relating to the package in his possession. During this series of conversations I am satisfied Mr Treffiletti must have asked him what was in the wine bottles. It was the fact that after the bottles had been picked up Treffiletti and Maharaj were involved in travelling around doing innocuous tasks, such as going to soccer training. The consignment, as valuable as it was, for a period of time was placed on the floor of the rear of the motor vehicle they used. During this trip Mr Treffiletti asked Mr Maharaj what he was going to do with the consignment or the package and Mr Maharaj told the prisoner Treffiletti that he was going to give it to Mr Kostopoulos who he referred to as “Lee”, which is short for the prisoner’s name of Liam.
	
	
	Later that evening, after soccer training, Mr Treffiletti picked up his friend from the park, took him to a meeting with Mr Kostopoulos where Mr Kostopoulos took possession of the second consignment. It was then that Mr Kostopoulos made a call to Mr Smith on Mr Maharaj’s phone. Later that night Mr Maharaj told Mr Treffiletti that he was going to tell Mr Kostopoulos that they were not going to be involved any further.
	
	
	A number of these conversations are recorded in part because of a listening device that was hidden within the consignment intercepted by the AFP. Hence the charges of attempting to possess the relevant border control drug. I have had regard to the various details of those conversations.
	
	
	The facts reveal that on 12 September 2012 Mr Kostopoulos opened up the second package and placed the wrapping that the consignment was in in a garbage bin outside his residence. He was then, of course, subject to police or AFP surveillance. Later the prisoner was seen in company with Mr Smith. He was carrying bottles of wine. Mr Smith inspected the bottles and then, in company with Mr Kostopoulos and another person, travelled from Mr Kostopoulos’ residence to Mr Smith’s residence in Harris Street, Ultimo. The wine bottles were ultimately stored in a lock up garage.
	
	
	All the accused were arrested that day. There were various items found in the search of Mr Smith’s property, a sum of cash, some false documents, mobile phones and the like. The prisoner Smith was in possession of some other drugs; matters of no significant moment in this case.
	
	
	Mr Kostopoulos gave a limited account but made no real admissions. Treffiletti was extensively interviewed. When Mr Smith was arrested the wine bottles that had been delivered to him or taken by him were recovered. He told the police about steroids in his possession, he said they were for his personal use. He did not participate in a record of interview. He denied knowledge of the wine bottles and the bag in which they were found, falsely stating to the AFP that he had not been in the lock up garage that day.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Smith by reference to the separate agreed statement of facts, much of what I have already outlined comes from that statement of facts and the joint statement of facts in relation to the other accused.
	
	
	The street value of the methyl amphetamine that was found in the bottles in his possession is said to be 1.039 million dollars. There is a wholesale value of approximately $324,000.
	
	
	The summary of Mr Smith’s conduct, as alleged by the Crown, was essentially that he made arrangements and instructed Kostopoulos to have the post office box checked to arrange for Maharaj to deliver the consignment. He also asked Mr Kostopoulos to obtain a measuring device for him.
	
	
	Mr Kostopoulos liaised with him when he had possession of the consignment taken from Mr Maharaj. Mr Smith also took delivery, as I said, of the wine bottles and stored them in his garage, presumably of subsequent distribution by himself or others and, of course, there was the contact with Mr Maharaj to which I referred.
	
	
	Mr Kostopoulos has a minor criminal history. He has some appearances in the Children’s Court for acts of violence and driving matters. He has other convictions in the Local Court, again in relation to driving matters. His most recent convictions in the Local Court, which were offences for which he was on bail when he committed the current offence with which I am concerned, were offences of driving whilst disqualified, the offence of affray and being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence. For the latter two offences, he was convicted and sentenced in mid-January 2013 to five months imprisonment. The commencement date of that sentence was 11 January 2013. He has been in custody, obviously, since his arrest in relation to this matter.
	
	
	Mr Smith has a far more formidable criminal history, including convictions in the Local Court in 2004 for offences of assault police officer in the execution of his duty, breaking entering with intent to steal and resisting police officer in the execution of his duty. These matters were dealt with modestly by the Local Court.
	
	
	He appeared in the Sydney District Court, as I best understand it, on 3 September 2004 in relation to a number of offences, including assaulting a police officer, being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment which included a non-parole period of six months.
	
	
	On 27 May 2005 he was convicted of common assault and affray in the Local Court and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment with a six month non‑parole period. On 3 July 2009 he was convicted in the Sydney District Court of being an accessory before the fact to a serious indictable offence, for which I understand he was sentenced to six years imprisonment, commencing on 23 January 2009; malicious wounding, for which he was sentenced to five years imprisonment; and assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence, for which he was sentenced to six months imprisonment.
	
	
	The effective non-parole period imposed was two years commencing on 23 January 2009, hence he was on parole at the time of the commission of the current offences, as I have earlier pointed out.
	
	
	In relation to the cases that were conducted for each of the accused, Mr Kostopoulos did not give evidence. He wrote a letter to the court stating that he was ashamed for what he had done and said that he did not want to be involved with drugs and crime again. He said that he had taken a lot of drugs before coming into custody but being in gaol had been a wakeup call. He said that he and withdrawn from drug dependence and he no longer wanted to be involved with the Rebels motor cycle club. He said he had restrictions in custody because of his “bikie affiliations”. He was restricted from work and other activities. He said he had new insight in light of his experiences in gaol and wished to re-join his family.
	
	
	I will come back to the evidence of his parents and the references in a moment.
	
	
	Mr Watson-Munro, a psychologist, provided a report setting out a great deal of history provided by the prisoner in terms of his personal circumstances. It is not controversial and largely confirmed by the prisoner’s mother.
	
	
	He is the only child of his parents. He left high school at an early age but went to complete whatever schooling he had a special school, completing Year 10. After leaving school he worked for his father for a while.
	
	
	Mr Watson-Munro does not, in his report, dwell on his associations with the Rebels bike club and its implications of that.
	
	
	He claimed to Mr Watson-Munro symptoms of anxiety and depression and “low self-esteem”. He said that he was greatly affected by the death of his grandfather, which I could understand and he said that his arrest was “untimely” because he said he had no opportunity to mourn.
	
	
	He claimed to be easily led. Much of the analysis of the psychologist provides little, if no, psychological explanation for his involvement in the current offending.
	
	
	The only form of testing of an objective character, if that is the correct expression, undertaken by Mr Watson-Munro, was the ‘Beck Depression Inventory’, which is a self-reporting test. Unsurprisingly, given the prisoner’s presence in custody, effectively for the first time, it showed symptoms of depression and anxiety. All of these symptoms would appear to be reactive to his circumstances at the time of the review. There is no evidence of any preceding treatment for any psychiatric or psychological injury or illness.
	
	
	Mr Watson-Munro did say, in fairness to his report, that there was no evidence of any major psychiatric disturbance and there was no mental disability.
	
	
	The report of Mr Watson-Munro claimed that his offending behaviour “commenced against the backdrop of his involvement with the Rebels motor cycle club”. The prisoner, however, does not provide any detail either to Mr Watson-Munro or to me to explain that. As I said, I cannot hold that against him.
	
	
	He undertook an analysis of his background, suggesting that he may have been bullied as a child, which “galvanised his feelings of worthlessness as well as escalating his sense of despair and anxiety”. His mother had reported his vulnerability to peer pressure, although at the same time his parents, in their evidence, did not seem to have any real insight, not that I criticise them for that, into the circumstances of his offending on this occasion.
	
	
	He had a history of substance abuse and was a problem gambler.
	
	
	The psychologist said, in his conclusion, that his observations, testing and discussions with the prisoner’s mother corroborated the history provided by the prisoner. He described him as a “troubled individual who clearly requires treatment”. There are some suggestions for treatment and therapy whilst in custody. The report will be available for the custodial authorities.
	
	
	His parents provided written references, setting out detail of his background, the illnesses suffered by the mother and the father, which are quite significant I accept. However, their evidence shows that they are not, in any way, dependent upon their son. They blame themselves for their son’s criminal behaviour, which, to my mind, is very much misplaced guilt. They confirm the passing of the prisoner’s grandfather on 4 September, being buried on 10 September. The prisoner being arrested on 12 September, I accept that he may not have had reasonable period to mourn. But, at the same time, bearing in mind as I understood it the grandfather had been ill and his death was not unexpected, the prisoner continued with the course of criminal conduct leading up to his grandfather’s death.
	
	
	The prisoner’s parents spoke of the effect upon him of being in gaol, the resolution of him to reform on his release and his expressed regret for his involvement in the crime, which I have taken into account and I have reflected that in my consideration of the non-parole period.
	
	
	The father of the prisoner points out that the prisoner’s conduct in the 12 months before his arrest as being out of character and gave the illustration of the prisoner stealing from him a credit card to pay for a party that he put on for his friends in the Rebels bike club and also to assuage his gambling difficulties. They said, in effect, that now that he is drug free he is a different person.
	
	
	His mother, in her oral evidence in court, said that in the 12 months before his arrest he was not normal. He was hostile and aggressive. She could not understand why. He was using steroids but they did not know that at the time. He was coming and going, sleeping during the day, going out at night. One day, some months before his arrest, he came home with a leather vest with the name of the Rebels motor cycle club on the back and this was a shock. He told his parents he had joined the Rebels because it was a brotherhood and because he was respected. They had no idea that he was involved in serious criminal activity but the mother said they noticed a big change in him and his remorse was absolute. He said that he wanted nothing to do with the Rebels on his release and they would stick by him and they would make sure that he complied with his parole conditions.
	
	
	His father gave oral evidence that he was completely shocked that he joined the Rebels. He did not know about his problems with drugs and he believes that he “dropped the ball” because he did not pay enough attention to him. He said he was very busy with the prisoner’s dying grandfather and that was a great stress upon the family. He said that the prisoner in custody has been transformed into a totally different person from the person he was before he went into custody and he is taking responsibility for his actions. The father said that he owned a transport company and it was a significant business. When he is finally released he would ensure that the prisoner complied with his parole conditions, he could provide him with work and he would continue to support him.
	
	
	There were a number of other references from people that have known the prisoner and his family over a period of time. I will not refer to people by name, but just to give some flavour of the referees’ testimonials, the mother of a school friend spoke of some of the prisoner’s better qualities as a young man, including his contribution to a community in the Cook Islands after a hurricane or tornado had struck that community. She spoke about his lack of maturity as a teenager, but his greater maturity now since being in custody and his capacity for reform.
	
	
	Another referee who had known the family for 20 years spoke of the prisoner’s artistic qualities, his assistance to others, the burden placed upon him of the illnesses of his parents and the positive impression that he was creating whilst in custody.
	
	
	Other referees talk about his contribution to the community as a school boy, that I have referred to, and his greater maturity since his incarceration, the expressions of remorse he had made, his commitment for change.
	
	
	The family accountant speaks of the integrity of the prisoner’s family. One referee spoke of the impact upon the prisoner and his parents of their illnesses and the exposure of him as a child to “adversity and stress”. Both parents have significant health problems, as I said, and there is some medical evidence about one aspect of that.
	
	
	Other character witnesses expressed opinions about the circumstances of the offender’s involvement in the crime, but much of those observations reflect very little understanding of the facts in this case.
	
	
	One referee, who had known the prisoner for 10 years, spoke of his change after joining the Rebels but also thought that the prisoner had returned to his former character since he had been in custody.
	
	
	Mr Smith filed an affidavit in court, he was not required to be cross-examined on it. It is not subject to the test of cross-examination and I note in relation to the matter it does little to explain the circumstances of his involvement in the offence. He speaks of his work in custody and the fact that he has had difficulty completing particular courses in custody. He set out various courses he had completed during his previous period in custody. He gave some detail of his upbringing; he has had a disadvantaged upbringing. His father was a man who was described as an alcoholic. His parents separated when he was 15. He lived in the inner western suburbs, completing Year 10 at Glebe High School. He worked in various occupations, including working in demolition work as a storeman and as a tiler.
	
	
	After his release to parole he got a job as a car detailer in 2011 but quit that job to undertake the care of his mother who had problems with cancer that kept recurring. She, sadly, passed away a couple of months before he was arrested.
	
	
	Since his release to parole he had been in a relationship with a woman since 2011 and their first child was born in June 2012. He intends to marry his fiancé on his release. He said that having a child and his mother’s passing had been a “big wakeup call”. I accept that that may be so, but the problem with that claim is, of course, that he committed this offence after both events had occurred.
	
	
	He said that when he came into custody he was taking a lot of “depressants” and “pain killers” and drinking a fair amount bit. He did express some hope for the future. He had completed a course in 2013 for which he produced a certificate. Upon the agreed facts and the draft affidavit, he was assessed by a psychologist, setting out details of his history, which I need not dwell upon; his alcohol abuse and his problems with illicit substances.
	
	
	He also gave a history of cocaine abuse over a period of time and the use of steroids, having smoked heroin in the past. He claimed, however, to be drug free in custody. He acknowledged a history of violence and aggression to the psychologist in his criminal history and tended to blame his abuse of alcohol, rather than any personal failings for it.
	
	
	He has never previously been diagnosed with any psychological disorders, although he reported a long history of psychological concerns that began in his early childhood.
	
	
	He did, however, develop obsessive compulsive symptomology when he was first in custody, serving the sentences imposed to commence in 2009. He also spoke about the reactive anxiety and depression he had in various life situations. He said, in the history provided to the psychologist, that his involvement in the offence followed upon a number of stresses in the preceding two months of the offence. He said he also owed his cocaine dealer thousands of dollars, which had built over the 12 months before his arrest.
	
	
	He said, in relation to the drugs for which he has been charged, that he was to keep them overnight and he claimed that he was unable to think through the consequences of his behaviour. He expressed regret and remorse to the psychologist. Of course, his reflections upon his involvement in the offence are not subject to any test, they are merely ultimately hearsay representations that remain untested.
	
	
	The psychologist undertook some psychometric testing. He undertook a “Personality Assessment Inventory”. The results of that testing seemed to dwell upon matters of little moment, such as his self-esteem and his inner personal style, not matters of great significance to explain his involvement in the commission of the offence.
	
	
	The psychologist says that on clinical examination the prisoner’s profile is “marked by significant elevations across several scales, including a broad range of clinical features (reflecting) the possibility of multiple diagnoses.”
	


“As such, Mr Smith’s profile suggests he is a person who most likely has marked distress and severe impairment in functioning associated with a number of anxieties that is currently manifested in obsessive compulsive symptomology.”


	
	The psychologist said his profile and characteristics most likely point towards “diagnoses of an enduring anxiety disorder in addition to alcohol dependence and substance dependence.” Not surprisingly, this is “consistent with Mr Smith’s reported history and current state.”
	
	
	There is nothing in the formulation of the matter by the psychologist, in my view, that points to any psychiatric or psychological condition that contributed to his offending behaviour, other than, of course, the consideration of his abuse of prescription and non-prescription drugs. Certainly not a mitigating factor in the circumstances of this case.
	
	
	In regard to the evidence of the two psychologists relating to both of those two prisoners, Mr Kostopoulos and Mr Smith, again I go back to the decision of De La Rosa. In that decision, particularly at [177], the learned Chief Judge at Common Law, Justice McClellan, summarised a body of authorities, going back to the decision of the Chief Justice Gleeson from 1994 of R v Engert concerning the relevance of a mental illness, intellectual handicap, or other mental problems, in the sentencing process.
	
	
	His Honour set out a formulation, quite accurate, it would seem from my understanding of the authorities, in summary of the principles that apply.
	
	
	Of course, it is true that when a person’s mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced and lesser weight may be given to general deterrence. But there is, in relation to Mr Kostopoulos and Mr Smith, other than consideration of alcohol and/or drug dependence, no mental health issue that contributes to the commission of the offences to which they have pleaded guilty in a material way.
	
	
	However, in the case of Mr Smith, in light of the obsessive compulsive symptomology which has reflected itself in past custody, it is correct to say that one other aspect of the judgment of Justice McClellan is relevant to some extent. A particular condition may mean that a custodial sentence “may weigh more heavily on (the prisoner).” In my view, in light of what I understand of the matter, to some extent the custodial circumstances of the prisoner, albeit that he is not subject to any intense regime of treatment, are affected by his condition. The principles relating to the condition of a prisoner reflecting the prisoner as a danger to the community of course do not apply to these two offenders.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Smith, a pre-sentence report was prepared. It sets out much of the detail that I have already summarised as far as background, particularly relating to his personal circumstances and the like, as well as his use of alcohol and non-prescribed medication. The report notes that the prisoner completed the “Getting SMART” program whilst in custody in 2009 and in November 2013 was referred to participate in the intensive drug and alcohol therapeutic program described as “IDATP”, but was waiting to commence the program at the time of the preparation of the report. The grief and loss of the prisoner’s mother is reflected upon in the report and I have taken that into account.
	
	
	With regard to his attitude to the offending, the report states,
	


“When discussing the offence Mr Smith justified his offending behaviour and claimed that he was very stressed at the time, given his mother had recently died and he was experiencing difficulty family issues with his fiancée and baby. The offender acknowledged that he was abusing alcohol and non-prescription medication at the time of the offence. Mr Smith disputes the Australian Federal Police facts. Mr Smith stated, ‘I was just holding something for someone’ and ‘I knew it wasn’t anything good, but I didn’t know exactly what it was’”.


	
	I do not accept that particular hearsay representation, although I accept that offenders will, from time to time, try to minimise their responsibility.
	
	
	He is considered as a person at medium risk of reoffending and he is a person who is regarded as one who would benefit from supervision from Community Corrections, notwithstanding his previous breach of parole. Certainly to receive counselling in relation to drug and alcohol dependency, to address the grief issues, to monitor his associations and other matters, which I think is self-evident from the facts I have outlined.
	
	
	Mr Treffiletti, as I said earlier, had just turned 18 years at the time of the offending and as I mentioned, has no prior criminal convictions. He was working as a motor mechanic at one point and then commenced working with Kennard’s Hire Company. He is a ‘permanent casual’, but could become a permanent employee. He continues, as I understand it, to work in that employment as he said in his oral evidence, and enjoys the work. He is a young man with fairly uncontroversial interests. He likes camping and four wheel driving. He had no direct dealing with any of the co-accused. He said he did not know that there were amphetamines in the bottles. In fact he did not know, he said to the investigating police, that liquid amphetamine could be concealed with other liquids in bottles. I have already dealt with the circumstances of his arrest. He said in his evidence that when he was approached by Mr Maharaj he assumed the packages would contain expensive wines. He was suspicious but he was reassured by Mr Maharaj, who was a friend of his from high school. He was to be paid $500 in relation to each consignment for the role that he played. He accepts that he assisted people to commit serious crimes. He was cross-examined by the learned Crown Prosecutor in relation to matters concerning his payment and the risk involved, the messaging between himself and others, particularly referring to the risk of going to gaol. Whilst he was skilfully cross-examined, I do not doubt his evidence, as I earlier indicated.
	
	
	He produced a reference from his employer of the last 13 months who spoke of his industry, his honesty and his value to his employer. His supervisor at that establishment also spoke of his value as an employee and his personal qualities. He does not drink alcohol, he is family oriented, he is a person with the promise of permanent employment. He does not have any drug or alcohol issues and this is reflected in the report from the Community Corrections Officer of 24 January 2014. That refers to the fact the prisoner has an “unremarkable upbringing”, denying any drug or alcohol issues. He is considered at ‘low risk’ of reoffending. He expressed to the officer disappointment in himself for not being more vigilant in relation to what he was being asked to do and that the arrest of himself and his experience of coming to Court has been a salutary one, which I accept. He has never had any previous contact, obviously, with Community Corrections . Because of his current personal circumstances he is unlikely to benefit from a period of supervision. There are no criminogenic factors to be addressed. He is suitable for community service.
	
	
	This brings me to the submissions that were produced to the Court. As I said I have very helpful written submissions from Mr Smith’s counsel and from counsel for Mr Treffiletti and I have very skilled oral submissions from Mr Boulten of Senior Counsel and extensive written submissions from the Crown. Although the order of submissions was the defence addressing first, I think it is appropriate for the purposes of my remarks on sentence to start off with the Crown’s submissions, simply because ultimately, when one analyses all that has been put before me, there was little dispute in terms of the legal principles to be applied. I will briefly summarise what was set out in the extensive written submissions of the Crown as usually provided by representatives of the Director of Public Prosecutions.
	
	
	I have already made mention to the reference to the significance of the maximum penalty. The Crown submitted that the conduct carried out by the offenders, particularly Mr Kostopoulos and Mr Smith, constituted a serious degree of criminality. Of course this submission is leavened by the need to fully appreciate and identify the differing roles and the different culpabilities of each of the offenders. The Crown referred to the period of time that the offenders had been in custody and obviously all relevant custody has been taken into account.
	
	
	All the offenders are required to be sentenced pursuant to Part 1B Crimes Act 1914 and particular reference was made in the submissions of all the parties to the terms of s 16A(2) of that Act. This sub-section is sometimes referred to as a “check list”, but it is to be borne in mind of course that it is introduced by the words,
	


“In addition to any other matters the Court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the Court”.


	
	Thereafter between s 16A(2)(a)-(p) are various matters, many of which have relevance to one or other of the offenders.
	
	
	As the Crown submits and is acknowledged in the submissions of the parties, general deterrence is a relevant consideration, notwithstanding its absence from the terms of s 16A one need only refer to the decision of El-Karhani. With regard to the nature and circumstances of the offence, as required to be considered under sub-paragraph (a) I have set out the detail of the involvement of the offenders in summary. The Crown submits and I accept beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Kostopoulos and Mr Smith knew the identity of what they were attempting to possess. The Crown pointed out correctly, that in the context of the High Court judgment of Olbrich, the Court is required to if able on the evidence, make determinations about the role of particular offenders, matters in mitigation are to be established by the offenders on the balance of probabilities. The objective facts need to be established beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution.
	
	
	The Crown points out that Mr Kostopoulos was recruited, stepping in from Mr Curcuruto and appointed to his role as a liaison person. There is the attempt to pick up the first package from the Five Dock post office and I need not go through the detail of what the Crown points out as to what he did. The Crown submitted that his role was significant and important and submitted that he was, “clearly a trusted member of a well organised syndicate”, acting as a “intermediary and facilitator”, but he was subordinate to Mr Smith. He was entrusted to warehouse and deliver the substances and of course attempted to collect one of the consignments. The Crown submitted that the level of criminality is at “the high end of objective seriousness”.
	
	
	If I could pause for a moment in relation to those submissions, which obviously are very helpful, I could not conclude that the prisoner Kostopoulos was a “trusted member of a well organised syndicate”, I have got absolutely no idea what organisation, if there was such an organisation, organised this importation. But he certainly was a trusted person and I accept he was an intermediary and facilitator. I have already pointed out to the issue of his role as a warehouser and deliver and other matters. I hasten to say, in the context of considering the issue of the role of the prisoner and where he fits within the range of offending contemplated by the provision, I have been greatly assisted by the decision of De La Rosa and particularly the very, very extensive discussion by the learned Chief Judge between paragraphs 207 and 263 of the various types of offending reflected in that case of course, cases of importation of commercial and/or trafficable or marketable quantities of drugs. I appreciate these offenders, Mr Kostopoulos and Mr Smith particularly, are not charged with importing the drugs. I obviously cannot be satisfied that they are responsible for the importation of the drugs. But the learned Chief Judge’s analysis is extremely helpful in showing the differing considerations that need to be had in assessing the role of an offender and assessing it in a proper context by reference to the matters that the Crown points to are relevant in consideration of the maximum penalty.
	
	
	I could not conclude either that Mr Kostopoulos or Mr Smith are liable for conduct, the culpability of which could be described as “the high end of objective seriousness”. That is not to say that their roles were not important. But there are many matters that need to be taken into account and particularly, in the context of the facts of this case, in neither case could I conclude that they financed the importation or were responsible ultimately for the distribution of the drugs. They were part of a chain of connection. But as to where that chain led I am not assisted by either Mr Kostopoulos or Mr Smith. I have got no doubt that they have at least some information in that regard that they might have shared with the Court to assist me.
	
	
	It has been pointed out time and time again by the superior Courts, that when matters are raised about the role of an offender in a particular criminal enterprise, particularly drug importation, normally the Court will be denied information about the character of the “organisation”, that is involved, if such an organisation exists. As I have said just recently in another case, most offenders who are arrested do not walk around the streets carrying around an organisation chart to be of some assistance at their sentencing proceedings in relation to these matters. I need only refer to the decision of Lee ([2007] NSWCCA 234) in that regard.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Smith’s role, I have already dealt with that. The Crown submits that he was knowledgeable as to the content of the consignment, was engaged in liaising and receiving the substance concerned with the second consignment. He was the “third set of hands”, through which the drugs were to pass, distancing himself from the original delivery and it was submitted that he had “seniority in the hierarchy of the syndicate”. I do not criticise the Crown for making that submission. Clearly I should not and could not, but I could not conclude that the prisoner, for the reasons I have just outlined had “seniority in the hierarchy of the syndicate”. Because I do not have any evidence as to whether there was a “syndicate” and I have got no idea as to what role Mr Smith played. Again, he could have assisted me but he did not.
	
	
	With regard to the matter of sentencing these offenders of course, one factor that is pertinent, bearing in mind the interest of Mr Kostopoulos in two consignments and Mr Smith in one consignment, is the issue of financial reward. There is no evidence from the offenders, no information provided by the offenders, even in any hearsay account they have given in that regard. But I think it could be safely concluded that there must have been some financial reward for them. The extent of that would only be a matter of speculation. The motivation of an offender at the point of initial involvement may be relevant to assessing the offender’s culpability, but again the motivation of these two prisoners is denied me beyond what might be concluded from the understanding that their involvement in this matter was not for altruistic purposes.
	
	
	The other matter of importance is of course the fact that the nature, quantity, purity, source and value of the drugs is a highly relevant matter to the assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence of this type, as the Chief Judge at Common Law in De La Rosa said at [260] “General deterrence is of particular significance when sentencing for drug offences”. And, “The nature, quantity, purity, source and value of the drugs important are highly relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending”.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Treffiletti, his role was effectively marginal. He did admit to receiving financial gain and it is not disputed that he ultimately stood to receive a thousand dollars, being almost completely ignorant of relevant facts and I have already been through the matters that point out the facts and circumstances of his offending.
	
	
	The Crown submits, in relation to Mr Treffiletti, that his role was limited but “necessary”. That may be correct but clearly his role was not “vital” because if he had not agreed to opening the post office box, somebody else may have, even Mr Maharaj himself. The Crown accepted that he was “at the very bottom in terms of the hierarchy”, and was at the “periphery” in terms of the involvement in this affair. His offending was at a “low level of objective seriousness”, with which assessment by the Crown I agree.
	
	
	The Crown points out of course, that a person who does perform a limited role is not necessarily to receive a degree of leniency. But the principles relating to that proposition are not of direct applicability to this offender. The Crown in its written submissions, as I have already noted, referred to the amount of drug or weight of drug that was imported. I have already made comments about that and the relationship of that amount to what constitutes commercial quantity of amphetamine and the Crown in its submissions, conceded ultimately that whilst Mr Treffiletti may not have known the identity or quantity of the drug, he must had operated under the belief, the probability that there were border control drugs of some kind. I dealt with the issue of the discount covered by the Crown in its written submission.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to the fact as it may be relevant to the matters to be considered under s 16A(2) of the Act and generally at common law, that there was no co-operation by Mr Kostopoulos or Mr Smith with the law enforcement officers, although there was co-operation by Mr Treffiletti. The Crown submitted that the criminal histories of Mr Kostopoulos and Mr Smith require consideration with greater weight being given to specific deterrence in their cases. This would be less so for Mr Kostopoulos, one would have thought.
	
	
	However, on the other hand it needs to be borne in mind as a fact in this case, that whilst there are aggravating factors of committing the offence whilst on bail, in the case of Mr Kostopoulos and whilst on parole in the case of Mr Smith, the aggravation of committing the offence whilst on parole, must be regarded as somewhat more serious than committing an offence whilst on bail. But both matters are relevantly adverse to the interest of the prisoners.
	
	
	The Crown submitted it, by reference to s 16A(2) factors, the need for the offenders to be adequately punished, to have regard of course, to their character antecedents and other matters set out in sub-paragraph (m), their prospects of rehabilitation. The Crown submitted that by reference to (p) that the probable effect of any sentence or order made upon a person’s family or dependants in these matters did not serve to mitigate the otherwise appropriate punishment for either Mr Kostopoulos or Mr Smith. The Crown dealt with the issue of the absence of any mental illness or disorder causally connected to the offending. The Crown also dealt in its submissions with the relevance of drug dependency and the like and properly referred the Court to the observations of Wood J in the guideline judgment of Henry, particularly at [273] of that judgment. The Crown also referred to Mr Kostopoulos’ problems with gambling and said that that was not a mitigating factor, although it may have been a contributing factor, citing a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Anna Le [2006] NSWCCA 136 and the judgment of Latham J.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of comparative sentencing of the three offenders, the issue of parity as might be generally described, that is providing equal justice to the offenders is a critical matter in this matter. Alike shall be treated alike and the unalike shall be treated unalike to the extent of their unalikeness, to paraphrase the words of Rothman J in the 2010 decision of Jimmy and also the words of Gaudron and Dawson JJ in Postiglione.
	
	
	The Crown also referred the Court to the various statutory principles that are of importance including the need to impose a term of imprisonment if satisfied that imprisonment is the only appropriate sentence, the fixing of non-parole periods and the like.
	
	
	The Crown also made submissions about the non-parole periods where they are appropriate, which I have already referred to. The Crown provided a schedule of comparative cases. I do not propose to read out the names of all those decisions but I have had regard to those various decisions referred to by the Crown. I have also had regard to the limited extent that they are of any assistance to the very many more decisions discussed by McClellan J in De La Rosa, albeit that his Honour was concerned with importation cases.
	
	
	What is of some importance in that judgment is the way in which his Honour analysed the categorisation of offending by reference to role, quantity of rugs and the like. An exercise obviously relevant in this matter. It is to be borne in mind, of course, that the comparative cases, whilst of some assistance, may provide some particular assistance in relation to the range of penalty that is appropriate, particularly where the Court of Criminal Appeal has intervened. Also, they need to be approached with some caution because there are many variables in each individual case relating to the role of the offender, the criminal antecedents, the subjective circumstances. Some of the matters referred to by the learned Crown in the helpful schedule, related to cases where offenders had pleaded ‘not guilty’. Obviously, pleas of not guilty might reflect absence of contrition and also would, where sentencing occurs after trial, not involve any discounts for any pleas of guilty.
	
	
	None of the authorities who which I was referred by way of comparative purpose had any real relevance to the position of Mr Treffiletti, both as to his role and his subjective circumstances.
	
	
	I was particularly invited by learned senior counsel for Mr Kostopoulos to have regard to the decision of Karan, a decision at first instance at the District Court of McLoughlin J, but subject to Crown appeal heard by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 11 March 2013.
	
	
	With regard to the written submissions on behalf of Mr Smith, very helpful submissions indeed were made by Ms Moody, who skilfully represents her client’s interests, in respect of the s 16A(2) matters. She correctly points out there are no other offences to be taken into account. There is no relevant ‘victim’ or loss or injury, particularly in light of the intervention of the AFP. She made submissions about the discount for the plea which I accept. It is submitted that Mr Smith has expressed contrition in his affidavit and through the psychologist. I accept that he has expressed it. There is remorse implicit in his plea, but remorse in contrition in this matter is discretely from any discount for the plea of guilty of not great moment in this case. This is considered by me to be the case when it is borne in mind that the prisoner provided no assistance to the authorities and of course has not given evidence in these proceedings.
	
	
	It is noted that he is a relatively young man. But he has a history of convictions which do not entitle him to any leniency and of course he has the aggravation of committing offences whilst on parole. I am required, as is correctly pointed out, to have regard to the deterrent effect of any sentence upon him. I not the character antecedents and other matters relating to his physical and mental condition. I have already summarised them. It is submitted that he is psychologically vulnerable in custody and I accept that to be so to some extent. It is relevant in the manner that I have outlined to his circumstances of custody.
	
	
	It is submitted on his behalf that, given his background, he has good prospects of rehabilitation and is motivated to change his lifestyle. I could not find on balance, that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. He may, but it will be a matter of time before anyone could form a concluded view about that matter. I am prepared to give him some credit in all the circumstances of the matter in the non-parole period to the promotion of his rehabilitation in the past and I believe that I have reflected upon relevant matters in the summary I have provided thus far.
	
	
	It was conceded in the oral submissions that he must have been motivated by financial reward. It is accepted in the submissions of his learned counsel that the Crown’s summary of his involvement in bare terms is an accurate one, although there is no acceptance of the description of his role and I have already dealt with that matter. It is submitted on behalf of Mr Smith that Karan is a relevant case.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Treffiletti, I will not dwell on the very helpful written submissions of his counsel. He substantially summarises the facts as I have outlined them and as the Crown concedes, the objective seriousness of the offence is the subject of specific submission. In this case it is submitted that it is not inevitable that a custodial sentence must be imposed. The learned Crown Prosecutor in oral submissions, conceded matters relevant to the low level of objective seriousness of the prisoner’s offending but one factor to be borne in mind of course, is that of course the offender has pleaded guilty to an offence that carries life imprisonment and it is in that context that consideration of community service order, whilst it might perform some benefit for the community, ultimately was not one that I could favourably make in this case.
	
	
	With regard to the factors arising under s 16A(2) I have dealt with the various matters identified in the written submissions. I accept that he was co-operative with the authorities and truthful with them from the get go, so to speak. I believe that his experience has been a salutary one and the order that I foreshadowed will have a deterrent effect upon him and that he will be adequately punished. I have already dealt with his antecedents. I believe he has excellent prospects of rehabilitation and ultimately I have concluded as I have foreshadowed.
	
	
	With regard to Mr Kostopoulos’ learned senior counsel’s submissions, there were no written submissions from him. That is not a criticism. But he gave very helpful oral submissions to the Court. Many of the matters that he addressed in his submissions I believe that I have already addressed in the remarks I have made thus far. Particularly, however, I pick up some aspects of the matter.
	
	
	Whilst I accept in relation to the second consignment that Mr Smith played something of a supervisory role in relation to the prisoner and only that consignment, in assessing ultimately the appropriate sentence, by reference to the objective facts, as I have earlier pointed out, and as conceded by the particulars.
	
	
	The involvement of Mr Kostopoulos in the first consignment, in the way in which I have described, ultimately means that in considering the comparison between Mr Smith and Mr Kostopoulos then the objective gravity of the criminality of Mr Kostopoulos must be greater given Mr Kostopoulos’s involvement in that first consignment.
	
	
	I appreciate, if one is to do a strict comparison between Mr Kostopoulos and Mr Smith, that Mr Kostopoulos is younger, in fact he was quite young, 19 years of age, about to turn twenty and did not have anywhere near as formidable a criminal history. He was not on parole. He had never been in gaol before. However, he committed the offence with which I am concerned whilst on bail, which I have already pointed out several times. The objective criminality with which he was concerned was greater, notwithstanding Mr Smith’s role, vis-à-vis him in relation to the second consignment. It is to be pointed out in that regard that I cannot conclude that Mr Smith was the man who was to distribute the drugs. Certainly there is no evidence that he financed the importation, I cannot conclude that any financial reward that he was to receive was significantly greater than that of Mr Kostopoulos. Neither prisoner has helped me in that regard.
	
	
	Ultimately, doing the best one can, one must balance up all the relevant factors to reach a final conclusion as to what the appropriate penalty may be. The truth of the matter is, if I could use a metaphor, the sentencing of an offender in any matter involves really, by comparison, filling up a flask or a container with water to reflect all the objective seriousness of the offence, and the relevant aggravating factors and then subtracting from that quantity those matters in mitigation, leaving one at the point where the final quantity of the penalty can be measured.
	
	
	Ultimately I have concluded, in the context of parity principles outlined in cases such as Postiglione, Jimmy, Lowe and the like, that the final sentence to be imposed on Mr Kostopoulos must be greater than that imposed on Mr Smith. However the reflection of matters favourable to Mr Kostopoulos not available to Mr Smith will be largely seen in the non-parole period.
	
	
	I have noted the submissions made by Mr Boulten about the way in which Mr Kostopoulos provided his own identification by his passport and thus sealed his fate on 6 September and also the fact that Mr Kostopoulos obviously was at various times acting on the directions of others. Whilst, as I said, he may have had a somewhat lesser role than Mr Smith in relation to the second consignment, the first consignment and his role in that of course is an important matter to bear in mind.
	
	
	I have had regard to the Victorian decision of Justice Forrest from 2012 to which counsel referred in distinguishing between a young offender and older offenders. But what was said by his Honour of course has to be seen in the context of the facts of this case. The substantial, it must be fairly said, difference in involvement by reference to the two consignments. It was conceded that a term of imprisonment must be imposed. I have accepted, as it would appear from what has gone before, his prospects of rehabilitation are good, particularly in light of the evidence of his parents and that law abiding environment to which he can return on his release from custody.
	
	
	The sentencing of offenders of course is not an exact science. Judges do not have the benefit, if I could use that word somewhat sarcastically, of a Code of Hammurabi to arrive at a mathematically correct decision. It is a matter of doing one’s best on the material available in the context of the sentencing practices by which a court is bound to apply, and of course the legislative direction given by the Commonwealth Crimes Act and any related state legislation that follows from Commonwealth provisions.
	
	
	In the case of Mr Kostopoulos ultimately I determine that the starting point for any sentence to be imposed upon him was seven years six months imprisonment but with a discount of 25%. The total sentence to be imposed upon him is five years nine months, to date, as I said, from 12 December, and the non-parole period will be three years.
	
	
	In the case of Mr Smith the starting point of the sentence to be imposed upon him in relation to the offence to which he pleaded guilty was six years and six months. On my calculation a 25% discount leads to a sentence of four years and ten months imprisonment. But in his case, because of the partial accumulation of his sentence upon his balance of parole, I have adjusted his non-parole period to a period of two years and ten months.
	
	
	In the case of Mr Treffiletti I cannot accede to the granting of a Community Service Order in the context of the measure of the criminality by reason of the maximum penalty. But having regard to his low level of involvement and moral culpability I have determined that a term of imprisonment should be wholly suspended.
	
	
	Mr Kostopoulos could you stand up please? Thanks very much. In relation to the offence to which you pleaded guilty you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years nine months to date from 12 December 2012. Your sentence will expire, on my calculation, on 11 September 2018. In respect of that sentence I fix a non-parole period of three years imprisonment which will commence on 12 December 2012 and expire on 11 December 2015. You can take a seat, thanks very much.
	
	
	Mr Smith would you mind standing up? Thank you very much. I do apologise to you. I said your head sentence would be four years and eight months but it is four years and ten months, but you are not disadvantaged by reference to a non-parole period, it was an error on my part of reading. In relation to the offence to which you pleaded guilty you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years and ten months to date from 12 June 2013 and expire on 11 April 2018. In respect of that sentence I fix a non-parole period of two years and ten months to date from 12 June 2013. That will expire on 11 April 2016. You can take a seat, thanks very much. I will explain the sentences in a moment.
	
	
	Mr Treffiletti do you mind standing up? Thanks very much. In relation to the offence to which you pleaded guilty you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of fifteen months imprisonment. I direct that you be released forthwith upon you entering a recognisance pursuant to s 20 (1)(b) yourself in the sum of five hundred dollars without surety to be of good behaviour for a period of two years from this date and to appear to receive sentence if called upon to do so at any time in respect of any breach in the said period.
	
	
	A further condition of the recognisance is that you are not to change your residence without notifying the court and the Director of Public Prosecutions. I do not propose to direct that you be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service because there seems to be no purpose in that, there is no reparation for you to pay. You can take a seat, thanks very much.
	
	
	Mr Kostopoulos and Mr Smith in relation to the sentences I have imposed upon you you will not be automatically released to parole. The Parole Authority will determine if you are release. I think Mr Smith you are aware of the way in which parole operates, to some extent at least. It will be within the discretion of the Parole Authority. But if you are of good behaviour and you make progress during your time in custody one might expect that your release to parole might be favourably considered by the parole authority, either on the date that I have fixed, or close to that date.
	
	
	As for you Mr Treffiletti if you fail to be of good behaviour during the period of time that you are on the bond that I have ordered an application can be made to the court for the bond to be revoked. And if the bond is revoked I would be required to consider sentencing you to a term of imprisonment in one form or another. If you are sentenced to a term of full-time custody I would be required to fix a non-parole period in your case.
	
	
	Now Madam Crown, any technical matters or slips of the tongue?
	
	
	CHOI: Yes your Honour. With respect in relation to Mr Kostopoulos.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Yes?
	
	
	CHOI: Your Honour stated that the starting point was seven years and six months and if your Honour was to apply a 25% discount in relation to that figure the head sentence should be five years and seven and a half months.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Seven and a half months is it? Well I’m going to give my calculator a good beating when I go back outside. Righto, well I apologise for that.
	
	
	BOULTEN: I reached the same conclusion without a calculator too your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: You probably went to a better school than I did Mr Boulten so I don’t doubt that you’re right. What I’ll do Madam Crown, Mr Boulten, I will round it down to seven months. The Court of Criminal Appeal doesn’t look favourably upon Judges fixing sentences in years, months and days.
	
	
	CHOI: Yes your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: So I’ll round it down to five years and seven months--
	
	
	CHOI: Which means that the balance of the term would expire on 11 July 2018.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: 11 July 2018, that’s right, yes, my apologies, yes thank you. In light of that error in relation to that head sentence Madam Crown and Mr Boulten I thus feel obliged to, and that’s an error on my part, or maybe my writing has deteriorated to the point where I’ve misread what I wrote. I’m prepared to make an adjustment to the non-parole period by a period of one month to fix an effective non-parole period of two years eleven months. That non-parole period thus will expire on 11 November 2015.
	
	
	BOULTEN: Thank you your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I’m embarrassed that I’ve made the error in the head sentence but in light of that and trying to keep the same rough relationship with a non-parole period of a head sentence I’m obliged to make that adjustment in your client’s favour. Yes, thank you.
	
	
	Well I will start with you Mr Boulten, in order of seniority if you don’t mind, any matters that you wanted to raise of a technical nature? Slips of the tongue I’ll fix up in due course when I revise the judgment?
	
	
	BOULTEN: No your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: None. What about you Mr Nicholls?
	
	
	NICHOLLS: No your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Thank you. Ms Moody?
	
	
	MOODY: No your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Right, thank you. Yes gentlemen you’re excused. Now Mr Treffiletti you can leave the dock of course, thanks very much. You will need to go up to level 4 and I will permit your solicitor to take you up there to enter into the recognisance. Thanks very much.

		22 May 2014",2014-05-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705066,Keppie v Foster [2014] NSWDC 383,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, Mr Matthew John Keppie of Wagga Wagga, brings an action for damages for personal injury. The tort relied upon in the statement of claim is the tort of negligence. In paragraph 3 of the statement of claim it is alleged that on 19 April 2010, the defendant drove his motor vehicle over the plaintiff, causing him severe personal injury and loss. The second particular of negligence given is ""deliberately driving into the plaintiff"". In essence, the plaintiff alleges the tort of trespass to the person.
	
	
	On one view of it, it could be said that the evidence called by the plaintiff and the evidence called by the defendant on the question of liability is fairly evenly balanced. I have been very properly referred by learned counsel for the defendant to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34; (1938) 60 CLR 336. The most crystalline judgment delivered in that case was by Sir Edward McTiernan. At 372, his Honour said this:
	


""English law adopts the reasonable rule that the strictness of the proof of an issue should be governed by the nature of the issue and its consequences. Lord Brougham's speech in defence of Queen Caroline describes an ascending scale of issues which illustrates this principle: 'The evidence before us,' he said, 'is inadequate even to prove a debt, impotent to deprive of a civil right, ridiculous for convicting of the pettiest offence, scandalous if brought forward to support a charge of any grave character, monstrous if to ruin the honour of an English Queen.' The law presumes against guilt of vice and immorality…A learned authority says, however, that the presumption against moral wrong-doing is not so strong as the presumption against criminal wrong-doing…The proof of the issue of adultery involves the displacement of this presumption of innocence in favour of the person charged with serious misconduct. The presumption is not to be regarded as a weak one.""

His Honour went on to point out the consequences of the proof of a charge to adultery in an application for the dissolution of a marriage and the consequent loss of status following upon such a dissolution. The Court has to be satisfied of the matter alleged against the defendant where it involves, in essence, a deliberate tort and, indeed, criminal conduct.


	
	The defendant was charged with serious criminal offences. According to exhibit W, they appear to have been the use an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and assault causing grievous bodily harm to a person with intent to do so. The defendant stood trial in this Court here at Wagga Wagga before her Honour Judge Payne and a jury, but was acquitted. That acquittal, of course, does not create any form of estoppel in these proceedings.
	
	
	An event occurred in the early hours of Monday 19 April 2010. A group of people had been camping on a rural property adjoining the Burra State Forest. The campsite has been described as being at Paddys Falls, a small waterfall on a small creek, which from exhibit B appears to have borne the name of Paddys River. The plaintiff had been camping there for approximately a week. He was in company with a neighbour, a lad, Mr Brenton Hawkins and a number of other persons. On the afternoon of the preceding Saturday, the defendant, in the company of his then lady friend, Ms Toni Tutty, joined the camping party. Ms Tutty was having a sexual relationship with the defendant, but was also the plaintiff's cousin. Late in the afternoon of Sunday 18 April 2010, dinner was consumed and there was then some drinking of beer. The plaintiff believed that he had consumed about eight stubbies of Toohey's full strength beer and the defendant believed that he consumed about four stubbies of full strength beer.
	
	
	Towards midnight, the plaintiff and the defendant agreed to go pig hunting. They were to be accompanied by Brenton Hawkins. Pig hunting was performed by driving through the State Forest and permitting dogs to pick up the scent of wild pigs. The dogs were then set loose to track down the pigs and hold them by their ears. The plaintiff's evidence was that he would then dispatch the pigs by placing a hunting knife into their throats, causing their death. The beasts would then be prepared for butchering and once the meat had been obtained, the meat was frozen. Whether the meat was for human consumption or only for the consumption of the plaintiff's hunting dogs, is not clear from the evidence before me.The hunting was to be carried out from the defendant's motor vehicle, a Mazda Bravo dual cab registered number WPA 206. At the front of the vehicle was a bull bar to which had been fitted a winch. The plaintiff's case, in essence, is that the party went driving in the defendant's vehicle through the State Forest. The defendant was driving, the plaintiff was sitting in the front passenger seat and Brenton Hawkins was in the back seat of the dual cab. Dogs were carried in cages on the tray of this utility truck, those being three dogs that were the property of the plaintiff.
	
	
	The plaintiff's evidence is that at some stage, the defendant wished to drive back to camp because of a perceived lack of fuel. The plaintiff told me that the defendant did not have sufficient fuel to get the party back to their camp in the four-wheel drive. There was then an argument, verbal at first, but then a physical altercation, as the defendant was sitting in the driver's seat and the plaintiff was sitting in the passenger seat. The vehicle came to a halt and the fight between the plaintiff and the defendant continued and they ended up in the back seat of the vehicle, wrestling. According to the plaintiff, Brenton Hawkins had been asleep, but he had woken as a result, presumably, of the fighting inside the vehicle. The plaintiff then said that he alighted from the vehicle, as did Brenton and the plaintiff announced that he was going to walk back through the forest to the campsite.
	
	
	Both the plaintiff and Brenton Hawkins identified the scene of the event in four photographs taken by the police on 13 May 2011, which became exhibit A. The photographs appear to me to show an essentially flat area of forest, with a slight upward incline ahead of the vehicle. The plaintiff told me that he was standing off the two tracks worn into the trail by vehicles on the right-hand side of the defendant's vehicle. According to the photographs, the plaintiff was facing away from the vehicle. That was, in essence, his ultimate position. The plaintiff said that initially the defendant drove over his right foot, presumably the tyre of one of the vehicle's wheels went over his foot, and then the defendant reversed and then, according to the plaintiff, he was run down by the vehicle.
	
	
	Brenton Hawkins gave evidence. He did not give evidence of the plaintiff's right foot being run over, but only of seeing, from a distance of some 20 metres, the defendant’s driving his vehicle off the road and striking the plaintiff and knocking him to the ground and then driving over him or over a part of him, then reversing back onto the two tracks of the trail and then heading off away from both the plaintiff and him. Brenton Hawkins said that he then ran towards the vehicle, which was being driven away from him. He believed that the plaintiff had been killed. He did not stop to give assistance to the plaintiff, but ran ahead to catch up with the defendant's vehicle, which was being driven only at a very slow speed. He reached into the vehicle, turned the ignition off, extracted the keys of the defendant's vehicle from the ignition and then became involved in an altercation with the defendant, which in essence was won by Brenton Hawkins. At the time, Brenton was a lad aged 14. The defendant was aged 25 years. He was a mature man.
	
	
	After overcoming the defendant, Brenton Hawkins persuaded the defendant to assist the plaintiff. Brenton said that he heard, during his scuffle with the defendant, the plaintiff call out for assistance. That must have disabused him of his belief that the plaintiff had been killed. Brenton and the defendant then went to the plaintiff's assistance and put him on the back seat of the utility and then drove to a nearby farm house, of which the plaintiff had learned earlier in his visit to this State Forest. They went to the farm house to seek assistance for the plaintiff.
	
	
	The house was occupied by Mr Gordon Kelso and his wife and three children. The house, according to Mr Kelso's statement, was located on Nine Mile Road at Tumbarumba, but was accessed from Tooma Road. There had been difficulties experienced in the past with whether the address should be described as Tooma Road, Tumbarumba or Tooma Road, Burra. It is common ground that the plaintiff was taken onto the veranda of Mr Kelso's house, where he was laid on the floor. Brenton Hawkins then knocked at the door and roused Mr Kelso and he explained that assistance was required for the plaintiff, who had been injured. Mr Kelso's statement to the police contains this matter:
	


""4. About 4 am on Monday 19 April 2010, I was woken up by a banging noise coming from the front door of my house. I got out of bed and went to the front door and opened it and I saw a male in a slumped position on the front porch and another young male who was standing next to him. The young male told me his name was Brenton Hawkins.

5. Hawkins told me that the male lying on the porch had been hit by a log that they had been winching off a lane.

6. I saw a vehicle parked at the front of my place, which had a number [of] dogs on the back tray. I asked Hawkins who were the people in the vehicle? The vehicle then drove off very fast, leaving my property.

7. I spoke to the male lying on the porch, asking him what was wrong. The male replied that his chest was crushed and he couldn't breathe.

8. I rang 000 and informed them that I needed an ambulance. I placed a blanket over the male and didn't move him, because of his injuries.""


	
	Exhibit 1 is a transcript of the 000 call. A lot of the call was taken up with trying to identify correctly the whereabouts of Mr Kelso's house. The conversation between the operator and Mr Kelso then continues thus:
	


""Q15   And what's the problem, tell me exactly what's happened?

A   Umm, we've got some people that have just turned up, we live in the bush and a log has fallen on this guy's chest.

Q16:   Yep.

A   And they've just brought him to our house.

Q17   Okay, is he there with you now?

A   Yeah, he's lying on our veranda.

Q18   How old is he?

A   I say late 40s.

Q19   Is he conscious?

A   Just, yep.

Q20   Is he breathing?

A   Yep, very, very shallow.

Q21   Okay, can I ask you some questions about his condition, I just need you to help me out, if you can?

A   Yep.

Q22   How long ago did this happen?

A   How long ago did this happen?""

   [Master Brenton Hawkins is then heard speaking to the operator]

""Q23   Oh, about ten minutes ago.

A   Ten minutes ago.

Q24   He's really finding it hard to breathe.""

The questioning then recommenced by the operator. Again there was a discussion as to the extent to which the plaintiff could breathe normally and further debate about the directions to Mr Kelso's house. On page 4, a question was asked by Mr Kelso, clearly directed to Master Hawkins. Master Hawkins replied ""I've just got to get these dogs back to camp."" However, it is clear that Master Hawkins was asked to stay at Mr Kelso's house. Question 52 appears to have been a statement made by Brenton Hawkins. The answer to it appears to have been a recital by Mr Kelso of what Mr Hawkins said. The exchange is recorded thus:

""Q. 52   Umm, we were moving a log and it just went over the top off him.

A.   They were moving a log and it went over the top of him.""


	
	It is the evidence of both Master Hawkins and Mr Kelso that the defendant drove off. As I recollect Mr Hawkins' evidence, he believed the defendant to have driven off before the 000 call was made. However, the evidence of Mr Kelso, which I have no doubt in accepting, was that the defendant drove off whilst the 000 call was being made. The defendant himself said that he participated in the 000 call, but there is no proof of that at all. The ambulance eventually arrived.
	
	
	The ambulance record is this:
	


""33 year old male. Blunt force trauma chest/abdomen. Patient has tried to move a log with a chain on a 30 ton tree-tree was green and has acted like a slingshot into his chest. Unspecific and unclarified how much of the tree came with the chain and hit the patient's chest/abdomen. Patient has abrasion to the forehead. ? LOC [loss of consciousness]. Patient has abrasion to the right side. Patient has pain of 10/10 ↓ 8/10 ↓ 7/10 eventually with morphine. Patient has defecated with the force of the injury. Plaintiff taken to Tumbarumba Showground for transport by helicopter. Patient's 14 year old neighbour on scene left in care of the address where patient was awaiting arrival of police as patient would not be able to go in the helicopter. Saw patient's helpers approximately two hours later and said 'Police did not show'. He took him back to two males from Gundagai were also out 'pigging'. Called coordinator of SOCO Steve at 7.30 re concerns as police had not arrived after request on scene for their involvement. He was going to get police to phone on my mobile. Patient unable to be collared due to chest pain. Report to Child Protection.""

The reference to the patient not being able to go on the helicopter was clearly a reference not to the patient but to Brenton Hawkins. The report to Child Protection was clearly about the welfare of Master Hawkins. The helicopter took the plaintiff to Canberra Hospital. The history recorded in the discharge summary from that hospital is this:

""Mr Keppie was transferred to our emergency department following a crushing injury whilst felling a tree.""


	
	In due course a statement was made to the police by Dr Christopher John Cole, the Emergency Medicine Registrar at the Canberra Hospital. He records that he examined the plaintiff at 9.30am on 19 April 2010. In paragraph 5 of his statement, the doctor said this:
	


""The history provided by the patient was somewhat unclear, with two possible sequences of events recounted by the patient and by the retrieval paramedic staff. Mr Keppie and at least one other person had been moving felled trees or logs. Whilst doing so, Mr Keppie was either struck by a log, or by a vehicle, or both, causing the injuries for which he was transported to the Canberra Hospital. My contemporaneous notes reflect that I was told that when paramedic staff arrived at the scene, there was no other adult driver present, only an approximately 14 year old boy.""

The final two paragraphs, the penultimate numbered nine, and the second not numbered at all, are these:

""Based wholly or substantially on the above knowledge, I am of the opinion that Mr Keppie had sustained serious injuries, consistent with blunt trauma involving significant energy or force. While he remained haemodynamically stable throughout his entire episode of care and did not require any surgical intervention, each of his significant injuries, independently and together, have the potential to be life-threatening. Specifically, I am referring to his traumatic pneumothorax with multiple rib fractures, his skull fracture and his liver injury.

His injuries were consistent with both proposed causative mechanisms. They could equally have been caused by the impact of a heavy log, or by being struck by a moving motor vehicle. My contemporaneous notes reflect that at the time I assessed Mr Keppie, I was of the opinion that his being struck by a heavy log was the most likely cause of his injuries. This opinion was based entirely on the collateral history that Mr Keppie had been engaged in moving massive logs at the time he was injured, and the lack of confirmatory history regarding the presence of a moving motor vehicle, or driver other than Mr Keppie, at the time NSW Ambulance officers arrived at the scene. The nature and extent of his injuries did not furnish any objective evidence upon which to prefer either possible cause over the other.""

Alas I cannot be assisted by medical evidence as to the likely cause of the plaintiff's injuries.


	
	At about 2.20pm on 19 April 2010, Senior Constable Gordon Spencer of the Tumbarumba Police spoke to the plaintiff on the telephone. The plaintiff was then a patient at the Canberra Hospital. The narrative created by Senior Constable Spencer continues thus:
	


""He stated that he cannot really recall. He was asked, were you [run] over by a car? He stated that he did not think so. He was asked was he on a road or road related area? He stated he was not. He stated they were driving through the State Forest in the bush. He was asked whose car he was in? He stated it was [redacted] from Gundagai. He stated that he does not know any more about [redacted]. He was asked what sort of vehicle does [redacted] own. He stated that [redacted] owned a Mazda Bravo. He did not want to give any more info. Police are of the opinion that all three persons of interest were illegally hunting in the State Forest. This cannot be proven without admissions. The witness [redacted] stated that they had dogs with them, but they were not hunting. The victim states that he was not hunting. Police did not sight the vehicle of interest or any dogs. At this [stage], police will wait for the victim to come forward with further info. The victim stated that he had a couple of broken ribs, with cuts and bruises all over.""

The first set of redactions clearly contained the defendant's name. The name of the redacted witness is clearly Brenton Hawkins. It can be seen therefore, that as at 2.20pm on 19 April 2010, the plaintiff was not telling the police that he had been run over by the defendant's motor vehicle. It is clear, however, that the police were concerned that the plaintiff and the defendant, together with Master Hawkins, had been illegally hunting pigs in the State Forest. Evidence was given by Mr Kelso that antecedent to 19 April 2010 police were conducting regular patrols in the State Forest near him because of a major theft from a nearby property of motor vehicles and plant and because of illegal hunting in the State Forest and some of the hunters having caused bushfires. The evidence before me suggest that if found guilty of illegal hunting in a State Forest, the illegal hunters might lose paraphernalia involved in hunting, which would clearly include things such as the plaintiff's dogs, any knives, perhaps the defendant's motor vehicle and perhaps things such as camping equipment.


	
	The plaintiff remained in the Canberra Hospital until discharge ten days later on 29 April 2010. On 3 May 2010, the plaintiff went to see his usual general practitioner, Dr Keith of Wagga Wagga, and obtained a prescription for a painkiller. Unfortunately no history was recorded at that time by Dr Keith. On 7 May 2010, the plaintiff saw Dr Endrey-Walder, a general surgeon, at the request of his then solicitors, Messrs Farrell Lusher of Wagga Wagga. The plaintiff had not consulted that firm about what occurred on 19 April 2010. He was consulting that firm about injuries sustained by him in a motor vehicle accident on 29 September 2001, about which I shall, in due course, have more to say. Dr Endrey-Walder's report makes it clear that he was seeing the plaintiff in respect of the motor vehicle accident of 29 September 2001. Part of the history recorded by Dr Endrey-Walder is this:
	


""Three weeks ago he was run over by a ute 'in the bush', suffering three fractured ribs on the right side, fracture of the right clavicle and a fractured skull, for which he was hospitalised at the Canberra Hospital for 11 days for observation and nursing care.""


	
	On 12 May 2010, the plaintiff saw Associate Professor Arthur Shores, a consultant neuropsychologist, again at the request of Messrs Farrell Lusher. Again, the purpose of that consultation was to obtain evidence for an action in respect of the motor vehicle accident of 29 September 2001. Part of the history recorded by the Associate Professor is this:
	


""He provided a history of a subsequent head injury which he said was sustained in another motor vehicle accident on 19 April, 2010. In this accident, he said he was a pedestrian struck by a 'ute'. He said his last memory of events preceding the event was of the driver of a stationary vehicle trying to 'strangle' him in the vehicle. He said he could remember getting out of the vehicle, then recalls 'a flash of light and then lying in pain'. He said he has been told that after he got out of the vehicle, the driver of the vehicle then ran him over. He said he could recall being picked up and carried to the vehicle. He said he could then recall waiting at farm house for a helicopter to retrieve him. He said he then 'blanked out', until the next day when he found himself in the Canberra Hospital. He said he suffered with very poor memory for 11 days following the accident. He said he continues to suffer chest and rib pain, has increased asthma symptoms and bad dreams which are now 'mixed in' with his dreams of the 2001 accident. He said he's also suffered moodiness and ongoing poor memory.""


	
	Eight days later, on 20 May 2010, the plaintiff saw Dr Brian Noll, an orthopaedic surgeon, at the request of the solicitor for the insurer of the vehicle involved in the motor vehicle accident of 29 September 2001. Part of Dr Noll's history is this:
	


""He informs me that some three weeks ago, while camping in the bush, he had had an argument and was 'run over' by a 4WD. He was admitted to Canberra Hospital on 19 April 2010 and remained an inpatient for a period of ten days. He provided me with a hospital discharge summary from which[sic] indicated that he sustained a right rib fracture and a small apical pneumothorax. He also had a non-displaced parietal bone (skull) fracture and a right scapula fracture. On discharge, he was provided with analgesic medication, but he informs me that he's discontinued taking this as he 'does not want to become addicted'.""


	
	On 27 May 2010, the plaintiff saw a Dr Paul at Dr Keith's practice and complained of increasing neck pain, which he had been suffering for the previous eight years, clearly relating back to the event of 29 September 2001.
	
	
	I do know, from the report of Dr Selwyn Smith of 14 August 2012, that the plaintiff made a statement on 24 June 2010 in which he said that he did not initially provide a truthful account of what had happened to him on 19 April 2010, because he feared what Mr Foster would do to him and to his dogs.
	
	
	On 7 July 2010, the plaintiff saw Dr Aamer at Dr Keith's practice and gave him a history of having been run over by a vehicle 'three months ago' which is roughly, of course, 19 April 2010.
	
	
	If the initial history given by the plaintiff or on his behalf to the ambulance officers and to the Canberra Hospital be untrue, then the plaintiff very quickly commenced giving the correct histories. The first history consistent with what the plaintiff now says, was recorded by Dr Endrey-Walder on 7 May 2010. There were then histories recorded by two other specialists shortly thereafter to the same effect. The evidence adduced by the plaintiff is that given by him, that given by Mr Brenton Hawkins, who is now an adult, and by his cousin, Ms Toni Tutty. The evidence given in the defence case is by Mr Kelso, which I have no hesitation in accepting, but it really doesn't advance the matter very far, and by the defendant himself. The two versions are completely inconsistent. In essence, the defendant used a version of events which could well be consistent with the contemporaneous histories given to Mr Kelso, to the ambulance service and initially at the Canberra Hospital and consistent with a denial of being run over, that the plaintiff made to police on the afternoon of 19 April 2010.
	
	
	To a large extent, I believe that the plaintiff's evidence is largely reconstructed from that which he can remember and what he has been told by Mr Hawkins. For example, the history recorded by Associate Professor Shores tells me that the last memory of events of the plaintiff was of the driver of the vehicle clearly the defendant, trying to strangle him in the vehicle, of his getting out of the vehicle, then recalling a flash of light and lying on the ground in pain. What the professor went on to record was clearly what the plaintiff had been told by somebody who was there and that must have been Mr Hawkins.
	
	
	Ms Toni Tutty was not there. She was in a tent back at the camp. Her evidence is that when the defendant, Mr Johnnie Foster returned to the camp, he woke her up as she had requested that he do and said words to this effect:
	


""Your cousin is a fuck head. I just run him over and he is being airlifted out of here.""

The problem is that the defendant had left Mr Kelso's property whilst the 000 call was being made. How was he to know that the plaintiff would eventually be airlifted from the Tumbarumba Showground to the Canberra Hospital? It is highly unlikely, in my view, that the defendant said that the plaintiff was about to be airlifted out of the State Forest or from near the campsite. However, her evidence contains a frank admission by the defendant of his deliberately running the plaintiff over. Nevertheless, Ms Tutty did not tell anybody about this admission of gross criminality to anybody, until she told the police in May 2011, after her relationship with the defendant had ceased in December 2010. Ms Tutty also said that on 20 April 2010, she visited her cousin, the plaintiff, at the Canberra Hospital and according to Ms Tutty, the plaintiff said words to the effect:

""Your boyfriend is a fuck head. He ran me over and do not speak further to me.""

In other words, Ms Tutty asked me to accept that on 20 April, the plaintiff confirmed to her what she had been told by the defendant, his being deliberately run down. Yet again she makes no disclosure of this piece of information to anybody, until May 2011. Furthermore, despite what she would have me believe, she maintained her sexual friendship with the defendant for a further eight months. One would find it difficult to continue such a relationship with somebody who deliberately caused damage to one's family member, her cousin, the plaintiff. Furthermore, one will note the similarity of language attributed both to the defendant and to the plaintiff. The person is described as either ""your cousin"" or ""your boyfriend"", then that person is declared to be a ""fuck head"", by the defendant and then by the plaintiff, and the words run/ran over are used in exactly the same way in each alleged utterance. I am afraid that I am unable to accept the evidence of Ms Tutty.


	
	There remains the evidence of Mr Hawkins. Again, I haves some difficulty with it. Mr Hawkins, at the time, was only 14 years old. He would have been an impressionable lad. He clearly was fond of the plaintiff, who was living next door to him. The plaintiff appears to have been regularly visited by Mr Hawkins, who was the victim himself of either domestic violence or had his life blighted by domestic violence between his parents. At the relevant time, Mr Hawkins' parents had separated. There was clearly some friendship between the plaintiff and Mr Hawkins, that is, some partiality. As has been submitted by learned counsel for the defendant, I have some difficulty in accepting at least part of Mr Hawkins' evidence. His evidence that he assumed the plaintiff to have been killed by the defendant, initially giving him no assistance, his running after the defendant's vehicle, catching up with it, causing it to come to a stop, seizing the keys, then overcoming a 25 year old man, I found to be quite implausible. Furthermore, it is clear from the cross-examination that at committal proceedings in the Local Court at Wagga Wagga, on 10 December 2012, Mr Hawkins as he now is, made statements on oath which were untrue. However, he was not cross-examined about the evidence he gave at trial, but that is probably because no one has a transcript of the evidence at the trial. This case may have been run in a completely different fashion if such a transcript had been available. It is clear that at the current time, Mr Hawkins has an animus against the defendant. Again, one much approach such evidence with caution. However, that animus appears to be based on his belief that he saw the defendant deliberately run the plaintiff down. Had I watched someone deliberately run down someone who was a close friend of mine, I would have towards that tortfeasor a similar animus. It is common human experience.
	
	
	I did not form an unfavourable impression of the defendant. However, details of how the log was being moved from the road were vague and the initial histories appear to me to be somewhat inconsistent with his evidence. It must be remembered that the first time that Mr Foster gave evidence on oath about this event, was in the witness box yesterday. He did not give an interview to the police, as was his right. No adverse inference can be drawn from that fact. He gave no evidence at the committal or at the trial. He was not required to do so. No adverse inference can be drawn from that either. However, he has had the opportunity of seeing and hearing others involved in this case previously give evidence and clearly he could recollect it, because some of his answers indicate what had happened at the trial. In other words, the defendant himself had an opportunity to confess and avoid, to tell a story that made him a 'small target'. However, there is one matter which appears to have arisen without any forethinking by him. Initially the defendant said that prior to engaging the winch of his vehicle to try to draw the tree from across the road, he had caused the plaintiff to stand clear, as is proper procedure. He said the plaintiff came back to the side of his vehicle, as I understand it on the left-hand side of the front mudguard of the car. However, when the plaintiff was struck, the plaintiff was 3 or 4 metres ahead of the car. How the plaintiff went to that position in a relatively short time, to put himself in a position of danger, the defendant himself could not explain.
	
	
	There are some other factors which have weighed heavily on my mind. The first is, as was pointed out by learned counsel for the plaintiff, that the sudden departure of the defendant from Mr Kelso's property, almost immediately after the plaintiff had been placed on the veranda of the home, is indicative of there being a “split up”, if one can use that expression, or a disagreement between the plaintiff and the defendant. According to the defendant's position, although there had been an argument earlier in the evening, between him and the plaintiff, they were in an amicable state, when they found the road ahead of them impeded by the fallen tree. The idea was to winch that tree off the road and the plaintiff took the cable of the winch and placed the cable around the tree, attaching the end of the cable to an earlier section of the cable and then the plaintiff walked clear and the defendant then engaged the winch. In this procedure, the plaintiff was injured. They were out pig hunting together. They were known to each other, through Toni Tutty. They were, on any view of it, two Australian males out enjoying a particular ""matey"" occupation, hunting, after engaging in another “matey” Australian activity, the drinking of beer. The behaviour of the defendant was not consistent with their being mates. That does speak of some ill will at the time between the plaintiff and the defendant, which could have led the defendant, in a moment of madness, to run the plaintiff down.
	
	
	The other thing which weighs heavily upon my mind is this. I know, from Associate Professor Shores' report, that the plaintiff has a full IQ of 65. The plaintiff is illiterate. Not only can he not read or write, he cannot spell. He can sign his name, but signatures I have seen, indicate a very poor hand indeed. He would probably be better off making a mark. The suggestion made by learned counsel for the defendant, that the plaintiff has made up this story in order to obtain an award of damages is, in the circumstances of this case, unacceptable. As I have already mentioned, the plaintiff rapidly commenced giving what he now says is the correct version of events. There is no suggestion that he had, for example, consulted either lawyers, or indeed, ""bush lawyers"", about his rights resulting from the accident which he now says occurred.
	
	
	Furthermore, for the plaintiff and Mr Hawkins to make allegations which were patently untrue against a person such as Mr Foster, would be completely contrary to the Australian ethos of supporting your mates and the making of allegations, which might have led to the defendant’s being incarcerated for many years, would be a “dog act”, to use the vernacular: it would be the height of evil and/or malice and is not the impression that I have of either the plaintiff or Brenton Hawkins. I therefore accept that around 3.30am on the morning of 19 April 2010 the defendant so drove his vehicle that he knocked the plaintiff to the ground.
	
	
	It is difficult to work out exactly how the accident happened, but it appears that the plaintiff may have been knocked onto his chest/abdomen. The photographs which were posed for with the police, clearly indicated the plaintiff was facing away from the defendant's vehicle. The plaintiff's pain was experienced on his anterior body, that is on the front of his body, rather than the back and would indicate to me he's been knocked to the ground and the front of his body came in contact with the ground. I accept that the plaintiff sustained a slightly displaced fracture of the lateral aspect of the right eighth rib, a fracture of the right scapula, a non-displaced fracture of the parietal bone of the skull, without any intracranial haemorrhage, and without any brain damage, and a small apical pneumothorax. The major injury appears to have been the pneumothorax, which of course would have caused the breathing difficulties attested to it in the evidence of Mr Kelso. There was also a small haematoma in the eighth segment of the plaintiff's liver, together with extensive abrasions on the right side of the plaintiff's head, face and chest, and also right leg, according to Dr Cole's statement of 25 March 2012, although that is not mentioned in the discharge summary, and the only item in the ambulance records which might indicate a right leg problem, was pain over the patella on each side. There was certainly no evidence of any injury to the plaintiff's right foot. The plaintiff also had a psychiatric reaction to this injury. It was thought, at the hospital, the plaintiff might have sustained post-traumatic stress disorder. A psychiatrist at the hospital recommended increasing the plaintiff's doze of Avanza, to 60 milligrams at night, because of a suspicion of the existence of PTSD. The plaintiff, for many years prior to this accident, had been prescribed Avanza. No surgery was practised at the hospital. The only restriction placed on the plaintiff on discharge was that he should not go flying for four weeks, because of the previous pneumothorax.
	
	
	The plaintiff's medical history is complicated by the fact that the plaintiff can be very shortly and succinctly described as accident prone. The plaintiff had profound learning difficulties as a child. His general practitioner, Dr Keith, has described the plaintiff as having specific learning difficulties since childhood, thus leading to his inability to read or write or spell. He commenced an apprenticeship as a painter and although acquiring all the practical skills of a painter, did not finish the final year of the formal education required by TAFE. Accordingly, he has not qualified himself as a tradesman painter.
	
	
	The plaintiff has, since the age of 18 smoked cannabis. The most recent medical report before me, one by Dr McClure, a psychiatrist, was made on 30 August 2013. Dr McClure obtained a history that the plaintiff admitted smoking cannabis ""now and then"", which was eventually worked out to mean ""a couple of cones"" several times a week to relieve pain and to stop the plaintiff ""thinking"" about what had happened to him. Further, in the report at page 8, Dr McClure noted that cannabis use continued and that the plaintiff would smoke that drug several nights a week, because it helped him to “relax” and reduced his pain level when he became ""stoned"". The plaintiff has also, for many, many years, until relatively recently, used a fair amount of alcohol.
	
	
	The plaintiff has been involved in a large number of accidents. He attended the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital on 29 June 1998. He gave a history that he was involved in a motor vehicle accident on the preceding Saturday evening, two days earlier. The plaintiff was complaining of generalised pain in his muscles, especially in his lower back and in his legs. He was prescribed anti-inflammatories and given a period of time off work. On 24 March 1999, the plaintiff attended the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital and said that on the preceding Monday night, he was wrestling with a friend and had experienced back pain, which was worse on movement. He attended the triage nurse at 2.11pm, but did not wait to be seen by the doctor, who did not become available until 3.35pm.
	
	
	On 29 September 2001, the plaintiff was involved in a motor vehicle accident near Nyngan. He and two of his friends had gone pig hunting. The idea was to go pig hunting in the Macquarie Marshes. The plaintiff eventually commenced proceedings in this Court here at Wagga Wagga in proceedings numbered 5 of 2010. The statement of claim in those proceedings is before me. Paragraph 3 of the pleadings alleges:
	


""On 29 September 2001, at about 4pm, the said motor vehicle was being driven by the defendant west on the Old Warren Road, when about 50 kilometres east of Nyngan, the plaintiff fell from the cabin of the motor vehicle and collided with the roadside.""

Some of the allegations of negligence are extremely unusual. Those include these:

""(d) Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.

(e) Failure to ensure the plaintiff was restrained by his seatbelt.

(f) Failure to decrease speed/halt when he became aware that the plaintiff was unrestrained by his seatbelt.

(g) Failure to pay heed to the plaintiff's numerous requests to stop, for the purpose of the plaintiff urinating.

(h) Swerving the said motor vehicle when the plaintiff was attempting to urinate out of the passenger side window.

(i) Excessive speed and failure to adjust speed to minimise danger to the plaintiff, when urinating, adjust speed and driving.""

Three gentlemen in the car, the defendant and the plaintiff and another, had all been drinking beer. The plaintiff had been requesting to urinate for about one hour. He could no longer contain himself and stood up with his head out of the passenger window of the car, in order to urinate. Unsurprisingly, the urine was blown back into the cab of the vehicle which caused the driver to swerve, hence causing the plaintiff to be ejected from the vehicle.


	
	In the statement of claim, it was alleged the plaintiff sustained a head injury, an injury to his neck, an injury to his back, an injury to his left arm, including a compound fracture of the left elbow, abrasions to the chest wall, an injury to the left foot and abrasions to both hands. The evidence also suggests the plaintiff injured his penis. Eventually, on 8 November 2011, the registrar of this Court signed consent orders awarding the plaintiff a verdict of $50,000, inclusive of costs and out-of-pocket expenses. The plaintiff told me that he recovered approximately $17,000 net.
	
	
	In approximately May 2003, the plaintiff was involved in another motor vehicle accident, when he rolled his utility truck. He told Dr Keith about that motor vehicle accident on 20 October 2003. On 2 October 2005, the plaintiff attended Wagga Wagga Base Hospital and eventually a stroke was diagnosed. The plaintiff had developed a speech problem, which was diagnosed as expressive dysphasia. That required the plaintiff to undergo speech therapy. X-rays taken at that time suggest that he had not only a recent intracranial bleed, but a longstanding prior intracranial bleed and it was thought that that was caused by the plaintiff’s being ejected from the vehicle on 29 September 2001.
	
	
	The plaintiff was involved in yet another motor vehicle accident on 18 October 2008. He again attended the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital. There was a relatively minor injury to his right leg, but precautionary scans were made of the plaintiff's brain. On 9 November 2008, the plaintiff had an accident at home. He saw Dr Keith on the following day. The history recorded is this:
	


""Hit left elbow yesterday afternoon and blacked out. Hit head and loss of consciousness about one minute. Residual cystic swelling, right middle finger. Left arm weakness for four years.""


	
	On 4 April 2009, the plaintiff attended the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital and complained of having been assaulted on the previous evening at a hotel. The evidence is that he was assaulted at the Black Swan Hotel at North Wagga Wagga. The plaintiff complained of headache, nausea and an unsteady gait. The history given at that time indicated a motor vehicle accident in October 2008 as being a ""high speed rollover"" and that no doubt is the event of 18 October 2008. On 4 December 2009, the plaintiff had another accident at home. He slipped in the bath and hit his head and had ongoing vomiting and diarrhoea as well as chest pain and pain in his abdomen.
	
	
	For many, many years before 19 April 2010, the plaintiff had been trying to obtain the disability support pension, with the assistance of Dr Keith. Initially the plaintiff relied upon his specific learning difficulties and a long history of asthma since childhood. In a certificate prepared on 24 September 2002, by Lorna Tyrrell, an occupational nurse, there is reference to the plaintiff's severe left arm injury, as a result of the motor vehicle accident of 29 September 2001 and of the plaintiff’s still suffering pain, pins and needles in his left arm and weakness of the limb. The plaintiff also complained to Ms Tyrell of asthma and his specific learning difficulties. Hence one can see that by 2002, the plaintiff had added to his list of ailments, an ongoing problem caused by the motor vehicle accident of 29 September 2001. In an assessment made on 26 September 2008, included in the list of ailments was the traumatic brain injury, mainly the stroke that the plaintiff had experienced, to which I have already made reference. In a certificate of 1 May 2009, Dr Keith added the condition of depression as being the first diagnosis warranting the grant of disability support pension. On 26 May 2009, nine months before the event with which I'm concerned, the plaintiff had a job capacity assessment carried out by somebody from the Wagga Wagga Centrelink office. Inter alia, the plaintiff told that examiner that he had done some ""pig chasing"" after the motor vehicle accident of 29 September 2001, but had found that far too demanding and had to give it up. However, the plaintiff was able to return to it some 11 months later!
	
	
	40    On 31 January 2010, the plaintiff was presented to the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital. The diagnosis that was offered was alcohol intoxication. A note made by the resident medical officer in the emergency department is this:
	


""Thank you for seeing Matthew, a 33 year old who presented tonight intoxicated and claiming to have been a passenger on a motorbike, when it crashed. He was picked up by the police and then brought in by ambulance, complaining of pain in various body parts. Matthew was non compliant with spinal precautions. On examination, he complained of some tenderness of the flanks and had multiple grazes of his limbs. CT head and neck was performed and no abnormality was detected. Chest X-ray and pelvis X-ray also revealed no abnormality.""


	
	The plaintiff has had only had intermittent, if any, employment since the motor vehicle accident of 29 September 2001. The plaintiff told Dr Endrey-Walder on 7 May 2010 that he had not had any remunerative work since the accident of 29 September 2001. Dr Endrey-Walder said this:
	


""I believe that his lack of work activity over the last nine years is more a function of his psycho-social condition, than the physical debility residual from the accident.""

On the plaintiff's need for care, on 7 May 2010, Dr Endrey-Walder said this:

""I understand, from his friend, that she is basically looking after his household and his domestic needs. I can see no reason as to why this man could not do his own shopping, cleaning, cooking.""


	
	As I have earlier mentioned on 12 May 2010, the plaintiff saw Associate Professor Shores. The plaintiff told Professor Shores that he had not worked since the stroke of 2 October 2005. He also told Professor Shores that he used to enjoy pig hunting, but stopped that after the accident in 2001. He also said that he'd stopped socialising after the accident in 2001. After assessing the plaintiff's IQ as being 65, the doctor said that he was not able to comment on whether the plaintiff's IQ had been decreased by the head injury of 29 September 2001, unless he had access to the records of the Department of Education, which would have been kept when the plaintiff was placed in an IM class. Professor Shores said this:
	


""Mr Keppie has a history of having suffered what appear to have been a number of insults to his brain over his lifespan, beginning most likely from or before his birth. His history that he was placed in an IM class at school, is suggestive of an intellectual disability/mild mental retardation and this indicates a problem with the development and growth of his brain. His current level of intelligence is in the range of mild mental retardation and without access to his Confidential Pupil Record from the Department of School Education, which is likely to contain his actual IQ when he's place in an IM class, it is not possible to know if the current IQ is a significant decrement or not. From the history he provided and the medical records reviewed, it appears that he has likely suffered at least 6 acute insults to his brain, in addition to the index injury [29 September 2001]…These insults to the brain include a cerebrovascular event in 2005, a motor vehicle accident in 2008, a fall in 2008, an assault in 2009, a fall in 2009, and another motor vehicle accident in 2010. His history of drug and alcohol abuse are further risk factors for neurophysiological impairment which need to be considered.""

A further complicating factor, according to the Associate Professor, was the plaintiff's apparent lack of effort on memory testing, which rendered the interpretation of the assessment ""unreliable"". The Professor could not rule out exaggeration of the level of the plaintiff's impairment, in other words, the distinct possibility of malingering.


	
	The plaintiff was seen by Dr Noll on 20 May 2010. Again, the plaintiff told Dr Noll that he had not been able to undertake any paid work since 29 September 2001. He referred to having been on Newstart Allowance for the previous six years and of his inability to find any suitable work. On the question of care, the plaintiff told the doctor that a lady friend, who worked as a cleaner, helped him with his household chores. The only person that is so identified to me is Ms Toni Tutty. The plaintiff, however, told Dr Noll that he would be able to manage the housework independently of her assistance, if so required. The plaintiff went on to tell the doctor, however, that he had difficulty hanging clothes on the clothesline, because that caused a problem with his neck. The plaintiff alleged an injury to his neck in the motor vehicle accident on 29 September 2001. I have carefully read Dr Noll's report. It appears to me that he could not find anything physically wrong with the plaintiff at that time.
	
	
	Eventually the plaintiff was awarded a disability support pension on 6 October 2011. Exhibit 8 are certain records from Centrelink. They indicate that the plaintiff was on receipt of the Newstart benefits from at least 19 April 2007. During the whole of the period of time, the plaintiff has been in receipt of benefits from the Department of Social Security, he has only ever declared one piece of income. That income was the sum of $80 paid to him by a firm of painters on 25 November 2010, i.e., after the accident with which I am now dealing.
	
	
	45    In essence, the plaintiff's complaints now are much the same as they were before the event of 19 April 2010, but they are expressed a little more robustly. The only objective thing that can be said about the medical evidence obtained for the purpose of the present litigation is that there may be an addition to the extent of the plaintiff's depressive illness. For example, prior to the accident now in question, the plaintiff was on a lower dose of Avanza than 60 milligrams nocte, that he is now on, although in the distant past it had been at the same level.
	
	
	The plaintiff claims and is supported in this claim by Dr Endrey-Walder, who has seen him for a second time, in connection with the current case, that he has the additional problem now of low back pain, which he never had in the past and Dr Endrey-Walder has diagnosed a discal problem at the L4-5 level. At the top of page 7 of his report of 12 March 2013, Dr Endrey-Walder said this:
	


""While his chronic, long term neck symptoms were clearly aggravated by the accident, it is his lower back condition that has been the most persistent and debilitating.

It is noteworthy that there is no past history in his doctor's clinical notes of any lower back related symptoms and that he complained of no lower back pain to me when I assessed him for the MVA of September 2001.

Furthermore, the CT scan report of three months ago highlights only single level disc damage. That is, a left-sided foraminal disc extrusion at the L4-5 level (I did not see the films, only the report) which was thought to impact on the left L4 nerve root, the L5 and S1 nerve roots remaining clear.""

For the plaintiff's low back condition, the doctor thought the plaintiff had a WPI of 5%. The problem with that opinion is that the doctor did not correctly read the GP's records. I have pointed out the plaintiff's complaints of low back pain, recorded by records from the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital on 29 June 1998 and 24 March 1999. Back pain was reported by Dr Keith on 24 September 2008, after the plaintiff's relationship of three years with a lady broke-up two weeks previously, causing the plaintiff to ""stress out"". The plaintiff also complained to Dr Gupta at Dr Keith's practice of backache on 8 December 2009, less than six months before the event now in question, and Dr Gupta noted that the plaintiff had been to the emergency department of the local hospital for backache and had been prescribed a painkiller for backache, namely Codalgin Forte. Furthermore, there is no mention in the discharge summary from the Canberra Hospital of back pain. There were numerous radiological investigations, but they were confined to the chest, the pelvis, the brain, the cervical spine and the abdomen; none of the low back. I am afraid that the plaintiff has probably had intermittent low back pain on a number of occasions over many years.


	
	The plaintiff has not crossed the threshold to obtain an award of damages for non-economic loss. The plaintiff's past out-of-pocket expenses have been agreed to amount to $1,396.35. The plaintiff claims a sum of $8,557 for future out-of-pocket expenses, being allowance of $10 a week for 33 years, when the plaintiff will attain the age of 70. The plaintiff was on Avanza and is still on Avanza. Only the amount of that drug he takes has increased. Whether that remains the case for the future, I do not know. Bearing in mind the finding of Dr McClure of an exacerbation of the plaintiff's depressive illness, I can accept that there might be some future need for increased psychiatric medication or psychiatric care, but not a great deal. Doing the best I can, I allow a cushion of $1,000 for future out-of-pocket expenses.
	
	
	The plaintiff claims for past and future loss of earning capacity the sum of $20,000. The plaintiff was, in essence, outside the normal workforce prior to this motor vehicle accident. To say that he was on the periphery of the workforce at the time would, in my view, be exaggerating. The plaintiff worked from time to time and generally in the cash economy. There is evidence of the plaintiff, for example, working after the event now in question, when he received the sum of $80 from a firm of painters. That has been disclosed to the Department of Social Security. There is also, in the records of the plaintiff's general practitioner, on 9 September 2010 a note that the plaintiff was ""back at painting work"".    The plaintiff attended Dr Keith's surgery on 29 September 2011 to have a dressing changed. The notes of this consultation are:
	


""Has wound to the left index finger, which was sustained whilst holding a star post, whilst his friend tried to hit it into the ground with a piece of metal pipe - split the end of finger and fingernail missing - was seen at Wagga Wagga Base Hospital emergency department on Tuesday evening.""

This would indicate the plaintiff was involving himself with the driving of a star picket, perhaps doing a bit of fencing to help a friend. The sum claimed for past and future economic loss is, in my view, far too great. However, I believe some allowance should be made. The plaintiff was clearly totally incapacity whilst he was in the Canberra Hospital and no doubt would have still had some ongoing pains for some stage after the event now in question. The plaintiff's earning capacity may also have been affected by the exacerbation or aggravation of his depressive illness. Doing the best I can, I allow a cushion for past and future economic loss of $5,000.


	
	The plaintiff's further claim is for future paid domestic assistance, one and a half hours per week, at $30 per hour to the age to 70. The lump sum claim is $25,671. The problem with that is that in essence, what is now claimed was much the same as what was claimed in respect of the motor vehicle accident of 29 September 2001. I have already remarked upon the observations made by the doctors in May 2010 as to that claim. The plaintiff admitted that he could care for himself, if he were motivated to do so and his motivation can be improved by taking appropriate medication. In any event, he has been assisted in housework by his cousin, Ms Toni Tutty, who works as a cleaner and she helps the plaintiff clean his house. She also reminds him from time to time that it is necessary for him to shower or wash or bathe, because sometimes the plaintiff forgets to do so, or is not motivated to do so. There is no evidence that she will not continue to render such assistance to the plaintiff.
	
	
	In Miller v Galderisi [2009] NSWCA 353, Delaney DCJ entered a verdict in favour of a plaintiff for $152,403.11. That was reduced, on appeal, to $9,111.11. The Court, Allsop P and Basten and Macfarlan JJA delivered a joint judgment. Their Honours set aside the award made for paid domestic assistance. Commencing at [15] their Honours said this:
	


""15. The evidence indicated that such domestic assistance as the respondent needed was being provided at the date of trial by his wife, and to a limited extent by his adult son who lived with him. The appellant pointed out, correctly, that there was no evidence that this gratuitous assistance would cease at some time in the future.

16. In our view, the award made by his Honour cannot be justified. It was made upon the assumption that the respondent required commercial domestic assistance immediately and would continue to do so for the rest of his life. However, it is clear that he did not require it immediately because it was being provided gratuitously, though to the extent that it could be attributed to the accident, not at a level of intensity that permitted recovery from the appellant.

17. As the assessment made by the primary judge cannot be justified, it is necessary for this Court to make an assessment.

18. There is no reason in principle why, if the evidence justifies it, damages may not be awarded in respect of a need for commercial domestic assistance likely to arise in the future after the availability of gratuitous assistance ceases.""

Their Honours went on to discuss Nominal Defendant v Lane [2004] NSWCA 405 and continued thus:

""19. The evidence accepted by the primary judge at the additional domestic assistance required as a result of the accident, assessed at four hours per week, was, since the accident and at the time of trial, being provided by the respondent’s wife, with limited assistance from his son. Whether that assistance would continue to be provided by them on a gratuitous basis was a factor which the primary judge was entitled to take into account. If the circumstance were to change in the future, domestic assistance would, foreseeably, be required from a commercial provider. However, that expense was neither immediate nor inevitable. No doubt the likelihood of the contingency would increase with time, but other factors would have a contrary tendency.""

Their Honours then identified four relevant variables. The fact was the plaintiff in that case was in poor health and it was unlikely that he would live to the age of 85, because of having had a stroke and two heart attacks. There was also a possibility that the plaintiff in that case would experience further ill health, which could overwhelm the needs created by the accident. Furthermore, mere age makes the need for such assistance greater, even without ill health. Furthermore, in that case, the plaintiff's wife was ten years younger than the plaintiff and there was no evidence to suggest she could not continue to give assistance to her husband.


	
	Here, there is no evidence that Ms Tutty will not continue to provide assistance to the plaintiff. She currently is working in Wagga Wagga as a cleaner. She is much younger than the plaintiff. Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest that the plaintiff will not experience further health problems or get himself involved in further accidents. Such is highly likely, bearing in mind the history which I have recorded. I am not persuaded on the balance of probabilities that there is a need for future paid domestic assistance on the evidence before me. The total sum of the damages which appear to me to be appropriate is the sum of $7,396.36.
	
	
	Does anyone want any further reasons for judgment?
	
	
	FOORD: No, your Honour.
	
	
	RYAN: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: For those reasons, I give verdict and judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant for $7,396.36.
	


[Counsel addressed the question of costs]


	
	HIS HONOUR: The defendant argues against the principle that costs should follow the event because the plaintiff has recovered a very small amount of damages. Objectively, that is so, but even a small amount of damages might be a solace to a person in the position of the current plaintiff. However, the real contest here was not about quantum. The real contest here was about liability. To think that a case of the current nature could be litigated properly in the Local Court is, with great respect to those who sit in the Local Court, highly unlikely. The defendant himself had been committed for trial by the Local Court and eventually was to stand for trial before a judge and a jury of 12. His case, on the question of liability and damages, had to be properly heard and in my view, it was proper in the circumstances for his case and the case brought against him by the plaintiff to be heard in an appropriate forum where the usual rules of practice and procedure, and evidence apply, where there is a tribunal of fact which regularly hears claims of a current nature, that is an action for damages for personal injury. Very few of such actions are ever heard in the Local Court. In my view, the plaintiff was entitled to commence these proceedings in this Court in order to vindicate his rights, which rights in essence have been vindicated, the major contest being about liability. In my view, the plaintiff should get his costs. Pursuant to UCPR 42.35, I order the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs.

		30 June 2016",2014-05-20 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705067,R v Forrest [2014] NSWSC 612,"reasons for verdict

1The accused, Kerry Forrest, is on trial before me, sitting without a jury, for the murder of William Adamson, alleged to have been committed at Campbelltown between 13 and 17 April 2010. It is the Crown case that she administered to him a large dose of a morphine based pain killer, MS-Contin, causing his death from morphine toxicity. It is also the Crown case that the killing was premeditated, motivated by financial gain. 

2The case against the accused is circumstantial. Mr Adamson was an elderly man, and Ms Forrest had been his carer. By way of background, the Crown relies upon evidence that she became extensively involved in his financial affairs, that she gained access to a large amount of his money, and that she was gambling heavily on poker machines. As to the killing, the Crown relies upon detailed evidence of her movements, as recounted by her or as proved by other evidence, around the time of Mr Adamson's death and immediately after it.

3Ms Forrest did not give evidence. That, of course, was her right and I draw no inference against her on that account. What I must decide is whether the evidence I do have establishes her guilt of the murder beyond reasonable doubt. There is no basis for the alternative verdict of guilty of manslaughter, and neither the Crown prosecutor nor Ms Forrest's counsel, Mr Ainsworth, suggested that there was. Very little of the evidence in the Crown case is challenged. The crucial question is what inferences can be drawn from it.

Background

4Mr Adamson was 84 years old at the time of his death. He had been living at a home in Kareela, which he owned. In September 2009 his wife, Beryl, died after a long illness. She had a son, John, from a previous relationship. He was a child when she married Mr Adamson, who brought him up as his own son. He is now in his mid-sixties. There were no other children. Mr Adamson also had two sisters, Elizabeth and Eva, both of them living on the north coast of New South Wales. It seems that in the years leading to his death he did not have regular contact with John or his sisters. 

5During Beryl's last months she had had the services of carers. After her death Mr Adamson advertised for a live-in carer. This was not for health reasons. He was reasonably fit for his age and was mentally alert. He was retired, in his earlier years having been a real estate agent and having also been involved in property development. However, in recent years he had been engaged in the development of an invention of his, a water saving device known as the Rainsaver. At the time of his wife's death he was still trying to market it. 

6Ms Forrest was 50 years old at this time. Forrest was her married name, but the marriage had broken down. However, she continued to use that name at times, while she used her maiden name of Jewel at other times. 

7Ms Forrest answered the advertisement and, after an interview in September 2009, secured the position. One of Mrs Adamson's carers, Ms Evelyn Smith, was present at the home on that day. Mr Adamson told her that Ms Forrest was suitable because, among other things, she had office experience, she could teach him how to use the internet, and she could help in the process of marketing the Rainsaver. It seems that his management of his financial affairs left something to be desired. A bookkeeper whom he had engaged in 2008, Ms Debra Keegan, described his organisational ability as ""messy."" Shortly thereafter, Ms Forrest moved into the home.

8In 2008 Mr Adamson had obtained an advance of a little under $276,800, to fund the development and marketing of his invention, from Homesafe Solutions Pty Ltd, a Victorian based company. This was by a process known as equity release, which was available to elderly people to borrow on the security of their homes with repayment to be made from their estate upon their death. 

9He had incurred considerable expense, including through the engagement of a patent attorney, who had obtained a trademark for his product in 2006, and a marketing consultant, who worked on the project between 2005 and 2008. That consultant, Mr Peter Windgrove, set up a company and a website for the promotion of the device. In 2007, one thousand of the devices were manufactured but very few of them were sold. Circumstances at the time were such that, in Mr Windgrove's view, Mr Adamson had ""missed the boat."" However, Mr Adamson refused to accept this and decided that he would take over the marketing of the product himself.

10Unfortunately, the device remained a commercial failure. By the time Ms Forrest moved into the Kareela home, Mr Adamson had spent the money he had received from Homesafe Solutions. He had no savings, his only income was a pension, and his only asset was the home. 

11As I have said, an important part of the Crown case is Ms Forrest's interest, and increasing involvement, in Mr Adamson's financial affairs. In November and December 2009, she was sending emails to Ms Keegan and to his accountant, Ms Annette Tasker demanding access to his financial records. This led to an acrimonious exchange of emails, which I need not recount.

12On 11 January 2010, Ms Forrest rang Homesafe Solutions on several occasions, seeking information about the details of the equity release system. Among other things, she asked whether more than one loan could be taken out. She also enquired about a situation where a home owner who had obtained a loan remarried and then died. Her enquiry was directed to the position of the surviving spouse in relation to the home. She did not identify herself, saying that her enquiries were purely hypothetical and that she was doing a course relating to equity release. 

13These calls were recorded according to the routine at Homesafe Solutions, and a computer record was kept of the telephone number of the caller. Each of the calls was made from the home phone of Mr Adamson. Recordings of the calls, together with a transcript, are in evidence: exhibit 31. 

14Three calls on 11 January were answered by the same employee at Homesafe Solutions. The fourth and last call was answered by a different employee, but that person was apparently aware of the previous calls. She referred to the fact that Ms Forrest had phoned earlier, which Ms Forrest firmly denied, saying that this was the first time she had rung. When the employee pointed out that all the calls had come from the same telephone number, Ms Forrest said that she was not the only one at the place where she was calling, falsely claiming that there were fifteen people there. 

15It is apparent from the whole of the evidence that the relationship between Ms Forrest and Mr Adamson was a friendly one. Ms Forrest told her daughter, Kara Forrest, that he had expressed interest in marrying her but she thought it might have been a joke. A number of witnesses gave evidence of Mr Adamson telling them that he thought of marrying her or, indeed, that they had discussed marriage. However, for the most part, he recounted this to the witnesses in such a way that they did not take it seriously.

16Early in February 2010, arrangements were put in place for the sale of the Kareela home. Ms Forrest made several further calls to Homesafe Solutions enquiring about calculation of the payout to that company on the sale. In these calls she identified herself and directed her enquiries expressly to the loan to Mr Adamson. In evidence, part of exhibit 31, are calls on 12 February, 9 March and 22 March 2010. During the call of 9 March she handed the phone to Mr Adamson so that he could confirm to the Homesafe Solutions employee that she was acting on his behalf. He said that she was his ""secretary"" and that she did everything. He also discussed with the employee briefly the proposed sale of the home. 

17After the call of 12 February Ms Forrest's enquiries, including those of 11 January, came to the attention of a senior member of the Homesafe Solutions staff, Ms Dianne Shepherd. Ms Shepherd phoned Mr Adamson to confirm his connection with Ms Forrest. He said that she was taking care of his affairs and acting for him. Within the ensuing 24 hours Ms Forrest phoned Ms Shepherd. She appeared upset, expressing concern that Ms Shepherd had divulged information of a private nature. She claimed that her enquiries in January had been in relation to her grandmother, not Mr Adamson. Neither of these calls was recorded because in both of them Ms Shepherd was using her direct line.

Home sale

18The sale of the home was placed in the hands of an estate agency, The Holt Property Group. In early February 2010, two real estate agents from that organisation went to the home and spoke to Mr Adamson and Ms Forrest. The first of them was Ms Maureen De Souza, who went to the home for the purpose of a market appraisal. The second was Ms Susan O'Neill, who went there with other staff from her office for what was called a group inspection. 

19Both of them noted that Ms Forrest did most of the talking. Nevertheless, it appeared to Ms De Souza, who seems to have been in charge of the conduct of the sale, that Mr Adamson knew what was happening and assented to what Ms Forrest was saying. Ms Forrest made it clear that they wanted a quick sale. When asked by Ms De Souza when they wanted the house put on the market, she replied, ""Yesterday."" She said that they were going to build a new home on a block of land in Bundanoon. Mr Adamson told Ms De Souza about the Rainsaver, showing her an area of the house where a number of the devices were stored, and said that one of the reasons they wanted to sell the house was so that he could raise funds to market it. 

20The next day a sales agreement was completed and in due course, after the home had been open for inspection, a married couple, Mr and Mrs Mullins, expressed interest in buying the home.

21Towards the end of February there were negotiations with the purchasers about the sale price, which was ultimately agreed at $690,000. Ms De Souza noted that instructions to her during those negotiations came mainly from Ms Forrest. When agreement was reached, Ms Forrest insisted that the price offered would be accepted only if the Mullins' agreed to the immediate release of $25,000 from the deposit payable on exchange of contracts. To this they did agree. Contracts were exchanged on 1 March 2010, and on 16 March the $25,000 released from the deposit was paid into a joint account of Mr Adamson and Ms Forrest which they had opened a few days earlier.

22Also in February 2010, Ms Forrest and Mr Adamson had engaged a conveyancer, Ms Angela Nicholson. Ms Forrest contacted her by phone and, after discussing the work she was to do and arrangements for payment, Ms Nicholson spoke to Mr Adamson to confirm her instructions to act. She prepared the contract of sale which was entered into on 1 March, and was in contact with the purchasers' solicitors. However, she was not to see the transaction through to completion.

23In the recorded call by Ms Forrest to Homesafe Solutions on 22 March she spoke to Ms Shepherd. In the course of that conversation Ms Forrest said, ""We've dismissed the conveyancer now and so I'll be handling the end of it."" The first Ms Nicholson knew of this was during a telephone conversation she had later that day with a representative of Homesafe Solutions. She phoned Ms Forrest, who denied that she had terminated her services, saying that she was calling Homesafe Solutions to discuss whether she should get legal representation. 

24Ms Nicholson decided to go to the Kareela home to discuss the matter with Mr Adamson and Ms Forrest. She did so the next day, and had a conversation with Ms Forrest about the conveyance, leaving her to understand that she was still acting in the matter. However, Ms Forrest appeared to be in a hurry to go out and ushered her out of the house somewhat peremptorily. Ms Nicholson left but, troubled by the visit, returned to the home. Ms Forrest was not there, but Mr Adamson confirmed that Ms Nicholson was acting for him in the matter, saying that he knew of no suggestion to the contrary.

25However, the next day, 24 March, she received a letter from the purchasers' solicitors saying that they would have no further contact with her because they had been instructed by Ms Forrest that she was no longer acting for Mr Adamson. She drove straight to the Adamson home, again to find that Ms Forrest was not there. She had a conversation with Mr Adamson, which she recorded on her mobile phone. An edited disc of that conversation and a transcript are exhibit 35.

26It is apparent from that conversation that Mr Adamson did not know that Ms Nicholson's retainer had been terminated. He said that Ms Forrest hadn't discussed anything like that with him and that, in his view, she should ""stay to the end."" He also expressed concern about the $25,000 expected to have been released from the deposit on the sale of the home, apparently unaware that it had been deposited into the joint account on 16 March. Ms Nicholson rang Ms De Souza, who spoke to him on the phone and told him that this had been done. 

27By way of explanation of his concern, he told Ms Nicholson that Ms Forrest owned two blocks of land in the Southern Highlands area, that she had a buyer for one of those blocks and that they were going to build a house on the remaining block. He described it as a ""spec"" house and, apparently, understood that they would be moving to Tweed Heads. A barn was first to be erected on the land, which would be temporary living quarters and a storage area. He understood that the money from the deposit was to be used to engage a building company and to pay for tradesmen who would be needed. Indeed, he believed that on that very day Ms Forrest was going to the building company to make an initial payment of $3,000.

28He described this as a ""business deal"" which he had with Ms Forrest. He told Ms Nicholson that Ms Forrest was his secretary and the manager of the company promoting his invention. He said that she was ""more capable at it"" than he was, so that she ""does everything, she hires and fires and does everything."" He added that at that stage he could not afford to advertise the Rainsaver, because he had spent $400,000 on the development of it and was ""broke.""

29During this meeting Ms Nicholson had Mr Adamson sign a memorandum of transfer, which had been sent to him by the purchasers' solicitors. She also had him sign a costs agreement in respect of her services.

30That same evening Ms Forrest left a message on Ms Nicholson's home voicemail. It expressed Ms Forrest's disapproval of Ms Nicholson's conduct that day in strident terms. She said that she was ""horrified"" that, while she was out, Ms Nicholson had gone to the house again ""to get Bill to sign something without me being there."" She expressly terminated Ms Nicholson's services, saying that they were not going to pay her bill and that she should return all their paperwork by mail. She added that Ms Nicholson could communicate with her by email, but was not to ring her or to come to their home. When Ms Nicholson heard this message she recorded it. That recording, together with a transcript, is exhibit 37.

31The next morning, 25 March, Ms Forrest came to Ms Nicholson's home and knocked loudly on the door. Ms Nicholson did not admit her, but from outside she expressed herself, in a raised voice, to be very unhappy that Ms Nicholson had been to see Mr Adamson without her being there. Ms Nicholson called the police and, in due course, through the mediation of the police officer, she was handed a letter from Ms Forrest terminating her services.

32Ms Nicholson was never paid for her work. She believed that she had handled the matter competently and was never told why her services were dispensed with. 

33For some years Ms Forrest had owned a block of land at Bundanoon. In 2002 she made an application to subdivide it. For reasons which were explained by a town planner at the relevant Council, Mr Michael Carpenter, and which need not concern us, that proved to be a very long process. It was finally released for subdivision in November 2010, although Ms Forrest had sent an email to the Council requesting its release on 29 March of that year. Contrary to Mr Adamson's understanding conveyed to Ms Nicholson, it was certainly not the case that Ms Forrest had two blocks of land, for one of which there was a buyer.

34In early March 2010, Ms Forrest attended a display village at Warwick Farm conducted by building company, Masterton Homes, where she saw a sales consultant, Mr Dino Novak. She enquired about the construction of a home on the property at Bundanoon. She struck Mr Novak as being knowledgeable about the matter and ""very genuine"". In due course the company prepared a quotation of $310,000 for the type of home she wanted. Mr Novak told her of that quotation by telephone on 16 April 2010, the day on which Mr Adamson was found dead. During the conversation, Mr Novak said, she seemed ""very keen"" and said that she would be coming in to leave a deposit. Again contrary to Mr Adamson's belief, she had not paid a deposit and never did so. Mr Novak had no further contact with her.

35In 2007 Ms Forrest had entered into an agreement with an estate agency, Highland Rural Real Estate, to sell her block. In the event, it was not sold until December 2010 when it was in the hands of a different agency. However, it was still with the original agency in April of that year. The licensee, Mr Henry Ramage, gave evidence that on 17 April he received a note of a phone message from Ms Forrest enquiring whether anything was happening with the sale. As will be seen, the message was actually left after hours on the preceding day, 16 April.

36On 20 April 2010, Ms Forrest attended the premises at Narellan of a company known as Capital Steel Building South West. There she saw the proprietor, Ms Michelle Paradjik and sought a quotation for the construction of a large shed. She said that it would be used partly as a temporary residence, and said something to the effect that there was a settlement coming her way. She prepared a quotation, but Ms Forrest asked for a further quotation as she was trying to economise on the construction. A second quotation was prepared on 1 May, but Ms Paradjik did not hear from Ms Forrest again and the shed was never proceeded with.

37Settlement of the sale of the house was fixed for Monday, 12 April 2010. Ms Forrest and Mr Adamson moved their property out over the weekend of 10 and 11, a matter to which I shall return. They both attended the settlement at the office of the solicitors for Homesafe Solutions. That company had forwarded to the solicitor handling the matter, Ms Evelyn Gardis, a document signed by Mr Adamson authorising Ms Forrest to represent his interests at the settlement. 

38The settlement having been completed, Mr Adamson and Ms Forrest checked in that night at the Maclin Lodge Motel at Campbelltown. What occurred between that Monday and the Friday, 16 April, is crucial to the Crown case, and I shall deal with it later. It is necessary at this stage to trace the movement of the proceeds of the sale of the home. That has been the subject of a considerable body of evidence, but it can be summarised relatively briefly.

Sale Proceeds

39I have referred to the joint account opened by Ms Forrest and Mr Adamson. It was opened on 25 February 2010 at the Miranda branch of Bankwest. The bank officer who attended to them noted that Mr Adamson was silent for most of the transaction, and appeared to be happy to let Ms Forrest do most of the talking. The account was one upon which either of them could operate and, in the event of one of them dying, the funds were to be paid to the survivor. Two types of account were opened, a high interest internet account known as the TeleNet account, and an account for everyday use known as the Lite Direct account. It is unnecessary to examine the TeleNet account, which was only briefly in credit. It is the transactions on the everyday account which are significant. That account could be accessed by an ATM card.

40As I have said, the $25,000 released from the deposit on the home was paid into that account on 16 March 2010. This was effectively the whole of the funds in the account. Thereafter, from 17 to 29 March, there was a series of withdrawals from the account which almost exhausted it. (I put to one side a dishonoured cheque, the circumstances of which need not be recited, which put the account into debit at the end of March.) Some of these withdrawals were by ATM for relatively small amounts. However, others were for substantial amounts withdrawn at the Miranda branch. Those withdrawal vouchers, signed by Ms Forrest in the name of Jewel, are in evidence. Three of the ATM withdrawals were made at the Cronulla Sutherland Leagues Club where, it will be seen, Ms Forrest gambled on poker machines. 

41The ATM withdrawals were made using a card in Mr Adamson's name. However, I am satisfied that it was Ms Forrest who was using it. This is apparent from the withdrawals at the Leagues Club, which she frequented and where she gambled regularly. Moreover, I accept that Mr Adamson did not know that the $25,000 was in that account until 24 March, during his conversation with Ms Nicholson. Of course, not only had the money been deposited into the account; by that time the lion's share of it had been dissipated.

42Upon the settlement of the sale of the home on 12 April 2010, a cheque for the net proceeds, $318,822.75, was deposited into the account. At that point the account had been in debit. Ms Forrest withdrew $8,500 on the following day, suggesting that a special clearance of the cheque had been obtained. On the next day, 14 April, she obtained a bank cheque for $285,000 and withdrew $8,900 in cash, this being the majority of the proceeds of the sale. This was two days before Mr Adamson was found dead in the motel room. 

43On the same day, Ms Forrest opened an account in her own name at the Parramatta branch of the Credit Union of Australia and deposited the bank cheque for $285,000 into it. By the end of April the funds in that account had been largely exhausted by cash withdrawals and substantial transfers of money to two accounts which she held with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA). Those transfers were effected by Credit Union cheques. In this manner, on 20 April $100,000 was deposited into her CBA account at Lindfield and $50,000 into her CBA account at Granville. On 21 April a further $100,000 was deposited into the Granville account. The Granville account had been opened in October 2009, and the Lindfield account in December of that year.

44On 20 April she opened a new CBA account at Macarthur Square, and on 28 April she transferred substantial sums from the other two accounts into that account. $126,000 was transferred from the Granville account, and separate amounts of $60,000 and $10,000 were transferred from the Lindfield account. Thereafter, up to the end of June, there were numerous transfers of funds out of that account.

45Within months the funds in these accounts had been wholly or largely exhausted. As I have said, the joint account at Bankwest was down to an insignificant amount by the end of April. Of the CBA accounts, by the end of June there was a balance of roughly $90 in the Granville account and effectively a nil balance in the Macarthur Square account. By the end of August there was an insignificant balance in the Lindfield account. 

46The depletion of these accounts was due in large part to Ms Forrest's gambling. The evidence about this was given by the gaming managers of four clubs to which she belonged and at which she gambled on poker machines: Parramatta Leagues Club, Cronulla Sutherland Leagues Club, Campbelltown Catholic Club and the Wenty Leagues Club (at Wentworthville). In each of those clubs she was regularly in attendance and became known to the gaming managers. In all of the clubs except the Wenty Leagues Club she was often observed to be playing more than one machine at a time. The gaming manager at the Cronulla Sutherland Leagues Club described her as a ""high roller."" Bank statements for the Bankwest account and the CBA accounts at Granville and Lindfield record numerous cash withdrawals at those clubs.

47In each of the clubs members could insert their membership cards into the machine when playing it, so as to earn points depending upon the amount of money played. Those points entitled them to certain benefits, such as food and drink. When the card was used a computer record of the pattern of gambling was created, setting out the date and time of each play and the amount won or lost by the player. These records relating to Ms Forrest's gambling are in evidence. For the Parramatta Leagues Club records between July 2008 and May 2010 were produced, for the Cronulla Sutherland Leagues Club records between November 2009 and October 2010, for the Campbelltown Catholic Club records for discrete periods between April 2009 and January 2011, and for the Wenty Leagues Club records between November 2009 and September 2010.

48Unsurprisingly, all these records disclosed that Ms Forrest's wins were exceeded by her losses. It is sufficient to refer to the calculation of her total losses by Mr Philip Bennett, a consultant with extensive experience in the club, hotel and gaming industries. From the club records, extending over the period from July 2008 to January 2011, her losses totalled $334,798.51. For the period from 16 March 2010 to January 2011 the total loss was $136,458.66. Of course, these clubs records are confined to figures recorded while she was using her card. If there were occasions when she played the machines without doing so, there would be no record of the amount of money involved.

49In evidence is a document from Centrelink disclosing that between January 2009 and September 2010 Ms Forrest was receiving a disability support pension, the gross payment over that period being $34,483.15. Between December 2009 and April 2010 she also received a carer's allowance, the gross total being $1,010.45. Between August and September 2010 she received a small amount as a pensioner education supplement. These payments were made into the Lindfield CBA account, and appear to be her only income during those periods. Plainly enough, the primary source of the funds she used for gambling from March 2010 was the proceeds of the sale of the Kareela home. 

12-16 April

50As I have said, in the evening of Monday, 12 April 2010, Ms Forrest and Mr Adamson checked in to the Maclin Lodge Motel at Campbelltown. At about 10.50pm on Friday, 16 April, Ms Forrest called the 000 emergency line, apparently very distressed, telling the operator that Mr Adamson was unresponsive and was not breathing. An ambulance arrived a little after 11pm, and the officers found that Mr Adamson was dead. He was lying on one of two beds in the motel room and one of the officers, Jason Patterson, observed post-mortem lividity, conveying that he had been dead for an extended period of time.

51Police arrived not long thereafter, and I shall summarise their observations shortly. Sergeant Rachel Fawcett spoke to Ms Forrest, who told her that on the Monday she and Mr Adamson had walked a considerable distance in the Sydney CBD, that on the Tuesday he was fine, but that on the Wednesday he said that he felt exhausted and lay down in the late afternoon. She said that on the Thursday she went out without waking him, and did not wake him when she returned. She then said that on the Friday she again went out and came back in the afternoon. She went to wake him, to find that he was ""stiff, cold."" She then made contact with a general practitioner, Dr Mao at Wetherill Park. She said that Mr Adamson went to that doctor because he had a heart problem.

Interview

52In the early hours of 17 April, she was interviewed at Campbelltown Police Station by Detective Senior Constable Lynch and Constable Milat, the interview being electronically recorded (exhibit 29). The interview covered a range of matters, but at this point I shall focus upon her account of the days leading up to the Friday. 

53She said that on the Tuesday Mr Adamson complained of being tired and having a sore back. They remained in the room and watched television. On the Wednesday, she said, he remained in the room while she left to put petrol into their car and to do some shopping at Macarthur Square. It will be remembered that it was on this day she opened the Credit Union of Australia account at Parramatta, a matter which she did not volunteer during the interview. In the afternoon Mr Adamson complained of pain in the back and feeling very tired, saying that he hadn't felt like that in over 50 years. He said that he wanted to lie down for a while, and he lay down on the bed in his singlet and trousers. She covered him with a blanket which she obtained from the car.

54I should note at this stage that there was evidence of Mr Adamson having exerted himself during the move out of the Kareela home on the previous weekend. Ms O'Neil, the estate agent, and Ms Mullins, one of the purchasers, saw him on the Saturday packing items of furniture and boxes of the Rainsaver device into his car. Both of them noticed that he appeared rushed and that he had cuts and scratches on both his arms, which were bleeding. Ms Mullins described him as ""frazzled"" and said that he appeared exhausted and looked unwell. Some neighbours, Mr and Mrs Cowles, had agreed to allow him to store some property temporarily in their garage. He drove to their home to deliver about 35 boxes of the Rainsaver and other items. Mr Cowles noticed him to be ""very energetic"", apparently able to move all of the goods himself. 

55In the interview Ms Forrest said that she remained in the room on the Wednesday, watching television. Mr Adamson went to sleep and began to snore really loudly, which to her was unusual. She said that on the following morning, the Thursday, she left at about 6am. Mr Adamson was still asleep and she did not disturb him. She went to Sutherland, where she had an afternoon appointment with a dentist. In the evening she dined at the Cronulla Sutherland Leagues Club and she stayed there, talking with people, until ""really late."" She did not get back to the motel until the early hours of the Friday morning. She got into bed, she said, without checking on Mr Adamson. 

56She gave the following account of her movements on the Friday. After only a few hours sleep, she again got up early and went straight out. She went to Macarthur Square to do some shopping and to go to a movie. She did not speak to Mr Adamson before she left, but left him a note saying that she had gone out. She had breakfast at Macarthur Square and, after shopping and the movie, went straight back to the motel room, arriving at about 4pm. 

57When she entered the room, she said, she noted that Mr Adamson was in the same position, still apparently asleep. She spoke to him but he did not respond. She felt his face, which was ""stone cold."" He was ""white"", his mouth was a little ajar and he wasn't breathing. She thought that he had died in his sleep. 

58She went on to say that she rang Dr Mao who, she said, was Mr Adamson's doctor. Asked why she did not ring 000 at that stage, she said that he was dead and she had always been told that an ambulance will not carry a dead body away. She wanted to have Dr Mao come over to the motel. She spoke to Dr Mao's son, who worked as her receptionist, who said that the doctor could not come to Campbelltown as she had many patients to be seen. After speaking to Dr Mao, the receptionist told her to come over to the surgery. This she did, taking with her a black briefcase of Mr Adamson which had his medication in it. 

59She said that, upon arriving at Wetherill Park, she waited a long time before Dr Mao saw her. She told the doctor what had happened, including the fact that Mr Adamson had exerted himself while moving the property over the weekend and walking in the CBD on the Monday. She said that Dr Mao refused to go back to the motel with her, saying that she should contact the police or ring 000. Asked by Detective Lynch why she wanted the doctor to go back with her, she said because she was ""his doctor"" and she felt that that was the right thing ""him being her patient, that she should go and take care of things.""

60Having failed to persuade Dr Mao to come with her, she said, she returned directly to the motel. Upon arrival, she made the 000 call. Towards the end of the interview she said that she never gave Mr Adamson medication. She denied any involvement in his death, saying that she had no idea what caused him to die. She said that he had never discussed taking his own life. 

61In the light of her account of events, it is necessary to examine her movements, particularly on the Thursday and Friday, as established by other evidence. 

Thursday

62The motel room had been booked in the name of Mr Adamson, but it is clear that it was Ms Forrest who dealt with the staff at the motel. The booking had been from 12 to 18 April. One night was to be paid for on check-in and the balance for the period (plus a key deposit) was to be paid the following day. There was no payment on the Tuesday, so on the Wednesday morning the manager of the motel, Ms Janine Taylor, rang the room and spoke to Ms Forrest. That day Ms Forrest paid $50 and she paid the balance owing, $660, on the Thursday. That payment was recorded by computer as having been made at 11.59am. The Bankwest statement records an ATM cash withdrawal at Macarthur Square a little earlier, at 11.41am.

63At this time both Mr Adamson and Ms Forrest had motor vehicles: Mr Adamson a Lexus, Ms Forrest a Toyota. When police arrived the following night the Lexus was parked outside the motel room, and it was searched. In it was found a JB Hi-Fi bag containing a receipt for the purchase of an item at its Macarthur Square shop, timed at 12.47pm on the Thursday. Also found was a copy of an application by Ms Forrest to the Campbelltown post office for redirection of her mail, with a receipt for payment of the fee on the Thursday timed at 2.09pm.

64There is evidence confirming Ms Forrest's attendance at a dentist's surgery at Sylvania at 3.30pm for about an hour. However, her assertion to the police that she left early on Thursday and went to Sutherland cannot stand with the other evidence to which I have referred.

Friday

65At about 11.30am on the Friday, Ms Taylor went to the room where Ms Forrest and Mr Adamson were staying. Staff had expressed concern about Mr Adamson because they had not seen him and had not had access to the room for housekeeping from the time they booked in. Ms Forrest said in the recorded interview that a ""do not disturb"" sign had been on the door, as I understand it, for virtually the whole time they had been there. Ms Taylor saw Ms Forrest leave the room, get into a car and drive off. She recognised her as the person who had paid money on the Wednesday or the Thursday. She appeared unclear as to whether it was on one or both of those days. I am satisfied that it was Ms Forrest that she saw. She entered the room and called out, but there was no response. She saw Mr Adamson on the bed and thought he was asleep. 

66Call charge records of the mobile phone Ms Forrest was using show that she had phone contact with Masterton Homes in the late morning and later afternoon of the Friday, consistently with the evidence of Mr Novak that he provided her with a quote for the construction of a home by phone that day. At 5.15pm she left a message at Highlands Real Estate. It is apparent that this was the message enquiring about the progress of the sale of her land, which was noted on the following day.

67Records of the Roads and Traffic Authority (as it was then known) disclose that in January 2010 Mr Adamson sold the Lexus to Ms Forrest. They also disclose that at 4.25pm on the Friday she attended the motor registry at Campbelltown to transfer the registration of the vehicle into her name. 

68Dr Mao was not Mr Adamson's treating doctor. She saw him once only, when she measured his blood pressure and conducted an eyesight test required by the RTA. His general practitioner was Dr Phillip Loxley, whose practice was at Sutherland. Ms Forrest had been a patient of Dr Mao for a long time, and for a period up to and including 2010 she had prescribed for her MS-Contin for pain. This is a matter to which I shall return. 

69According to Dr Mao, in the late morning of the Friday a call was put through to her from Ms Forrest. Ms Forrest told her that, while trying to serve breakfast to Mr Adamson, she found that he had died. She asked Dr Mao to come and see him at the motel. Dr Mao said that there was nothing that she could do for him and that Ms Forrest should ring the police.

70This evidence of a phone call in the morning was challenged, and I am not satisfied that there was a call at that time. Dr Mao may have been mistaken about that matter. Her son who worked as her receptionist, Mr Andrew Burkitt, gave evidence of receiving only one call from Ms Forrest that day, and that was in the afternoon, he thought around 3.30. He said that she sounded stressed, saying that she needed to see the doctor urgently that day and that the doctor might need to travel somewhere with her. Mr Burkitt told her that Dr Mao was very busy and it was agreed that she should come to see her at the end of the day. Reverse call charge records relating to the phone at the surgery record one call only from Ms Forrest's mobile on that day, at 4.44pm (in round figures).

71What the evidence does establish is that in the early evening - Mr Burkitt thought at about 5.30 - Ms Forrest arrived at the surgery. At some stage thereafter she spoke to Dr Mao. As the doctor recalled it, she had a conversation with her in the reception area, where she asked the doctor to go to the motel with her to see Mr Adamson. Dr Mao refused, saying that she had not finished seeing patients and advising her to contact the police. It may be that it was at this time that they had a conversation to the effect of that which the doctor attributed to a morning phone call.

72Dr Mao confirmed that Ms Forrest had with her a briefcase. They went into the consulting room and Ms Forrest wanted to show her what she said was Mr Adamson's medication in the case. She did not look at the medication, taking the view that it was a police matter and that there was nothing she could do about it. 

73Although Dr Mao could not recall it, it is apparent that she wrote out a prescription for a month's supply of Ms Forrest's MS-Contin. Records of a pharmacy at Wetherill Park, which she regularly attended, disclose that the medication was dispensed to her at 7.57 that night. Ms Marita Cooke, a registered pharmacist who worked there, explained that there had to be a fresh prescription for each occasion on which the drug was supplied.

74Thereafter, Ms Forrest returned to Campbelltown, where she went to the premises of Kennards Self Storage. She and Mr Adamson had hired a unit there on 8 April. They were issued with a key to the unit and they were supplied with a code whereby they could have 24 hour access to it. The use of the code created a computer record of entry into the building, the opening and closing of a particular unit, and departure from the building. This was known as the gate log. Some property was stored in the unit on 8 April, but they were subsequently allocated another unit of a more suitable size.

75The gate log in respect of that unit records activity generated by the code on the Friday night. The building was entered at 8.40, the unit was opened at 8.43 and closed at 9.06, and departure from the building was recorded at 9.16.

76Ms Forrest then drove to the home of her daughter, Kara at Eldersleigh. At the time Kara was in a relationship with Mr Mitchell Bleakley, who also lived there. Her recollection was that her mother arrived about 9 o'clock. However, Mr Bleakley put it at about 10 o'clock, which I consider to be more reliable. It was Kara's recollection that she arrived in the Toyota.

77Both Kara and Mr Bleakley observed Ms Forrest to be upset, Kara describing her as frantic and Mr Bleakley as distraught. She told them that Mr Adamson had died, and that she had been to see Dr Mao but had not yet reported his death. According to Mr Bleakley, they asked her if she had spoken to the police or the ambulance but she said that she had not done so as yet. She also said that she had been out shopping all day and had come back to find that he was dead. 

78Mr Bleakley drove her back to Campbelltown in his car, and Kara accompanied them. They passed Campbelltown Police Station, which is not far from the motel, but did not stop there. At Ms Forrest's request, she was not driven to the motel but dropped off at a nearby corner.

79It will be seen that Ms Forrest's account to the police in the recorded interview of her movements on the Friday was very truncated. More importantly, much of the evidence of her movements contradicts that account, particularly her assertion that she left the motel room early in the morning. 

Crime Scene

80At about 1am on the Saturday, 17 April, Senior Constable Mark Lester, a qualified crime scene officer, arrived at the motel. A number of photographs of the exterior and interior of the motel room were taken (exhibit 3). There was a front door to the unit and a sliding door at the rear, neither of which showed any sign of forced entry. It was a twin room, and Mr Adamson was lying on the bed nearest to the rear door. He was lying on top of the bedclothes, covered by a blanket. He was wearing a singlet, trousers and socks. He was cold to touch. Senior Constable Lester noticed rigor mortis in his limbs which was easily released once they were moved. He was lying on his right side and there was lividity on that side of his lower body. Senior Constable Lester noticed a slight decomposition smell. From these observations he concluded that Mr Adamson had been dead for about 24 to 48 hours. 

81There was a cabinet in the room with a television on it. Leaning against the television, supported by a jug, was a note on motel letterhead, apparently the note to which Ms Forrest referred in the police interview. It read as follows:

""Bill

Gone to movies & shops & to do all the things you wanted me to do

Will be home very late

I will try to be very quiet

Have a nice rest

Love Kerry""

82On the bedside table next to the bed where Mr Adamson was lying was a box of Phenergan tablets. Next to the box was a partly used blister pack of that medication. There was other medication in the room, including in Mr Adamson's black briefcase, which was on a table. Neither Senior Constable Lester nor other police who were at the scene located in the room any MS-Contin or any blister pack which might have contained that drug. Earlier in the night, before Senior Constable Lester arrived, two female police officers had searched an overnight bag belonging to Ms Forrest. No medication was found in it. Nor was any found in the Lexus.

Expert evidence

83A forensic pathologist, Dr Issabella Brouwer, conducted a post-mortem examination of Mr Adamson's body in the afternoon of 20 April. She concluded that he had died of morphine toxicity. A thorough external examination of the body did not reveal any needle marks, although she said that an injection would not necessarily leave a mark. Having said that, there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Mr Adamson was given to taking drugs by injection, and Mr Ainsworth did not suggest injection as a possible mechanism of his death.

84Dr Brouwer had been provided with an account of Senior Constable Lester's observations of Mr Adamson when he saw him. This indicated to her that he had been dead for at least 36 hours, that being the period after which rigor mortis usually starts. She emphasised, however, that that figure was ""in no way accurate"" because the development of rigor and of decomposition was dependant upon many variable factors, including the temperature of the environment where the body had been. She could not rule out a longer period, perhaps in excess of 48 hours. 

85I received evidence from two forensic scientists with expertise in toxicology, Dr William Allender and Professor Olav Drummer. They had been supplied with certificates of analysis of a sample of Mr Adamson's blood conducted at the Division of Analytical Laboratories at Lidcombe. These revealed a free morphine content of 3.8mg per litre and, more importantly, a total content of 11mg per litre. Both of them described this as a very high reading, well within the lethal range. They had regard to Mr Adamson's age, his weight of 64.5 kilograms, and the assumption that he had not been consuming morphine prior to the occasion in question and had not developed a tolerance to it.

86Both of them were asked to consider how that level of morphine might be achieved by the ingestion of 100mg MS-Contin tablets, the dosage prescribed for Ms Forrest. They were agreed that no precise estimate could be made. However, Dr Allender was of the view that it would have to be in excess of 5 tablets, certainly much more than 2. He described the estimate of 5 tablets as ""erring on the side of the conservative"", and would not rule out that it might have been as many as 10 tablets.

87Professor Drummer emphasised that the calculation of the dose was ""particularly difficult, if not almost impossible, with any accuracy."" He said that there was a lot of individual variability in this regard, adding that there were processes after death which could increase the concentration of morphine. An estimate would be assisted by analysis of Mr Adamson's stomach contents, but the evidence of Dr Brouwer was that no such analysis was done. He could say no more than at least one 100mg tablet would have to have been consumed. He summed up his position by saying, ""So all I can say, it is a very high concentration, represents probably a substantial dose, but I can't narrow it down to a milligram amount of a likely dose.""

88Dr Allender was firm in his opinion that it would be ""impossible"" for the reading to be achieved by the consumption of one 100mg tablet. He said that the morphine levels might be slightly higher due to decomposition of the body, but added that morphine is ""quite a stable drug."" Both experts agreed that the morphine would have been taken orally, and that it would be absorbed more quickly if the tablets had been crushed before being ingested. Professor Allender said that crushed tablets could be put into food, although he would expect there to be an obvious bitter taste. He agreed that the bitter taste might be masked in drinks, such as coffee. 

89Dr Mao had prescribed for Ms Forrest 100mg tablets of MS-Contin to be taken three times a day. Prescriptions were provided on a monthly basis. Dr Loxley gave evidence that Mr Adamson had been a patient of his since 1986, his last consultation with him being on 19 February 2010. He described some conditions for which he had treated him over the years, including a type of eczema and some problems with his eyesight. He treated the skin problem with different types of cream and also Phenergan, which is an antihistamine. He had never prescribed any morphine based medication for him. 

90The black briefcase found in the motel room was among the items seized by police. Eight months later, in December 2010, a police officer located an empty MS-Contin blister pack in a compartment in the lid of the briefcase. In February 2011, Ms Virginia Friedman, a forensic biologist, examined the blister pack for DNA, having received a buccal swab taken from Ms Forrest upon her arrest that same month. She found DNA on the blister pack of the same profile as Ms Forrest's. She said that the entire surfaces of both sides of the blister pack were swabbed. No male DNA was located, and no female DNA other than that which was consistent with Ms Forrest.

91She cautioned, however, that a large number of factors could affect whether a person leaves DNA on an item, such as the length of time that person was in contact with it and the degree of contact. Moreover, there are factors affecting whether a person is likely to leave DNA on a surface. For example, people holding an object may not leave any DNA on it if they had recently washed their hands. As she put it, ""If we don't find somebody's DNA on an item, the most likely reason is that they have not come into contact with it but obviously there are a lot of variables."" 

After the event

92In the police interview on 17 April, Ms Forrest said that she was aware that Mr Adamson had two sisters. Asked whether he had any children, she said that he did not. She was in fact aware of his step-son John, whom he had introduced to her as his son. John Adamson was out of the country on business at the time of his father's death. Before Ms Forrest and Mr Adamson moved out of the Kareela home, he had exchanged mobile numbers with Ms Forrest. He did so because his father never turned his mobile on and was difficult to contact. 

93Ms Forrest did not contact either of Mr Adamson's sisters to tell them of his death. They found out about it when police contacted Eva. However, it may be that she never had contact with either of them. Certainly, Mr Adamson's older sister, Elizabeth McCarthy, gave evidence that he had spoken of Ms Forrest on the phone but she had never met her or spoken to her.

94More importantly, Ms Forrest did not contact John to tell him of his father's death. He found out about it from another source when he returned from overseas. He telephoned her. She told him that Mr Adamson had died in his sleep. He asked why she had not contacted him, and she said that she did not have his contact details. That was not true and, in any event, he was listed in the phone book. They arranged to meet at Parramatta on 19 May. 

95At that meeting Ms Forrest told John Adamson that she thought that his father had passed away because the work he had done in the course of moving house had been too much for him. She said that she had made funeral arrangements, to which he responded that that was his responsibility as Mr Adamson's son. He asked her about the proceeds of sale of the Kareela home, and she said that that money was committed to Masterton Homes for the building of a house at Bundanoon. He proposed that the issue of the money be settled between them when the house was complete, to which she agreed.

96On 24 May 2010, Ms Forrest approached Guardian Funerals at Campbelltown to arrange for the cremation of Mr Adamson. She told the funeral director, Ms Ann Waplington, that he had no living relatives or next of kin and that, as his carer, she was the person responsible for him. However, she made it clear that she had no money to pay for the funeral, so Ms Waplington contacted a colleague, Dorothea Hasley, the manager of a related funeral home, Economy Funerals. Ms Waplington attended to the paperwork for Economy Funerals, including a statutory declaration which Ms Forrest made to the effect that she was responsible for the funeral arrangements as there was no living next of kin.

97Subsequently, Ms Hasley was informed by police that Mr John Adamson was the next of kin, and he took over the arrangements for the cremation. About 2 weeks later Ms Forrest phoned her to ask what was happening about the cremation and she told her that John Adamson had undertaken the matter. Ms Forrest said that he was not Mr Adamson's biological son, that Mr Adamson didn't like him, and that she met him after the death and he told her that he wanted nothing to do with the funeral. Clearly, that was not the case.

Telephone intercepts

98In January and February 2011, calls to and from Ms Forrest's mobile were being intercepted pursuant to a warrant. A number of those intercepted calls, together with transcripts, are in evidence: exhibit 121. For present purposes it is sufficient to refer to some salient features of them. 

99Early in January, Detective Lynch (by then a sergeant in general duties) left a number of messages on Ms Forrest's phone asking her to call him. On 12 January, Ms Forrest phoned Campbelltown Police Station to speak to him but he was not there. She spoke to an inspector at the station and complained that she was being ""harassed."" She said that she was a carer for an elderly gentleman who died while he was in her care. She later said that she cooked his meals and looked after him but did not issue his medications. She added, ""I didn't do anything. I was just with him when he died."" Later she said, ""Well, actually, I wasn't with him when he died. I don't know when he died. He was in a motel room and I was out. But when I came home he was deceased."" There is not necessarily an inconsistency here. When she said that she was ""with him"" when he died, she may have meant no more than that they had been staying together at the motel at that time.

100When the inspector suggested that Sergeant Lynch might be conducting investigations for the purpose of a coronial enquiry, she questioned why the coroner should become involved. She said that Mr Adamson had been ""buried, cremated."" She asked rhetorically, ""Why would they do that when someone's elderly?"" Apparently, she had assumed that the circumstances of Mr Adamson's death, as she believed the police understood them, would not have warranted such an enquiry.

101On 14 January, she had a conversation with her other daughter, Kischa Forrest, which conveys that she believed herself to be under suspicion for involvement in the death of Mr Adamson. She denied any involvement in his death, saying that she would never do something like that to a person who had done her no harm. She also said:

""I am just speechless. ... if I was going to frigging murder someone I would have murdered David Marshall or your father. ... And if they bring up money or anything like that, well, for God's sake I would have ... been able to keep Camden home if I did that to Marshall. ... I would have profited more.""

She made an observation to the same effect in another conversation with Kischa on 4 February. 

102The reference to David Marshall is explained in a statement of agreed facts, MFI V. Mr Marshall was the owner of a home in Mt Colah. On 11 May 1990 he signed a memorandum of transfer of the property to Ms Forrest, and it was registered shortly thereafter. On 22 October 1991, Ms Forrest sold the property for $190,000. On 30 May 1994 she and her husband, Wayne Forrest, purchased a property at Kirkham (also referred to as Camden). 

103In September 1997, Mr Marshall commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court to recover $190,000 from Ms Forrest and her husband. On 2 April 2001, those proceedings were settled on the basis that Ms Forrest and her husband would pay Mr Marshall $190,000 within 14 days. Shortly thereafter Ms Forrest and her husband sold the property at Kirkham and paid $190,000 to Mr Marshall out of the proceeds of that sale. 

104On 17 January, despite being aware than an investigation into the death of Mr Adamson was in progress, she rang an auction house in Canberra to enquire about selling a large quantity of the Rainsaver devices. At this time she was living in a unit at Moruya and in the following month, on the day of her arrest, police found 265 boxes of the product stored there.

105On 20 January, she phoned a solicitor to seek advice about the effect of the joint bank account. She explained that one of the account holders had died and enquired whether she, as the surviving account holder, was entitled to the money. She explained that the deceased had made a will in which he left the whole of his estate to his son. She appears to have been seeking a basis upon which she could claim to have been legitimately entitled to the money in the account. However, it will be remembered that she transferred most of the funds in the joint account to her own Credit Union account on Wednesday, 14 April 2010 when, on her version of events, Mr Adamson was still alive or, at least, she had no reason to believe otherwise. Of course, there could be no such justification for her earlier dissipation of the $25,000 from the deposit.

Arrest

106Ms Forrest was arrested at Moruya on the evening of 14 February 2011. The arresting officers were Detective Senior Constables Anthony Holmes, Dean McGarry and Maria Feher. She was conveyed to Batemans Bay Police Station and during the car journey the officers, mainly Detective McGarry, questioned her under caution. The questioning was recorded, and an edited disc and transcript of it were admitted as exhibit 91.

107Ms Forrest generally maintained her earlier account to police of her discovery that Mr Adamson had died and of her movements on that Friday. However, she suggested that she had asked Dr Mao to come back to the motel with her because she wasn't ""a hundred percent sure"" that he was dead. Asked why she did not call an ambulance, she said it was because ""my doctor ... told me what to do."" She confirmed that she wanted ""my doctor"" to come back ""because he was under her care."" 

108Asked whether she went straight back to the motel after seeing Dr Mao, she said that she thought so. Asked about her visit to Kara's place, she could not remember whether that was before or after she had made the 000 call. She said that she had left the motel early, between 6 and 8am. When it was put to her that motel staff saw her leave at about 11.30, she denied it.

109She repeated her account that Mr Adamson had lay down on the bed in his clothes because he was extremely exhausted. Asked whether he had sought any medication, she said that he had not but that her medication was there. She insisted that it was in the bathroom with all their bags. She said that he had been in pain and postulated that he may have taken her medication when she was not there. She added that he knew that she took MS-Contin for pain. 

110She claimed that she did contact John Adamson to tell him about his father's death because she felt sorry for him. She added that she and his father had been ""very good friends."" She maintained that she did not see John as Mr Adamson's next of kin because he was not his natural son. She also maintained that Mr Adamson did not love John like a son and that John wanted nothing to do with the funeral arrangements. She denied that John had asked her about the proceeds of the sale of the home. 

111Asked why she was withdrawing money ""from the accounts"", she said that it was because they were going to build a barn on the property at Bundanoon. She claimed that she had made enquiries about the construction of the barn at the Capital Steel company before Mr Adamson died. It was put to her that the money had gone into poker machines, which she denied. She acknowledged that she played poker machines but said that the money had gone into Mr Adamson's business.

112All her responses in that interview were false. At Batemans Bay Police Station she secured the attendance of a solicitor and, on legal advice, declined to participate in an interview. Of course, that was an exercise of her undoubted right to silence and I draw no inference against her from it. 

Verdict

113There is other evidence to which I have not referred, but the material I have summarised is sufficient to determine the matter. I am grateful to counsel on both sides for their helpful final submissions. The Crown prosecutor's submissions are lengthy and detailed but, here also, it is not necessary to deal with all the matters he has raised to arrive at my verdict.

114I am satisfied that Ms Forrest misappropriated the proceeds of the sale of the Kareela home, and planned to do so from an early stage. I accept that Mr Adamson was a knowing and willing party to a scheme to sell the home and invest the funds in the construction of a house on the land at Bundanoon. With his background in dealing with real estate and property development, he was no novice in this area and perceived the scheme to be in his financial interests. I accept that he was a willing party to the opening of the joint bank account, as he was to the early release of $25,000 from the deposit, which he also saw to be financially beneficial. 

115I also accept that he was happy to leave arrangements for the sale and the conduct of it in the hands of Ms Forrest, whom he believed to be competent in administrative matters and whom he trusted. However, I am satisfied that she was in breach of that trust.

116Her interest in his financial affairs was demonstrated late in 2009 by her demands upon his bookkeeper and his accountant for access to his financial records. This was followed by her anonymous calls to Homesafe Solutions enquiring about the operation of the equity release scheme. That is a matter about which I shall have more to say later. 

117She came to control the process of the sale of the home completely, to the extent of seeking to exclude Mr Adamson from it. This can be seen in her phone call to Ms Shepherd at Homesafe Solutions in which she expressed concern that Ms Shepherd had had direct contact with him. This is also a matter to which I shall return. It is even more apparent in her angry reaction to the visit to the home by the conveyancer, Ms Nicholson, and her conversation with Mr Adamson in her absence. I might add that, while she portrayed that as her reason for terminating Ms Nicholson's services, it is clear that she had decided to do so in any event. 

118Her betrayal of Mr Adamson's trust is clearly demonstrated in the recorded conversation he had with Ms Nicholson on 24 March. I approach that evidence with caution, bearing in mind that it is hearsay. Nevertheless, it has the advantage that there is no doubt about what he said because it was recorded, and I accept it as an accurate account of his understanding and expectations at the time. Plainly enough, he did not know that Ms Forrest had dismissed Ms Nicholson as the conveyancer. Equally, he was not aware that the $25,000 from the deposit had been in the joint account. More importantly, he was unaware that his legitimate expectation about the use of that money had not been met and that, in fact, it had been dissipated by Ms Forrest. In addition, he had been led to believe that progress had been made towards the development, in that a buyer had been found for a block of land and a deposit had been paid to the building company.

119Whether Ms Forrest had intended to use the proceeds of the sale of the home to develop the property at Bundanoon I cannot say. What I can say is that, if she did, she did not intend Mr Adamson to share the benefits of that investment with her. At the time of settlement of the sale of the home she had done little or nothing to pursue that investment. She had done no more than seek a quote from Masterton Homes and request a release of the subdivision by the council. Her claim to the police on the day of her arrest that she had made enquiries at Capital Steel about constructing the barn on the Bundanoon property before Mr Adamson died was false. She did not approach that company until 20 April, four days after his death had been reported. There appears to have been no arrangement in place for their accommodation after their sojourn at the motel.

120Put shortly, she deceived Mr Adamson about the purpose of the sale of the home and the steps taken in pursuit of it. She withdrew the funds from the sale and used them for her own benefit. She lied about the matter to John Adamson, as she did to the police.

121Mr Ainsworth did not concede that Ms Forrest had misappropriated the funds. He argued that the lack of progress towards the development of the Bundanoon property should be seen as inefficiency, and Ms Forrest's withdrawal of the funds as her taking advantage of the situation as it stood after Mr Adamson's death. As he put it, the ""doing stage"" in relation to the Bundanoon property ""didn't match the planning stage"", and after Mr Adamson's death she simply ""took the money and ran."" 

122I cannot accept those submissions. As I have noted above, her expenditure of the $25,000 from the deposit preceded the death by some time and her transfer of the sale proceeds into her Credit Union account was effected on a day when, on her case, she had no reason to believe that Mr Adamson had died. Viewed as a whole, the evidence of her behaviour points to a calculated course of dishonest conduct designed to gain for herself the proceeds of the sale of the home.

123That said, Ms Forrest stands charged with murder, not with an offence of dishonesty. The crucial question is whether there is to be found in this evidence a motive for her to kill Mr Adamson, and whether she did so. 

124There is nothing in the evidence to raise the possibility that Mr Adamson committed suicide, and Mr Ainsworth did not suggest it. His case was that Mr Adamson may have sought relief through MS-Contin for his pain and exhaustion following his exertion during the move over the weekend and that, being unaccustomed to the drug, he took a dose which was unsafe. He suggested that Mr Adamson might have taken one or two tablets, noting Professor Drummer's evidence that one 100mg tablet could have been enough to produce the high level of morphine which killed him. 

125Although police who came to the scene did not find any MS-Contin in the room or in the Lexus, or any sign of it, they missed the empty blister pack of the drug which was in the lid of Mr Adamson's briefcase. Mr Ainsworth argued that the tablet or tablets Mr Adamson took could have come from that blister pack, which he then placed in the briefcase with his other medication. That DNA consistent with that of Ms Forrest was on the blister pack was hardly surprising, given that she used the medication, and he relied upon Ms Friedman's evidence that the fact that there was no male DNA on it does not necessarily mean that Mr Adamson did not handle it.

126This course of events, he submitted, points to a reasonable explanation of the circumstances consistent with Ms Forrest's innocence. That was so, he said, even if I were satisfied that she had planned to misappropriate the proceeds of the home sale. As he put it, there is a ""fairly obvious fault line"" upon which the Crown case should be divided between evidence going to her dishonesty, on the one hand, and evidence pointing to murder, on the other. I have given these arguments careful consideration, but I am satisfied that they must be rejected. 

127It is here that Ms Forrest's phone calls to Homesafe Solutions acquire additional significance. Clearly, she was enquiring as to what her position might be if she and Mr Adamson married and he died. Equally clearly, she did not want him to know that she was making any such enquiry. In the initial calls she sought to remain anonymous, describing her enquiry as hypothetical. In the telephone conversation with Ms Shepherd she claimed that her enquiry related to her grandmother, which I am satisfied was false. I cannot say that at this early stage she had formed the intention to kill Mr Adamson, but it is significant that she had turned her mind to how she might benefit from his death. 

128From the opposite perspective, there is some significance in Ms Forrest's conversations with her daughter, in the intercepted phone calls in early 2011, harking back to the transfer of title to a home to her by Mr David Marshall and the litigation which ensued. Too much should not be read into this evidence. As Mr Ainsworth said, it establishes no more than that there had been a commercial dispute leading to litigation, which was settled. No doubt, what she said about the possible advantage of having murdered Mr Marshall (or her husband) was not meant to be taken seriously. Nevertheless, it is worthy of note that at that time she made comments suggesting that, if a person obtained a benefit in questionable circumstances, the best way to protect that benefit from future challenge would be to eliminate the benefactor.

129Ms Forrest's conduct on the Friday, 16 April, is wholly inconsistent with that of a person who has discovered that a friend and companion had died unexpectedly. As I have said, while I do not accept Dr Mao's evidence that Ms Forrest phoned her in the morning, it may be that the conversation which the doctor attributed to that time occurred in the early evening when Ms Forrest came to the surgery. If that is so, Ms Forrest told her at that time that she found Mr Adamson dead while trying to serve him breakfast. It seems unlikely that Dr Mao would be mistaken about Ms Forrest using those words, even though she might be about when the conversation occurred. If so, it was Ms Forrest's account that she realised Mr Adamson was dead some time in the morning. Yet she proceeded during the day to attend to more or less mundane tasks, making phone contact with Masterton Homes and Highlands Real Estate and attending to the transfer of registration of the Lexus, before she contacted Dr Mao to seek help. 

130However, I have sufficient misgivings about the accuracy of Dr Mao's recollection to put aside her evidence about the reference to breakfast. But even on Ms Forrest's version that she did not discover that Mr Adamson was dead until the late afternoon, serious questions remain about her proved conduct thereafter. The evidence establishes that, after going to Dr Mao's surgery and being told that the doctor could do nothing to help her, she did not return immediately to the motel to raise the alarm. She went to the pharmacy to obtain a supply of her medication, which was dispensed at 7.57pm. She attended Kennards Self Storage at 8.40pm, remaining there for almost half an hour. There is no evidence of what she was doing there. She then went to Kara's home at Eldersleigh, and, some time after 10pm, was dropped back at the motel. Finally, at about 10.50pm she rang 000 to report the death.

131Moreover, she clearly lied to the police about her movements during the interview in the early hours of the following morning, at a time when she was hardly likely to have forgotten them. The effect of what she said was that, having waited for a long time at Dr Mao's surgery and then having failed to persuade the doctor to return to the motel with her, she went straight back there herself. That was untrue. 

132Equally untrue was her account to the police that she had left the motel early on that Friday morning and did not return until the late afternoon. As I have said, I am satisfied that the manager, Ms Taylor, saw her leave the room at about 11.30am. This was a lie, as was her claim that she had also left early on the Thursday morning to go to Sutherland. The evidence establishes that she made an ATM cash withdrawal at Macarthur Square at 11.41am and paid the balance owing to the motel at 11.59am. I am satisfied that her account of leaving early on both days was a lie.

133The effect of what she told the police was that she left early on the Thursday and was out until very late and, after a few hours sleep, she left early on the Friday and was out until the late afternoon. This, I am satisfied, was a story concocted to explain why she may not have noticed that Mr Adamson was dead earlier than she claimed she did. On her own account, he had remained in the same position since he lay down on the bed on the Wednesday afternoon. 

134The effect of the evidence of the ambulance officer, the crime scene officer and the forensic pathologist who conducted the post-mortem is that it was apparent from the condition of the body that Mr Adamson had been dead for a considerable time when he was found. While taking account of Dr Brouwer's evidence of a variety of factors which complicate an estimate of a time of death, it could well be that he was dead by the Thursday morning and I have no doubt that he was by the Friday morning.

135It is inconceivable that on the Thursday or, certainly, by the Friday morning, Ms Forrest would have believed that Mr Adamson was still sleeping and not have noticed that something was amiss. One can understand that when Ms Taylor entered the room briefly on the Friday morning she may have thought he was asleep. However, Ms Forrest had the opportunity to observe him over a long period. It was to meet this very question that she gave a false account of her movements conveying that she was largely absent from the room on the Thursday and throughout the Friday and, in particular, was not there during the day.

136I inspected the motel room during the course of the trial. It had not changed in relevant respects since April 2010. There were opaque curtains across the rear sliding door. However, there was a small window above the front door, which admitted light. With the interior lights off, the doors closed and the curtains drawn, the room was dim but not dark. To my eye there was enough light to see the furniture in the room and to be able to see a person lying on one of the beds. If, as I am satisfied, Ms Forrest was in the room until well into the morning on both the Thursday and the Friday, she would have been able to see Mr Adamson and it must have been apparent that he was not merely asleep.

137I am persuaded that the scenario for which the Crown prosecutor contended is correct. Having caused Mr Adamson's death, Ms Forrest sought the assistance of Dr Mao, with whom she had had a long relationship, asking her to come to the motel in the hope that she would certify his death as being of natural causes, so that there would be no investigation into it. She panicked when Dr Mao refused to help her, and it was for this reason that she appeared to be distraught when she saw Kara and Mr Bleakley. Eventually, she saw no choice but to call 000, but even in that call she did not in terms report his death. Rather, what she conveyed was that she needed help because she had just found him unresponsive and apparently not breathing.

138I am satisfied that it was she who put the MS-Contin blister pack into Mr Adamson's briefcase. The Crown prosecutor did not advance any reason why she would have done so, or why she took the briefcase when she went to see Dr Mao. What is clear, however, is that she did handle the briefcase at that time.

139I also accept the Crown prosecutor's submission that the note apparently left for Mr Adamson was a sham. As he put it, she ""staged the room"", leaving the note to suggest that she believed that he was alive when she left on the Friday morning.

140I have referred to a number of untruths, which I am satisfied were deliberate lies, told to the police in both interviews, to a number of the civilian witnesses and, apparently, to Mr Adamson himself. The purpose of many of these lies might fairly be seen as an attempt to cover up her misappropriation of Mr Adamson's money. However, her lies to the police about her movements on the Thursday and Friday, and about Dr Mao being Mr Adamson's doctor, have a greater significance. I am satisfied that they were deliberate lies designed to cover up her involvement in the murder, that is, lies born of a consciousness of guilt of the crime charged.

141I am also satisfied that she lied when she told police in the interview of 17 April that Mr Adamson had no children. Her subsequent assertion to Ms Hasley at Guardian Funerals, and to the police after her arrest, that she did not see John Adamson as his father's next of kin because he was not his natural son is specious. What she sought to do was to arrange for his cremation without anyone in the family knowing of it, a scheme which was foiled only by the fact that John Adamson became aware of his father's death from another source. That said, this may not have been conduct directed to covering up the murder rather than, as Mr Ainsworth suggested, to ensure her retention of the misappropriated money.

142Of course, it is necessary to have regard to the combined effect of all the circumstances proved by the evidence. Having done so, I can find no reasonable explanation of them other than that Ms Forrest misappropriated Mr Adamson's money and killed him to prevent that misappropriation being exposed. She killed him by having him ingest MS-Contin. I cannot be certain how she did so, but it is most likely that she crushed tablets and mixed them with his food. The conflict in the expert evidence about how many tablets would be required to achieve the level of morphine found in him is not one which I can resolve. Nevertheless, in the light of all the circumstances, I am satisfied that she had him ingest sufficient of the drug to cause his death, intending that that would be the outcome.

143Accordingly, the elements of murder have been established in this case beyond reasonable doubt and I find the accused guilty.

		20 May 2014",2014-05-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705068,R (Cth) v Ender [2014] NSWDC 198,"Sentence


1HIS HONOUR: Marco Claudio Alexander Ender, who was born on 19 May 1973 and is now 41 years of age, is for sentence today in respect of an offence committed by him on 16 July 2013 at Mascot in the State of New South Wales when he did import a substance, the substance being a border controlled drug, namely cocaine, and the quantity imported being a marketable quantity contrary to s 307.2(1) Commonwealth Criminal Code.

2This is an offence that carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $850,000 expressed as 5,000 penalty units in the legislation. A marketable quantity of cocaine may vary between, as I understand it, 2 grams up to but not including 2 kilograms. The facts and circumstances of the matter with which I am concerned so far as the custody of the offender and the circumstances of the crime that he committed are as follows: 

3The offender was a German citizen who had lived in the Philippines, as I understand it, for approximately five or six years before he arrived in Australia on 16 July 2013. He had previously lived in Thailand for a number of years, the details of which I will cover when I deal with the subjective case. He arrived in Sydney at about 9am on Monday 16 July 2013 on a flight from Manila. He was travelling on a German passport. I hasten to say in this case, as opposed to many other cases of this type, there is nothing suspicious or particularly salient about his travel documents. When he arrived in Australia he filled in the incoming passenger card in the normal way and ticked ""no"" to question one which asked if he was bringing into Australia goods that may be prohibited or subject to restriction such as ""illicit drugs"". Then again, what else would he do? He recorded on the incoming passenger card that he was staying at the Ibis Hotel in Sydney.

4Customs officials became suspicious of him in circumstances I need not dilate upon, the facts are largely silent on that matter in any event, and eventually, after being detained by Customs officers for a few hours, the offender signed a consent for an internal search form. He was taken to the nearby St George Hospital where most people in this circumstance are taken and subjected to a CT scan of his abdomen. The CT scan result at 2.10pm showed at least initially that there were no foreign objects within his body. As a consequence of this AFP members very kindly drove him to the Ibis Hotel at Darling Harbour and he was released and they departed.

5However, at about 5.10 pm on the same day Customs officers were contacted by the medical staff at St George Hospital and advised that a re-consideration of the scan indicated there were at least 50 soft tissue density foreign bodies in the gastro-intestinal system including the stomach, the small bowel, the colon and the rectum. AFP enquiries at the Ibis Hotel revealed subsequently that in fact the offender was not registered there.

6In circumstances which are not explained in the facts, it could have been a matter of chance, it might have been a matter of AFP investigation, at 8.20am the following day the offender was seen by AFP officers in the vicinity of the Pyrmont Bridge Hotel in Murray Street Pyrmont. He was arrested, cautioned and on his person were particular items including what seems to me to be some keys associated with his then accommodation and the sum of $444.10 and some other items that are of no moment. He was taken back to the St George Hospital and he consented again to another scan of his abdomen. At 1.40pm medical staff advised the AFP that in fact there were foreign objects within his abdomen. The offender was subjected to the relevant cautions and explanation of rights under the Commonwealth Crimes Act and then at approximately 3pm whilst being guarded by AFP officers the offender made various admissions. This is a matter of some relevance in assessing the offender's contrition, for example, because at this point whilst the AFP knew that there were items in his abdomen they were not sure of the detail of that and they had not searched his hotel room.

7The facts reveal that in the conversation with an AFP agent the offender advised that he had passed some pellets in a toilet at the Star City Casino, that he was to be paid $5,000 for importing the items that were within his body, that he had a partner and a daughter who was then aged three back in the Philippines, that he was supposed to call what he described as an ""Englishman"" who would pay him in Australia and that he apparently had committed the offence because he had lost his business. He said, inter alia, ""I'd rather go to gaol than be shot in the Philippines"", and also added that he was ""worried for my daughter but what can I do .. nothing .. safer here in Australia.""

8Police ascertained from him that he was staying at the Sydney Darling Harbour Hotel in Pyrmont Bridge Road staying in Room C, hence the keys in his possession with the letter ""C"" attached to them. AFP officers conducted a search at 2.40pm of his hotel room and there they found 41 cylindrical objects in four clip seal bags which ultimately were found to contain cocaine. A mobile phone was found containing two sim cards, a back pack which contained the cylindrical objects, his passport and his boarding pass. The cylindrical objects that were found in the room were described as being 3 centimetres long and 1 centimetre in diameter and within those objects was contained the cocaine sealed, it would seem, in some type of latex material tied with a knot.

9The offender between 5.32pm and 10.14pm on 13 July 2013 whilst under AFP custody passed a further 22 foreign objects by a series of bowel movements and the material that was within the various cylindrical objects was the subject of assessment. The evidence reveals that the total weight of the white powder within the ""condoms"" was 340.1 grams, but the relevant pure weight for the purposes of assessing the offending was 92.8 grams. The white powder was found to have an average purity, as is the normal method of assessing these matters, of 26.85% of cocaine. The statement of facts states that the wholesale value of the cocaine is described as approximately $3,500 per ounce (I am not favoured with a description of how many grams there are in an ounce) which is calculated to be approximately $42,000. The purported street value of the drugs, on a calculation which does not seem to bear any relationship to the purity of this item, is said to be no more than $66,275.

10The offender obviously then was relevantly charged and has remained in custody since the date of his arrest. In accordance with the requirements of the Commonwealth Crimes Act and, of course, with the general sentencing principles in New South Wales, all time spent in custody referable to the offence will be taken into account.

11The offender was 40 years of age at the time of the offence. He has no prior convictions in the Philippines, Thailand and in Germany and he gave evidence before me and produced to the Court a report from a psychiatrist, Dr Richard Furst, dated 16 May 2013. When the offender gave evidence about his offending and his background he gave an outline of his personal history, largely in accord with what he told the psychiatrist. From what I understood of what he told me he grew up in Germany and was educated there but since either his late teens or his early twenties he has lived primarily in either Thailand or the Philippines. As a child he appeared to show aptitude in relation to computer work and the like and as an adult he has largely worked, apart from managing bars and working in the hospitality industry, developing computer programs. 

12He was married at what I understood to be quite a young age, 18 or 19 years of age, and it was in those circumstances a few years later his wife, when he was working in Germany, recommended that he have a trip away from Germany. He went to Thailand and there he remained. The marriage collapsed. He said he had a business in Germany with a partner and his partner and his former wife took over that business leaving him with no assets from that enterprise.

13He gave evidence that in Thailand he was involved in two relationships. He was required because he was not a citizen or apparently a permanent resident to do what he described as visa runs, that is, frequent trips out of Thailand primarily to Hong Kong to renew his permission to remain in Thailand with temporary visiting visas. It was in these circumstances that he said he travelled to the Philippines in about 2007 and 2008. On one of these trips he met his now partner and he eventually settled in Thailand where, as I said, he had lived for some years prior to his travel to Australia. He was also required as I would understand it to leave Thailand from time to time in order to renew his visa and in fact one of the issues raised in his evidence was the fact that he had visa problems, as I might generally describe them, which in part lured him to involve himself in this affair.

14In the Philippines he did some bar managing work, as I understand he had done in Thailand. But also he got involved in computer program development. He entered into a contract with a person I will describe as a contractor to develop what was called a 'web scraper' program. The purpose of the program, to summarise it, was to assist commercial organisations to get increased internet search exposure, particularly on the Google search engine. He was paid $7,500 as an advance to develop this program but he had an expectation that the program would earn up to $30,000 per month which he would share with his business partner, so to speak, when the program was developed.

15As I understood his evidence, in November 2012 his home where he lived with his partner and his child was burgled and personal property was stolen. It would appear not to be a case of industrial espionage. As he explained it the personal property was of great loss to him but what was of greater concern to him was the loss of the computers that had been provided by the contractor and particularly the hard drive of the computers upon which the work that he had entered into developing the program was placed. He sought to recover the computers or the hard drive of the computers but to no avail. The theft of his property left him in terrible financial circumstances. He had no savings at that point. He had no access to any form of income, any property that he had formerly held in Germany and Thailand had been taken by his former partners.

16At this point he also was in some sort of visa trouble because he had no money to renew his visa. He ended up not having any money he said for food and he lost his accommodation. He was living, as I understood the evidence, in a placed called Angeles City which is north of Manila. Angeles City was a city that had, as I understand it, developed a great deal when the Clark Air Force Base was then being run by the United States Air Force and had a very heavy American military presence. The Americans abandoned the Air Force Base in the early 1990's after a volcanic eruption of a nearby volcano. It would appear that the offender lost his accommodation there and was forced to live in what he described effectively as a slum with members of his wife's family. It was a place where there was no running water and no real infrastructure. Primarily it would be described as some sort of squatters' accommodation. His mother ultimately provided some assistance sending him €100 a fortnight. He was trying to obtain money to go back to Germany if it was possible. Certainly he was in a situation where he said he really had to beg and scrape even to feed his family.

17It was in this situation of economic vulnerability that he said that he was approached by two men who he described as Darren and Carlos who gave him a proposition to ""bring something into Australia"". He gave evidence, and I do not criticise him for this given the manner in which it was led, somewhat prevaricating as to precisely what he initially agreed to do. He said that he had understood that he was to smuggle ""something"" into Australia. I have got no doubt that he knew by the time that he had entered into the agreement that it was to smuggle drugs. He agreed to the proposition although he claimed that he then prevaricated about going through with it once Darren and/or Carlos had fixed up his visa problems and had provided him with a ticket to fly to Australia. My understanding of his evidence was that the arrangements for him to come to Australia and his final trip to Australia were made over some few days.

18He gave evidence that he gave some thought to participating in the arrangement at the Philippines end but then finding some way to travel to Germany. He said that when he expressed some doubts about whether he would go through with the scheme his family were threatened by one or other of the men that had recruited him and thus he went through with the arrangement. He was required to ingest the drugs as his self-evident from the facts that I have outlined. His claim of ingesting the drugs and then possibly changing his ticket to fly to Germany in my view had a complete air of unreality about it for a number of self-evident reasons. If he was to renege on the arrangement he had made with the drugs within his body, taking a valuable consignment of drugs to Europe instead of Australia, one might have thought that the threats that he said had already been made to him about the safety of his family would have been brought to fruition having betrayed the arrangement he had with his handlers in the Philippines.

19In my view, this part of his evidence was inconsistent with his claim of going through with the arrangement because of the threats that had been made. I have got no doubt that he may have been threatened if he indicated some reluctance, having agreed to do what was suggested, but ultimately his own evidence establishes, as was discussed in the submissions, that he had already agreed to do what he ultimately did before any threats were made and no issue of duress arises whatsoever. One might have thought of course people in the illicit drug trade who recruit people are likely to threaten people who try to pull out of it once they have exposed themselves as being involved in that trade. They themselves run risks once they bring people into their confidence and a person who expresses reluctance to carry out an agreed scheme is a person who could cause problems for those people in the venture. Be that as it may, as I said, no issue of duress arose and this was conceded in the submissions. But it is submitted on behalf of the offender, as I will note later, that he did carry through with this matter because of his desperation to overcome his financial difficulties, which I do accept.

20He gave evidence that when he arrived in Australia he was to contact, as I understand it, Carlos. He claimed that Carlos was to fly to Australia to pay him the $5,000 that he agreed would be his fee. Again, although I do not reject all of the offender's evidence, I find it very difficult to believe that Carlos, who had organised him to fly to Australia, would expose himself to the risk of arrest in Australia simply to fly over here to give him $5,000. In any event it seems to be inconsistent with the terms of the admission he made to the AFP. The offender sought to explain that Carlos was in fact the ""Englishman"". I have difficulty accepting that to be true. In any event, as it transpired, he was arrested before he had contact with anybody who could distribute the drugs. He accepted in his evidence that he had done the wrong thing. He expressed regret for his actions and I accept his expression of regret. He confirmed that he had no criminal convictions in any country.

21Since he has been in custody he has had significant health difficulties which I will summarise shortly from Dr Furst's report. He said in his evidence there was a gap in his memory as to what had happened whilst he was in custody. He apparently had been found unconscious in his cell in November and could not remember anything between November and January. At the time he was in custody he was suffering from conditions including hypertension, reflux and the consequences of alcohol dependency. He said that since he had come into custody he had recently undertaken entry into what is called the Getting SMART program and that he had undertaken one session of that. He claimed that he did not realise that he had a big problem with alcohol until his arrest in relation to this matter. Given the history that he gave Dr Furst he must have been completely blind to the reality of his lifestyle, if what he told the doctor was true. 

22In cross-examination he was asked about whether he had considered borrowing some money from friends and family to overcome his financial difficulties. He said there was nobody to assist him although he did concede, as I have earlier indicated, that his mother provided him with some sums of money. He thought that there was a risk involved but he saw it as the only available option for him at the time. 

23He agreed that he gave no thought at all to alerting authorities to what he did either in Australia or in the Philippines, although I can understand with the more stringent penalties in the Philippines he might have been reluctant to admit that he was carrying drugs within his system. 

24Dr Furst sets out the personal history of the prisoner, including the history of heavy drinking whilst living in Thailand and the Philippines and his lack of appreciation of his problem. In the review of the Justice Health records, Dr Furst reveals that the prisoner has been diagnosed with a significant hypertension as well as reflux issues. He received medication in relation to these conditions which is set out in the report and he has also been receiving medication in relation to alcohol dependence whilst in custody. As I understand it there is no suggestion that he ever sought any assistance in relation to his alcohol dependence prior to coming into custody. 

25The Justice Health records confirm that in November 2013 he suffered a psychotic episode when, as I said earlier, he had been found collapsed. He required emergency evacuation to a hospital, he was treated for conventional medical issues such as his hypertension, his reflux and his alcohol dependence and then several days later he gave indications of hallucinating consistent with some form of delirium. He continued with bizarre behaviour over the next number of weeks. His condition settled down for a period and then after late November he showed further evidence of mental disturbance until about 8 January when he was regarded as lucid by 20 February Justice Health records made by a nurse described him as ""orientated and logical."" The diagnosis of the psychiatrist suggests ""mental disorder"", as he describes it of ""alcohol dependence"", and also evidence of psychotic features between November and January 2014 ""probably organic in nature related to medication interactions."" In other words, the bizarre behaviour and his collapse and related matters are a result of the interrelation or interaction of medications to treat the conditions that he has. He continues to remain in the prison hospital system. 

26There is some debate in the report about the cause of the delirium. It could have been brought about by the ingestion of prohibited drugs but the prisoner denies that he had ingested prohibited drugs and there is no evidence to suggest that he did so. The psychiatrist concluded: ""There are no indications of a pervasive more serious mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder at the time of recent assessment or prior to his arrest from 19 July 2013."" In other words, there is no evidence of any causal relationship between any mental condition and the commission of the offence. This was not suggested in submission. Of course, his alcohol dependence may have indirectly contributed to his offending as his counsel pointed out insofar as it may have actually exacerbated his financial difficulties and it may have affected his judgment to some extent, but it is to be remembered that his involvement in this offence was not a spur of the moment involvement. The offence occurred over a relatively short period of time, but his involvement involved a number of days of contact with his handlers, travel to Australia and, of course, his excretion of the drugs that were found in his room. 

27The prisoner does not assert that he agreed to commit the offence or participate in the offence under the influence of alcohol and did not assert in his evidence that he was guided in any way by the condition created by his alcoholic dependence. The psychiatrist has made various recommendations about his treatment in custody including the need for counselling and involvement in the Getting SMART Recovery program. As for his prognosis, the prisoner if he was able to get on top of his alcohol issues had good prospects of being successfully rehabilitated particularly if he remained abstinent from drugs and alcohol in the community. Although there is no evidence of any drug dependence at the time of the commission of the offence and, in fact, the prisoner said in his evidence that whilst he experimented with drugs at a younger age he was not using drugs at the time of the commission of the offences. 

28The Crown has provided detailed written submissions which set out reasonably fairly the various matters that are required to be considered according to law. The submissions of learned counsel for the prisoner were focused around those written submissions. He said there was not much to dispute in relation to what had been put in the Crown submissions. Thus before I turn to the oral submissions that were made, because there were no written submissions filed by the prisoner, I will just deal briefly with the Crown's written submissions. Firstly, I point out I have taken into account all that has been put by the Crown. As I have said earlier, it is correct to say that the Crown has summarised the salient legal issues that needed to be taken into account. The Court is to have, of course, close regard in the matter described by the Crown as to the maximum penalty and assess the objective seriousness of the offence in the context of the range of conduct that is contemplated by the provision. The prisoner is to be sentenced in accordance with Pt 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and particularly by regard, to the terms of s 16A having regard particularly to s 16A(2) and the various matters under that subsection that are relevant to this matter. 

29I will deal with some of those matters. Firstly, the nature and circumstances of the offence I have already summarised. With regard to the issue of the guilty plea, the Crown correctly submits that the guilty plea is to be taken into account as a mitigating factor as it demonstrates a willingness to facilitate the course of justice, the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty is not a relevant discounting factor in Commonwealth sentencing. That having been said, notwithstanding what was said about the guideline judgments in Wong v R by the High Court, the practice in New South Wales of providing discounts in respect of pleas of guilty in accordance with the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton, whilst not necessarily applying to Commonwealth offences, can be considered in Commonwealth sentencing. As I will demonstrate in a moment when I refer to the decision of De La Rosa, it is common place for judges in New South Wales to provide such a discount and I do propose to provide the prisoner with a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence to recognise the plea of guilty as submitted in the terms appropriate by the Crown. It is true that the Crown case against the prisoner was completely overwhelming but that having been said a discount of 25% is appropriate particularly having regard to the fact that the prisoner pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity. In fact, as I understand the matter, he pleaded guilty in the Local Court when he was not even represented. 

30Properly the Court is to have regard to the need for specific deterrence as provided in s 16A(2) and the need for adequate punishment. The Court is also required to take into account the offender's character, antecedence and background. The Crown submits, of course, that his absence of criminal convictions is of less salience as a mitigating factor in cases of this type and it can be fairly said that that is correct. One bears in mind, of course, this prisoner, who I am prepared to assess was a courier and not a manager or organiser of this importation, was obviously attractive to those that recruited him because he had no prior criminal convictions. People who send people to this country to import drugs are not going to send people with substantial criminal histories because they obviously will attract attention. So far as his character is concerned I accept that throughout his adult life he has been industrious although he was unemployed at the time of the commission of the offence and I accept that he has in recent years been performing responsibilities in relation to his family. In that regard, the issue of the hardship to the offender's family, as the Crown correctly points out, by reason of the prisoner's presence in Australia is not an exceptional circumstance in this case. I am mindful of the fact that there is evidence that he has left behind his partner and his daughter to fend for themselves. But the prisoner, himself, has not raised any matter in his evidence that speaks of exceptional circumstances such as to give effect to the particular mitigation of which the Crown has correctly identified in its written submissions. The Crown, of course, does concede, and it is correct to do so, that the probable effect of the sentence upon the prisoner, they being left in difficult financial circumstances back in the Philippines albeit with some family support, is part of the offender's subjective features which obviously must be taken into account. 

31This brings me back to the role of the offender in the offending. In this regard, as the Crown correctly submits, in the context of determining the role of the prisoner by reference to the principles set out in the decision of Olbrich v R (1999) 199 CLR 270 (particularly at 279), the prisoner agreed for financial reward to travel from the Philippines to a country with which he had no connection, that is, Australia with the drugs inside his system. He swallowed the drugs to conceal them and actively sought to conceal them from the authorities. It is the case that the prisoner was prepared to travel to Australia and to take such steps as were necessary to enable the drugs to be delivered to whomever he was to provide the drugs. Clearly, as the Crown points out, the prisoner played a crucial role in the importation of the border controlled drug because without the steps that he took the drugs would not have been imported. He was aware of his risk of going to gaol. That would have been self-evident to him. He would have fully been aware, I would have thought having lived in Thailand for many years and been in the Philippines for some years, that the consequences for drug importation were substantial even in a country like Australia that has a more liberal approach to sentencing than might be the case in those countries. 

32In relation to his participation in the matter, as I have pointed out, by his own account there was no issue of duress. Touching upon his agreement the only issue of threats arose when he sought to withdraw from the enterprise as I have earlier pointed out. The facts of the matter are, as the Crown says, that the fact that the prisoner's role might be seen as that of a courier and categorised as such it does not of, itself, denote the need for a degree of leniency. It merely requires consideration of that role in the context of the range of conduct contemplated by the Section. The Crown is absolutely correct to say that couriers who are willing and able to undertake the role that this prisoner performed, facilitate the importation of drugs in this country. The Crown has made submissions about the significance and the weight of the drug and I will deal with that in the context of the decision of De La Rosa. The Crown in its oral submissions said, having extensively covered relevant matters in the written submissions, simply that there no issue of duress, the medical condition of the prisoner was of limited importance but otherwise relevant matters were set out in the Crown submissions. 

33The prisoner's counsel submitted that a full term of imprisonment was the only appropriate order to be made which is self-evident. He made submissions about the role of the prisoner which I accept. He submitted that in the context of the quantity of the drugs the offence was at the lower end of the spectrum which I accept although there are other matters to be taken into account which I will deal with shortly. Of course, it should be borne in mind, as I have pointed out to counsel for the accused in submission, that the quantity of the drugs that was imported was constrained by the method of importation. He noted the plea at the earliest opportunity which I have earlier indicated I accept is so. He made submissions about the absence of prior convictions and the prisoner's prior industry. He submitted that the offence was one of ""need rather than greed"". In the context of the character of the offending and the manner in which the prisoner agreed to enter into this enterprise one could not so categorise the offence in such simplistic terms. It was submitted that the Court should bear in mind the significance of alcohol in his life and the indirect relationship of it to his offending and his medical condition. The medical evidence he said was quite important and I accept that it is certainly highly relevant in a range of ways. 

34It was initially submitted that the Court would regard his medical condition as one that required less weight being placed upon general deterrence. A discussion of that matter with counsel led to the concession that, in fact, in the context of there being no causal connection between his mental condition in November to January of last year and early this year to the offending that was not so. But his current medical condition and his past medical condition were certainly relevant to the circumstances of his custody. It was submitted he had insight now into his alcohol dependence, had good prospects of rehabilitation and that a finding in relation to the non-parole period, in the context of the submissions of the Crown in respect of the non-parole period, in light of the decision of Hili v The Queen, Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45 should permit a minimum term that led to an earlier release than might otherwise be the case primarily because of his medical condition and his prospects of rehabilitation. It was conceded, as I said earlier, that the Crown submissions were of importance and of assistance to the Court. 

35The Crown provided to the Court a number of comparative cases in summary, I will not read the details of those cases, some of them were decisions of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, some were decisions at first instance in Western Australia and Victoria. I was provided copies of those judgments and I have read those judgments. I have taken them into account.

36Counsel for the accused provided me with a case with which I am familiar, as most sentencing judges should be, because of its importance: Director of Public Prosecutions for the Commonwealth v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1. That judgment, of course, was a judgment of a Full Bench of the Court of Criminal Appeal, presided over by the learned President with the Chief Judge at Common Law and other senior judges. The judgment, of course, was concerned with some constitutional and other issues relating to the operation of s68A Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 and other matters of particular legal importance. The judgment or the learned Chief Judge at Common Law, however, is most instructive in a range of ways in relation to sentencing in this matter. For a start, dealing with the issue of comparative sentencing, the learned Chief Judge's treatment of comparative cases is extremely useful. I mean no criticism of the learned Crown's assistance in this regard, but the categorisation of various types of offending under relevant legislation and the vast number of judgments that are summarised by his Honour that may be thought to be relevant in a comparable way, was of great assistance to this Court. The judgment is also instructive as setting out principles relating to the treatment of offenders with mental health problems and also in relation to general principles that relate to sentencing offenders in relation to offences of this type.

37In relation to this latter matter I particularly refer to [270] - [273] of that judgment. His Honour discusses, for example, that the nature, quantity, purity, source and value of the drugs are highly relevant to the assessment of the objective seriousness of the drug offending. He discusses the need for general deterrence as the Crown pointed out in its written submissions. The participation for financial reward may increase the objective gravity of the offending but, again, this is a matter of degree. He observed: ""However, the converse is not true, mere indebtedness does not necessarily operate to mitigate the offence."" He points out that in importation cases, the motivation of the offender at the point of initial departure may be relevant in assessing his or her culpability and that it clearly is so. He discusses, of course, the early plea of guilty stating, ""It will quite normally attract a discount of 25%"" although there is no issue in relation to that matter here. He discussed (at [177]) the issue of an offender ""suffering from mental illness, intellectual handicap or other mental problems."" He set out a number of issues that arose from a range of authorities from Engert through to R v Henry [2007] NSWCCA 90 [28]. He noted the relevance of mental health where it contributes to the commission of an offence in a material way to the assessment of moral culpability and the weight to be given to general deterrence. That does not arise here. 

38However, he pointed out, and this may be an observation that may be made in relation to general health issues as also arise here, that the mental state of an offender ""may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on that person because the sentence will be more onerous for that person, the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced."" The condition may also reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence, although that is not a major matter here. Of course, he also discusses the relevance of mental illness when it creates a danger to the community, but that does not arise here. 

39Ultimately, as I have earlier indicated in the course of submissions the medical condition of the prisoner and the psychotic episodes suffered whilst in the hospital are relevant in this matter in assessing the circumstances of his custody. I have particularly had regard to that matter in considering the fixing of the non-parole period in the contest of submissions made on that matter by the Crown and the defence particularly in light of the decision of the High Court in Hili and Jones. 

40With regard to the comparative sentencing exercise, of course, the learned Chief Judge at Common Law extensively discussed what could be called ""comparative cases"". From [207] through to [253] he not only referred to a number of cases indirectly, but summarised a number of cases. He even went to the trouble of identifying (at [224]) what he called a table of his analysis of the dozens of cases that were considered by him relating the importation of commercial quantities and traffickable and/or marketable quantities, bearing in mind the legislation had changed over the years. He broke up the imports of commercial quantities into four groups, imports of traffickable/marketable quantities into three groups. On my understanding of the facts of this matter, in the comparable cases that he summaries or adverts to, it is clear in relation to this matter that this offending falls within group 3 of cases involving an importation of a traffickable/marketable quantity of border controlled drugs. In that regard, group 3 (if I might refer to [224]) cites in general terms that the form of offending involves a quite low quantity, monetary reward or relief of debt, discount for early guilty plea, mere courier role, adverse personal circumstances. 

41I do not have to now undertake some summary of what his Honour has summarised, but I found the very extensive discussion by his Honour along with the material provided by the learned Crown Prosecutor who skilfully represented the Director very helpful in assessing the appropriate penalty in this matter.

42Ultimately, I have concluded the comparative cases point to an appropriate starting point for the sentence in this matter to be seven years imprisonment. The prisoner is entitled to a discount of 25%. That leaves the sentence to actually be imposed as five years and three months. In light of all that has been put to me and the material that I have summarised, I have determined that the non-parole period should be two years and seven months. All sentences should commence from the date the prisoner came into custody. Can you stand up thanks very much, Mr Ender? 

43In relation to the offence to which you pleaded guilty you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years and three months to commence on 17 July 2013, that sentence will expire on 16 October 2018. The non-parole period I fix as I am required to do for a sentence of that length in the context of the relevant Commonwealth legislation summarised by the Crown's written submissions is two years and seven months commencing on 17 July 2013 and expiring on 16 February 2016. You can sit down. Whether you are released on that date will be a matter for the parole authorities. I am mindful of the fact that you will be deported at the expiration of your sentence and it will be a matter for negotiation between the Parole Authority and the Department of Immigration or whatever title it will have in 2016 as to your disposal in that regard. If you are of good behaviour during the period you are in custody and undertake the courses that are required of you by the custodial authorities the likelihood is you will be released at least into immigration custody on or about 16 February 2016. It goes without saying, of course, from the remarks on sentence and the form of the order that I have made that I have certainly had regard to the particular legislative provisions relating to the imposition of sentences under Commonwealth law, clearly no other sentence other than a term of imprisonment can be imposed and as I have earlier said given the length of the ""head sentence"" the minimum term must be expressed as a non-parole period. Yes, thank you. Any technical matters, Madam Crown?

44TANDA: No, your Honour.

45HIS HONOUR: Any matters from you, Mr Leary?

46LEARY: No, your Honour.

47HIS HONOUR: Mr Ender, as I say you will be eligible for release to parole on 16 February 2016. You will be taken into immigration custody at some point, you will be deported, whether you will be deported to Germany or to the Philippines will be a matter to be determined by others not I. The law in Australia, somewhat strangely one might have thought, permits consideration of the fixing of the non-parole period issues for foreign/alien offenders but in reality the Australian authorities cannot address relevant issues.  Because once you are released you will not be subject to parole supervision, you will be deported.  But, of course, foreign nationals are not denied consideration in relevant matters that are to be taken into account for those who will remain in Australia. Yes, thank you, you are excused.

		24 November 2014",2014-05-20 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705075,R v Smith (No.2) [2014] NSWSC 769,"Judgment - Admissibility of Evidence
1The Crown seeks to lead evidence of a conversation which occurred late on the evening of 20 January 2013 between the accused and Ms Asprogiannis.  The conversation and conduct is adequately contained at paragraph 13 of the statement of Ms Asprogiannis to police dated 23 January 2013. 
2Ms Traill, counsel for the accused, objects to the evidence being admitted.  She submits in reliance upon either, or both, of s 135 and s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995, that the Court should exercise its discretion to refuse to admit the evidence.  Ms Traill submits that it would be unfair to the accused to admit the evidence of what he said on the evening of the shooting because at the time of the conversation he was significantly affected by drugs. 
3The Crown is presently presenting its evidence.  The accused has not, as yet, given evidence.  
4As the Crown case presently stands there is no evidence that between the time of the shooting at about 1.30pm and the time of this conversation at about 9.30pm or 10pm, the accused in fact took drugs.  There is some evidence from Mr George Asprogiannis of a conversation with the accused which may suggest that some hours earlier, in the course of the early afternoon, the accused was in a physical and mental state which was consistent with having taken drugs. 
5The evidence that Ms Asprogiannis is also capable of giving, in particular her observations of the accused's demeanour, may be interpreted as being consistent with his having taken drugs.  Equally, so it seems to me, it may be interpreted by the jury as simply being the consequence of the events which had occurred earlier in the course of that afternoon: in particular, that the accused had shot and killed the deceased, and had then escaped the scene and evaded the police search.  
6If it be that evidence, in due course, demonstrates that the accused was under the effects of drugs at the time he made the challenged statement, then it will be a matter for the jury to determine the extent of that affectation, and the extent of reliability of the accused's admission that is recorded by this witness. 
7I accept that the evidence has significant probative value, and I accept that like much other evidence called by a prosecution the evidence is prejudicial to the interests of the accused.  
8However, that is not the test.  I have to be satisfied that any prejudice which exists is unfair.  I do not think that there is any unfairness to the accused in the admission of this evidence.  The real question that surrounds this evidence is what is its weight.  That seems to me to be a matter for the jury and a matter which is properly to be determined having regard to all of the surrounding evidence. 
9I am not satisfied that I should exercise my discretion to exclude this evidence and accordingly I will permit it.
Order
10I make the following order:
(1)Evidence in paragraph 13 of the statement of Ms Asprogiannis dated 23 January 2013 is allowed.

2705077,R v Jones [2014] NSWSC 696,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: An application has been made by defence counsel for a verdict by direction, on the basis that there is no evidence of a number of elements of the offence of homicide in its two forms, murder and manslaughter. It was made after he had indicated that he would not be calling evidence, but nothing turns on that. 

2Defence counsel has submitted that there is no evidence that the accused did an act that caused the death of the deceased, with regard to both murder and manslaughter; and furthermore, with regard to murder, that there is no evidence that the accused did such an act with either an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm.

3He submitted that the Crown has not excluded reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence, in particular with regard to the question of causation. 

4To state the Crown case with great succinctness, it is alleged that the accused and the deceased checked into a motel room in Coffs Harbour at about 7pm on 12 December 2012. The last time that the deceased is seen alive is on some CCTV footage from a nearby shopping centre at 7.14pm on 12 December 2012. 

5It is quite true that Dr Beer, forensic pathologist, gave equivocal evidence with regard to the cause of death. It is also quite true that he could not rule out as a reasonable possibility death by overdose from methylamphetamine, in light of toxicological evidence with regard to the body of the deceased. Dr Beer has put forward a theory of cause of death founded on asphyxia, but he conceded in evidence that there are no physical signs to that effect on the body of the deceased. He also accepted that it is by no means a firmly established theory. 

6I respectfully accept that Dr Beer's evidence is not of great force. And if that were the only evidence in the Crown case, the application would have its attractions. However, to my mind Dr Beer's evidence is by no means the only inculpatory evidence. 

7Other noteworthy, undisputed evidence in the Crown case is as follows. 

8First, one is entitled to infer that some time after 7.14pm on 12 December 2012 and before the afternoon of 15 December 2012 the deceased suffered a bashing to her face, including a broken nose. 

9Secondly, a post mortem examination revealed a number of injuries to the rest of her body, although it is true that the date of infliction is indeterminate. 

10Thirdly, at post mortem a fresh chemical burn to the abdomen of the deceased was seen.

11Fourthly, the accused engaged in many acts capable of demonstrating a consciousness of guilt. They include permitting, at various stages, no-one to see into the room; taking convoluted steps to hide the body of the deceased; divesting himself of a number of items at Brelsford Park, Coffs Harbour, including belongings of the deceased; seeking to falsely implicate a taxi driver, Mr Allen; making at least one phone call at the relevant time offering to pay handsomely to be taken away from Coffs Harbour; and telling a seeming lie about men with shotguns bashing him and the deceased.

12Fifthly, during a call on 5 December 2012 (a time when it seems the accused and the deceased were together) made to the deceased by her sister, a male person was heard yelling angrily at the deceased, although I accept that this evidence is of less probative value. 

13Sixthly, when the body of the deceased was located it was found to be ""hogtied"" tightly, whereby if the legs were moved her arms were pressured. In the opinion of Dr Beer that restraint was imposed close to death or after death. 

14Seventhly, a ligature was found around the neck of the deceased that was not attached to the other ligatures on her body. 

15Eighthly, nine out of 10 of the false fingernails of the deceased had seemingly been removed or dislodged by the time her body was located. Furthermore, the room in question was in a very dishevelled state, suggestive of a struggle. 

16Ninthly, to my mind there is an abundance of evidence that during the relevant time the accused was abusing the prohibited drug methylamphetamine. There is evidence from Senior Constable Cook and Dr Beer that that drug can readily cause aggression; in the opinion of Dr Beer, extreme aggression. 

17Tenthly, on the morning of 13 December 2012 the proprietor of the motel, Mr Shaw, saw two bloodspots on the wall near the light switch of room 7 at a time when the accused would not fully open the door to that room. One spot contained the blood of the accused, but the other was a mixture of DNA from the accused and the deceased. 

18It is well established that a verdict by direction should only be granted when there is simply no evidence of an essential element of the offence charged: May v O'Sullivan [1955] HCA 38; 92 CLR 654; Doney v R [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207. Furthermore, in a circumstantial case like this one, it is not a matter of the Crown needing to rule out alternative rational hypotheses consistent with innocence at this stage: see, for example, R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39.

19As I have said, if the Crown case consisted of nothing more than the presence of the accused and the deceased in the motel room, along with the evidence of Dr Beer, that to my mind would be a different matter. However, I consider that the circumstantial Crown case that the accused has inflicted fatal violence on the deceased is strong. Nor do I accept that there is no evidence that he has done so with one of the necessary mental elements for murder.

20Accordingly the application for a verdict by direction with regard to both forms of homicide is refused.

		29 May 2014",2014-05-20 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705084,Thomson v R [2014] NSWCCA 88,"Judgment
1GLEESON JA:  Murray Graham Thomson (the applicant) applies for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on him by his Honour Judge Arnott in the District Court on 23 May 2013.
2The applicant had pleaded guilty to two offences of dishonestly causing a loss to the Commonwealth, namely that:
(1)between about 26 June 2006 and about 26 February 2009, the applicant did obtain payment of a Newstart Allowance without disclosing that he was already receiving a disability support pension, contrary to s 135.1(5) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) (count 1); and
(2)between about 27 February 2009 and about 7 May 2010, the applicant did obtain a disability support pension without disclosing that he was already receiving a disability support pension, contrary to s 135.1(5) of the Criminal Code (count 2).
3The maximum penalty prescribed for each offence is imprisonment for 5 years and/or a fine of $33,000.
4The individual sentences imposed on the applicant were: in respect of count 2 - a fixed term of 9 months imprisonment to commence from 23 May 2013; and in respect of count 1 - a term of 2 years imprisonment to commence from 23 November 2013, with the applicant to be released pursuant to a recognisance release order on 22 July 2014 subject to giving security in the sum of $1,000 without surety.  
5Thus the sentences were partly accumulated for a total term of 2 years and 6 months, with the applicant required to serve a period in custody of 14 months, to be released on 22 July 2014 on a recognisance order to be of good behaviour for 16 months from that date.
Ground of appeal
6The sole ground of appeal is that the applicant was denied procedural fairness because, it is asserted, the sentencing judge failed to warn the applicant's legal representative that: (a) he intended to impose a total sentence in excess of the sentence indicated during the course of the sentencing proceedings; and (b) he intended to impose a full-time custodial sentence.
7The applicant's appeal against sentence requires the leave of the Court: s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  The respondent does not oppose the grant of leave.  
Circumstances of the offence
8The sentencing judge proceeded on the basis of a statement of agreed facts.  In summary, the uncontested facts were as follows.
9The applicant was receiving disability support pension payments from 21 September 2001 in the name of Murray Graham Thomson, which were paid into a Commonwealth Bank of Australia account in that name. The applicant's claim had been lodged with, and approved by, the Auburn office of Centrelink.
Count 1 - 2006 claim
10On 26 June 2006 the applicant lodged a claim for Newstart Allowance in the name of Graham John Murray at the Burwood office of Centrelink.  The applicant completed and signed a Customer Declaration Form for Newstart Allowance in which he falsely stated that he had not been, or was not, known by any other names and that he had no other income.  The claim was accepted and, from 26 June 2006, the applicant received continuous Newstart Allowance payments, which were paid into a Bendigo Bank Limited account in the name of Graham John Murray.
2007 claim
11On 12 June 2007 the applicant lodged a claim for a disability support pension in the name of Graham John Murray at the Burwood office of Centrelink.  This was declined on the basis that he did not meet the medical eligibility criteria.  He nevertheless continued to receive Newstart Allowance payments in that name.
Count 2 - 2009 claim
12On 25 February 2009 the applicant lodged a further claim for a disability support pension or sickness allowance in the name of Graham John Murray at the Burwood office of Centrelink.  In this claim form the applicant falsely stated that he had not been, or was not, known by any other names.  The applicant also did not disclose that he was then in receipt of disability support pension payments in the name of Murray Graham Thomson.
13The claim for disability support pension in the name of Graham John Murray was granted and, from 27 February 2009 until 7 May 2010, the applicant received continuous disability support pension payments, which were paid into the Bendigo Bank Limited account in that name.  The applicant did not receive any further Newstart Allowance payments in the name of Graham John Murray from 26 February 2009. 
14In January 2010 the applicant attended the Burwood office of Centrelink and participated in a review of his entitlements in the name of Graham John Murray.  During that review the applicant was required to complete a form titled ""Income and Assets"".  The only information provided by the applicant was the details of the Bendigo Bank account into which the disability support pension (and previous Newstart Allowance) payments in the name of Graham John Murray were paid.
15In March 2010 the applicant attended the Auburn office of Centrelink and participated in a review of his entitlements in the name of Murray Graham Thomson.  During that review the applicant was required to complete a form titled ""Income and Assets Update"".  The applicant answered ""no"" to a question in the form, ""Do you receive any payments from other sources you have not already advised us about on this form?"".
16Surveillance of the applicant following the reviews conducted in January and March 2010 led to the execution of a search warrant on 14 May 2010 by the Australian Federal Police at the applicant's home at Auburn, at which the applicant was present.  Various documents in the names of Murray Graham Thomson and Graham John Murray were located during this search.  One such document, entitled ""Instrument Evidencing Change of Name"" dated 13 January 1992, recorded that the applicant had changed his name by Deed Poll from Murray Graham Thomson to Graham John Murray.  (The applicant had not notified Centrelink that he had changed his name by Deed Poll.)  
17The applicant declined to participate in a record of interview.
18Between 26 June 2006 and 25 February 2009, the applicant had received $32,995.20, by way of Newstart Allowance payments in the name of Graham John Murray, to which he was not entitled.  Between 27 February 2009 and 7 May 2010, the applicant had received $21,776.47, by way of disability support pension payments in the name of Graham John Murray, to which he was not entitled.
19As at 7 March 2013 the applicant had repaid $5,824.90 by way of withholdings from his disability support pension in the name of Murray Graham Thomson.
The proceedings on sentence
20The applicant was charged with the two offences on about 22 June 2012.  After service of the prosecution brief he pleaded guilty in the Local Court on 25 September 2012 and was committed for sentence to the District Court.  
8 March 2013 - Sentencing hearing commences
21On 8 March 2013 the hearing on sentence commenced before Arnott DCJ.  A pre-sentence report assessed the applicant as unsuitable for a community service order due to a previous conviction in 1992 for two counts of indecent assault.  
22The Crown's written submissions contended that the only appropriate sentence was a custodial sentence.  Reference was made to the need for general deterrence and statements in this Court that frauds against the Social Security system should result in a custodial sentence being imposed unless there existed ""very special circumstances"" justifying some lesser sentence: see, for example, R v Purdon (NSWCCA 27 March 1997, unreported, BC9700950 at 7 per Hunt CJ at CL (McInerney J and Donovan AJ agreeing)).  
23The Crown submitted that the two offences related to the same continuing conduct and that any sentence imposed should be accumulated.  
24The Crown's submissions included a schedule of comparative decisions which it said may provide some guidance as to the general range of sentences imposed in cases of social security fraud similar to this one.  
25The applicant's written submissions conceded that a sentence of imprisonment was appropriate in the circumstances, so long as the Court was satisfied that no other alternative to full-time imprisonment was appropriate before imposing such a sentence: s 17A(1) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).
26The applicant's case on sentence was that ""special circumstances"" existed that would justify the imposition of an alternative to full-time custody under State sentencing provisions, such as an intensive correction order (ICO).  (This was available to Commonwealth offenders by virtue of s 20AB of the Crimes Act: see R v Winchester (1992) 58 A Crim R 345 at 348.)  Alternatively, it was submitted that ""the Court would find special circumstances or reasons to vary the usual ratio or to fix the non-parole period at the lowest end of the ordinary range (being 60%)"" (AB 99).  
27The features of the applicant's case which were said to justify special circumstances included: the early guilty plea; the delay in the commencement of the proceedings against him; the applicant's asserted prospects for rehabilitation as assessed by the psychologist, Mr Borenstein; and the fact of the applicant's pathological gambling addiction at the time of the offences (said to amount to ""illness or disability on the part of the offender"") (AB 99).
28At the commencement of the sentencing hearing the applicant's solicitor stated that he would be asking for an ICO or home detention (AB 6, lines 19-20).  The applicant's solicitor drew attention to the concession in the Crown's written submissions that each offence was part of one course of criminal conduct for the purpose of totality of the sentence (AB 6, lines 39-45).  
29The applicant gave evidence and was cross-examined.  The solicitor appearing for the Crown made oral submissions.  
30The Crown repeated its written submission that a custodial sentence was the appropriate sentence.  In response to a question by his Honour, the Crown submitted that R v Ivanovic (Ivanovic) [2009] NSWCCA 28 was the closest of the comparative cases.  
31In Ivanovic the overpayment of Centrelink benefits amounted to approximately $50,000 over 4 years and 7 months.  Mr Ivanovic was aged 62 at the time of sentence, had a prior criminal record, and had pleaded guilty to three offences of dishonestly causing a loss to the Commonwealth contrary to s 135.1(5) of the Criminal Code and four offences of imposing on the Commonwealth by an unfair representation contrary to s 29B of the Crimes Act.  He was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment on each of the s 29B Crimes Act offences and 2 years imprisonment for the Criminal Code offences.  It seems from the reasons of this Court (at [2]) that although the sentencing judge may have intended to accumulate the sentences (because the starting date of the sentence for the Criminal Code offences was deferred by 9 months), in fact the sentences were made concurrent as the total effective term was 2 years with the offender to be released after 12 months upon entering a recognisance to be of good behaviour for the remaining 12 months.  This Court dismissed an appeal against sentence.  
32The Crown submitted that there were ""no very special circumstances in this particular case to render the sentence less than the comparatives"" (AB 19, lines 33-35).
33The applicant's solicitor then made oral submissions.  He conceded that the case of Ivanovic was ""very similar to the current amount"" (AB 20, lines 2-3).  He submitted however that it was a more serious case.  
34Consistently with the applicant's written submissions, the applicant's solicitor submitted that the sentencing judge should find special circumstances and increase the parole period so that the applicant could be rehabilitated.  He also asked his Honour to consider an ICO (AB 21, lines 24-29).
35The transcript then records (AB 21, line 32-22, line 38) an exchange between the sentencing judge and the parties as follows:
""HIS HONOUR: You say that the case of Ivanovic is a more serious case?
SINGH: Yes, your Honour. It involved more charges. It involved the fact that that person was not employed at the time. In my submission this is not a matter where Mr Thomson has committed this offence out of agreed [sic]. It is a matter that was motivated by need.
HIS HONOUR: The penalty in Ivanovic was two years imprisonment, is that right?
SINGH: Yes, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: What is the legislation say with respect to ICOs?
SINGH: The overall sentence must be two years or less in order for him to be eligible for an ICO.
HIS HONOUR: I have got to come to that decision first? SINGH: Yes, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: But it would seem, on a cursory look at this, that it would appear to be a term of imprisonment, if a term of imprisonment was imposed of two years or less. Therefore if I were to order an ICO report now and came to the view that this case, looking at all the facts, warranted, nonetheless, a full-time term of imprisonment, I would not be in error in ordering an ICO now? 
KHOURI: Your Honour is in a position to order the report now - -
HIS HONOUR: But I can change my mind?
KHOURI: Yes, even if he is found to be suitable for an ICO, your Honour can change your mind.
SINGH: Yes, I believe that is correct.
HIS HONOUR: I am inclined to order an ICO assessment.
KHOURI: Could I hand to your Honour the legislation?
HIS HONOUR: Yes, please, (Document handed to his Honour).
KHOURI: The relevant section is section 67, your Honour; your Honour can decline to make an ICO, even if he is suitable.
HIS HONOUR: Yes, as I say, sub-section 3 says, (Read). I am inclined to -and I am thinking out aloud here - to order an ICO assessment and to place the matter back before me in two weeks time for sentence. All the range of sentencing options are still available to me in two weeks time, but at that stage I will have the benefit of an ICO assessment.
KHOURI: In a way it is similar to a PSR.
HIS HONOUR: Is two weeks enough time for an assessment to take place?
SINGH: I think it requires about six weeks, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: I think I will put it back before me in two months time. ..."".
36The sentencing judge proceeded to convict the applicant and made an order referring him to the Commissioner of Corrective Services for assessment for suitability and eligibility for an ICO.  The proceedings were adjourned to 10 May 2013 for further hearing.
10 May 2013 - Sentencing hearing adjourned for judgment
37On 10 May 2013 the sentencing judge confirmed with the parties that the ICO Assessment Report (ICO report) had been provided to them.  The ICO report assessed the applicant to be suitable for an ICO, with gambling noted as a factor associated with the offending that would be targeted in the event that an ICO was made.  
38The sentencing judge informed the parties that he had not had a chance to absorb the ICO report and accordingly proposed to adjourn the proceedings to 23 May 2013 so that he could consider the matter more carefully.  His Honour indicated that he would give his judgment on that date.  Neither party opposed that course or sought to make any submissions in respect of the ICO report or further submissions on sentence generally.
23 May 2013 - Judgment on sentence
39On 23 May 2013 his Honour stood the matter down the list for judgment at 11.30am.  When the matter was called on at that time, the applicant's solicitor drew his Honour's attention to an inaccuracy in the ICO report.  This related to the circumstances in which the applicant had changed his name by Deed Poll.  The applicant's solicitor did not seek to make any further submissions on sentence.  The sentencing judge proceeded to deliver his remarks on sentence.  
40His Honour found that the offending was objectively serious - it was planned, deliberate, and deceitful, extended over a significant period of time, and the amount involved for each offence and collectively was significant (AB 34).  His Honour considered that the offences formed part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of the same or similar character, causing a loss to Centrelink of $32,995.20 for the first offence and $21,776.47 for the second offence.  
41His Honour gave minimal weight to the need for the sentence to deter the applicant from further offending.  He observed that the more significant consideration was that the sentence was sufficiently punitive in keeping with the overall weight of authority to similar effect in relation to social security fraud offences.  Reference was made to the statement of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Purdon that a custodial sentence should be imposed in cases such as the present unless there existed ""very special circumstances"" justifying a lesser sentence.
42His Honour considered the risk of re-offending as low and the prospects of rehabilitation as reasonable, as well as cautiously accepting Mr Borenstein's view that the applicant's prospects of not returning to pathological gambling were good.  His Honour allowed the full weight of discount customarily allowed for an early guilty plea.  His Honour took into account the applicant's age and medical conditions as part of his subjective case, but did not consider that these matters would otherwise mitigate the appropriate sentence.  He also took into account the delay of almost three years from the time of execution of the search warrant as justifying a degree of leniency to be taken into account.
43Relevantly to the ground of appeal his Honour stated:
""Whilst there is not [sic] statutory relationship between the head sentence and non-parole period in Commonwealth matters as there is with State matters, Mr Singh submitted that the non-parole period should be reduced below the usual range of non-parole periods fixed for Commonwealth offences.
The Crown submitted that there are no very special reasons not to impose a custodial sentence. The money he obtained was not spent on necessities but gambled. I agree with the Crown's submission that his age and the evidence about his health do not constitute special reasons. The Crown is also correct to highlight the fact that the money was not spent on necessities.
Mr Singh conceded a sentence of imprisonment was appropriate. However, his central submission related to the way in which this should be served.
When this matter was last before me during the hearing of this sentencing matter, at first blush it seemed to me that an appropriate sentence would be one of two years or less and, accordingly, an ICO report was ordered. However, having considered the matter, I consider no other sentence other than one of imprisonment is required and one of full-time imprisonment. This is after having given earnest consideration to this matter, including s 17A of the Crimes Act 1914 which provides that Courts should not pass a sentence of imprisonment in respect of a federal offence unless the Court, having considered all other available sentences, is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in the circumstances. I consider, as I say, having earnestly considered the matter, that the combination of his age, his current medical conditions and his fear of losing his Housing Commission home do not amount to very special circumstances to enable me to impose any lesser sentence than the one that I propose."" (AB 39-40.)
Intensive corrections orders
44Sections 67 and 69 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) relevantly provide:
""67   Suitability of offender for intensive correction order(1)  An intensive correction order may not be made with respect to an offender's sentence of imprisonment unless the court is satisfied:
(a)  that the offender is of or above the age of 18 years, and
(b)  that the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of intensive correction in the community, and
(c)  that it is appropriate in all of the circumstances that the sentence be served by way of intensive correction in the community, and
(d)  that the offender has signed an undertaking to comply with the offender's obligations under the intensive correction order.
(2)  In deciding whether or not to make an intensive correction order, the court is to have regard to:
(a)  the contents of the assessment report on the offender (prepared under section 70), and
(b)  such evidence from the Commissioner of Corrective Services as the court considers necessary for the purpose of deciding whether to make such an order.
(3)  A court may, for any reason it considers sufficient, decline to make an intensive correction order despite the contents of the assessment report.
(4)  A court may make an intensive correction order with respect to an offender's sentence of imprisonment only if the assessment report states that, in the opinion of the person making the assessment, the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of intensive correction in the community.
(5)  If a court declines to make an intensive correction order with respect to an offender's sentence of imprisonment despite an assessment report that states that the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of intensive correction in the community, the court must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, its reasons for doing so.
(6)  A sentence of imprisonment is not invalidated by a failure to comply with subsection (5).
69   Referral of offender for assessment(1)  Before imposing a sentence of imprisonment on an offender, the court may refer the offender for assessment as to the suitability of the offender for intensive correction in the community.
(2)  A court is not to refer an offender for such an assessment unless satisfied, having considered all the alternatives, that no sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate and that the sentence is likely to be for a period of no more than 2 years.""
Submissions
45The applicant submitted that because his Honour had ordered an ICO report, the applicant would have had an expectation that the sentence his Honour was to impose would be 2 years or less and that it would be imposed by way of an ICO.  It was argued that because his Honour did not grant the applicant an opportunity to make further submissions to the contrary after receipt of the ICO report that there was a denial of procedural fairness when his Honour fixed a term of imprisonment in excess of 2 years, and this amounted to jurisdictional error: see Parker v DPP (1992) 28 NSWLR 282 at 289E-F (Kirby P).  
46The applicant also submitted that he was denied the opportunity to make additional submissions relating to the nature of an ICO and whether there needed to be found ""very special circumstances"" for such an order to be made.  
47The applicant further submitted that there had been practical injustice in that the aggregate sentence was at least 6 months longer than that initially indicated by his Honour.  The applicant relied on Weir v R [2011] NSWCCA 123 (Weir) at [64]-[67]; R v Button [2010] NSWCCA 264 (Button) at [14]-[18] and Ng v R [2011] NSWCCA 227 (Ng) at [41], [42], [44] and [55].
48In oral argument, the focus of the applicant's complaint was that his Honour sentenced the applicant to a term in excess of 2 years without giving any indication that he proposed to accumulate the sentences, nor providing the applicant with any opportunity to address this issue.  The applicant submitted that the Court was required, but failed, to afford the applicant a ""further hearing"" after receipt of the ICO report: R v Glynatsis [2013] NSWCCA 131 at [56] Hoeben CJ at CL (Rothman and McCallum JJ agreeing).  
49The Crown submitted that the comment of his Honour during the sentencing hearing on 8 March 2013 was no more than an expression of the required satisfaction (that the sentence of imprisonment was ""likely"" to be no more than 2 years) which enlivened the jurisdiction to refer the applicant for an ICO assessment.  It was argued that this was a preliminary view only, which did not bind his Honour to imposing a sentence of less than 2 years or to make an ICO.  
50It was further submitted that there was no denial of procedural fairness as the applicant was on notice of the Crown's written submissions that ""very special circumstances"" did not exist to justify a lesser sentence than a custodial sentence and that the sentences should be accumulated.  It was said that the applicant had an opportunity to address these issues on 8 March 2013.
Disposition
51The relevant principles to be applied when a complaint is made of a denial of procedural fairness to the offender during the sentencing hearing are summarised by Garling J (Macfarlan JA and Johnson J agreeing) in Weir at [64]-[67].  See also Ng at [43] (Bathurst CJ, James and Johnson JJ).  
52In summary, an offender is entitled to procedural fairness during criminal proceedings, including on sentence.  The content of the requirement of fairness may be affected by what is said and done during the proceedings such as where the sentencing judge has indicated the sentence he or she proposed to impose.  The focus is upon the consequence of any departure from proper procedure because what is ultimately in issue is whether unfairness has resulted from the process, not whether an expectation has been disappointed: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam (Lam) [2003] HCA 6; 214 CLR 1 at [34] (Gleeson CJ).  The concern of the law is to avoid practical, and not merely theoretical, injustice: Lam at [37].  
53It is accepted that one common basis for demonstrating that practical injustice and unfairness has occurred is where an individual has lost the opportunity to make submissions to the decision-maker in opposition to a proposed course and in support of a different course which he or she urges:  Weir at [67]. 
54The authorities relied upon by the applicant are distinguishable from the circumstances of the present case.  In Weir, after the sentencing judge had indicated that he was ""highly likely"" to impose a sentence of the order foreshadowed, the offender's representative did not make any further submissions on sentence.  When the sentencing judge delivered a sentence which was significantly longer, that sentence was set aside by this Court on the basis of a denial of procedural fairness.  In Button, the sentencing judge had commented during the course of the hearing that, given the applicant's status as a first time offender and his strong prospects of rehabilitation, the ""release after one year in jail and perhaps 18 months or 2 years on parole"" would be appropriate (at [9]).  However the sentencing judge later imposed a significantly longer sentence, with an aggregate non-parole period of 18 months.  This Court found that there had been a denial of procedural fairness.  
55In Ng, the sentencing judge had expressed a view as to the starting  point of 30 years as a ceiling for an offence of murder, being the sentence which had been imposed with respect to a co-offender.  This view was expressed as being subject to any submissions from the Crown.  The Crown submitted that the sentence should be the same as that imposed upon the co-offender.  The sentencing judge later imposed a term of imprisonment of 35 years.  This Court found that there had been practical injustice, and substantial unfairness, to the applicant in at least two respects.  One such respect was that the applicant received a longer sentence of imprisonment on the murder count than that which had been identified clearly by the sentencing judge in the course of submissions, without any indication from his Honour that his view had altered in this respect, nor any opportunity for the parties to make further submissions on the issue.
Denial of procedural fairness not established
56In the present case, the context in which the sentencing judge expressed a preliminary view on 8 March 2013 is most significant.  It occurred during an exchange between the judge and the parties about the availability of, and procedural aspects relating to, the making of an ICO.  In that regard, a preliminary determination as to whether a sentence of imprisonment is ""likely"" to be for a period of no more than 2 years, so as to warrant a referral of the offender for assessment as to his or her suitability for intensive correction in the community, was required to be made pursuant to s 69(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act: R v Glynatsis at [56].  
57Viewed in context the comment by the sentencing judge was clearly preliminary and tentative only.  The tentative nature of his Honour's view was emphasised by his later comment that ""all the range of sentencing options are still available to me in two weeks time, but at that stage I will have the benefit of an ICO assessment"" (AB 22, lines 28-30).  His Honour made clear to the parties that he was leaving open all sentencing options.  Undoubtedly this included a custodial sentence and the possibility for a total sentence longer than 2 years.
58In my view there is no substance in the applicant's complaint that he was denied procedural fairness.  First, for the reasons given above, the view expressed by his Honour (for the purpose of the preliminary determination required before referral for an ICO assessment) did not amount to an indication of a particular sentence to be imposed.  
59Secondly, contrary to the applicant's submissions, the manner in which the matter proceeded on 10 May 2013, when listed for a further hearing, could not have led to an indication and an expectation that the applicant would be sentenced to serve imprisonment by way of an ICO for not more than 2 years.  His Honour made clear to the parties on that occasion that he had not had an opportunity to absorb the ICO report and that he would defer giving judgment until 23 May 2013.  As noted above, the applicant did not oppose this course or seek to make any submissions in respect of the ICO report or any further submissions on sentence.  
60Thirdly, it cannot be said that his Honour failed to afford the applicant a ""further hearing"" after receipt of the ICO report, in circumstances where the applicant's solicitor did not seek to advance any further submissions on sentence on 10 May 2013.
61Fourthly, the applicant's solicitor was on notice of the Crown's written submissions on the topic of accumulation.  It was implicit in the oral submission of the applicant's solicitor on totality on 8 March 2013 that he was contending that the sentences should be concurrent.  His Honour was not obliged to signal to the parties in advance of his decision whether he accepted the Crown's submission on accumulation or the implicit submission of the applicant's solicitor.
62Fifthly, no attempt has been made to show that the applicant or his legal representative held any subjective expectation in consequence of which he did, or omitted to do, anything by way of submissions made to the sentencing judge either on 8 March 2013, or 10 or 23 May 2013.  Nor has it been shown that he lost an opportunity to put any information or argument to the sentencing judge: Lam at [36].  
63Finally, the applicant was not denied an opportunity to make submissions on whether there needed to be ""very special circumstances"" before an ICO could be made.  The applicant's solicitor was on notice of the Crown's written and oral submissions on 8 March 2013 that a custodial sentence should be imposed for offences such as the present, except in ""very special circumstances"".  The applicant's solicitor sought to meet the Crown's submission by submitting that ""special circumstances"" existed which justified an ICO (which is a form of imprisonment), or alternatively that the parole period be increased.  There was no practical injustice or unfairness to the applicant.
Conclusion
64The applicant has not made out a case that he was denied procedural fairness on the sentencing hearing.  I propose the following orders:
(1)Grant leave to appeal.
(2)Appeal dismissed.
65R A HULME J:  I agree with Gleeson JA.
66CAMPBELL J:  I agree with Gleeson JA and the orders his Honour proposes.

2705086,Wootton v R [2014] NSWCCA 86,"Judgment

1GLEESON JA: I agree with Campbell J.

2RA HULME J: I agree with Campbell J.

3CAMPBELL J: The applicant was sentenced in the District Court on 31st January 2013 to a term of imprisonment of 10 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 7 years for the offence of specially aggravated breaking and entering a dwelling and committing a serious indictable offence, contrary to s 112(3) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The serious indictable offence was robbery, and the circumstance of special aggravation was being armed with a .22 pump-action long rifle. The applicant indicated he would plead guilty in the days leading up to his trial.

4The offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 7. 

Summary of the Facts

5The applicant was one of three co-offenders who committed what is commonly referred to as a ""home invasion"" on the evening of 22nd August 2010 at the victim's residence in Katoomba. The men were armed with firearms and concealed their identity with either masks or full-face motorcycle helmets. The applicant was wearing a motorcycle helmet and actually carrying the .22 rifle.

6The victim was home with his partner and their two-month old baby when the applicant and his accomplices knocked loudly on the front door at around 8:45 pm. One of them called out ""Katoomba Police"". The victim opened the door but immediately slammed it shut when he saw the armed, disguised men. He locked it before retreating into the house. One of the three then fired a shotgun through the door. A number of the pellets struck the victim on his left arm, back and neck.

7The offenders kicked in the door and entered the house demanding money and drugs. The victim denied he had any and the accomplices fired shots into the roof, wall and curtains, presumably to intimidate him. In response the victim handed over his wallet containing $1,500. 

8The men then demanded to be shown the victim's safe, escorting him to the bedroom where one of them struck him on the back of the head with the butt of a gun, knocking him to the ground.

9The victim managed to escape, running to a neighbour's house. A shot was fired as the men pursued him. These events occurred in the presence of the partner and the baby, who were in the loungeroom. Before chasing the victim the applicant warned the partner to ""stay there"". 

10The offenders then absconded in the applicant's car. In the days following the applicant fled to Victoria.

11Police investigations located the helmet worn by the applicant, the gun carried by him, and ammunition at the applicant's home. The applicant was arrested in Victoria and extradited. Whilst in custody he made a number of telephone calls which were lawfully intercepted and recorded. In them he admitted his involvement in the offence. 

The applicant's subjective case

12The applicant was 27 years of age when he offended and 29 years when sentenced. He had separated from his partner of 10 years and their three children. He had commenced a new relationship at the time of the offence. 

13The applicant's father had an affiliation with an outlaw motorcycle gang and was a drug addict. The applicant suffered physical abuse at his hands. An uncle sexually assaulted him when he was six or seven years old. Dr Furst, a psychiatrist who examined the applicant for the purpose of the case, described him as appearing to be of below average intelligence but no psychometric testing was available.

14The applicant's own drug addiction began at the age of 12 when his father permitted him to smoke cannabis. His daily habit continued until he was in his twenties. He started using heroin at the age of 16 and ceased using it in 2002. He had used amphetamines between 2000 and 2002 to overcome his opiate withdrawal, and occasionally ever since. 

15The applicant worked as a tree-lopper and tattoo-ist until 2008 when he suffered injuries in a high-speed motorcycle accident. He used cannabis and heroin as a form of pain relief and was unable to regain employment. 

16At the time of sentence, according to the evidence of Dr Furst, the applicant had been in protective custody since his arrest due to his association with outlaw motorcycle gangs. 

17Also according to Dr Furst, there was no indication that the applicant was unaware of his actions or their wrongfulness. Whilst in the opinion of Dr Furst the applicant had no signs of paranoia or hallucinations and was not depressed or suicidal, his chronic pain disorder, ongoing substance abuse, limited intellect and the influence of fellow bikie club members may have contributed to his actions at the time of the offence. 

18The applicant's criminal antecedents include convictions for driving offences, drug related offences, common assault, contravening an apprehended domestic violence order, using a carriage service to threaten serious harm and an assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

19At the time of committing the offence the applicant was subject to section 9 bonds of 10 months duration imposed by Penrith Local Court for offences of using a carriage service to threaten serious harm and common assault. These crimes were committed in a domestic context. 

20There is a suggestion in the report of Dr Furst that the subject offence was committed in retaliation for crimes committed against the applicant. 

Reasons of the primary judge

21The primary judge allowed a 10 per cent discount for the applicant's late plea. She did not regard his criminal record as one ""which aggravates the current offence"" nor as one ""which disentitles him to leniency"". Her Honour also observed that the s 112(3) offence was one of the most serious in the criminal calendar ""as can be seen from the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period"".

22In assessing the objective seriousness of the offender's offending as one ""above the midrange of subjective seriousness"", her Honour referred to the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period; the element of the offence of being armed with dangerous weapons; the fact that the weapons were discharged and the victim suffered gun shot wounds and other violence; and the consideration that the victim's partner and child were present. 

23As aggravating factors, her Honour also referred to the applicant being on conditional liberty; the significant elements of premeditation and planning; and the aspect of retaliation. 

24Her Honour did not accept that the applicant was either contrite or remorseful, rather she formed the view that he regretted the personal consequences of his offending. She found his prospects of rehabilitation, and of avoiding similar offending upon release, were reasonable provided he undertook rehabilitative courses, was abstemious of drugs and alcohol and avoided bad company. 

25No parity issue was raised and her Honour had no information about whether the co-offenders had been ""charged, convicted or sentenced"".

26The primary judge then made the following remarks about general deterrence, which are central to the applicant's grounds of appeal:

General deterrence of course looms large. Gun crimes are on the increase and the police and community have a level of expectation that when those who commit crimes involving the use of firearms are sentenced then a message will be sent to the community that these types of offences will not be tolerated. Lives are put at risk when guns are discharged randomly in the commission of the crime, often innocent victims are injured and properties damaged by the indiscriminate discharging of firearms by criminals. The lives of police are put at significant risk in these sorts of circumstances.

Grounds

27Four grounds of appeal are advanced as follows:

1.That there was no evidence to support her finding that ""Gun crimes are on the increase""; 

2.In finding that gun crimes are on the increase the applicant was denied procedural fairness;

3.As a result of her findings she erred by giving more weight to general deterrence as a result of her finding that there was an increased prevalence of gun crimes;

4.In stating ""The lives of police are put at significant risk in these sorts of circumstances"" being gun crime, there was no evidence to support that finding.


Grounds 1 to 3

28The substance of the applicant's written argument in relation to these grounds was that her Honour's observations about an increase in the prevalence of gun crime in this State should be understood as the adoption of an approach by the primary judge that ""the increasing prevalence of a particular crime calls for an increase in the preceding pattern of sentencing"" as discussed by Wood CJ at CL in R v House [2005] NSWCCA 88 at [23]. The applicant argued that in such circumstances natural justice in sentencing requires both that counsel be warned so he or she may address the issue, and the admission of ""proper and sufficient evidence"" of increased prevalence justifying an increase in sentence.

29To make good this contention, the applicant relied, not only upon the decision of this Court in R v House, but also on two subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court of Victoria, Court of Appeal. In Nguyen v R; Phommalysack v R (2011) 31 VR 673; [2011] VSCA 32 Maxwell P said (at [82]):

Axiomatically, before prevalence can be taken into account for the purposes of sentencing, a judge must have ""some reliable foundation"" for the conclusion that the offence is in fact (more) prevalent. And if the judge is minded to impose a more severe sentence on account of (increased) prevalence, then on ordinary natural justice principles the matter must be raised with counsel and an opportunity afforded for submissions to be made.

30In Trajkovski v R (2011) 32 VR 587; [2011] VSCA 170 Weinberg JA, with the agreement of the other members of the Court said at ([103] - [104]):

Counsel submitted that it is one thing to say that a particular type of offence is prevalent within the community. The incidence of drug trafficking is a matter of such notoriety that it is hardly necessary, when sentencing, to make reference to that fact. He submitted, however, that it is another thing altogether for a judge, when sentencing an offender, to find that a particular offence is becoming more prevalent and therefore, at least implicitly, warrants more severe punishment. In such circumstances, it was submitted, the requirements of procedural fairness may dictate that the judge should flag his or her intention to approach the matter in that way so that counsel may be heard in relation to it.

In my opinion, the applicant is entitled to complain of his Honour's having arrived at that conclusion without the applicant having had the opportunity to address the judge on that point. It follows that I would accept the applicant's submission that his Honour proceeded in error.


31In oral argument, the applicant argued that notwithstanding the formulation of Wood CJ at CL in House at [23], to make good these grounds, it was not necessary for him to demonstrate the sentence imposed represented ""an increase in the preceding pattern of sentencing"". It was enough if the sentence imposed was heavier than that which would have been imposed absent the perception of an increase in the prevalence of gun crime. With respect, how this comparison was to be made without reference to an established pattern or range (assuming this is permissible) so that a sentencing judge would know a warning was required was never made clear.

32The Crown submitted that her Honour's remarks should not be understood in context as a finding of an increasing prevalence of gun crime calling for an increase in the pattern of sentences. Rather, it was argued that her Honour's remarks represented no more than the discharge of the primary Judge's duty to draw upon her own experience and knowledge of human affairs to reflect on community attitudes to offending of this type: House at [17]; R v H (1980) 3 A Crim R 53 at [75] per Begg J. The Crown also relied upon WCB v R (2010) 29 VR 483, a joint decision of Warren CJ and Redlich JA, constituting the Court, (at 493 [33]) to argue that the sentencing judge is entitled to ""take account of public attitudes to the type of crime in question and public concern about the prevalence of a type of crime or about its effects, and have regard in a general way to a public expectation that serious crime will attract severe punishment."". 

33It is worthy of interpolation that their Honours emphasised that the permissible reference to the community carries an ""underlying assumption of an objective, fully informed community that [understands] the range of sentencing that would be appropriate in the circumstances"" (WCB at 497 [44]).

34The Crown relied upon the recent case of El Masri v R [2014] NSWCCA 13 where a sentencing Judge's reference to ""the apparent increasing prevalence of illegal firearms in the community"" passed without negative comment. Indeed, in disposing of that matter Hulme AJ, with whom Basten JA and Hidden J agreed, referred to ""the prevalence of drive-by shootings"". However, this may not be the same thing as an ""increasing prevalence"". 

35Notwithstanding the changed emphasis in oral argument, in my judgment the cases relied upon by the applicant establish that to make good his ground, he must demonstrate that: (a) without proper basis in the material before her Honour: and (b) without notice to the applicant, the sentencing Judge decided to impose a heavier sentence than that justified by a prevailing pattern, to take account of an increasing prevalence of the offence in question, whether for the purpose of general deterrence, or denunciation. 

36Absent a legitimate expectation that the sentence will fall within some established range, no practical injustice can flow for the reasons discussed by four justices of the High Court of Australia in Barbaro v The Queen; Zirilli v The Queen [2014] HCA 2 at [44]-[49]. Absent permissible reliance on an established range this Court cannot assess whether, and how, the failure of the primary judge to warn counsel to invite further argument might have deprived the applicant of the opportunity, even as a possibility, of a more favourable outcome. It is not said the sentence is manifestly excessive.

37Leaving aside the Victorian practice established in R v MacNeil-Brown (2008) 20 VR 677; [2008] VSCA 190, disapproved of by the High Court in Barbaro, for the reasons discussed in Barbaro at [24] - [28] there are difficulties with a sentencing court permissibly identifying a preceding pattern or ""setting the bounds of the range of sentences within which the sentence should (or could) have fallen"" (Barbaro at [28]). ""Setting bounds"" is not a requirement of the sentencing task. It is worth setting out in full the following passage from Barbaro:

Fixing the bounds of a range within which a sentence should fall or within which a sentence that has been imposed should have fallen wrongly suggests that sentencing is a mathematical exercise. Sentencing an offender is not, and cannot be undertaken as, some exercise in addition or subtraction. A sentencing judge must reach a single sentence for each offence and must do so by balancing many different and conflicting features. The sentence cannot, and should not, be broken down into some set of component parts. As the plurality said in Wong v The Queen, ""[s]o long as a sentencing judge must, or may, take account of all of the circumstances of the offence and the offender, to single out some of those considerations and attribute specific numerical or proportionate value to some features, distorts the already difficult balancing exercise which the judge must perform"" (original emphasis). 

No less importantly, any determination of the bounds of an available range of sentences would have to depend upon first, what considerations are judged to bear upon the fixing of sentence and second, what effect is given to those considerations. Hence, if a party to sentencing proceedings proffers a range of sentences as the range within which a particular sentence should be imposed upon an offender, the range will necessarily reflect conclusions or assumptions (stated or unstated) which have been made about what considerations bear upon sentence and what weight is given to each. As Buchanan JA rightly said in MacNeil-Brown, even if those conclusions and assumptions were all to be exposed, ""it is not possible to explain the part played by those facts and factors in arriving at the figures advanced by counsel without resorting to the mathematical approach"" to sentencing which this Court has rejected. 

.......

The setting of bounds to the available range of sentences in a particular case must, however, be distinguished from the proper and ordinary use of sentencing statistics and other material indicating what sentences have been imposed in other (more or less) comparable cases. Consistency of sentencing is important. But the consistency that is sought is consistency in the application of relevant legal principles, not numerical equivalence. 

As the plurality pointed out in Hili v The Queen, in seeking consistency sentencing judges must have regard to what has been done in other cases. Those other cases may well establish a range of sentences which have been imposed. But that history does not establish that the sentences which have been imposed mark the outer bounds of the permissible discretion. The history stands as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence. What is important is the unifying principles which those sentences both reveal and reflect. And as each of Buchanan JA and Kellam JA rightly observed in MacNeil-Brown, the synthesis of the ""raw material"" which must be considered on sentencing, including material like sentencing statistics and information about the sentences imposed in comparable cases, is the task of the sentencing judge, not counsel. 
(My emphasis)


38The applicant's case at one level of abstraction is that he was not given a fair hearing because the Judge took into account factual material not in evidence without notice to the parties, namely ""[g]un crimes are on the increase"". Expressed this way an infringement of the ""hearing rule"" aspect of natural justice may have occurred. However, the argument advances only the conclusion for which it contends. Expressed this way, the error is asserted, not demonstrated.

39In my judgment, the correctness of the argument has not been demonstrated. As the cases of House, Phormmalysak and Trajkovski relied upon by the applicant establish, demonstration of error in the present context depend upon showing that the sentence represents ""an increase in the preceding pattern of sentencing"" or previously accepted available range. Given what the High Court has recently said in Barbaro about the availability of ""ranges"" and emphasising that fixing of the appropriate sentence for the offence and the offender is the sole responsibility of the sentencing Judge, it is difficult to see how natural justice could impose a duty on the Judge to warn counsel, or provide advance notice of, the result he or she has in mind. Naturally, if a Judge chooses to give an indication that foreshortens legitimate persuasion by counsel he or she may not depart from it without allowing the opportunity for further argument. No such thing occurred here.

40Moreover, with great respect to learned counsel, there is a certain air of artificiality about the argument in the present case. It is said to be impermissible for a sentencing Judge to rely upon an increasing prevalence of the offence in question as a fact, matter or circumstance relevant to the fixing of a sentence without notice, but permissible to rely upon a perceived prevalence per se. The error in the present case is said to be that the Judge said, ""[g]un crimes are on the increase""; but her Honour might have said ""gun crimes are too common"" without error. I confess that this is too nice a point for me.

41This is not to say that reliance upon an unsubstantiated rising prevalence of an offence can never found a right of appeal in accordance with the principles discussed in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499. It may be possible to demonstrate that by relying on such a consideration, the sentencing Judge has misapprehended the facts, or taken into account an irrelevant consideration, i.e. an unsubstantiated belief about an increasing prevalence of the subject crime, in a material way. That, however, is not the argument advanced here. 

42I appreciate that the primary Judge took time to consider the appropriate sentence in this matter. Even so, her Honour's judgment must be read fairly, as a whole, and without an eye too finely attuned to the detection of error. Reading the impugned paragraph in the context of the whole judgment, I am of the view that when discussing the relevant consideration of general deterrence, as one only of all of the circumstances of the offence and the offender relevant to the sentence, which her Honour referred in the course of her reasons, her Honour was not singling out a perceived rising prevalence of gun crime as a determinative factor in fixing the sentence. 

43I would reject Grounds 1, 2 and 3.

Ground 4.

44Ground 4 focuses upon the last sentence of the impugned paragraph. Her Honour is recorded as having said: 

The lives of police are put at significant risk in these sorts of circumstances.

Of course, the lives of police were not put at risk in the circumstances of the applicant's offence. The applicant and his co-offenders had absconded before the police had the chance to respond to the emergency call. The applicant points out that there was no risk to any police officer in the present case, and argues that her Honour used this irrelevant consideration as an aggravating factor. 

45The Crown suggests that the word ""police"" may be a slip of her Honour's tongue, or perhaps, a mistranscription. On this argument, the word ""police"" should be read as ""people"". There is some contextual support for this argument. In the preceding sentence her Honour spoke of ""lives ... at risk"" as a general incident of gun crime.

46As the reasons were delivered after time for consideration, I am not persuaded that ""police"" in the final sentence is a mistake. Rather, as the context was general deterrence, I consider that her Honour was speaking generally of the possible consequences of gun crime, rather than referring specifically to the facts of the present case. There can be no doubt that when criminals arm themselves, police officers called on to arrest them may be ""put at significant risk"". I am not persuaded that her Honour used this consideration as an aggravating feature of the present offending. She was merely making an observation about the evils of gun crime generally, as she was entitled to do.

47I would reject ground 4.

Police Expectation

48In the impugned paragraph, the learned primary Judge said, ""the police and the community have a level of expectation ... that these type of offences will not be tolerated"" (my emphasis). No complaint is made about the reference to ""police expectation"".

49Police perform vital, indeed crucial, work in the administration of criminal justice. They detect and solve crimes; arrest and bring offenders before the court; they investigate and gather the evidence by which the prosecution will establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The importance of this work should not be underestimated in any way.

50However, just as prosecutorial opinion as to the ""available range"" of sentences is irrelevant for the reasons explained in Barbaro at [42] - [43], so too is the expectation of the police service about the appropriate sentence. Like the opinion of the prosecutor (or defence counsel for that matter), the view of the police about the appropriate range ""will necessarily reflect conclusions or assumptions (stated or unstated) which have been made about what considerations bear upon sentence and what weight is given to each"". (Barbaro at [35]). With respect, the reference to police, as opposed to community, expectation should not have been made.

Section 6(3) of Criminal Appeal Act 1912

51If I were wrong in my conclusions, I would, nonetheless, conclude that no lesser sentence is warranted at law. The offending conduct in this case involved a very serious degree of criminality. It was a premeditated offence involving the actual use of multiple dangerous weapons which were discharged in the course of the offence. The victim suffered gunshot wounds. And the guns were fired when the three offenders were unlawfully in the victim's home whilst the victim's partner and young baby were present. The victim was also struck on his head by one of the co-offenders during the offence.

52As to planning, the offenders armed themselves with loaded firearms and deliberately attempted to conceal their identities using masks or helmets. They forced their way into the victim's home after shooting through the front door. They discharged further shots, even firing at the victim whilst he fled to a neighbouring house. Her Honour correctly, and unsurprisingly, assessed the objective seriousness as above the mid-range.

53Moreover, the offence was committed whilst the applicant was on conditional liberty. 

54When proper regard is had to the degree of objective seriousness of the offence, taking into account the applicant's, on the whole less than compelling, subjective case and paying proper regard to the legislative guidance offered by the standard non-parole period of 7 years and the maximum penalty of 25 years, no other and lesser sentence is warranted in law.

55I propose the applicant be granted leave to appeal, but the appeal be dismissed.

		21 May 2014",2014-05-20 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705088,R v Mohammad Hadi Parivash [2014] NSWDC 62,"JUDGMENT

1HER HONOUR: The accused has objected to the admission of identification evidence sought to be led by the Crown at trial. There has been a voir dire conducted in relation to the admissibility of this evidence. The accused was arraigned on indictment dated 6 January 2014 on one charge, contrary to s 233A of the Migration Act, namely that between 9 April and 14 August 2012 in Java and elsewhere in Indonesia, he facilitated the bringing or coming to Australia of another person, namely Fawad Ahmed, who is a noncitizen, reckless as to whether the non-citizen had a lawful right to come to Australia. 

2For the purposes of this voir dire I have not had access to any of the statements of witnesses to be called at any trial. The officer in charge, an Australian Federal Police officer, has given evidence and summarised what would be the evidence at trial, relevant to this voir dire at least. There is no dispute about this and as I understand it, the Crown's case against the accused relies almost entirely on the evidence of Mr Fawad Ahmed, who will give evidence he came on a boat from Indonesia to Australia arriving on 14 August 2012 as a person without a visa, therefore without a lawful right to come to Australia, but as I understand it, claiming asylum as a refugee and in a boat intercepted off Ashmore Reef. 

3The evidence will be that from then on he was in Immigration detention, taken initially to Darwin with others from that boat. It would appear to be the case that in the course of some initial interviews, before his first official interview with Immigration, or at least at some stage not long after, he arrived on the boat, he indicated he had been assisted to undertake that journey by a people smuggler in Indonesia who he knew as Sadra. 

4Before 18 April 2013 he was brought down to Sydney, still in Immigration detention. Between 18 and 19 April 2013 he engaged in an interview with Australian Federal Police officer Luke Pouldon at their headquarters in Goulburn Street Sydney. He made a formal statement to police, including confirming his previous information that he was assisted to come to Australia on a boat from Indonesia by a people smuggler who he knew as Sadra. He gave a description of that person, namely that he was a clean-shaven person with a baldhead. There may be other evidence of his description but they are the relevant details provided to me on this voir dire. I accept from the evidence of the officer in charge, that Mr Ahmed did not know this person by any other name at the time he gave his interview at least. During the interview in April he was shown a photo board of twelve people, one of whom was the accused in a photograph taken on 6 December 2012. 

5The accused himself also came to Australia on a boat from Indonesia about a month later than Mr Ahmed, namely in September 2012, and was detained initially on Christmas Island as a person referred to in the Act as a noncitizen who had no lawful right to come to Australia. He had his first interview with Immigration officials on Christmas Island on 6 December 2012. During the course of this interview he was photographed, as is the normal case so far as I am aware. This photograph was the one of the accused which was one of the twelve photographs shown to Mr Ahmed on 18 April 2012 during his interview with the Australian Federal Police. The purpose of the photo board identification process was to obtain identification evidence, if possible, of the person who Mr Ahmed said was the people smuggler who assisted his coming to Australia and who he knew as Sadra. The accused's photograph was number 3 in that photo board. Mr Ahmed selected his photograph as being the people smuggler who had assisted him. There is no dispute photograph 3 is in fact a photograph of the accused taken by Immigration officials at Christmas Island on 6 December 2012. 

6The Crown seeks to lead this evidence to identify the person referred to as a people smuggler by Mr Ahmed, known to him as Sadra, and to identify him as being this accused. As I understand the arguments, there is no other evidence in the Crown case, which is in any event, almost entirely dependent on the evidence of Mr Ahmed, to prove his guilt of the offence. In particular there is no evidence to establish he is in fact the person known as Sadra without the photo board identification evidence. 

7The accused's solicitor argues against the admission of this evidence on two grounds, as I understand it. The first and most significant is that the identification evidence is illegally obtained and, pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act, ought not be admitted. The unlawfulness it is argued arises because of a failure to comply with the provisions of s 3ZO, of the Crimes Act 1914. 

8The second ground argued is that the prejudicial value of the evidence outweighs the probative value. That is an argument pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act as I understand it, brought on the basis that the process itself was in effect contrary to other provisions of s 3ZO relevant to the timing of the photograph taken of the accused which was shown to the witness, and the composition of the other eleven photographs in the photo board. I will come to that in due course. 

9Dealing with the first argument however, that is the illegality argument, s 3ZO appears in a Division of the Crimes Act 1914 entitled 'Arrest and Related Matters'. That section itself is entitled 'Identification by means of photographs'. Relevantly S3ZO (1) provides that:

S3ZO (1)""If a suspect is in custody in respect of an offence or is otherwise available to take part in an identification parade, the constable investigating the offence must not show photographs or composite pictures or pictures of a similar kind to a witness for the purpose of establishing or obtaining evidence of the identity of the suspect unless: 
(a) The suspect has refused to take part in an identification parade or 
(aa) the suspect's appearance has changed significantly since the offence was committed or 
(b) The holding of an identification parade would be unfair to the suspect or unreasonable in the circumstances.""

10There are other provisions of the section as I have said, also relied on by the accused, namely some portions of S3ZO (2) but primarily it is argued that conducting the picture identification procedure was contrary to S3(1) of this Act and thus the evidence was obtained in consequence of this illegality. 

11As I have said the evidence was given on the voir dire by the AFP officer in charge of the case. I accept the following from his evidence: 

(1)At some stage before January 9, 2013 the AFP had received information from various asylum seekers in detention on Christmas Island that their passage to Australia had been facilitated by a people smuggler, who himself was in detention as an asylum seeker. It would appear that Mr Ahmed was not one of those providing that information at the time.

(2)This information was taken seriously enough by the AFP that they made a request to the New South Wales police Suspect Identification Unit to prepare a photo board for the purpose of picture identification. That request was made on 21 January 2013 and the photo board was provided to the AFP on 7 February 2013.

(3)The photo board thus compiled was of twelve people and one of those was the accused. The actual photo board shown to Mr Ahmed is exhibit 1 on this voir dire.

(4)There were multiple photo boards provided to the AFP on 7 February 2013 with exactly the same twelve people in them, including the accused in each one. The eleven other people depicted, I accept, were compiled by New South Police Suspect Identification Unit from their own resources. More probably than not this was from arrest photos of other individuals. None of the twelve photos indicates that any of them was or had been in police custody. Almost without doubt, although the evidence is not absolute, but almost without doubt, none of the other eleven persons was a person suspected of people smuggling activities. They were all, I accept, selected by that New South Wales Police Unit in an attempt to provide photographs of eleven other people who had similar characteristics and appearances to the accused in circumstances where a photograph which ultimately was number 3 in that photo board had been provided to that unit by the AFP for that very purpose. 

It obviously also follows that the whole reason that the AFP obtained these photo boards was to show the potential witnesses for the purpose of establishing the identity of, or if possible, obtaining evidence of the identity of the people smuggler about whom the AFP had received information from asylum seekers before January 2013. 

It also follows from the fact that they sought and provided a photo of the accused to be included in these twelve photo boards that the AFP by at least January 2013 regarded it as likely that this accused was indeed at least one of the people smugglers referred to by these asylum seekers. 

(5)Photo number 3 in exhibit 1 was taken by and on behalf of immigration officials when the accused was formally interviewed by them on 6 December 2012, having arrived on an intercepted boat on 22 September 2012, apparently seeking asylum. On the evidence before me photo number 3 was the first photograph taken of him in Australia whilst he was on Christmas Island and taken as part of the interview undertaken by DIAC with all such people, known as the Irregular Maritime Arrival Entry interview.

(6)There is no evidence about whether at the time that photograph was taken the AFP had any suspicion about his involvement in people smuggling generally or specifically in relation to this charge albeit, as I have found, at some stage not long after and certainly before 21 January 2013, they did.

(7)The interview with Mr Ahmed on 18 April 2013 took place in Sydney. He was initially taken to Darwin after his arrival in August. There is no evidence about when he was brought to Sydney, other than it was sometime before 18 April 2013, but not specifically for the purposes of engaging in an interview with the AFP. He remained at all times in immigration detention, albeit it would appear, community detention from the time he arrived in Sydney. 

(8)The AFP officer in charge knew, as from at least 21 January 2013, that the accused was in immigration detention and by that stage at least, as I have said he was, on my finding, suspected by the AFP as being one of the people at least referred to as a people smuggler although there had been no positive identification of him as yet by any person.

(9)In March 2013 the officer in charge, and more probably than not, other AFP officers, became aware that another asylum seeker had provided an indication that a people smuggler had offered to arrange a trip for him in Jakarta to get to Australia but that had not eventuated and he had been, in his terms, ""ripped off"". That person according to this asylum seeker was known to him as Sadra and the information given to the AFP no later than March 2013 from this person was that the person, known to him as Sadra was in fact this accused.

The officer agreed therefore that by March 2013 and certainly by the time of the interview on 18 April 2013, the AFP had at least one statement from an asylum seeker that a person who had purported to arrange a boat trip for them from Indonesia to Australia was named Sadra and that Sadra was in fact this accused. He also said that by the time the interview with Mr Ahmed was conducted, on the basis of this accumulation of information and material, that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the accused was in fact the person referred to by Mr Ahmed as Sadra.

(10)The AFP officer in charge did not make any attempt to locate the accused before the photo board was shown to Mr Ahmed for the purposes of identifying the accused. He agreed that he did not himself turn his mind to approaching him to offer an identification parade before showing the photo board to Mr Ahmed. He gave further evidence that he understood the importance of physical identification parades in identifying offenders. He agreed that normally if there is to be an attempt to identify a suspect then the first step should be to offer the suspect involvement in an identification parade. I accept from the combination of his evidence that in fact the officer in charge never turned his mind to doing so in this case.

(11)I accept that in large part his reason for not doing so was because of what he perceived to be difficulties in conducting such an identification parade when people in Immigration detention are spread throughout the country and are regularly moved. He accepted, it seems to me, that there was some sort of policy in place as between the AFP and the Immigration Department that it would be impractical to organise identification parades in such circumstances. But there is no evidence that apart from knowing or believing that this was a policy, he ever turned his mind to whether or not it was in fact difficult or easy in this particular case, and in any event did not offer the accused the chance to participate in such an identification parade. 

12From this combination of facts I accept that as at 18 April 2013 the accused was in fact a suspect in relation to people smuggling involving Mr Ahmed, the offence with which he is charged. The accused was not in police custody at the time but I accept being a person who was in fact in Immigration detention at the time, somewhere in Australia, he was available to take part in an identification parade. He was never offered a chance to do so and thus there is no evidence that he refused to take part in such an identification parade.

13His appearance had in fact, more probably than not, changed from the date of the offence to the date that any such parade would be conducted, if indeed Mr Ahmed's original description of him is accurate. That is his original description of him being a clean shaven person with a shaved or bald head, is clearly not how the accused appeared in photograph 3. But this, in my view, would not enliven s 3ZO(1)(aa) because it was the photograph of the altered appearance that was shown in the photo board. That particular subsection in my view is not relevant in relation to this voir dire.

14Whether or not it was then necessary for the officers to offer and, if accepted, conduct an identification parade before using picture identification evidence then depends on the provisions of s 3ZO(1)(b), namely that it is not necessary to do so if it would be either unfair to the suspect or unreasonable in the circumstances. There is no suggestion or evidence on this voir dire that it would have been unfair to hold an identification parade. 

15The question then becomes one of reasonableness. Section 3ZO(1A) sets out some matters to be taken into account in determining the issue of reasonableness. The Crown has argued that subs (c) applies in that it was impractical to hold an identification parade in the circumstances. 

16In circumstances where I have found that the accused was a suspect and that photographs were shown to a witness to establish his identity, contrary to s 3ZO(1), the onus it seems to me is on the Crown to establish, on the facts of this case, that it would have been unfair or unreasonable to do so, and the only matter argued in this case has been that it would have been impractical to do so. 

17To prove this the Crown relies on the evidence of the officer in charge. He said in his opinion it was impractical to do so. I do not accept his opinion. 

18The reason for that opinion it seems to me was a belief, more probably than not expressed in the witness box with the benefit of hindsight, but nonetheless a belief, that there was a policy or understanding amongst the AFP at the time that because those in Immigration detention were scattered around Australia and often moved around by the Department of Immigration, it would be impossible to organise a potential witness and a suspect in the same city so that there could be an identification parade including the suspect. The difficulty with a submission based on that evidence, it seems to me, is that the officer did not in this case in fact check the whereabouts of either Mr Ahmed or the accused at the time. His evidence was that the Department of Immigration records were often out of date and wrong and it seemed to me that he was saying that he was of the view, at least when he gave his evidence in the witness box, that a request to Immigration would not necessarily have revealed accurate information about the whereabouts of either of them. 

19What must be observed first, it seems to me, is that if this is an accurate statement of fact then it is both disappointing and concerning. Each of these two people was in Australia having been taken into detention from boats which entered Australia containing people who had no lawful right to come to Australia, but seeking asylum. It is not illegal to seek asylum in a country which is a signatory to the Refugee Convention, as is Australia. Whether or not they were genuine asylum seekers or not is another matter. However that is the basis on which they were taken into the custody of the Department Immigration.

20There is evidence that the normal practice was followed in relation to each of them, namely that a nominal roll was created when they were first taken off the boats so that the names that they ascribed themselves were known. A little later, in my view too much later, but nonetheless a little later, about six to eight weeks later, each of them was interviewed formally and photographed for the first time and in each case they spent time, either one in Christmas Island, the other I think the evidence is silent about. But having had that administrative process undertaken, each of them was moved elsewhere. Each of them was then moved to Darwin and as it transpires Mr Ahmed moved to Sydney, in community detention, some time before 18 April 2013. As it transpires the accused too was in Immigration detention, moved there at some stage from Darwin to Sydney at Villawood Detention Sydney in May 2013 and possibly was in Sydney in that same detention centre at the time the interview with Mr Ahmed was conducted. The officer did not know any of these details because neither he nor anyone else in the AFP had made any enquiries to establish the whereabouts of the accused to offer him an identification parade before 18 April 2013.

21If the officer's statement of belief about potential inaccuracy of Immigration Department records is a statement of fact then, as I have said, it is both disappointing and concerning that people who are in the detention of the Department of Immigration, in the name of the Government of Australia, cannot be sufficiently organised so that their whereabouts are known if that is requested by the AFP or other agencies whose task it is to identify crime. It may be that amongst them are people smugglers. It may even be that amongst them are terrorists. It almost certainly is that the bulk of them are genuine asylum seekers based on the history of such people in this country.

22The fact that they are taken into custody, their movements are to be controlled thereafter by the Immigration Department, but that there is a belief abroad that the Department cannot provide information on any one day about their whereabouts, if it is true, is a matter of some concern. Nonetheless I accept that it was at least, at the time he gave his evidence, the view of the officer in charge of this case, even though he was aware of the importance of at least offering an identification parade to a suspect if identify was sought to be established.

23Even though in fact at least by January 2013 the AFP believed that this accused was a people smuggler being spoken of by others at Christmas Island, even though they knew that he was known to Mr Ahmed by the name of Sadra, even though they knew that by March 2013 that another asylum seeker named his potential people smuggler as Sadra and provided information that he knew that Sadra was in fact this accused, nonetheless this officer did not make any inquiries to locate the accused so that an identification parade could be held and in fact he did not consider doing so at all.

24As I said I accept, more probably than not, his reason for not doing so was because of an institutional belief that, in the vernacular, it was too hard to do so because there were so many boats arriving to the north of Australia at the time and there was an institutional belief within the AFP that the Immigration Department was over burdened with work and what is more, those in immigration detention were moved around frequently by the Department and could be in any part of Australia at any given time.

25However that was just an institutional belief and in fact he did not turn his mind at all to the possibility of organising an ID parade, even though he knew that they were important and more probably than not, on his evidence, was familiar with the provisions of s 3ZO or at least the principles contained in that section. As a result it was never considered but nonetheless some weeks were spent organising the picture identification parade and it went ahead without any attempt being made to offer the accused an opportunity to participate in that parade.

26That is the only evidence there is before me to establish whether or not it was unreasonable to hold an identification parade and in summary I accept that what the evidence actually establishes is that no one in the AFP actually thought about doing so and no one ever made an inquiry about the whereabouts of the accused before the picture ID process was conducted on 18 April 2013.

27They did not speak to the accused until May or June 2013 and even then, only because he contacted them from Villawood Detention Centre and asked to see them. AFP officers went to Villawood and in accordance with procedure gave him the opportunity to seek legal advice before talking to them. He did so and, as I understand the evidence, on legal advice declined to speak to them further. Even at that stage they did not offer him the opportunity to participate in an identification parade which could have been done, albeit that any evidence obtained as a result may have been subject to later forensic challenge because Mr Ahmed had already identified a photo of the accused in the picture identification process.

28I do not accept that it has been established that it was unreasonable to hold an identification parade on the basis of that evidence. The provisions of s 3ZO appear to be mandatory and thus AFP officers must not show photographs of a suspect to a witness for the purpose of establishing the identity of a suspect unless there has been identity parade or, in the way that this case has unfolded, it was unfair or unreasonable to hold one. That has not been established and as such the evidence of identity was obtained in contravention of an Australian law.

29Section 138 of the Evidence Act then provides that in such a circumstance, the evidence should not be admitted unless the desirability of admitting it outweighs the undesirability of doing so. Matters which may be taken into account in conducting this balancing exercise are set out in S138 (3). 

30Addressing those, and other issues, I accept that the probative value of the evidence is potentially high and that it is important evidence in the trial. The probative value is potentially high but is subject to matters which I will address briefly in relation to the 137 argument raised on behalf of the accused. That is the composition of the photo board and other matters about which it is argued the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighs its probative value. But at least on a prima facie basis it is potentially high.

31In assessing the nature of the evidence, which is another matter to be taken into account, I accept that clearly enough it is identification evidence. Identification evidence is that sort of evidence treated with some circumspection by courts and always accompanied by fairly detailed directions and warnings about the potential frailty of identification evidence. It is thus evidence recognised in law as having the potential to be frail or with difficulties.

32The subject matter of the trial is serious, in that it is an allegation that the accused, as a people smuggler for money, facilitated Mr Ahmed's entry to Australia, knowing that he had no lawful right to be here. However the subject matter of the proceedings is not of the most serious type involving such things as murder, loss of life, serious bodily harm, rape or the like. 

33The contravention of law in my view is serious. There is a reason based in the experience of courts for strict compliance with laws and rules in relation to the process of identification. As juries must be directed, it is the experience of courts over the years, for a variety of reasons, people are sometimes wrongly convicted on the basis of identification which later turns out to be incorrect.

34It is also the case that two dimensional, head and shoulder photographic evidence has always been regarded as potentially less reliable than the identification of a person in the flesh, which is no doubt the reason for the provisions of s 3ZO and similar provisions in the Evidence Act in relation to the admission of picture identification evidence where a person is in custody.

35Further, this contravention was not just an oversight in relation to a minor issue. It was an institutional error in relation to evidence gathering in circumstances where the AFP officer acknowledged the importance of an identification parade, and thus where it would appear that a lesser standard was being applied, on an institutional basis, when gathering evidence in relation to offences potentially committed under the Migration Act in relation to asylum seekers, than in relation to suspects for other offences. That itself is a matter of even greater concern because all people in immigration detention, whether they are suspected people smugglers or those seeking asylum, have very limited rights compared to others in the community. They have no control over the place to which they may be moved. Their access to others is limited and controlled by the Immigration Department. They are, to that extent, in a more vulnerable position than those in the Australian community generally and with limited opportunities. As such, laws designed to protect the rights of a person who is suspected of an offence and likely to be charged with a criminal offence, ought be complied with strictly when dealing with people in that vulnerable position. 

36The contravention of law here was not done deliberately by the officerincharge or any of the other AFP officers, but in my view, even though knowing the importance of identification parades, they simply did not ever seek to find out where the accused was and whether or not he was prepared to participate in a parade. In my view, in those circumstances that amounts to institutional recklessness in relation to this particular law. 

37On the evidence before me I accept that it would not have been difficult to obtain the evidence of identification without contravening the law. Either, they could have conducted an identification parade, and there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the accused and Mr Ahmed could not have been brought together in the same city without significant trouble, and in fact more probably than not they were in fact both in Sydney as at 18 April 2013. What is more, however, they could have found the accused, who was in immigration detention at the time somewhere in Australia, and offered him the opportunity of engaging in an identification parade. If he had declined, then they could gone ahead and conducted the picture identification process and obtained this evidence without any contravention of the law. 

38It is a balancing exercise and minds may differ about the importance of the various elements to take into account. I have concluded on the assessment of the matters to which I have referred and generally, that it is important that laws be complied with strictly when those who to be charged are themselves under the control of the same State which seeks to prosecute them. This was a reckless but serious contravention of an important law in relation to the sort of evidence which the Courts have traditionally regarded as potentially unreliable. Even though it is of major importance in the Crown's case and even though it would appear to have reasonable probative value, nonetheless I am of the view that strict compliance with the law in this case outweighs those factors. I thus decline to admit the evidence sought to be led by the Crown.

39I will not deal with the challenge to the admissibility of the evidence on the basis that its prejudicial value would outweigh its probative value. It seems to me that that argument overlaps with an assessment of the probative value of the evidence as well. It would appear to be based on two grounds. First, that it was a photo taken of the accused before he became a suspect, which of itself is contrary to a particular provision of 3ZO(2). That provision applies, if practical. That would ultimately be a matter for consideration, but not, of itself, one that would dictate the admissibility of the evidence. 

40The second major plank of the argument, as I understand it, is that the photo board is comprised of people who either do not match the description given by the witness, which applies to all of them, or do not sufficiently match the actual appearance of the accused as he apparently appeared in the photograph, which is number 3. 

41Those matters, it seems to me, if the matter ever got to trial, would be matters to go before the jury to be assessed in accordance with all of the other matters in an identification case subject to directions to be given by a judge. If I were required to rule on that issue, I would not find that the prejudicial value of that evidence, as it now appears before me on voir dire, would outweigh the probative value of that evidence and would not, on that basis alone, reject the admissibility of the evidence. But it seems to me that that is not necessary for me to make a final determination of that matter given the finding that I have otherwise made in relation to the rejection of the evidence as it is contrary to s 138 of the Evidence Act. 

42The formal order is I decline to admit the identification evidence, as it is contrary to s 138 of the Evidence Act.

		05 June 2014",2014-05-21 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705099,Villis v R [2014] NSWCCA 74,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: I agree with Fullerton J.

2FULLERTON J: By Notice of Appeal dated 18 October 2013 the appellant appealed his conviction following a jury trial in the District Court on one count of supply of not less than a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). On 22 February 2013 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months. There was no application for leave to appeal the sentence. 

3On 15 April 2014 the appeal against conviction was upheld and the conviction quashed. An order was made for a retrial. What follows are my reasons for joining in the making of those orders.

4There were three filed grounds of appeal although only grounds 2 and 3 were ultimately pressed on the hearing of the appeal as follows:

Ground 2: The trial judge erred in not discharging the jury following an application for discharge on the basis that a prosecution witness had given evidence amounting to the bad character of the appellant. 

Ground 3: The verdict of the jury should be set aside because it appears that a unanimous verdict was reached through pressure of time restraints rather than proper deliberation.

5I propose to deal with the grounds in reverse order since it was his Honour's directions delivered in the course of the jury's deliberations that, in my view, undermined the integrity of the verdict such that the conviction could not be allowed to stand. I would dismiss the second ground of appeal. 

6It is not necessary to detail the evidence led at trial at any length. In short, the Crown alleged that the methylamphetamine, located by police in a shopping bag on the front passenger seat of the appellant's car during the course of a roadside search at Wentworthville, was in his possession for supply. During the search police also located a range of other drugs and drug paraphernalia in a backpack in the rear of the car. In a recorded interview with police the appellant admitted possession of the drugs and other items in the backpack but denied any knowledge of the methylamphetamine in the shopping bag. He suggested it must have been placed there by Louise Wiseman, a woman he was to pick up and drive to the Central Coast and who was in the vicinity of the car when it was searched. The appellant gave evidence at the trial to the same effect.

7The attention of police was initially drawn to the appellant's vehicle following his interaction with Ms Wiseman as she walked past the open passenger door of the appellant's parked car, hesitating momentarily as she passed. She was spoken to by police, searched and permitted to leave. She was one of the six witnesses called by the Crown at trial. She denied any knowledge of the methylamphetamine. It was her evidence in cross-examination that was said by the appellant to have raised his bad character prompting the application to discharge the jury, the subject of the second ground of appeal. 

8Ms Wiseman gave evidence that on the late afternoon or early evening of 17 July 2011 she contacted a woman from Morisset named Chris, with a view to obtaining a lift from Sydney to Newcastle. Ms Wiseman was given the appellant's telephone number and arrangements were made for the appellant to collect Ms Wiseman and drive her to Morisset. 

9Ms Wiseman gave evidence that as she was walking up Station Street Wentworthville to meet the appellant, she heard someone call her name. She turned around and saw the appellant speaking with police officers. She did not recognise the appellant at first. At that time Ms Wiseman was carrying a green bag with clothes and shoes in it. Ms Wiseman gave evidence that she believed the appellant was ""off his head"", and that he was throwing bottles out of his car. Ms Wiseman called Chris who confirmed that the appellant was the person she had organised to pick her up. 

10Ms Wiseman gave evidence that while she was in the vicinity of the appellant his car was in full sight of the police and the appellant. One of the police officers searched her and she was allowed to leave. Ms Wiseman gave evidence that she was present when one of the police officers searched a backpack that was in the appellant's car in which they found drugs and scales. Ms Wiseman said she did not put the drugs in the shopping bag in the car. 

11Although only six witnesses were called, the trial extended over eight days before the jury retired to consider their verdict at about 2.30pm on Thursday 15 November 2012. In his summing up, the trial judge directed the jury that their verdict should be unanimous subject only to directing them that ""things can change later and I would have to talk to you about that then"". 

12The jury had originally been advised by the trial judge that the trial was estimated to extend over five, possibly six days and that any application to be excused from jury duty would be considered on that basis. It seems that estimate was revised from time to time after day six on account of juror illness and some difficulties with Ms Wiseman's availability. A juror was excused from further participation due to illness on Thursday 15 November 2012, the eight day of the trial.

13It also appears that his Honour had informed the jury before they commenced their deliberations on Thursday afternoon that they would not be required to sit after 1pm the following day, it being a Friday, as three jurors had made arrangements to attend to their personal affairs that afternoon. It also appears that other jurors informed the trial judge they would not be available on the following Monday. 

14The jury sent a note on Friday at about 12.30pm advising that they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The transcript records that counsel and his Honour agreed that the jury had, by that time, been deliberating for approximately 4 hours and 40 minutes. The note advised his Honour that the division was ""nine versus two"". Contrary to what this Court has held in Nagti v R [2008] NSWCCA 3 at [33] and Burrell v R [2007] NSWCCA 65 at [253]-[266] to be the proper approach where a trial judge is informed by a jury of the extent of disagreement in a jury note, his Honour advised the appellant's counsel and the trial advocate appearing for the Crown of the jury's note. Nothing turns on this in so far as this appeal is concerned although it seems to have informed the exchanges with counsel that followed. 

15The application of s 55F of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW), which provides for majority verdicts in criminal proceedings and the procedures that must be followed before a jury is invited to consider returning a verdict by majority, was not raised at the time of receipt of the jury note by either the trial advocate or trial counsel or the presiding judge. However the consensus that 4 hours and 40 minutes had elapsed when the jury advised that they could not agree upon a verdict would suggest that both the trial judge and counsel were at least conscious that the eight hours specified in s 55F(2)(a) had not elapsed and that therefore it was not open to his Honour to direct the jury that they might consider returning a majority verdict at that time. It is, however, by no means clear that his Honour appreciated that he had no discretion to discharge the jury from returning a verdict until they had been deliberating for eight hours and were unable to reach a unanimous verdict or by majority as expressly provided by s 56(1) of the Jury Act. 

16Section 56 of the Jury Act provides: 

""56 Discharge of jury that disagree in criminal proceedings

(1) Where a jury in criminal proceedings has retired, and the jury consists of 11 or 12 persons, the court in which the proceedings are being tried may discharge the jury if it finds, after examination on oath of one or more of the jurors, that it is unlikely that the jurors will reach a unanimous verdict or a majority verdict under section 55F.

(2) Where a jury in criminal proceedings has retired, and the jury consists of 11 or 12 persons, the court in which the proceedings are being tried may not discharge the jury under this section if it finds, after examination on oath of one or more of the jurors, that it is likely that the jurors will reach a majority verdict under section 55F.

(3) Where a jury in criminal proceedings has retired, and the jury consists of 10 persons or less, the court in which the proceedings are being tried may discharge the jury if it finds, after examination on oath of one or more of the jurors, that it is unlikely that the jurors will reach a unanimous verdict.""

17In order to deal with the jury announcement of their disagreement his Honour directed the jury in accordance with Black v R [1993] HCA 71; 179 CLR 44, commonly referred to as a ""Black direction"" at 12.42pm. 

18It is necessary, however, to set out the direction in full:

""Ladies and gentlemen thank you, I think as you heard the Crown and Mr Marr and myself say your verdict must be unanimous, it must be a unanimous verdict and the law and the courts appreciate that you have to be honest to your own belief and affirmation, that is your own affirmation, your own oath but experience has shown that sometimes if juries are given a bit more time you can agree upon a verdict and I understand that at this stage you cannot agree upon a verdict but if you have a bit more time I understand some of you have got real problems this afternoon is that right some of you have got problems this afternoon, I can see heads nodding but if I ask you to go back into the jury room now and if you listen to each other's views, experience has shown that sometimes you can agree. You don't have to come to a verdict by the same path, that is you can come to the same verdict from this path or that path, you don't have to come from the same path to reach a verdict but it must be unanimous, has to be unanimous. So what I can say is this, that if you listen and I'll just take the wording from the text in front of me, you should calmly weigh up one another's opinions about the evidence and test them by discussion, calm and objective discussion of the evidence often leads to a better understanding of the differences of opinion which you may have and may convince you that your original opinion was wrong. Now we will see what happens and I will get you to come back at 5 past 1 and I will see how you are going.""

19The jury retired to continue their deliberations at 12.45pm.

20In the exchange with counsel that then ensued, trial counsel suggested that rather than the jury being brought back just after 1pm (as his Honour had informed them he would) they ought to be encouraged to stay until 2pm to allow appropriate consideration to be given by them to the Black direction before discharging them for the day. In that discussion, his Honour was reminded by the trial advocate for the Crown that despite the issues in the trial being of relatively narrow compass, the two stage process provided for in s 55F(2) of the Jury Act did not allow his Honour to direct the jury that their verdict could be other than unanimous until eight hours had elapsed and he was satisfied that further time would be unlikely to achieve unanimity. It was agreed that the eight hour time limit did not expire until 3.50pm. 

21At counsel's invitation, his Honour asked the Sheriff's officer to enquire whether the jury were prepared to stay until 2pm and continue their deliberations (and that lunch would be provided if that were the case). He was advised that the jury would stay until 2pm if they were permitted to make phone calls. His Honour allowed for that to occur. 

22In the discussion that then ensued with counsel whilst the jury continued their deliberations, consideration was given to what his Honour ought do at 2pm, or shortly before that time, in the event that a verdict was not returned in the interim. The trial advocate for the Crown reminded his Honour that while it was appropriate that he enquire of the foreperson as to their progress in agreeing upon a verdict he should not refer to the possibility of a non-unanimous verdict nor advise the jury of the necessity that there be eight hours of deliberation before that option was available. This was in accordance with Hunt v R [2011] NSWCCA 152. She also submitted that it was appropriate for his Honour to enquire of the foreperson whether any member of the jury needed further assistance which might be productive of agreement, and that if after further consultation and at the effluxion of eight hours such as to invoke the operation of s 55F, his Honour was then advised there was no prospect of the jury reaching agreement unanimously or by majority then his Honour could discharge the jury from returning a verdict.

23The trial advocate then volunteered the tentative view that it would be unfortunate to discharge the jury at 2pm when, after what had proved a lengthy trial on what was ultimately a narrow issue, it was a matter of less than two hours before a majority verdict direction could be given. She then submitted that it may be of some utility to inquire of the foreman whether the jury wished instead to return the following Tuesday to continue their deliberations. The appellant's counsel agreed that course should be adopted. That option had a logical and practical appeal in the open dialogue with the presiding judge, and was an approach entirely commensurate with the trial advocate's duties and obligations as the Crown to secure a verdict were that possible in the interests of justice and defence counsel's obligations to his client. That said, in circumstances where the jury had signalled they were ""deadlocked"" after almost five hours deliberation in a trial that had far exceeded the trial time estimate, the prospect of the jury electing to return the following week to deliberate further was slim. Moreover, without deft handing by the presiding judge to inform the foreman that the jury might have to return the following week if they did not sit on that afternoon, and for the foreman to have communicated that to the jury, carried a risk that passive pressure would be applied to the jury to compromise their verdict (and for those in the minority to fold to the views of the majority, contrary to their sworn oaths or affirmations) in particular when it was left to the foreman to be the conduit of his Honour's further suggestions and directions.

24On approach to 2pm and without any communication from the jury the transcript records the trial advocate handing to the trial judge a series of questions she submitted should be given to the jury for their consideration after his Honour had made his enquiries of the foreperson and, in the event that he was advised that the jury remained unable to agree, the jury required further instruction or assistance. Although the transcript records that the document was given to the Sheriff's officer to give to the jury at his Honour's direction after the foreman returned to the jury room after being examined in the terms set out in [27] following, because the document was not in the appeal book and was not otherwise available for tender, the extent to which it explained or clarified how the jury might approach their continuing deliberations is unknown. What is clear is that within what appears to be minutes of the document being sent into the jury room, and only minutes after the foreman left the witness box to consult with his fellow jurors, a verdict of guilty was announced. 

25Before setting out the foreman's evidence under questioning by the trial judge, I note that the trial advocate asked on two occasions that the foreman be sworn in the presence of the jury which his Honour declined to do. 

26Although s 56 of the Jury Act requires that one or more of the jurors actually be sworn in order for the trial judge to enquire into and to be satisfied of the matters of fact grounding the exercise of the discretion to discharge a jury under s 56, the section is silent as to whether that enquiry should be in the presence of the jury. This case exemplifies the inherent danger in a trial judge examining the foreperson in the absence of the jury for that purpose. On any view, in this case there was the pressure of time with the jury in deliberation on a Friday afternoon on the ninth day of the trial when at least some of the jurors had competing commitments that afternoon. This was in addition to what might be safely assumed to be an understandable reluctance on the part of the jury to embrace the prospect of returning the following Tuesday as the next full sitting day. These matters alone had the potential to deflect each juror from the task of considering whether the Crown had proved guilt beyond reasonable doubt and to bring about a compromise of the doubt at least some of them had as to the appellant's guilt in order to return a unanimous verdict. While the trial judge had the impression, as he expressed it, that the foreperson seemed to be ""on the ball"", that rather assumed that the foreman both understood the role he was being asked to perform as a conduit for his Honour's further directions and that he was an able and reliable communicator of them. 

27After the foreman was sworn there was the following exchange between his Honour and the foreman: 

""Q. I'll lead the first part from you. You are the foreperson on this jury?
A. Yes. 

Q. You have been deliberating now for one and a half plus - you've been deliberating now for six and a half hours, you went out - yes that's right?
A. Yes. 

Q. So one and a half - just give me - I'm just counting on my fingers sorry, yes, you've been deliberating for over six hours and I know that there are problems, I've been told that there are problems with three of the jurors for this afternoon, is that right?
A. Yes. 

Q. There's also problems I think with more of the jurors on Monday?
A. Correct. 

Q. And what I was going to ask you was do you think there would be any purpose - or do you think the jury would like to return on Tuesday of next week or not or do you think they would prefer not to return?
A. From what I can tell the jurors that aren't agreeing on the verdicts are quite certain in their decision and I don't believe that any amount of deliberation will change their mind. 

Q. No deliberation would change their mind?
A. In my opinion, no. 

Q. No I accept what you tell me because as I say you've been there for more than six hours all right. Do you think there's any assistance we can give you, any legal questions or factual questions you want to ask us or not or do you think you've considered it all and that's where you come to is that what you feel?
A. Not from me I'm - I could go and ask if you like. 

Q. Whether anybody would like further assistance? 
A. Yes. 

Q. To have something explained, all right, well what I might do is - you see what I'm getting at is this, sometimes a juror says well if we had some assistance or something we might come to a verdict, see what I mean?
A. Yes. 

Q. But if the jurors say no we don't need any more assistance we've made up our mind and we're quite certain, that's the issue. 
A. Yes. 

Q. Would you like to find out, see if they say we'd like more assistance then you'd have to work out when they want to come back?
A. Correct.

Q. If they say we'd like more assistance then you've got to agree upon - 
A. A time. 

Q. And I gather jurors have got problems Monday so - and if they say, if they say no further assistance will achieve nothing then I will discharge you, I'll release you?
A. Excellent, I will find out.""

28Although the trial judge identified for the foreman the options as he saw them at that time including, on one view, that the jury would be discharged from returning a verdict at all, which was, as I have emphasised, simply not available at that time under s 56 of the Jury Act because the jury had not been in deliberations for eight hours as provided for in s 55F, his Honour seems to have assumed that the foreman knew what was meant when, at the very end of the exchange, he said that if no further assistance was sought ""I will discharge you, I'll release you"", which he must be taken to have meant was for that afternoon. In circumstances where the option of continuing to deliberate, perhaps with some jurors taking up the offer of further assistance, had to be clearly communicated by the foreman and a poll taken and a time frame agreed upon for that to occur were some jurors in need of assistance, the foreperson also needed to be told, and for him to clearly understand that his Honour proposed only to ""discharge"" the jury for that purpose and to ""release"" them that afternoon but that they should not allow that to influence their verdict or invite any juror to compromise their consideration of whether the Crown had proved the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. What is also troubling is that despite the trial judge asking the foreman to advise him of the jury's response to the matters he asked be communicated, the foreman did not do so before the announcement of the jury's verdict at 2.20pm. 

29Were his Honour to have sworn the foreman and examined him in the presence of the jury, the risk of what I am satisfied was likely to be a miscommunication of what the law required of them as a jury at that point in their deliberations would have been averted. As I have noted, the document that was sent into the jury room might well have resolved any risk of a miscommunication of that kind but without knowing what it contained that cannot be gainsaid. For my part the document should not, in any event, have been sent into the jury room without the trial judge discussing its contents with the jury as a whole. 

30I would uphold the third ground of appeal. 

31I now turn to consider the second ground of appeal. 

32I have referred to Ms Wiseman's evidence above at [8]-[10]. During examination in chief Ms Wiseman referred to the appellant as ""a driver for this Chris lady"". The trial advocate asked Ms Wiseman, ""Who is this Chris lady?"". The witness did not answer the question. There was a short discussion in the absence of the jury in which his Honour queried the relevance of who Chris was to the issues in the trial, and the question was subsequently withdrawn. During that discussion the witness told his Honour that she did not want to answer the question because she did not want people to ""come after her"". Later, in the presence of the jury, Ms Wiseman gave the following answer in response to a question regarding where the appellant was living:

""Well as far as Julie tells me, he lives around the corner from Chris' house, he's always there, he's Chris' right hand man, he's always there with Chris you know. Like the occasions I've been there he's been around, like - like I said at the front gate he's been in the bedroom sitting there. Wherever Chris is, he's there, he drives Chris, he's got Chris' possessions, he's doing whatever for Chris you know.""

33A short way into cross-examination the following exchange took place:

""Q. So the statement can be returned your Honour, that was untrue what was in that statement?
A. Well at the time in my eyes no that was Chris related, drug related, Chris related, whatever you want to call it... 

...

Q. When you say Chris related?
A. Chris is a drug dealer. He was driving around for her. That's Chris's right hand man. He keeps everything with him at his house, you know what I'm saying.""

Shortly after that, Ms Wiseman said, not in response to any question:

""Why'd you come and see me with all the drugs on you for then Andy? With scales, and satchels and drugs on you, what for? I didn't have any money on me.""

34The appellant, through his counsel, then applied for the jury to be discharged on the basis that Ms Wiseman's answer raised the appellant's bad character by asserting that he was a drug dealer/courier for Chris. Counsel argued that the answer was not responsive to any question asked by him, and that the evidence was inadmissible and prejudicial. His Honour rejected the application but did not provide formal reasons for doing so. It is clear from the transcript, however, that his Honour was of the view that any risk that Ms Wiseman's evidence extracted above might unfairly prejudice the appellant could be cured by a direction that the jury should disregard Ms Wiseman's evidence in so far as it attributed to the appellant a criminal association with Chris. Counsel did not ask his Honour to direct the jury to disregard Ms Wiseman's answer at that time, doubtless to avoid highlighting that aspect of her evidence. 

35In summing up his Honour directed the jury to put out of their minds any possible prejudice to the appellant from his involvement, or Ms Wiseman's involvement, in what his Honour described as ""the drug scene"" or ""the drug culture"" and to focus on the events of 17 July 2011. As his Honour reminded the jury, the appellant had in any event given evidence that he was a drug user and that he owned a set of scales. 

36His Honour directed the jury, in accordance with s 165(1)(d) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), that Ms Wiseman's evidence generally may be unreliable, since she might reasonably have been supposed to be criminally concerned in the events of 17 July, and may have given evidence to shift the blame from herself and to the appellant. Counsel did not seek any further direction or redirection at the conclusion of his Honour's summing up. 

37In my view, the question asked by the appellant's counsel in cross-examination was brave, if not foolhardy, especially considering Ms Wiseman's previous answer which intimated that ""Chris related"" was synonymous with ""drug related"", and where counsel was on notice of that fact from Ms Wiseman's previous answer. It is well settled that, subject to some exceptions, parties are bound by the conduct of their counsel at trial (see Nudd v R [2006] HCA 9; (2006) 162 A Crim R 301 at [9]). 

38With regards to Ms Wiseman's further answer, also said to be ""unresponsive"", which referred to the appellant being in possession of ""scales, and satchels [sic] and drugs"", as I have noted, that was a matter already before the jury as part of the appellant's case. 

39I am not satisfied that his Honour's refusal to discharge the jury resulted in a miscarriage of justice and I dismiss the second ground of appeal. 

40BELLEW J: I agree with Fullerton J.

		31 May 2016",2014-05-12 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705108,DSJ v R; NS v R [2014] NSWCCA 77,"Judgment
1GLEESON JA:  The applicants seek leave to appeal against an order made by the trial judge (Hall J) on 3 May 2013, dismissing their notices of motion filed on 11 March 2011 which sought to have a number of charges in the indictment presented against them tried separately, and also sought a ruling that the Crown's coincidence evidence not be admitted at the trial of each of the charges in the indictment: R v DSJ; R v NS (No 3) [2013] NSWSC 471 (Judgment No 3) and DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWSC 409 (s 98 Judgment).
2The history of the motions is referred to in greater detail below.  It is relevant to the context of the present applications and the considerations bearing upon whether leave to appeal should be granted. 
3The foundation for the separate trials application is the assertion by the applicants that the trial is unmanageable on the current indictment of 20 counts (10 counts relating to each accused) because there is a real danger that the jury could be overwhelmed by the coincidence evidence (if admissible) and other evidence in the case, and this would involve great confusion and complication.  It was contended that the directions required to be given to the jury would necessarily be complex and long, and that there is a real risk that the applicants will be prejudiced in presenting their defence and putting the prosecution to proof, because of the onerous task of giving evidence and/or of meeting the voluminous and complex material.  Related to this application for separate trials is the assertion that the trial judge erred in his ruling on the admissibility of coincidence evidence under s 98 and s 101 of the Evidence Act 1995.
Leave is required 
4The application for leave to appeal is made pursuant to s 5F(3)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, which requires the applicants to obtain leave in order to appeal against an interlocutory order or judgment.  There is no dispute that leave is required.  The order dismissing the applications for separate trials is an interlocutory order.  This is so regardless of whether the refusal turns on a question of evidentiary admissibility: Saunders v R (1994) 72 A Crim R 347; R v Georgiou [1999] NSWCCA 125 at [19]; DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; 81 NSWLR 568 at [2], [76] and [125]. 
5The principles relating to the grant of leave are not in dispute.
6First, leave should not readily be granted, unless an appropriate case is made out showing an error of principle which is apt to cause an irregularity or an injustice: Queanbeyan City Council v Environment Protection Authority [2011] NSWCCA 108 at [25] per Whealy JA (Hall and McCallum JJ agreeing) citing R v Van Phu Ho (NSWCCA, 18 July 1994, Gleeson CJ, Mahoney JA, Dunford J, unreported).  
7Secondly, a significant factor in determining the grant of leave is that rulings on the admissibility of evidence are not interlocutory orders.  It is well established that s 5F is not available to review a decision as to the admissibility of evidence: R v Powch (1988) 14 NSWLR 136 at 137D-138B; R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 at 639F; DAO v R at [74].  This is a strong consideration against the grant of leave in respect of an order refusing separate trials, where a ruling on the admissibility of evidence is a central issue: DAO v R at [16] per Spigelman CJ, at [106] per Allsop P and at [208] per Simpson J (Kirby and Schmidt JJ agreeing).  
8The principal consideration which led this Court in DAO v R to grant leave to appeal against the decision refusing separate trials was the importance of the question concerning the correct approach to an appeal from a ruling on the admissibility of tendency evidence under s 97 of the Evidence Act: at [18] per Spigelman CJ; at [106] per Allsop P and at [209] per Simpson J (Kirby and Schmidt JJ agreeing).  Chief Justice Spigelman also considered it significant that the decision involved a pre-trial ruling of potentially critical significance as it fundamentally affected the structure of the proceedings.  
9Thirdly, in considering applications under s 5F, substance, and not mere form, should prevail: DAO v R at [75] per Allsop P.  Thus, although a complaint about the ruling on separate trials may be based on a question of evidentiary admissibility, that does not change the form and substance of the trial judge's refusal to make orders for separate trials.  Thus, if leave is to be given in this case, it is to be given in relation to orders 2 and 3 made on 3 May 2013, and not Order 1 made on that date in relation to the admissibility of the Crown's Coincidence Evidence (as defined). 
10Fourthly, one of the principal reasons for subjecting appeals from interlocutory orders in criminal cases to the requirement to obtain leave is to prevent or minimise the fragmentation of the process of criminal justice: R v Einfeld [2008] NSWCCA 215; 71 NSWLR 31 at [23].  
11Fifthly, an appeal from an interlocutory judgment on an application for separate trials, is subject to the degree of appellate restraint identified in House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504-505; see DAO v R at [70] per Spigelman CJ, [78] per Allsop P.  Such an order remains a matter of procedure and that brings it within the well-known rules of restraint from interference: Re Will of F B Gilbert (deceased) (1946) 46 SR (NSW) 318 at 323; Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Philip Morris Inc [1981] HCA 39; 148 CLR 170 at 177.
12Before considering the question of leave and the proposed grounds of appeal, it is necessary to refer to the background of the present applications.  
Background
13The applicants have been charged, on indictment, with insider trading offences under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act).  The first applicant, DSJ, is charged with 10 counts pursuant to s 1043A(1)(d) of the Act.  The second applicant, NS, is charged with 10 counts pursuant to s 1043A(1)(c) of the Act.  
14The charges against DSJ allege that he was an insider, that he possessed inside information, and that, contrary to the provisions of the Act, he procured NS to apply for, acquire, or dispose of relevant financial products, being shares or securities.  
15The charges against NS allege that he had possession of the insider information given to him by DSJ and that he intentionally acquired the financial products particularised in the indictment.  The products were either shares or contracts for difference in relation to seven listed companies.
16On 4 February 2011, each accused was arraigned before Latham J and pleaded not guilty to all counts.
Coincidence Notice
17The Crown seeks to lead coincidence evidence on the basis that the evidence pertaining to each individual count is admissible in respect of each other count.  The Crown served a Coincidence Notice under s 98 of the Evidence Act on 25 February 2011, giving notice that it intended to rely upon the evidence of the other charges as particularised in Table A, in relation to each charge, as well as the evidence of the facts particularised in Table B, relating to uncharged acts.  This notice stated that the evidence was to be adduced for the purpose of establishing that each of the accused did the acts alleged against him in the indictment and that each had the required state of mind, on the basis that, having regard to the similarity of the events, it was improbable that the events occurred coincidentally.  The Crown served an amended Coincidence Notice on 8 July 2011 (WB 644).
18The combined course of conduct, summarised in pp 5-9 of Table A of the amended Coincidence Notice (WB 648-652), was compartmentalised into seven ""events"" as follows:
(1)The receipt by Moody's of information from seven entities the subject of the charges, being ""inside information"".
(2)DSJ's direct receipt of inside information in some instances and indirect receipt of information in others.
(3)Telephone communications between DSJ and NS, by which means DSJ allegedly communicated the inside information to NS, thereby procuring NS to trade whilst in possession of the inside information. 
(4)NS's acquisition of the financial products in the seven entities whilst in possession of the inside information.
(5)The announcement made to the market of an event that pre-empted the transaction.
(6)NS's trading out of his position in the seven entities.
(7)DSJ's significant surveillance of the share price in the entities traded in by NS, usually on CommSec, throughout the material time.
19The purpose of the Coincidence Notice was stated to be as follows in respect of each applicant:
""[DSJ]
3.  The evidence of the two or more related events is to be tendered to prove that the accused [DSJ] did the particular acts alleged in each of counts 1-10 in the indictment, namely, that he procured [NS] to acquire the relevant Division 3 financial products identified in each count in the indictment.
4.  The evidence of the two or more related events is also to be tendered to prove that the accused [DSJ] had a particular state of mind, namely that at the time he procured [NS] to acquire the relevant Division 3 financial products identified in each of counts 1 -10 in the indictment, he acted intentionally and was in possession of the inside information as particularised in each of counts 1-10 in the Indictment.
[NS]
5.  The evidence of the two or more related events is to be tendered to prove that the accused [NS] did the particular acts alleged in each of counts 11-20 in the indictment, namely, that he acquired the relevant Division 3 financial products identified in each count in the indictment.
6.  The evidence of the two or more related events is also to be tendered to prove that the accused [NS] had a particular state of mind, namely that at the time he acquired the relevant Division 3 financial products identified in each of counts 11-20 in the indictment, he acted intentionally and was in possession of the inside information as particularised in each of counts 11-20 in the indictment.""
20Each accused filed a notice of motion on 11 March 2011 seeking , in effect, orders that the question of admissibility of the Crown's coincidence evidence be determined in advance of the trial, and that an order be made that it ought not to be admitted.  Further, an order was sought pursuant to s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, that the charges in the indictment (other than Charges 6-9 in respect of DSJ) be tried separately.
Judgment No 1
21The applications were originally heard by Hall J over five days in June and July 2011 and judgment was delivered on 17 August 2011: R v DSJ; R v NS [2011] NSWSC 894 (Judgment No 1).  His Honour ruled that the evidence particularised in Table A to the notice of coincidence evidence was admissible pursuant to s 98(1)(b) of the Evidence Act, but that the evidence particularised in Table B relating to the uncharged acts was not admissible under s 98(1)(b) of the Evidence Act.  On 23 August 2011 his Honour made an order dismissing the applications for separate trials, other than on Charges 6 - 9.
Leave application
22The applicants sought and obtained leave to appeal on 9 September 2011 against the decision of Hall J.  Leave was granted only on a limited basis - namely, on the trial judge's approach to the interpretation and application of s 98 and, to the extent that it flowed through, on his approach to the operation of s 101 of the Evidence Act: DSJ v R; NS v R [2011] NSWCCA 222 at [5] per Allsop P (Kirby and McCallum JJ agreeing) (Leave decision).  Leave was not granted in respect of the other matters complained of in the proposed grounds of appeal, which included the way in which the trial judge would deal with the issue of prejudice if the trials were not severed and the so-called circularity of reasoning in the Coincidence Notice: at [6] Leave decision.
23The refusal of this Court to grant leave to appeal in respect of the other matters is of some significance for the present applications.  First, the reference to the so-called circularity of reasoning in the Coincidence Notice, is a reference to ground 4 of DSJ's application for leave to appeal filed 23 August 2011 (WB 1023).  NS adopted this ground in his application for leave to appeal filed 24 August 2011 (WB 1027).  Ground 4 was in the following terms:
""His Honour erred in holding that the proposed use of the Table A evidence did not constitute circular reasoning."" (WB 1023)
24The written submissions of DSJ in support of the leave application dated 6 September 2011, advanced the complaint that (a) Table A of the Coincidence Notice relied on each event to prove both the ""act"" and ""state of mind"" on each charge in relation to each other charge; and (b) the events on each charge are relied on to prove each other event in the same charge.  It was argued by DSJ that this involved circular reasoning and to this extent the Coincidence Notice had no probative value at all, much less ""significant"" probative value (WB 1046-1047).  This submission was expanded upon at some length in the written submissions of DSJ, and supplemented by DSJ's written submissions in reply on that leave application (WB 1082-1083), which included:  
""For those counts where there is no evidence that [DSJ] received the information, BLD, AIHCA, RIN, and arguably SRG, the Crown seeks to establish each of items 2, 3 and 4 in Table A at AB 519 and 521-522 by reference to other counts where each of those elements is not the subject of direct evidence but merely of inference.  That is, that [DSJ] ""was told the effect of the inside information"", when there is no direct evidence that he did; that he communicated the inside information to [NS], when there is no direct evidence that he did; and that he procured [NS] to trade while in possession of the information, when there is no direct evidence that he did, and that the ""evidence"" supporting each such assertion can be used to prove each other assertion.  The impermissible circularity of such a process is manifest.""
25The complaint made by DSJ was that, in Judgment No 1, the trial judge had accepted the grouping of essentially dissimilar cases, by allowing cases where there was no evidence that DSJ had received inside information to be grouped with cases in which the Crown contended there was such evidence.  As already noted, this Court declined to grant leave in respect of this ground.
26Secondly, Ground 1 of DSJ's previous application asserted that the trial judge erred in declining to order separate trials.  The written submissions of DSJ in support of this ground advanced arguments on the issue of prejudice to the applicant, separate to the arguments based on the admissibility of the coincidence evidence.  This Court declined to grant leave to appeal in respect of that issue.
27Thirdly, Ground 5(b) of DSJ's previous application for leave asserted that the trial judge erred in concluding that any prejudice could be cured by directions.  Again, this Court declined to grant leave to appeal on that issue.  
28One of the relevant considerations raised by the present applications is the attempt by the applicants to re-agitate the same, or substantially similar, arguments in respect of which this Court has previously refused leave to appeal.
Appeal decision
29On 12 February 2012, this Court allowed the appeal, set aside the order made by Hall J on 23 August 2011, and referred the applicants' motions back to the trial judge for reconsideration in the light of this Court's rulings: DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9; 84 NSWLR 758 (the Appeal decision).
30The appeal in this Court was successful on the narrow point of whether the trial judge fell into error by rejecting altogether that, in determining the extent to which the evidence could be significant in establishing the facts in issue, regard should be had to an alternative explanation for the conduct said to have the capacity to point towards guilt.  That is, this Court found that the trial judge had erred in the method of evaluation of significant probative value when ruling on the admissibility of coincidence evidence.  Chief Justice Bathurst at [10] stated:
""[10]  However, as Whealy JA has pointed out (at [78]-[81]), the trial judge in forming a view as to whether the evidence has significant probative value must consider by reference to the evidence itself or other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party tendering it, whether there is a real possibility of an alternate explanation inconsistent with (in this case) the guilt of the party against whom it is tendered. This is because the availability of such an alternative hypothesis will be relevant to forming the view required by the section that the evidence has significant probative value. However, this does not involve either undertaking the fact-finding analysis suggested by senior counsel for DSJ or reaching a conclusion that the explanation for the coincidence proffered by the party seeking to tender the evidence was more probable than an alternative hypothesis. Each of these approaches go beyond what is required by the terms of s 98(1)(b) of the Act and would involve the judge usurping the fact-finding role of the jury.""
31It is also appropriate to refer to the observations of Whealy JA as follows:
""[79]  In a practical sense, there are two avenues of approach to be taken. First, in examining the coincidence evidence (together with other material already in evidence or to be adduced) the trial Judge is required to ask whether there emerges, from a consideration of all the Crown evidence, a possible explanation inconsistent with guilt. For regard to be had to the alternative explanation, it must be a real possibility, not a fanciful one. It must be a broad or overarching possibility, capable of being stated in general terms, even though it may derive from an individual piece or pieces of evidence or the evidence taken as a whole.
[80]  Secondly, the trial Judge must ask whether that possibility substantially alters his (or her) view as to the otherwise significant capacity of the coincidence evidence to establish the fact or facts in issue. Of course, if the trial Judge has already concluded that the coincidence evidence does not reach that level of significance in terms of its capacity, he will have rejected the evidence in terms of s 98. In that situation, the possibility of an alternative inference may, for the time being, be set to one side. Later in the trial, when the evidence has concluded, that possibility will become a matter for the jury to assess and determine when it comes to consider whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.
[81]  The Crown, in making its concession, however, stressed that at no stage in this process was the trial Judge required or entitled to assess the actual weight of any part of the evidence, or to make any actual assessment concerning the probabilities of any alternative theory. Nor was the trial judge required or entitled to make a comparison of the Crown theory and the probabilities of any alternative theory. This proposition appears consistent with established authority. Any attempt by the trial Judge to anticipate the actual weight the jury would attach to the evidence is prohibited, as I have explained.
32Later in his judgment, Whealy JA, having emphasised at [131] that it is not for the trial judge to weigh and assess the alternative explanation, as a jury would do, nor to examine and weigh parts of the evidence only in isolation from the whole body of evidence, stated:
""[132]  However, in the present matter, the trial Judge was required to ask himself whether, for example, the possibility that NS had been ""tipped off"" about the corporate entities without receiving inside information might otherwise substantially alter the capacity for cogency he thought the coincidence evidence possessed. Similarly, in the case of DSJ, his Honour was required to ask whether, for example, this mass of phone calls and other communications between the two men might mean no more than that they were engaging in social and recreational communications, without reference to stock market trading. If that were a possibility, did it substantially alter his view as to the otherwise significant capacity of the Crown evidence to establish the facts in issue. He had to ask whether the fact that Moody's had information about a vast number of corporate entities, and that, in some cases, there was no direct evidence that DSJ had acquired inside information, substantially altered the high cogency of the coincidence evidence, as he saw it, to prove the facts in issue. In each case, did the possibility deprive the coincidence evidence, taken with the other evidence, of its capacity to prove significantly the Crown case? His Honour, in considering these alternative inferences, may well have taken the view that none of these possibilities had the capacity to diminish the otherwise strong probative value of the Crown evidence. However, in my opinion, they had to be recognised and taken into account in the limited manner I have suggested, and it was an error not to do so.""
33The prospect that the trial judge, upon reconsideration, would reach the same conclusion so far as concerned the capacity of the evidence to meet the s 98 threshold, was adverted to by Whealy JA at [33].  
Section 98 Judgment
34The trial judge heard argument on reconsideration of the coincidence evidence on 12 April 2012, and delivered the s 98 Judgment on 18 May 2012.  His Honour confirmed the order he had previously made to the effect that the coincidence evidence is admissible pursuant to s 98 of the Evidence Act.
35However, the trial judge stated at [134]:
""I have considered the application of s 101 of the Evidence Act to the facts of this case.  Given the number of Counts to be tried in the one trial and having regard to the submissions that have been made on behalf of both accused to which I have referred as to 'prejudice' arising from a joint hearing I consider that it is prudent to further inquire into the way in which the Crown intenders [sic] to proceed at hearing, so that I will be in a fully informed position to evaluate submissions that have been made on behalf of each accused.  It is my intention, following a further hearing on that matter, to then make a ruling as to whether the coincidence evidence can be used in accordance with the provisions of s 101 of the Evidence Act.""
Judgment No 3
36Following a further hearing on 2 July 2012, the trial judge delivered Judgment No 3 on 3 May 2013.  This concerned the issue as to whether the restrictions imposed by s 101 of the Evidence Act apply in these proceedings.
37The trial judge set out his conclusions in Judgment No 3 as follows:
""[293]  Upon consideration of the evidence and submissions I have concluded that:
(1)  The coincidence evidence, described in Table A to the ""Notice of Coincidence Evidence"", in my opinion:
(a)  does have significant probative value;
(b)  substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused.
(2)  The probative value of the coincidence evidence is supplemented and reinforced by other evidence in the Crown's circumstantial evidence case.
(3)  There is, accordingly, a connection between the counts on the indictment with evidence on one individual count being properly cross-admissible on the trial of each other count.
(4)  There is no proper basis for separating the counts on the indictment. To separate the counts into three groups as proposed by the accused would, in my opinion, be inappropriate as a matter of principle once the issue of cross-admissibility of the coincidence evidence has been determined in favour of the Crown. The proper use of coincidence evidence and protection against its misuse can be achieved by appropriate trial directions.
(5)  There is no proper basis for a conclusion that either accused may be prejudiced or embarrassed in their defence by reason of being charged with the offences set out in the indictment. The capacity of trial directions to ensure proper use of evidence as discussed above is a material consideration in relation to the order sought under s21(2). There is no other reason within s21(2)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act, in my opinion, that would justify the making of an order under s 21 of that Act.""
38The formal orders made by the trial judge in relation to the applicants' notices of motion were:
""(1)  Pursuant to s 192A of the Evidence Act 1995, the question of the admissibility of the Crown's Coincidence Evidence be determined in advance of the trial.
(2)  The Notice of Motion filed on behalf of DSJ on 11 March 2011 is otherwise dismissed.
(3)  The Notice of Motion filed on behalf of NS on 11 March 2011 is otherwise dismissed.""
39It is necessary to refer also to two further judgments which the trial judge delivered at the same time as Judgment No 3 on 3 May 2013.  Both concerned rulings on evidence.
Judgment No 4
40The first concerned a ruling which the Crown had sought on the admissibility of evidence described as the ""uncharged acts"".  This expression referred to trading that occurred in relation to three companies, identified as ""PBL"", ""DOW"" and ""APA"".  The evidence of the uncharged acts had been previously ruled not admissible by the trial judge as coincidence evidence under s 98 of the Evidence Act in Judgment No 1 at [256] to [276] delivered on 17 August 2011.
41On the question of whether the evidence of the uncharged acts was admissible on another basis, the trial judge made the following rulings: R v DSJ; R v NS (No 4) [2013] NSWSC 472 (Judgment No 4):
(1)the evidence in relation to PBL is not admissible under s 55 of the Evidence Act;
(2)the evidence in relation to APA and DOW is admissible under s 55 of the Evidence Act as to relationship/joint or mutual interest of the accused in financial products.
Judgment No 5
42Also on 3 May 2013, the trial judge ruled on the admissibility of evidence in relation to three other matters:
(1)the acquisition and disposal of shares in Aditya Birla (ABY);
(2)the payment of an amount of $30,000 from DSJ to NS; and
(3)the provision by Damien Elias to DSJ of Alinta documents.
43The trial judge made the following rulings: R v DSJ; R v NS (No 5) [2013] NSWSC 473 (Judgment No 5):
(1)the evidence in relation to the acquisition and disposal of shares in Aditya Birla is admissible under s 55, Evidence Act 1995 on the relationship/joint or mutual interest of or between the accused in financial products;
(2)the payment of the amount of $30,000 from [DSJ] to [NS] is admissible against [DSJ] and [NS] under s 55, Evidence Act 1995 as to the issues of possession, communication, and procurement in relation to Counts 5 and 15 (AIHCA);
(3)the email exchange between Mr Elias and [DSJ] on 15 November 2006 and the provision by Mr Elias to [DSJ] of Alinta documents prior to [NS's] s 19 examination is not admissible against [DSJ] or [NS] under s 55, Evidence Act 1995.
Evidence Act provisions
44It is appropriate to refer to the relevant provisions of the Evidence Act which the present applications concern.  Section 98 of the Evidence Act, so far as material to the present applications, provides:
""98.  The coincidence rule
(1)  Evidence that 2 or more events occurred is not admissible to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind on the basis that, having regard to any similarities in the events or the circumstances in which they occurred, or any similarities in both the events and the circumstances in which they occurred, it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally unless:
(a)  the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and
(b)  the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.
(2)  Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if:
(a)  the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or
(b)  the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by another party.""
45The expression ""probative value"" is defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act as follows:
""Probative value of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.""
46""Significant"" means ""important"" or ""of consequence"": R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457; R v Lock (1997) 91 A Crim R 356; DAO v R at [149]. 
47As noted by the trial judge, coincidence evidence is evidence that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose of establishing that, because of the improbability of two or more related events occurring coincidentally, the person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind: [13] Judgment No 3. 
48Next it is necessary to refer to s 101 of the Evidence Act which imposes restrictions on tendency and coincidence evidence.  It provides:
""101  Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution
(1)  This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.
(2)  Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.
(3)  ...
(4)  This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant.""
49""Prejudicial effect"" is a reference to the evidence being used against an accused for a purpose other than that for which it is admitted: DAO v R at [150].
50The trial judge recorded that the Crown sought to rely upon coincidence evidence in order to submit to the jury that it was improbable that the ""events"" referred to in the Coincidence Notice had ""occurred coincidentally"" and to thereby meet a defence based on coincidence.  In addition, such evidence if admitted, would permit the Crown to have evidence in each count available for use on each of the other counts: [16] Judgment No 3.
51The trial judge noted that the test under s 101(2) required that the probative value of the evidence must ""substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused"": [17] Judgment No 3.
52The trial judge also noted that, as stated by Spigelman CJ in R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319; 58 NSWLR 700 at 718 [94]-[95], the balancing exercise can only be conducted on the facts of each case -  it requires the Court to make a judgment, rather than to exercise a discretion -  and consideration is to be given to the actual prejudice in the specific case, which the probative value of the evidence must substantially outweigh: [18]-[19] Judgment No 3.
Application by DSJ
Grounds 1 and 2
53Grounds 1 and 2 of the proposed appeal by DSJ assert that the trial judge erred in declining to order separate trials, and in failing to properly construe and apply s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
54The written submissions of DSJ acknowledged that the decision not to order separate trials was predicated on the trial judge's ruling on the admissibility of coincidence evidence.  Underpinning these grounds were two contentions.  The first was that there had been a failure by the trial judge to ""properly assess the proper use of coincidence evidence"".  This contention relied upon the acceptance of Grounds 3 and 4 of the proposed appeal.  Assuming acceptance of error as asserted in these grounds, it was argued that this meant that the prejudice suffered by DSJ had not been properly identified or assessed by the trial judge.  That asserted prejudice was relevant to the decision of whether to order separate trials.  
55I have concluded below that leave to appeal should not be granted in relation to proposed Grounds 3 and 4.  Accordingly, the premise of this part of DSJ's complaint is not established.
56The second contention of DSJ was that the trial judge had erroneously confined his consideration of whether to sever the charges to the question of whether the coincidence evidence was admissible, and had ignored a consideration of the evidence which was the subject of the rulings in Judgments No 4 and No 5.  It was contended that it was oppressive for DSJ to meet such a complex and lengthy case at trial, and that the trials should have been separated due to the prejudice and embarrassment to his defence that would result.
57At this point the following provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act should be noted.  Section 21(2) provides:
""If of the opinion:
(a)  that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or
(b)  that for any reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment,
the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment.""
58Section 29(1) and (3) provide:
""(1)  A court may hear and determine together proceedings related to 2 or more offences alleged to have been committed by the same accused person in any of the following circumstances:
(a)  the accused person and the prosecutor consent,
(b)  the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances,
(c)  the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character.
...
(3)  Proceedings related to 2 or more offences or 2 or more accused persons may not be heard together if the court is of the opinion that the matters ought to be heard and determined separately in the interests of justice.""
Risk of prejudice
59In support of this second contention, DSJ submitted that the trial judge either failed to take into account, or gave insufficient weight to, the following matters when assessing the risk of prejudice that would arise if the counts were not severed:
(1)The impossibility for the jury of separating out the evidence relating to one charge from evidence relating to another, given the complexity and multiplicity of the transactions.  It was contended that the trial as currently framed would place an enormous strain on the jury and the trial is unmanageable on the current indictment.
(2)There is a real danger that the jury could be overwhelmed by the coincidence evidence and the other evidence and ignore features of the evidence that indicate DSJ's innocence or gaps in the Crown case.
(3)Admission of the occurrence of the 10 counts in addition to three further uncharged acts in a single trial before a single jury would involve great confusion and complication, particularly given the number of witnesses proposed to be called and the number of documents proposed to be tendered.
(4)The directions required to be given to the jury would be necessarily complex and too long.
(5)The Crown proposes to run 20 trials simultaneously.
(6)The proposed Crown case, on each case, is wholly circumstantial and gives rise to the difficulty of drafting appropriate and adequate directions to the jury.
(7)The characterisation of the Crown case as a single circumstantial case or a ""single enterprise"", as accepted by the trial judge in the s 98 Judgment and Judgments No 4 and No 5, further complicates the task of drafting appropriate directions.
(8)There is a real risk that DSJ will be prejudiced in presenting his defence and putting the prosecution to proof.  This is said to arise from the onerous task of giving evidence and/or meeting voluminous and complex material.
60The Crown's response was that the trial judge did not fail to either take into account, or give sufficient weight to, any of the eight matters listed above. 
61The order made not to separate the trials is a procedural question involving a true discretion: DAO v R at [70] per Spigelman CJ, [77] per Allsop P.  As already noted, the grounds of appellate review (if leave has been granted) are governed by House v R at 504-505.  This requires that error must be shown in exercising the discretion: acting on a wrong principle; allowing extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the decision-maker; mistaking the relevant facts; failing to take into account some material consideration; or, in circumstances where no specific error of such kind can be demonstrated, where the result is, upon the facts, unreasonable or plainly unjust such that it can be inferred that there has been some error or miscarriage in the exercise of the power: DAO v R at [78] per Allsop P.
62Dealing with each of the eight listed matters in turn.
63First, it cannot be doubted that the trial judge considered the contentions advanced by DSJ that it was impossible for the jury to separate out the evidence relating to each count, given the complexity and multiplicity of the transactions; that the trial would place an enormous strain on the jury; and that the trial is unmanageable on the current indictment.  These arguments were recorded by the trial judge at [81], [102] and [287]-[292] Judgment No 3.  At [289], the trial judge rejected these contentions stating:
""The acts and matters associated with transacting financial products are not in themselves unduly complex.  They are everyday transactions and are not in the nature of complex commercial transactions requiring evidence of detailed contractual and other documents and dealings between contracting parties over time.""
64At [291], the trial judge referred to the use of case management directions to devise methods to assist the jury in dealing with voluminous primary records wherever possible.  
65Further, at [292], the trial judge, having noted that management of the trial process will clearly be challenging, went on to state that he did not accept that the trial directions cannot achieve the purpose for which they are given - amongst other things to ensuring that the jury understand the nature and permissible use of the evidence.
66The trial judge considered the complexity/unmanageable trial contention in the context of the charges which were the subject of the indictment.  In weighing this contention, his Honour took into account the availability of case management directions for dealing with voluminous primary records, and the ability of trial directions to ensure that the jury understands the nature and permissible use of the evidence.  
67Secondly, as to the asserted danger that the jury could be ""overwhelmed"" by the coincidence evidence and ignore other relevant evidence, the trial judge recorded these contentions at [78] and [97] Judgment No 3.  His Honour considered that this complaint would be met by the jury directions proposed at [281]-[285] Judgment No 3.  
68Thirdly, as to the assertion that the 10 counts, together with the three further uncharged acts, would involve great confusion and complication for the jury, particularly given the number of witnesses proposed to be called and the number of documents proposed to be tendered, this matter was essentially a variant of the first two matters.  The trial judge considered these matters.  At [290] Judgment No 3, his Honour noted that there will be both a considerable number of witnesses and a considerable number of documents relating to each count.  The Crown told this Court that the trial judge was informed that there was some 27 witnesses to be called by the Crown and that, as a result of case management, the documents relating to each particular count were to be collated in a helpful and straightforward matter.  
69As already noted, the primary judge took into account the use of case management directions to deal with voluminous primary records: at [291] and that trial directions would achieve the purpose for which they were given: at [292] Judgment No 3.  There is no substance in the complaint that the trial judge failed to take into account the confusion/complication contention.  
70Fourthly, as to the contention that the jury directions would be necessarily complex and too long, the trial judge addressed this issue when he set out in some detail what would be the requirement to give directions in relation to (a) the joint trials, (b) the elements of the offences, (c) the use of coincidence evidence, and (d) the distinction to be made between that evidence and other evidence which was admitted as ""relationship evidence"": at [268]-[285] Judgment No 3.  The trial judge did not fail to take this contention into account.  
71Fifthly, as to the contention that the Crown proposes to run 20 trials simultaneously, again this is a variant of the first and second matters.  It cannot be seriously suggested that the trial judge did not take into account this factor: see [274] and [284]-[285] Judgment No 3.  
72Sixthly, as to the contention concerning the difficulty of drafting appropriate and adequate directions to the jury, this matter has already been taken into account under the second and fourth matters.  The trial judge recorded this contention in a number of parts of Judgment No 3 including at [75], [79], [82]-[83], [93] and [104]-[109].  As already noted, the trial judge considered that this complaint would be addressed by the directions proposed at [274], [283] and [284]-[285] Judgment No 3.  
73Seventhly, as to the asserted further complication in drafting appropriate jury directions in light of DSJ's characterisation of the Crown case as a single circumstantial case or a ""single enterprise"" case, the trial judge dealt with the nature of the Crown case in [127]-[131] of the Section 98 Judgment.  His Honour proceeded upon the basis that the Crown's case seeks to rely upon both facts from which other facts relevant to the facts in issue may be inferred, and additionally to rely upon coincidence evidence to strengthen its case in that respect: at [130] Section 98 Judgment.  The trial judge was undoubtedly aware of the nature of the Crown case when considering the prejudicial effect of the coincidence evidence.
74Eighthly, as to the asserted real risk that DSJ will be prejudiced in presenting his defence and putting the prosecution to proof, given the onerous task of giving evidence and/or meeting voluminous and complex material, the trial judge took this contention into account at [99]-[103] and [188]-[189] Judgment No 3.  
Section 21(2) Criminal Procedure Act
75The next group of arguments of DSJ contended that the trial judge erred in failing to properly construe and apply s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act.  
76The trial judge considered the s 21 issue at [195]-[201] and found at [293] Judgment No 3, that there was no proper basis for a conclusion that either accused may be prejudiced or embarrassed in their defence by reason of being charged with the offences set out in the indictment.  The trial judge reasoned that the capacity of trial directions to ensure proper use of evidence was a material consideration, and no other reason within s 21(2)(b) would justify the making of an order under s 21 severing the counts. 
77The submissions of DSJ, which challenged this finding, relied upon the following propositions:
(1)The trial judge erroneously confined his consideration as to whether to sever the charges to the question of whether the coincidence was admissible.
(2)The trial judge's reference at [198] Judgment No 3 to Ludlow v Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1971] AC 29, disclosed error because the approach in Ludlow not to order separate trials turned on whether some ""special feature"" would make a joint trial prejudicial or embarrassing to the accused, which has not been followed in Australia: Verma v R (1987) 30 A Crim R 441 at 444, applying Sutton v R [1984] HCA 5; 152 CLR 528 at 541-2 and De Jesus v R [1986] HCA 65; 68 ALR 1.
(3)The admissibility of coincidence evidence was not determinative of the question as to whether the counts in the indictment should be severed.
(4)A relevant consideration on whether to order separate trials, in the present case, was the rulings on the admissibility of uncharged acts as ""relationship evidence"" and payment of $30,000 by DSJ to NS on the issues of possession, communication and procurement (being the subject of Judgments No 4 and No 5).
78As to each of these matters, it is to be observed as follows.
Whether trial judge confined his consideration
79First, contrary to the contention of DSJ, the trial judge did not confine his consideration to whether the coincidence evidence was admissible, nor did he ignore the separate submissions made on behalf of DSJ concerning the considerations relevant to whether to sever the charges.  
80At [199]-[200] Judgment No 3, the trial judge recorded the submissions advanced on behalf of NS.  These were to the effect that whether it is desirable to direct separate trials was to be determined by the admissibility of the evidence going to each count in the trial for the other counts and vice versa.  However, at [195] the trial judge noted that the focus of the parties' submissions on the s 21 issue also included the possible use or misuse of such evidence, and the issue of ""prejudicial effect"" under s 101 for the purpose of the balancing test under that section.  This reflected the separate submissions advanced by DSJ in written submissions dated 30 March 2012, to the effect that the trial is unmanageable on the current indictment, and that, at the very least, counts, 4, 5, and 10 should be tried separately, or alternatively, the Court would need to consider whether or not to sever count 1 and/or counts 6-9 (WB 857).  
81In further written submissions dated 18 June 2012, it was contended by DSJ that even if the coincidence evidence was properly admissible, the potential for prejudice was large in the context of a trial with complex charges and diverse evidence on a wide-range of counts.  The trial judge was undoubtedly aware of and considered these submissions.  At [267] Judgment No 3, his Honour referred to submissions on behalf of each accused concerning the complexity of the matters that will arise for determination on each count, and on all counts, if heard together.  At [286]-[293], under the heading ""Prejudicial effect: complexity and related issues"", his Honour considered the issue of complexity raised in the written submissions of DSJ.  The trial judge did not confine his considerations in the manner asserted by DSJ.  
Construction of s 21
82Secondly, notwithstanding the trial judge's reference to Ludlow, his Honour did not himself use the expression ""special feature"", or apply such a requirement to the question of whether to order separate trials.  Nor did his Honour adopt an erroneous approach at [198] Judgment No 3, where he stated, unexceptionally in my view:
""Different offences, [sic] may be contained in the one indictment if there is some connection between the crimes alleged.  This will be so if the evidence of one is admissible on the trial of the other.""
83The trial judge did not err in his construction of s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act.
Proper approach
84Thirdly, as to the contention concerning the significance attached by the trial judge to the inadmissibility of the coincidence evidence in determining whether to order separate trials, undoubtedly this was an important factor in determining the s 21 issue.  However, contrary to the assertions of DSJ, the trial judge also took into account the other considerations raised by DSJ which have been referred to above, including the arguments concerning the complexity of the trial, the strain on the jury, whether the jury directions would achieve their purpose, and the potential prejudice or embarrassment to the accused in their defence: at [247] and [286]-[292] Judgment No 3.
Significance of other evidence
85Fourthly, the absence of a reference by the trial judge to his rulings in Judgments No 4 and No 5, does not establish that his Honour failed to take into account the factual evidence relating to uncharged acts (APA, DOW and ABY) and the payment of $30,000 by DSJ to NS was part of the Crown's case, when considering the question of severance.  
86In this regard, the history of the Crown's intention to rely on this evidence, of which the trial judge was no doubt aware, is relevant.  The trial judge had previously considered and ruled that the evidence of the uncharged acts was not admissible as coincidence evidence: [261], [267] and [276] Judgment No 1.  After delivering the s 98 Judgment, his Honour received further written submissions and heard further argument about the admissibility of this evidence prior to delivering Judgment No 3.  Separate judgments were delivered on 3 May 2013 in relation to the s 101 issue, the admissibility of the uncharged acts, and the evidence relating to ABY and the $30,000: Judgments No 3, No 4 and No 5.  
87Undoubtedly, his Honour was cognisant of the factual matters relating to the evidence which were the subject of Judgments No 4 and No 5, when delivering Judgment No 3.  The fact that the evidence referred to in Judgments No 4 and No 5 was not expressly referred to in Judgment No 3 does not, in my view, establish a failure by his Honour to take into account this evidence, which his Honour had ruled admissible, for the purposes of the s 21 issue.
88I would not grant leave in respect of Grounds 1 and 2.
Grounds 3 and 4
89Grounds 3 and 4 of the proposed appeal contend that the trial judge erred in failing to properly construe and apply s 98 and s 101 of the Evidence Act, and erred in determining that the evidence of each count in the indictment is admissible in relation to each of the other counts.
Events/acts and states of mind complaint
90The first contention of DSJ was that the ""events"" identified in the Coincidence Notice are not really ""events"" for the purposes of s 98, but are the acts and states of mind the Crown is trying to prove.  It was asserted that this misconception underlies the Coincidence Notice.  It was argued that it is meaningless to identify, as ""events"" possession by DSJ of the particularised information when that is the fact in issue to be established.  Likewise it was argued that it is meaningless to identify, as an event, procuring by communicating ""the inside information"" when that is the high level intermediate (if not ultimate) fact sought to be established against both DSJ and NS. 
91The submissions of DSJ contended that the coincidence evidence should be approached from a different perspective.  This was referred to before the trial judge and on this application as ""the skeleton"".  The ""skeleton"" is set out in the s 98 Judgment at [41].  The so-called ""skeleton"" adopted a narrow perspective of the related ""events"", as consisting in (a) the receipt of certain information (not the ""particularised information"" by Moody's), (b) evidence of contact between DSJ and NS, and (c) purchase by NS of securities.  
92It was submitted by DSJ that correct identification of the events in the s 98 notice is critical because it is from this base that the Court, and ultimately a jury, can work out what are the ""acts"" and ""states of mind"" that can be inferred from such established ""events"".  
93The Crown argued that the complaint by DSJ that the ""events"" identified in the coincidence notice are not really ""events"" for the purposes of s 98, but are the acts and states of mind the Crown is trying to prove, is an attempt to re-argue Ground 4 of DSJ's earlier (unsuccessful) application for leave to appeal dated 23 August 2011.  The arguments advanced in DSJ's written submissions on that occasion (WB 1046-1050) described the complaint in relation to the Coincidence Notice in terms of circularity of reasoning.  
94Insofar as the circular reasoning argument was sought to be re-agitated on the present application, the position has not changed since the earlier Leave decision, which refused leave to appeal on this issue.  Similarly, I am not persuaded that his Honour's reasons on reconsideration were attended with any doubt worthy of the grant of leave.  
Impermissible inferences complaint
95A second argument advanced by DSJ was that whilst an inference must be capable of being drawn from the ""events"" that support it, the Coincidence Notice in this case invites, and is built on, the drawing of impermissible inferences, and that the trial judge erred in adopting this reasoning.  
96The trial judge recorded this argument at [40]-[43] and [51]-[54] Judgment No 3.  His Honour observed at [56] that the proposition was advanced that coincidence evidence lacked probative value by reason of the fact that it would involve, at least on several counts, inferred facts and inferential reasoning.  His Honour noted that this argument had not been previously advanced on the initial s 98 hearing, nor apparently before this Court on the Appeal decision.
97At [57] and [59], his Honour noted that a similar line of argument had been advanced on behalf of NS on the reconsideration of the s 98 issue and again on the s 101 issue.  The trial judge addressed the arguments of DSJ that the coincidence evidence lacked probative capacity or value in relation to those counts where the alleged inside information comprised, in part, information as to facts that DSJ may or must have inferred: at [248]-[260] Judgment No 3.  His Honour rejected the contention of DSJ that a distinction was to be drawn between those counts where there is direct evidence of possession of inside information and those where the Crown relies upon indirect evidence of possession, as a reason why one group of counts cannot or may not be cross-admissible in relation to counts in the other ground: at [262] Judgment No 3.  
98At [263] Judgment No 3, his Honour stated that the fact of possession and communication of inside information can be established indirectly through circumstantial evidence.  The submission of DSJ in reply that the trial judge meant ""coincidence evidence"" when he used the expression ""circumstantial evidence"" should not be accepted.  His Honour went on to observe that it was not the mode of proof that was in issue, but rather the strength of the evidence sought to be led as coincidence evidence.  His Honour further observed that indirect evidence could have as much probative force as direct evidence in proof of a fact, including facts as to possession and communication for the purposes of the present case. 
99I am not persuaded that his Honour's reasons were attended with any doubt worthy of the grant of leave.
Other complaints
100It was contended that the trial judge was in error in distinguishing R v Gale; R v Duckworth [2012] NSWCCA 174; 217 A Crim R 487 in Judgment No 3 at [122], on the basis of a distinction between ""similarities"" particularised in the Coincidence Notice and ""asserted similarities"" in R v Gale; R v Duckworth.  A similar contention was raised by NS under Ground 5 of his proposed appeal.  
101The trial judge dealt with R v Gale; R v Duckworth under a separate subheading at [115]-[122] Judgment No 3.  After summarising the facts of that case, his Honour said, in reference to the reasons of Simpson J in R v Gale; R v Duckworth:
""[120] Simpson J stated:
'37 Some of the asserted similarities expose a serious logical fallacy in the argument. The presence of Gale in the Nimbin Hotel, the (criminal) involvement of an 'insider' at the Nimbin Hotel, the involvement of ex police officers (ie Duckworth and Gale) in each event, and involvement of multiple offenders at the Nimbin Hotel event are all, far from being established similarities (or similarities capable of being established), the very facts that the DPP seeks to prove by the coincidence evidence.'
[121] Underlying these observations was the fact that the matters in the Tendency and Coincidence Notice as to Gale and Duckworth were not 'facts'. They were mere assertions and were not in truth 'similarities' within the meaning of s 98. The assertions assumed the presence of Duckworth and Gale at the Nimbin event when that was a matter to be proved by other evidence and could not be assumed to be 'facts' or 'similarities' for the purposes of s 98.
[122] The position in the present proceedings is that the Crown relies upon identified 'similarities' as to discrete or particular facts as detailed in the Coincidence Notice. They are not in the nature of 'asserted similarities' based on assumptions as to facts as in Gale; Duckworth.""
102The Crown's response to DSJ's contention was that it seeks to prove the matter in issue by reliance upon all of the circumstantial evidence internal to a particular count together with evidence in relation to other counts, including the similarities revealed by reference to the evidence relating directly to other counts.  It was submitted that there are no assumptions in this case, such as those that were sought to be relied upon in R v Gale; R v Duckworth.  In particular, it was submitted that it is not assumed that DSJ was in possession of the particularised information.  
103As explained by Simpson J in R v Gale; R v Duckworth at [25], the purpose sought to be achieved by the tender of coincidence evidence is to provide the foundation upon which the tribunal of fact could draw an inference.  The inference is that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind.  At [26], Simpson J emphasised that what is important to recognise is that the process of reasoning and the drawing of the inferences - that the person did the act or had the state of mind - is for the tribunal of fact.  Her Honour went on:
""Part of that process involves findings of fact.  Did the two (or more) events occur?  Were there relevant similarities?  Where the party tendering the evidence relies upon a number of asserted similarities, the tribunal of fact must identify which, if any, of those similarities have been established.  Before asking itself the penultimate question - is it improbable that the two events occurred coincidentally? - it must discard any asserted similarities not established.""
104The trial judge considered and rejected the contention of DSJ that the matters stated in the Coincidence Notice were mere assertions: at [122] Judgment No 3.  I do not consider that his Honour's reasons were attended with any doubt worthy of the grant of leave.
105It was also contended that the trial judge erred in using the terms ""information"", ""confidential information"" and ""inside information"" interchangeably; for example, at [246](3) Judgment No 3, when referring to the common thread running through all 10 acquisitions - ""that all related to financial products in or concerning entities the subject of confidential information (being inside information) provided to Moody's"".  I do not consider that the trial judge conflated confidential information with inside information.  
106In the example just referred to, the information provided to Moody's by various entities referred to as Moody's Credits, was provided in confidence.  Of course there may be a difference between ""confidential information"" and ""inside information"" for the purposes of s 1043A of the Corporations Act.  His Honour's reference at [246](3) Judgment No 3, should not be taken as suggesting otherwise.  Similarly, his Honour's use of the term ""confidential information"" in [263] Judgment No 3, is not to be read as something different from the reference to ""inside information"" in the first sentence of that paragraph.  His Honour's reference to ""inside information"" is to be taken as a reference to the particularised information relied upon by the Crown in Table A of the Coincidence Notice.  
107It was further contended that the trial judge erred in rejecting the distinction between information actually received by Moody's and the information said to be possessed by DSJ, by relying upon the potential operation of s 1042A of the Corporations Act in relation to the expansive definition of ""information"".  ""Information"", as defined, may include matters of supposition and matters relating to the intentions or likely intentions, of a person.  
108The Crown submitted that his Honour's reference to s 1042A was unexceptionable as it is to be read in the context of the directions to the jury which were referred to by his Honour at [285](iii)-(iv) Judgment No 3.  In oral argument (AT, tcpt 12, lines 22-27) his Honour's reference to directions to the jury was criticised by DSJ as having nothing to do with the present case.  Whether that contention by DSJ is correct or not, it does not demonstrate any doubt in his Honour's reasons on the separate trials application which is worthy of the grant of leave.  Argument about the appropriateness or otherwise of any direction to the jury arising from s 1042A of the Corporations Act is a matter for determination at the trial.  Neither does the separate complaint by DSJ that the trial judge relied upon a matter which had not been raised by the parties warrant a grant of leave.  It is otherwise unnecessary to express any view in respect of the trial judge's reference to s 1042A of the Corporations Act.
Section 98 Judgment 
109The submissions of DSJ also complained of two matters arising from the s 98 Judgment.  The first matter was that his Honour had proceeded on the basis that the Crown case involved the notion of a continuing joint venture in share trading.  This was characterised by DSJ as an allegation of a joint criminal venture in share trading and the complaint made was that this had never been particularised and was not open to the Crown.  It was contended by DSJ that subsequent submissions by the Crown resiled from alleging a joint criminal enterprise (see [169] Judgment No 3), and that instead the idea of a relationship or a ""shared interest in trading"" between the applicants was relied upon by the Crown: see [223]-[224] Judgment No 3.  
110The Crown responded that it had never alleged a joint criminal enterprise.  Rather, the Crown case was said to have been that there was joint involvement in insider trading.  The Crown submitted that it had not disavowed reliance upon an allegation that the applicants acted together and that the evidence established a pattern of conduct by them that exhibited striking similarities, as found by the trial judge: at [195] Judgment No 1, and referred to again at [246]-[247] Judgment No 3.  
111This debate as to the proper characterisation of the Crown case must be considered in light of the observation of the trial judge recorded at [170] Judgment No 3, that the Crown's position is that it does not seek a direction that there is a single case against each accused, but rather will seek a direction that in considering each count separately the jury are entitled to rely upon all of the evidence relating to the other counts.  In my view, the trial judge did not proceed upon a misconception of what the Crown case involved.
112Secondly, the contention was advanced by DSJ that the trial judge was in error in acting on the basis that there was a ""circumstantial case"", in addition to the coincidence evidence case.  It was contended that the ""circumstantial evidence"" in the case consisted entirely in the coincidence evidence and that there was no other body of evidence, and that this misconception carried through to Judgment No 3 at [247].
113The Crown disputed the contention by DSJ that there was no other body of evidence apart from the coincidence evidence.  The Crown's written submissions identified a number of areas of evidence which were contended to be different from the evidence relating directly to each particular count, including evidence either relating to, or with respect to:
(1)the background of each accused;
(2)email communications between the accused and others;
(3)NS purchasing financial products associated with other ""Moody's related"" credits;
(4)the purchase of shares in ABY;
(5)the transmission of $30,000 from DSJ to NS.
114The trial judge's approach to the Crown case was open to him.  No error of principle has been identified by DSJ deserving of a grant of leave in respect of this particular complaint.
115Finally, the written submissions of DSJ contained a series of detailed arguments, by reference to a number of counts, which disputed whether the related events were capable of actually establishing the matters particularised in the indictment and the particulars.  These detailed complaints did not raise an issue as to the construction of s 98 of the Evidence Act, but rather sought to attack the trial judge's finding that the evidence had the capacity to meet the s 98 threshold.  I would not grant leave to appeal in respect of these arguments.
Ground 5
Impact of rulings in Judgments No 4 and 5
116Ground 5 of the proposed appeal asserts that the trial judge erred by failing to have regard to the impact on the trial of his decisions in Judgments No 4 and No 5, which ruled that other evidence was admissible under s 55 of the Evidence Act.
117It will be observed that Ground 5, as framed, does not assert any error of principle in the evidentiary rulings the subject of Judgments No 4 and No 5.
118The contention that the trial judge failed to have regard on the separate trials application (the subject of Judgment No 3), to the asserted prejudice and embarrassment to DSJ's defence that would result from the admissibility of other evidence (the subject of Judgments No 4 and No 5), has already been dealt with above under Grounds 1 and 2.  As I have concluded that there is no substance in this contention, I would not grant leave to appeal in respect of Ground 5.
119There are three further matters which it is necessary to refer to under Ground 5.  
120First, the written submissions of DSJ contended that the rulings in Judgments No 4 and No 5 were made without regard to the trial judge's original admissibility ruling in Judgment No 1.  This ruling was that the evidence particularised in Table B of the Coincidence Notice relating to the ""uncharged acts"", was not admissible under s 98 of the Evidence Act.  However, as the Crown correctly pointed out in its written submissions, it is self-evident that the trial judge was aware of his earlier ruling in Judgment No 1, when handing down Judgments No 4 and No 5.  At [2] Judgment No 4, his Honour makes reference to that earlier ruling as being the genesis of the proceedings with which he was dealing.  
121Secondly, it was contended by DSJ that, notwithstanding the evidentiary ruling in Judgment No 1 as to the inadmissibility of the ""uncharged acts"" for a coincidence purpose, the Crown will proceed to use this evidence for a coincidence purpose.  Unsurprisingly, the Crown disputed that it intends to act in this manner.  Furthermore, the ruling of the trial judge in Judgment No 1 precludes the Crown from doing so.  The basis for the admissibility of the evidence referred to as the ""uncharged acts"" is clear from Judgment No 4.  
122Finally, it was contended by DSJ that the basis of admission of the evidence which is the subject of Judgments No 4 and No 5 was unclear, because the trial judge used the same language of evidence of ""relationship"" in Judgments No 4 and No 5 as he used in Judgment No 3 at [224], when describing the Crown case as using coincidence evidence to establish the same ""relationship"" of a ""mutual interest in trading"".
123This submission should be rejected.  As the Crown correctly pointed out, it proceeds upon a misstatement of [224] Judgment No 3, where his Honour stated:
""In the present case, the Crown proposes to use coincidence evidence, inter alia, with a view to establishing that, at the time of each transaction, there existed a relationship, or an association between the two accused which went beyond that of mere personal or social friendship, that they shard a mutual interest in trading, and that in the course of the relationship particularised ""events"", possessing similarities, occurred that are not explicable as coincidence. (Underlining added).""
124It is tolerably clear from the use of the word ""inter alia"", that his Honour was referring to the evidence to be dealt with in Judgments No 4 and No 5 in the context of his reference to establishing that there existed a relationship or an association between the two accused as described.
Application by NS
125The application by NS raises six proposed grounds of appeal.  Whilst there is some similarity in content with the proposed grounds of the application of DSJ, some of the matters raised are particular to the position of NS.
Ground 1
126Ground 1 of the proposed appeal contends that the trial judge erred in not considering the admissibility of evidence as coincidence evidence against NS, separately from its admissibility against DSJ.
Separate consideration of NS's position
127The essential thrust of this contention was that the matters sought to be proved against DSJ are different to those sought to be proved against NS.  It may be accepted that there are different elements of the offences charged against NS compared to the offences charged against DSJ.
128The written submissions of NS accepted that the trial judge separately set out the relevant arguments, which had been advanced on his behalf: at [57]-[71] Judgment No 3.  These included the contention that proof of the state of mind of NS is ""a separate matter from the state of mind of DSJ"": at [66] Judgment No 3.  It was also accepted that the trial judge discussed the arguments advanced by NS on the s 101 issue, including submissions as to probative value, which his Honour reconsidered following the decision in this Court: at [123]-[154] Judgment No 3.
129The complaint made by NS was that the trial judge ultimately determined the admissibility of the evidence as against both applicants as a single issue.  In support of this complaint, NS pointed to the trial judge's reference to the Crown submissions, in particular as summarised at [165] and [167] Judgment No 3, as revealing the asserted error by his Honour of failing to consider the separate position of NS.  It is necessary to turn to the impugned paragraphs of the trial judge's reasons.
130At [165] Judgment No 3, the trial judge referred to the Crown's submissions which identified, by a series of questions, the essential facts and issues to be determined by inference from the whole of the evidence ""whether constituting an individual offence or all of the offences"".  Some of the matters identified by the trial judge referred solely to DSJ, other matters referred solely to NS, and one matter referred to both applicants, namely, did DSJ procure NS to acquire Division 3 financial products?  In my view, nothing in the trial judge's reference to the Crown's submissions, supports the contention that the trial judge failed to separately consider the admissibility issue as against NS.  
131Nor can any valid complaint be made in respect of the reference by the trial judge at [167] Judgment No 3 to the Crown's submission that the ""ultimate issue"" existing ""in each case was why NS engaged in that trading"".  The trial judge's reference to ""in each case"" was clearly a reference back to [166], where his Honour noted the Crown's submission that there was no doubt that NS traded in financial products relating to companies about which Moody's had, prior to that trading, received inside information.  None of these references by his Honour, are to be taken as treating the admissibility of evidence against both applicants as a single issue.
132It was next contended by NS that in stating his conclusions at [293] Judgment No 3 - that the evidence ""does have significant probative value"" and ""substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused"" - his Honour failed to distinguish between the probative value of the evidence as regards the matters in issue for DSJ as against the matters in issue for NS.  NS complained that there was no proper ""weighing"" of the evidence with regard to its capacity to prove only the matters in issue as against NS.  It was argued that the absence of separate consideration of the probative value of the coincidence evidence as against NS, was demonstrated by his Honour's analysis at [246] and [247] Judgment No 3.  In my view, these submissions should be rejected.
133First, this contention is not a fair reading of his Honour's judgment.  It ignores the earlier references by his Honour to each of ""the accused persons"" including at [211] and [214] Judgment No 3.  Further, at [215], the trial judge distinguished between the terms of the Coincidence Notice insofar as it related to NS and DSJ.  His Honour observed:
""The Notice separately identified the nature of the conduct and state of mind of each of the accused the subject of the proposed evidence."" [emphasis added.]
134At [216], his Honour identified the particular respects in which the Coincidence Notice stated that the evidence of the two or more related events was to be tendered to prove that NS did the particular acts alleged in each of counts 11-20 of the indictment. 
135At [225]-[226], his Honour referred to the separate position of NS, as opposed to that of DSJ, in relation to the allegation of possession of inside information.
136Again, at [232]-[233] and [237], his Honour distinguished the cases against each accused.  There is no proper basis for the assertion that his Honour failed to do so.  
137Secondly, when considering the distinctive similarities in the events, both preceding and post-dating each acquisition, and the circumstances surrounding and associated with each acquisition and disposal: at [246], his Honour expressly acknowledged the separate counts against each of the applicants, when he stated at [247]:
""The events and circumstances referred to in (1) to (3), along with the other events in the Coincidence Notice, support the admissibility of the coincidence evidence in relation to counts 1 to 10 and counts 11-20."" [emphasis added.]
Ground 2
138Ground 2 of the proposed appeal asserts that the trial judge erred in failing to correctly assess the probative value of the evidence.
Probative value and use of evidence
139It was contended by NS that the assessment of the probative value of the evidence (or the assessment whether that value substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect the evidence might have), is to be made having regard to the use to which the evidence is to be put.  In the present case, this was said to be what ""state of mind"" is sought to be proved.  It was argued that the probative value of the evidence and the use to which the evidence is to be put are not separate considerations, and that the trial judge erred when (a) stating, at [28] Judgment No 3, that if the evidence is admissible, then a determination must be made as to how such evidence may be used, and (b) when referring, at [208] Judgment No 3, to the use of which the evidence may be put if admitted, in the context of the balancing test under s 101 of the Evidence Act.
140In my view, there is no substance in these contentions.  On a fair reading of the whole of Judgment No 3, it should not be accepted that the trial judge proceeded on the basis that he would first admit the evidence and then consider what use could be made of it.  At [236]-[238] Judgment No 3, the trial judge addressed the submissions of NS concerning the use of coincidence evidence in the present case.  It is clear that his Honour proceeded upon the basis that the ""use"" to which the evidence is to be put is one part of the factors required to be considered prior to the admission or rejection of the evidence as coincidence evidence.  
141At [208] Judgment No 3, the trial judge stated:
""The balancing test under s 101 accordingly embraces an assessment of the strength of the probative value of the evidence and a consideration of the use to which the evidence may be put if admitted and any risks as to the prejudicial effect arising from such use and risk of misuse.  ..."" [Emphasis added.]
142NS submitted that the implicit assertion by the trial judge in the above passage was that the probative value of the evidence and the use to which the evidence is to be put, were separate considerations.  This submission should be rejected.  It is clear from his Honour's use of the words ""if admitted"" in [208] Judgment No 3, that his Honour did not approach the matter in the manner suggested by NS.
Probative value - state of mind of NS
143Next, it was contended by NS that the trial judge erred in his consideration of the probative value of the coincidence evidence.  First it was argued that whilst the trial judge correctly acknowledged at [218] Judgment No 3 that the evidence was being led not to prove the identity of the offender but to prove the commission of the offence, his Honour did not address the fact that the evidence is sought to be led against NS to prove, in each case, the commission of the offence, by proving a ""very specific state of mind"".  
144The premise of this argument is unsound.  At [218] Judgment No 3, the trial judge recognised that the Crown seeks to rely upon coincidence evidence in the present proceedings for the purpose of establishing the commission of the alleged insider trading offences, in particular, the liability of the accused in respect of prohibited conduct under s 1043A of the Corporations Act.  At [219], the trial judge identified the circumstantial evidence in relation to a combination of events relied upon by the Crown in the present case.  At [236], the trial judge recorded that the Crown seeks to use the coincidence evidence to establish the fact that a criminal offence(s) had been committed.  At [237], the trial judge noted that the Crown proposed to use coincidence evidence to prove, relevantly in the case of NS, the acts of possession of inside information and his state of mind.  At [239], his Honour went on to record the similarities in events and circumstances in which the events allegedly occurred before considering the probative value of the coincidence evidence in Part F of Judgment No 3.
145The trial judge did not fail to address that coincidence evidence was being led to prove the commission of the offence, which in the present case, included the state of mind of NS.
Probative value inflated argument
146Secondly, it was argued by NS that the trial judge impermissibly inflated the probative value of the evidence by reference to relationship evidence.  This complaint was directed to the trial judge's statement at [224] Judgment No 3:
""In the present case, the Crown proposes to use coincidence evidence, inter alia, with a view to establishing that, at the time of each transaction, there existed a relationship or an association between the two accused which went beyond that of mere personal or social friendship, that they shared a mutual interest in trading, and that in the course of the relationship particularised ""events"", possessing similarities, occurred that are not explicable as coincidence.""
147It was argued by NS that proof of such relationship between the two accused was no more than a by-product of proof that the acquisitions were not coincidental, and the fact that the evidence also proved a relationship in no way added to its probative value once it was accepted that the evidence had the capacity to prove absence of coincidence.  For the purposes of this argument it was acknowledged by NS that the evidence had the capacity to prove absence of coincidence.
148The Crown submitted that, contrary to the contentions of NS, evidence as to the nature of the relationship between the accused was not otiose.  Furthermore, insofar as the submissions of NS contended that a mutual interest in trading was not a fact in issue, and proof of such matters by other evidence did not advance the Crown case, this ignored the entitlement of the Crown to call evidence about those facts, even if the applicants made formal admissions: R v Smith [1981] 1 NSWLR 193; R v JGW [1999] NSWCCA 116 at [42]-[44]; R v Frazer [2002] NSWCCA 59; 128 A Crim R 89 at [67].  The Crown's submission is to be accepted, subject to acknowledging that the trial judge has ultimate control over the admission of evidence sought to be tendered at trial.
149His Honour's statement at [224] must be read in the context of [217]-[226] Judgment No 3.  When this is done, his Honour's reference to the capacity of the evidence to prove ""relationship"" does not, in my view, suggest error in his Honour's assessment of the probative value of the coincidence evidence.
Lack of capacity arguments
150Thirdly, it was argued that the trial judge failed to address the issue of the capacity of the evidence to prove that NS had a particular state of mind.  It was also contended that the trial judge failed to address the question of the capacity of the evidence to establish that NS was in possession of the particularised information in each count.  It was asserted that his Honour appeared to acknowledge that any information in the possession of NS might be less than the information in the possession of Moody's.  It was contended that the Crown is not able to prove that all of the particularised information was in the possession of DSJ.  
151It is to be observed that these submissions ignore two matters.  First, the trial judge found that the evidence did have significant probative value: at [242] Judgment No 3.  Secondly, the trial judge considered and rejected the alternative possibilities inconsistent with guilt of the accused: at [243]-[246] Judgment No 3.  His Honour found at [245] that the ""possibilities"" contended for by the applicants are very substantially outweighed by the coincidence evidence and other circumstantial evidence taken in combination.  
152In evaluating the alternative explanations suggested by the applicants as being inconsistent with guilt, his Honour had regard to matters which undoubtedly had the capacity to prove that NS had a particular state of mind, including the timing and relative intensity of phone calls between the accused, as well as the matters recorded at [246] Judgment No 3, concerning the distinctive similarities in the events both preceding and postdating each acquisition and in the circumstances surrounding and associated with each acquisition and disposal.  His Honour recorded these matters in relation to the Crown case against NS at [239] Judgment No 3.
153Insofar as complaint was made that the trial judge failed to deal with the submission by NS that coincidence reasoning could not operate to prove that all of the particularised information was in possession of DSJ, this was essentially a repetition of the submission that the evidence did not have the capacity required pursuant to s 98 of the Evidence Act.  
154Contrary to the contention of NS, the assessment of the capacity of the evidence to prove that NS had a particular state of mind was not to be approached by consideration of one factor, namely, possession of inside information on the part of NS, in isolation from the balance of the evidence to be called by the Crown.  
155The trial judge's reasons at [261]-[264] Judgment No 3, read together with his Honour's identification of the distinctive similarities in the events and the circumstances in which the events allegedly occurred at [239]-[241] and his Honour's assessment of the probative value of the coincidence evidence at [242]-[248] Judgment No 3, addressed the ""lack of capacity"" argument raised by NS.
156Fourthly, insofar as the lack of capacity argument was also directed to the trial judge's conclusions in the s 98 Judgment at [127]-[131], I do not consider any error of principle has been demonstrated in his Honour's rejection of the applicants' submissions that the Crown seeks to essentially rely upon coincidence evidence to establish the elements of possession and communication.  His Honour correctly identified, what he described as the ""super structure"" of the Crown case, as being based upon both circumstantial evidence constituted by primary facts, as well as coincidence evidence in support of its case: see [131] s 98 Judgment.
157Insofar as the submissions of NS raised particular arguments in relation to the capacity of the evidence in relation to specific counts - count 3 (AWB), count 4 (BLD), count 5 (AIHCA), and count 9 (SRG) - the schedule to Judgment No 3 makes it clear that his Honour gave careful attention to, and had regard to, the factual arguments concerning whether the evidence had the requisite capacity to meet the s 98 threshold: see Schedule [363]-[419] - count 3 (AWB); [420][451] - count 4 (BLD); [527]-[576] - count 9 (SRG).
Consideration of alternative possibilities
158Fifthly, it was argued by NS that the trial judge erred in his consideration of alternative possibilities in the s 98 Judgment at [132]-[133] where his Honour stated:
""132  The co-incidence evidence the Crown seeks to rely upon does, in my assessment, have significant probative value for the purpose of s.98. In arriving at the conclusion which I have expressed in that respect, I have sought to test the strength of the co-incidence evidence by assuming the possibilities to which I have referred do exist, but that notwithstanding, I have, in my assessment, concluded that such possibilities do not substantially alter the capacity for cogency which the co-incidence evidence possesses.
133  On a consideration of the evidence which the Crown seeks to rely upon I do not consider in the assessment or evaluation required by s.98 that it strongly either supports or gives rise to the alternative explanations or inferences raised by the accused DSJ or NS and/ or as identified for consideration in the judgment of Whealy JA. In any event the capacity of the co-incidence evidence remains, in my assessment, strong and cogent even if it be assumed that the alternatives are open on that evidence.""
159It was contended by NS that the trial judge's conclusion at [133] s 98 Judgment was expressed in terms which import a requirement for the evidence to ""strongly"" support or ""strongly"" give rise to alternative explanations.  It was argued that if other possibilities remain open with respect to the state of mind of NS, the evidence does not have the capacity to prove that for which it sought to be admitted.
160I do not consider that the trial judge's reasons about the ""alternative"" possibilities and their impact on whether the evidence had the requisite capacity pursuant to s 98 were attended with any doubt worthy of the grant of leave.  His Honour dealt with and rejected the possibility of social contact being a reason for the telephone contact: at [88] s 98 Judgment.  His Honour also considered and rejected the possibility that NS was ""tipped off"": at [90] s 98 Judgment.  His Honour's reasoning in both respects indicates that he assessed those possibilities against the evidence which established multiple communications between the applicants prior to a particular acquisition being made and took into account all of the factual pieces constituting the Crown's circumstantial evidence.  
161Further, there is no warrant for the suggestion by NS that his Honour failed to have regard to the possibility that the communication was a mixture of the two, that is, social contact and tipping.  His Honour considered the possibility that the series of trades were all ""tips"".  It was open to his Honour to conclude that the possibility that NS had been ""tipped off"" was of insufficient weight to diminish the probative value of the coincidence evidence.
162Sixthly, it was argued that the trial judge erred in his consideration of the capacity of the evidence to prove DSJ's possession of inside information in the absence of direct evidence of that matter.  This complaint was directed to [91]-[93] s 98 Judgment, where his Honour considered whether the absence of any direct evidence that DSJ acquired inside information reduced the cogency of the coincidence evidence to prove relevant facts in issue.
163NS contended that his Honour's finding is flawed because he considered the issue separately, without explanation as to why the absence of direct evidence of possession of inside information by DSJ in some cases did not ""diminish"" the cogency of the coincidence evidence.  However, it is apparent from [91]-[93] s 98 Judgment, that his Honour considered the capacity of the evidence in light of all the facts and the suggested alternate possibilities inconsistent with guilt of the applicants.  
164Seventhly, it was argued that the trial judge's reliance on the significance of ""repetition"" at [108] s 98 Judgment was erroneous.  This complaint was directed to the trial judge's statement that evidence concerning the repetition of communications between DSJ and NS needed to be considered in the overall context, which included the progressive supply of information to Moody's in many instances.  It was argued that the trial judge failed to explain how the evidence in counts where there was not such a ""progressive supply"" of information could assist as against other counts.  It was also argued that the progressive supply of information to Moody's did not necessarily equate to a progressive supply of information to DSJ, and that the fact and timing of online searches by DSJ said nothing with respect to the level of information conveyed to NS.
165This contention was also directed at [109] s 98 Judgment, where the trial judge stated that in an evaluation of alternative inferences, such as ""tipping"", it is open for a jury to take into account whether internet searching by DSJ and communications back and forth between DSJ and NS is more consistent with insider trading than communication in the nature of phone calls to pass on a ""tip"".  It was argued that the trial judge failed to examine any relationship between internet checking and communication between DSJ and NS.  This argument was advanced with respect to the evidence of the single occasion of internet checking in relation to GasNet (count 1) which was said to be unable to assist in the drawing of an inference in the case of BLD (count 4), where DSJ is recorded as having visited the relevant internet site on 696 occasions (or vice versa).
166The Crown's response was that the submissions of NS are contrary to the decision of this Court in the Appeal decision at [82] per Whealy JA, because they require the trial judge to embark on the task of fact finding, which is not the relevant task.
167Insofar as the submissions of NS conflated the issue of the capacity of the evidence to meet the threshold required by s 98 with the task of fact finding, they must be rejected.  Insofar as the submissions of NS attack the trial judge's finding as to the capacity of the evidence to meet the s 98 threshold, I am not persuaded that an error of principle has been identified worthy of the grant of leave.  
168Eighthly, it was argued that the trial judge failed to approach the exercise required pursuant to s 98 in accordance with the steps identified in R v Gale; R v Duckworth at [31] per Simpson J.  This complaint is dealt with below under Ground 5, and I do not consider that it warrants a grant of leave.  
169As to the specific complaints advanced by NS, the first was that the trial judge failed to identify the particular state of mind of NS that the Crown seeks to prove.  This complaint is unsustainable.  The submissions of NS acknowledged that his Honour did refer to proof of the particular state of mind to be proved against NS.  The complaint made - that his Honour's assessment of the probative value leans heavily on the capacity of the evidence to prove a mere absence of a coincidence - does not demonstrate any error of principle by the trial judge.
170As to the second complaint - that the events identified in the coincidence are not ""events"" for the purpose of s 98 - this, like the same submission by DSJ, is a repetition of the argument which this Court has previously refused to grant leave on the earlier leave application.  It is also to be observed that events can be ""facts in issue"", as the note to s 98 of the Evidence Act expressly permits: R v Gale; R v Duckworth at [34](ii).
171Ultimately, the various arguments advanced by NS amounted to a series of complaints concerning the trial judge's conclusion as to the capacity of the evidence to meet the s 98 threshold.  No error of principle has been identified worthy of the grant of leave.  Insofar as these arguments were advanced by way of detailed submissions on the facts, these are properly viewed as more in the nature of arguments to be placed before the jury in closing address: Appeal decision at [89].
172I would not grant leave to appeal in respect of Ground 2.
Ground 3
173Ground 3 of the proposed appeal asserts that the trial judge erred in failing to provide reasons for rejecting certain arguments of NS.
Lack of reasons
174Although formulated as a lack of reasons ground, the written submissions of NS made the somewhat different complaint of insufficient reasons, when contending that the trial judge did not deal, or adequately deal, with certain submissions advanced by NS.  The relevant submissions of NS made below, as recorded by his Honour in Judgment No 3, were as follows:
(1)That there is a difficulty in relying on coincidence reasoning to establish possession of all of the information particularised in the individual counts: at [125](4), [145] Judgment No 3.
(2)That repetition (in the particular circumstances of this case) does not strengthen the inference sought to be drawn: at [49]-[50] Judgment No 3.
(3)That the probative value of the evidence varies between counts: at [125](5) Judgment No 3.
(4)That there is confusion as to the use to which the evidence is to be put: at [125](8) Judgment No 3.
(5)That the multiplicity of calls between DSJ and NS and online checking of the share information does not (materially) further the inference sought to be drawn by the Crown (with respect to proof of NS's state of mind, as opposed to rebuttal of coincidence).
175It was contended by NS that the analysis of the trial judge under ""Part F Decision"" of Judgment No 3, was primarily concerned with the use of the evidence to rebut coincidence - in particular the use of the evidence to establish that the acquisitions were not coincidental - being a matter regarding which it was acknowledged that the written submissions of NS below were not directed.
176The trial judge's reasons under Part F, were contained in [242]-[292] Judgment No 3.  At [244], the trial judge stated that:
""... the alternative explanations advanced on behalf of the accused do not, in my opinion, as I have previously determined, constitute in the evaluation of the coincidence evidence 'real possibilities' inconsistent with the guilt of the accused that operate to deprive it from having the significant probative value referred to in [242] above.""
177The trial judge reasoned at [245] that:
""The 'possibilities' contended for are, in my opinion, very substantially outweighed by the coincidence evidence and other circumstantial evidence taken in combination. In so determining the alternative explanations suggested, tipping, mere social/personal communications between the accused, are to be considered and evaluated against the evidence as to particular events, including the dates upon which Moody's was entrusted with confidential (inside) information, the content of the confidential information and the number, the timing and the relative intensity of phone calls between the accused, often during working hours, and surrounding or proximate to dates/times of the acquisitions as well as the nature and timing of internet surveillance by DSJ on relevant stock prices.""
178At [246], the trial judge observed that the probative value of the coincidence evidence arises from distinctive similarities in the events both preceding and post-dating each acquisition and in the circumstances surrounding and associated with each acquisition and disposal.  His Honour noted that those similarities were detailed in the factual matters earlier recorded in Judgment No 3, as well as in the s 98 Judgment.  
179The distinctive similarities noted by his Honour included (a) the common identity of NS, being the acquirer in nine out of ten acquisitions; the tenth acquisition relating to the GasNet shares being purchased by NS's father in two parcels, one of which was allocated to an account in the name of NS and his sister, (b) that all ten acquisitions involved shares in other financial products and entities which all shared in common the fact that they had been, and were at the time of the acquisition, the subject of confidential information that had been provided to Moody's by the companies the subject of the acquisitions, and that these were the only acquisitions made by NS in the relevant seven month period; and (c) that the number of acquisitions, the temporal factors associated with the acquisitions as referred to at [239], and the common thread running through all ten acquisitions are facts weighing against chance or coincidence as an explanation for the similarities that arose successively in one acquisition followed by another.
180The written submissions of NS advanced the complaint that although the trial judge, at [245] Judgment No 3, considered the timing and relative intensity of the phone calls between the accused and the nature and timing of internet surveillance by DSJ, his Honour did not consider how such matters operated ""to elevate the nature of the communication, from the communication of some information to the communication of the particularised information"", and that his Honour failed to deal with the submission that internet checking was not capable of proving NS's state of mind.
181A number of detailed arguments were advanced by NS, essentially to the effect that the evidence did not have the capacity contended for by the Crown.  These arguments included:
(1)That the multiplicity of telephone calls whilst establishing opportunity, could not establish the content of the communication (beyond the existence of a bare relationship between the contact and the acquisition of the relevant security by NS).  It was contended that the trial judge was required to, but did not consider, the prospect that the telephone calls were in part related to the acquisitions and in part social.
(2)That there was no ""multiplicity of calls"" in relation to counts 11 to 14, although it was acknowledged that some of the counts involved different levels of contact and different timeframes between receipt of information by Moody's and the acquisition of financial products by NS.
182The Crown's response to these contentions was that the complaints by NS related to matters seeking to challenge the capacity of the evidence to meet the s 98 threshold.  The Crown argued that the submissions of NS amounted to arguments suggesting that certain facts cannot be established by certain other pieces of evidence.  It was submitted that this was not the relevant test, nor the process required to be undertaken by the trial judge.
183In relation to the arguments of NS concerning the significance of phone calls between the accused, the Crown submitted that those arguments were based upon assertions by NS as to what the evidence was capable of establishing.  It was submitted that those arguments were unduly limited in focus to what flows from the specific number of telephone calls between the receipt of the information by Moody's and the acquisition of financial products by NS.  
184It was also submitted by the Crown that the arguments of NS did not, as the trial judge had done, consider all of these matters in the context of the whole of the evidence relied upon by the Crown.  Thus it was argued that deciding what was communicated to NS is not to be determined by the number of calls in isolation.  Rather, it is relevant to have regard to the fact of the timing of the calls, and the fact that each of the acquisitions made by NS were consistent with him being in possession of inside information.
185In my view, the trial judge adequately addressed the arguments advanced by NS concerning the capacity of the evidence to meet the s 98 threshold.  In addition to the matters identified by the Crown as referred to above, this complaint has many common features with the arguments advanced by NS in support of Ground 2 in respect of which I would refuse leave.  I would not grant leave in respect of Ground 3.
Ground 4
Jury directions
186Ground 4 of the proposed appeal asserted that the trial judge erred in failing to consider the directions that would be necessary to give to the jury as part of the assessment of the admissibility of coincidence evidence.  There was a significant overlap between the submissions of NS and those of DSJ in respect of Grounds 1 and 2 of his proposed appeal.
187It was contended by NS that the trial judge purported to determine both the probative value of the evidence and its prejudicial effect, without dealing with the directions that would be required at trial.  This complaint was directed to [268]-[285] Judgment No 3.  
188The written submissions of NS accepted that it is the purpose for which the evidence is admitted, and not the reasons for determining its admissibility, which should dictate the direction as to the use which the jury is entitled to make of it: [280] Judgment No 3.  It was contended that the trial judge failed to deal with the issues raised by the applicants as to the use to which the evidence was to be put.
189The Crown's response was to the effect that the trial judge had set out in appropriate detail, in answer to the applicants' submissions, matters relevant to the issue of the ""danger of misuse of evidence""; that his Honour ""closely considered"" the submissions made by the applicants in this regard: [272] Judgment No 3; and that his Honour was correct to note that the final form of any such directions will be shaped and determined by reference to the actual evidence at trial: [273] Judgment No 3.  
190In my view, there is no substance in this complaint by NS.  
191First, it is to be accepted that in determining the issue of prejudicial effect, the trial judge gave consideration to the actual prejudice that the probative value of the coincidence evidence must substantially outweigh: at [266] Judgment No 3.  The trial judge considered the two strands of prejudicial effect relied upon by each applicant.  The first was the danger of the misuse of the coincidence evidence by the jury.  The second was the complexity of the matters that would arise for determination on each count, and all counts, if heard together: at [267] Judgment No 3.  It is with respect to the first argument that this proposed ground of appeal is directed.  
192The trial judge dealt with the danger of the misuse of coincidence evidence at [268]-[285] Judgment No 3.  It is apparent that his Honour carefully considered the submissions made by the applicants on this topic: [272] Judgment No 3.
193No complaint can be made in relation to the trial judge's observation at [273] Judgment No 3, that the formulation of specific directions will be shaped and determined by reference to the actual evidence adduced at trial, and that in formulating such directions the Court would have input from counsel for each of the parties.  Although acknowledging the difficulty in framing directions in specific terms before trial, his Honour carefully considered and identified a number of matters concerning trial directions which could be identified in general terms in advance of the trial.  
194The complaint by NS that the trial judge failed to consider the directions it would be necessary to give to the jury must be rejected for the reasons already given in respect of the similar complaint by DSJ: see [67] and [70] above.  
195I would not grant leave in respect of Ground 4.
Ground 5
196Ground 5 of the proposed appeal asserted that the trial judge erred in distinguishing the decision of this Court in R v Gale; R v Duckworth.
197It was contended by NS that the terms of the Coincidence Notice itself established that the present case is not distinguishable from R v Gale; R v Duckworth, on the basis found by the trial judge.  It was asserted, by way of example, that the second ""related event"" in Table A of the Coincidence Notice - with respect to counts 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 that DSJ was in direct receipt of the inside information in some instances, and indirectly in others - does not assert any fact, but rather is a matter sought to be proved by the coincidence evidence.  On this premise it was argued, that use of this matter as a ""related event"" involves begging the very same question as referred to by Simpson J at [37] in R v Gale; R v Duckworth.  
198It was submitted by NS that the trial judge failed to distinguish improbability reasoning in the ordinary case (where proof of the state of mind follows the exclusion of coincidence as an explanation for the events) from this case.  It was asserted that the evidence cannot show the same quality of mind in the sense of possession by NS of the particularised information, with respect to any single count simply on the basis of coincidence.  Further, it was argued that even if the particular state of mind could be established in relation to one count, proof that some other acquisition was not the result of coincidence does not prove that the same level of information was transferred on some other occasion by DSJ to NS.
199The contentions of NS that R v Gale; R v Duckworth is not distinguishable essentially depends on accepting the argument that the trial judge was wrong to find that the Crown relies upon ""similarities"" not ""asserted similarities"" based on assumptions as to facts in the Coincidence Notice.
200For the reasons given at [102]-[104] above in relation to the similar complaint raised by DSJ, I do not consider that this conclusion by the trial judge is attended with any doubt worthy of the grant of leave.
Ground 6
GasNet - count 11
201Ground 6 of the proposed appeal asserted that the trial judge erred in failing to separately consider the admissibility as coincidence evidence of the evidence on count 11 (relating to GasNet) in counts 12 to 20, and the admissibility of the evidence on counts 12 to 20 as coincidence evidence in count 11, having regard to asserted particular differences present in count 11 as against the other counts.  
202It was contended by NS before the trial judge and on this application, that count 11 (and count 1 against DSJ, which also related to GasNet) was in a special category because of the differences between the ""events"" or the circumstances in which the events occurred.
203The ""divergences"" argument advanced by NS, was recorded by the trial judge at [124] s 98 Judgment.  His Honour dealt with that argument at [125]-[126] s 98 Judgment.  His Honour referred to his previous consideration of the facts concerning GasNet in Judgment No 1.  His Honour also noted that he had considered the possibility that the transaction the subject of the GasNet account had an innocent explanation.  His Honour went on:
""[126] ... However, I do not consider that, taken in context, that the variations or 'divergences' referred to of themselves are of sufficient weight to deprive the evidence concerning the GAS count of its significant capacity as coincidence evidence.""
204The trial judge recorded the further submissions of NS with respect to count 11 (GasNet) at [47], [61] and [127]-[32] Judgement No 3, as well as the Crown's submissions at [179]-[181] Judgment No 3.  At [127], his Honour noted that the facts and submissions made in relation to GasNet were recorded at [301]-[329] of the Schedule to Judgment No 3.  At [324] of the Schedule, his Honour again referred to the divergences argument of NS and stated:
""The issue becomes whether they are such as to displace relevant similarities.  Firstly, a 'pattern' suggests similarities but not a fixed template.  There may exist matters in common but not a complete identity of all features.""
205His Honour identified at [324] of the Schedule, that the relevant points of similarity with the GasNet count included:
""(i)  [DSJ], as an insider directly received 'inside information'.
(ii)  BBI was a 'Credit' of Moody's at the relevant time.
(iii)  On 14 June 2006 GasNet shares were purchased in parcels - one in [NS's father's] name and another in the names of [NS] and his sister.
(iv)  The acquisition was made a few days before the scheduled public announcement.""
206The trial judge noted, at [325] of the Schedule, other points of similarity relied upon by the Crown in relation to the GasNet count, albeit there were some variations to the other counts.  His Honour's analysis of the facts and submissions made in relation to the GasNet count are to be read together with his Honour's consideration of the submissions of NS concerning ""system"" or ""pattern"" at [230]-[235] Judgment No 3.
207At [246] Judgment No 3, the trial judge addressed the probative value of the coincidence evidence arising from distinctive similarities in the events both preceding and postdating each acquisition and in the circumstances surrounding and associated with each acquisition and disposal.  His Honour's assessment of those similarities included similarities in relation to the acquisition of the GasNet shares, whilst noting a difference being that the purchase was by NS's father in two parcels.  One of those parcels was allocated to an account in the name of NS and his sister.  
208There is no substance in the complaint of NS that the trial judge failed to consider the submissions which had been advanced by NS as to why count 11 should be severed from the remaining counts.
209I would not grant leave in respect of Ground 6.
Conclusion and Orders
210I would not grant leave to appeal in respect of any of the proposed grounds of appeal in the application of either applicant.
211I propose that each application be dismissed.
212HIDDEN J:  I agree with Gleeson JA.
213ROTHMAN J:  I have had the considerable advantage of reading, in draft, the reasons for judgment of Gleeson JA. It is therefore unnecessary for me to repeat the background, facts or details involved in the appeal, except to the extent necessary to elucidate the further points. 
214The starting point for an assessment of the issue before the Court is that, as a serious Commonwealth offence triable on indictment, the trial must occur before a jury: s 80 of the Constitution. The assessment by the trial judge as to whether separate trials are appropriate is performed in that context. 
215The indictment charges, as Gleeson JA has summarised, twenty counts of insider trading of two kinds (s 1043A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)), ten counts against each accused, each of which count relates to conduct of both accused. In other words, each count for each accused has a counterpart charge against the co-accused. 
Jurisdiction
216In Kocer v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 328, the Court (Rothman J, McClellan CJ at CL and Buddin J agreeing) examined the history of s 5F and the context s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Unless the term ""interlocutory order"" in s 5F(2) and s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act is read to exclude rulings on evidence, s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act would be otiose: see Kocer at [11] - [15], and the cases cited therein; and now see DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; (2011) 81 NSWLR 568. 
217Thus, there is, by leave, available to an accused an appeal against an interlocutory order, but not against an evidentiary ruling. Nevertheless, there is no express prohibition on appeals against evidentiary judgments or orders (or, if it be different, rulings). 
218The purpose of differentiating decisions or rulings on evidence from interlocutory orders was discussed in DAO and in Kocer. In Kocer, at [1]-[3], McClellan CJ at CL refers to the undesirability of interference or interruption with a criminal trial because of the effect of such interruption on the administration of justice. In Kocer, I also discuss such issues at [22] and, in relation to fairness or unfairness, at [18]-[19]. 
219Once, as here, the jurisdictional gateway established by s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act has been identified and the appeal has been brought within its terms, the question of whether leave ought to be granted arises. The fact that the interlocutory judgment or order is largely predicated on one or more rulings on evidence does not necessitate a refusal of leave, although the rulings themselves could not have been the subject of a separate appeal. 
220The grant of leave will depend upon a range of factors described herein by Gleeson JA at [6]. I agree, if that be the basis for the comments at [7], that where, as here, the interlocutory order depends on rulings on evidence, that will be a significant factor in deciding the question of leave. The significance depends, in my view, not on the unavailability of an appeal against rulings on evidence, but on the basis that rarely will such an appeal give rise to the kind of issues for which leave would be granted, because they do not generally warrant an interference with the trial. In my view, nothing in DAO at [16], [106] or [208] is inconsistent with that approach. 
221I also agree that the established principles identified by the High Court in House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505 are to be applied on appeal against an order refusing separate trials. First, when a judge refuses an order for separate trials, the judge is nevertheless issuing an order or judgment: Maxwell v Keun [1928] 1 KB 645; Sali v SPC Ltd (1993) 67 ALJR 841 at 843; Peterborough v Overseers of the Parish of Wilsthorpe (1883) 12 QBD 1 at 3; Holborn v Guardians of Union Chertsey (1884) 15 QBD 76 at 79; Re Lamb [1894] 2 QB 805. 
222Secondly, the established principles to which Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ referred in House include manifest error and a ground of substantial miscarriage of justice. In my view, an application for separate trials that relies on a ground of manifest injustice, if the trial were to proceed as presently anticipated, is not, in the sense to which the High Court referred in Adam P Brown v Phillip Morris [1981] HCA 39; 148 CLR 170, simply a matter of procedure. 
223A fundamental issue on the grant of leave under s 5F(3) is whether the grounds raised justify interference with the trial process, when the appellant's rights are protected on an appeal against conviction. That issue depends on the strength of the ground raised in the appeal and the interests in the administration of justice associated with allowing a trial to proceed in circumstances where there is a strong possibility that an appeal against conviction may lead to a retrial. 
224The last mentioned matter will generally be less important than the first mentioned in the previous paragraph, but where, as here, the trial will proceed over many months, at great expense to the parties, different relative weights may be appropriate. Further, in the present case, because these rulings by the trial judge have been made as preliminary rulings, there is no trial currently proceeding or fixed with which this appeal is interfering.  
225The foregoing discussion on the question of leave is not intended to diminish the significance of the circumstance that a central issue in a particular application for leave to appeal may be an evidentiary issue. It is intended, rather, to emphasise that it is the principle (or lack of it) raised by the appeal that is central to the question of whether leave ought to be granted, not the circumstance that evidentiary rulings cannot separately be the subject of an interlocutory appeal. 
Basis of Application for Leave
226The judgment of Gleeson JA sets out with great clarity each of the grounds upon which each appellant relies in seeking leave to appeal (and, if leave be granted, in the appeal itself). It is unnecessary to repeat those grounds. 
227Fundamentally, the application for leave to appeal and the appeal itself rely upon two broad principles. The first is that there is a need for separate trials because the aggregation of all of the counts in one indictment will render the trial judge's directions to the jury necessarily confusing, extremely detailed and consequently unfairly prejudicial to each of the accused. The second basis, which in part, at least, is a factor in the first, is that charging both co-accused with each of the charges, and prosecuting them in one proceeding, is unfairly prejudicial to each co-accused, because of the circularity of the inferences sought to be drawn and the unfair prejudice that will result as a consequence. 
228Each of the foregoing bases is related. Essentially they raise not the theoretical question of whether the evidence is admissible against each of them and on all counts, but whether, as a matter of practical justice, each co-accused can be fairly prosecuted in that manner. 
Consideration
229The circularity of the evidentiary issue is almost self-evident. As the Crown, at the appeal, sought to explain it, each of the circumstances of the conduct that gave rise to the charges in counts one to nine is to be used as coincidence evidence in count ten. Each of the conduct in counts one to eight and ten is to be used as evidence of guilt in relation to count nine; and so forth. 
230In other words, on each count on the indictment, the conduct alleged in every other count will be used to prove that the trading activity engaged in by each of the co-offenders was not innocent and was engaged in at a time when the relevant co-accused had, or obtained, inside information concerning the entity in which the shares were purchased. 
231It must be recalled that, with offences under this provision, the conduct of each co-accused is totally innocent in the absence of proof that the particular co-accused had possession of inside information. Usually, but not necessarily, in criminal trials coincidence evidence or tendency evidence is concerned with conduct that is, by its nature, criminal. Obvious examples are those with which the cases on tendency and similar fact evidence have largely been concerned. R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; 156 A Crim R 308 concerned tendency evidence as to sexual assault on minors. R v Ngatikaura [2006] NSWCCA 161; 161 A Crim R 329 concerned drug supply. Similarly, the earlier English judgments, in pre-Evidence Act treatment of similar fact or propensity evidence dealt largely with sexual offenders: Hoch v The Queen (1998) 165 CLR 292; DPP v Kilbourne [1973] AC 729; DPP v Boardman [1975] AC 421. Noor Mohamed v The King [1949] AC 182 concerned poisoning. 
232In this case, there is little or no issue as to the fact of share trading. The only issue in the proceedings is whether one of the co-accused possessed inside information and passed it to the other co-accused. Thus, the existence of other share transactions is not being used to prove that a share transaction occurred. The existence of other share transactions involving clients of the employer of one co-accused is being used to demonstrate that another count relating to another particular share transaction, involving other clients of the co-accused's employer, were occasioned as a result of the possession of inside information. 
233In the absence of direct evidence as to the possession of the information of the co-accused's employer, the difficulty with such an approach is obvious. Moreover, at least arguably, it is not the coincidence that renders the state of mind more likely to exist, it is the conduct itself. The foregoing comment would suggest that the relevant notice should have referred to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995. This last aspect matters little, because the test as to admissibility is identical.
234Nevertheless, the material that has been ruled admissible (and capable of being used for the purpose suggested) is coincidence evidence, namely evidence adduced of two or more events to prove that each of the co-accused either did a particular act or had a particular state of mind (namely, procure the other co-accused or possess the inside information) to prove that in each of the counts the particular co-accused engaged in that conduct or possessed that information. The difficulty (leaving aside certain independent evidence that is not related to the other counts) is that the two or more events are each counts in the indictment. 
235In those circumstances, the communication between the co-accused and/or the purchase of shares in an entity, which was a client of the employer of one of the co-accused, is to be utilised to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, the guilt on another count and the other count is to be used to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, the earlier criminal conduct. 
236Ordinarily, an inference proving, beyond reasonable doubt, an essential element or fact in the commission of an offence may be drawn from a series of circumstances that are not each proved beyond reasonable doubt: Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 175 CLR 573 at 576-577, unless the fact is an essential link in the chain of proof. 
237In criminal proceedings, if there be an hypothesis inconsistent with guilt that is reasonably available from the evidence that is accepted, the jury would not be entitled to return a verdict of guilty. However, except as earlier stated, facts that have not been proved beyond reasonable doubt may be aggregated to reach a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. That is the nature of circumstantial evidence. 
238In this instance, the events, being the communication between the co-accused and the share transactions (without evidence of the possession of information), are to be used to prove the possession of information (and the conveying of that information). As a consequence, the communication between the co-accused and the share transactions, which form essential elements of the charges, are, without more, to be used to prove the further essential element of the charge, namely, the possession of the inside information. 
239None of the foregoing is legally impossible or necessitates inappropriate or illogical reasoning. In some circumstances it is a usual course. For example, where a person deliberately shoots a gun and kills someone, the irrefragable inference is that there was at least an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. The state of mind is inferred from the conduct of the shooter. However, where the conduct that is engaged in is otherwise legal and rendered illegal only by the possession of certain information, to use such otherwise legal conduct to infer illegality has difficulties. Again, it is not impossible or necessarily inappropriate. 
240Nevertheless, whatever be the theoretical possibility associated with the capacity to use otherwise legal activity to infer an illegal state of knowledge and illegal conduct, it creates significant difficulties in the directions that the judge is required to provide to the jury. 
241Were it not for the previous judgment of this Court on the admissibility of evidence, I would consider that the evidentiary issues in this case raise grounds that might warrant leave being granted. I would hold this view even though the evidentiary issues are incapable of giving rise to a right of appeal of themselves because they inform the discretion on separate trials. However, there has already been a determination by this Court of those evidentiary issues. It is inappropriate, in those circumstances, for this Court, as presently constituted, to gainsay the view already expressed by this Court on another occasion.  
242Further, the difficulties in framing an appropriate direction, to which I have referred, are to be faced by the trial judge after submissions by counsel. The trial judge has determined that such unfair prejudice can be overcome by appropriate directions. 
243Although the view of a trial judge that she or he may by directions overcome or ameliorate adequately the unfair prejudice created by a joint trial of all counts requires a consideration of possible directions that the judge may provide, at the same time, it cannot be a requirement of a trial judge to frame such appropriate directions prior to, or at the time of, coming to that conclusion. 
244It would be an intolerable burden on trial judges to be required to frame directions on each occasion that the question of unfair prejudice (for example, an objection to s 137 of the Evidence Act) was raised. Ordinarily, the form of directions will alter, sometimes dramatically, as the trial progresses and as the judge takes account of changes to the anticipated evidence or its perception. 
245The trial judge has dealt with these matters on a number of occasions already. His Honour has an intimate knowledge of the manner in which the Crown seeks to put its case. His Honour has determined that appropriate directions are capable of being framed. 
246The conduct of a trial often involves issues that are resolved between judge and counsel whilst the trial is in process. In a case such as this, the judge's proposed directions will no doubt be the subject of submissions. Any interlocutory judgment on that issue is, pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act, capable of application for leave to appeal. Any error of law in the directions or miscarriage of justice occasioned by inadequate directions, if either accused were convicted, can be raised at an appeal against conviction. 
247Given the earlier judgment of this Court on the evidentiary issues raised, the nature of the judgment on the separation of counts in the indictment is not one that warrants interference with this exercise of discretion, because the applicants' rights to appeal any unfavourable verdict are fully protected. 
248For the foregoing reasons, I join in the orders proposed by Gleeson JA.

		13 May 2014",2014-05-12 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705121,State of New South Wales v Mintern [2014] NSWSC 664,"ex tempore Judgment
1The plaintiff, by summons filed on 24 April 2014, is seeking an extended supervision order in respect of the defendant pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) and an interim supervision order for a period of 28 days pursuant to ss 10A and 10C of the Act pending final hearing of the matter, at which time final orders will be sought.  The summons also seeks an order pursuant to s 7(4) of the Act appointing two qualified psychiatrists to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the defendant and to furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations by a date to be fixed by the Court and an order directing the defendant to attend those examinations. 
2Section 10A of the Act provides that an interim supervision order may be made by the Court if it is satisfied that the defendant's current custody will expire before the proceedings are to be determined and that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation, if proved, justify the making of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order.  The decision to make an interim supervision order is discretionary and it is open to the Court to refuse to make such an order, even if the conditions specified in the relevant section are satisfied. 
3I should mention that the making of the present interim order is not opposed, although there has been some disagreement, now resolved, as to the terms of the order.  For the purposes of this hearing, the defendant concedes that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation, if proved, would justify the making of a high risk sex offender supervision order.  Nevertheless, it is necessary for the Court to be satisfied that such an order is appropriate
4The defendant is in custody following a plea of guilty to one count of aggravated sexual assault under s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.  He was sentenced on 13 June 2008 to six years and eight months imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years and six months, commencing on 5 October 2007.  The defendant was released on parole on 17 August 2011 but his parole was revoked on 30 March 2012.  He was again released on parole on 25 October 2012.  However, on 18 January 2013 parole was again revoked and he remains in full-time custody.  The defendant has either been in custody or subject to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service during this period, so he continues to be a supervised sex offender within the meaning of s 5I and, accordingly, the present application may be considered. 
5It is not necessary for present purposes to predict the ultimate result of the proceedings; merely to find prima facie that the matters alleged, if proved, would justify the making of the final extended supervision order envisaged.  Amongst other things, it does not involve the weighing up of documentation or the consideration of evidence which will be called at the final hearing.
6It is necessary before a high risk offender extended supervision order is made that the Court be satisfied that the offender is a high risk sex offender within the meaning of s 5B of the Act.  Section 5B provides - 
""(2)  An offender is a high risk sex offender if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision."" [Emphasis original].
7The meaning of the important element of the definition that there be a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk has been considered, amongst others, by Justice Davies in State of New South Wales v Richardson (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 276; (2011) 210 A Crim R 220.  Essentially it involves a balancing exercise between the likelihood of the commission of a serious sex offence by the defendant on the one hand and, on the other, serious consequences for him by way of significant limitations on his freedom as a citizen.  These considerations are relevant also to the making of an interim order.
8The Act specifies the matters to which the Court must have regard when considering whether to make an extended supervision order (see s 9(3)).  These include the safety of the community, the reports of the psychiatrists and other persons appointed to conduct examinations of the offender, the results of assessments, the results of statistical analysis, reports prepared by Corrective Services New South Wales, the outcome of treatment or rehabilitation programmes in which the offender has been involved, his level of compliance with parole obligations or any earlier extended supervision order or any other obligations to which he or she has been subject, his criminal history, the views of the sentencing court at the time of his being sentenced and other information that pertains to the likelihood of future offending.
9I do not intend and it is not necessary for present purposes to detail the criminal history and patterns of offending behaviour of the defendant, it is enough to say that I have read the material which is relied on by the plaintiff in that regard. The defendant has a lengthy criminal history and has been convicted of committing sexual offences against four victims, the youngest being a four year old child. The first of these offences was committed when the defendant was thirteen years of age.
10The risk report provided by the Department of Corrective Services prepared by a psychologist within the department confirms the risk which the offender represents and describes the extent to which the defendant can reasonably and practically be managed in the community. The defendant was assessed as falling within the high risk category of sexual offending relative to other male sexual offenders.  I should mention, of course, that a supervision order is in no sense punishment.  It is designed, so far as it may reasonably do so, bearing in mind the civil rights of all citizens including the defendant, to protect the community from the risk of serious offences being committed by him, he having demonstrated in the most direct way the tendency to commit such offences.
11I am satisfied in the present case from the material provided and the reports supplied that the matters alleged, if proved, would justify the making of an extended supervision order.  Accordingly, it is appropriate to make the interim supervision order subject to the conditions specified in the schedule attached to the summons with the amendments which have been the subject of debate and, ultimately, agreement.  It is not necessary to further refer to these matters in this judgment.
12Accordingly, I make the orders in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of the summons.

		29 May 2014",2014-05-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705131,Grant v R [2014] NSWCCA 67,"Judgment

1THE COURT: Mr Barry Ronald Grant shot and killed Mr Jethro Matheson on 15 January 2009, and pleaded guilty to manslaughter and other crimes. He seeks leave to appeal against the sentence that was imposed on him on 15 September 2010 of 12 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months, in relation to the charge of manslaughter. The other sentences imposed on him, for cultivation and supply of cannabis, and unlawfully disposing of a body, have wholly or largely been served, and are not sought to be challenged. 

2We are of the view that leave should not be granted in relation to proposed Grounds 1, 3 and 4. However, leave should be granted and the appeal allowed on the basis of the proposed second ground of appeal. The second ground is that there was a miscarriage of justice following an admission made by Mr Grant's former solicitor who appeared for him at the sentencing hearing. The admission which should not have been made was that Mr Grant had intended to kill the deceased. 

3We first set out below the procedural and factual background, then address each of the proposed grounds, in the order referred to above, and then turn to resentencing Mr Grant.

Procedural background

4Mr Grant was arrested and charged with the two drug offences on 13 February 2009, and pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to them. He was subsequently charged with murder and was committed to the Supreme Court for trial. He offered to plead guilty to a charge of manslaughter, before he was committed, but his offer was not accepted by the Crown. When arraigned, he confirmed his pleas of guilty to the two drug charges, and pleaded not guilty to murder. Shortly before the commencement of the trial, an amended indictment charged him with manslaughter as an alternative to murder and added a charge of wilfully disposing of the body of Mr Matheson. Mr Grant pleaded guilty to the charge of manslaughter and of wilfully disposing of the body, and the Crown accepted those pleas in discharge of the amended indictment. 

5Thus Mr Grant ultimately pleaded guilty to the following four offences: 

1. That on or about 15 January 2009 at Condong he unlawfully killed Jethro Matheson;
2. That on or about 15 January 2009 at Condong and elsewhere in New South Wales he wilfully disposed of the dead body of Jethro Matheson, he having died a violent death, before the Coroner had had an opportunity of holding an inquest upon the dead body;
3. That between 15 and 17 January 2009 at Condong he cultivated not less than the large commercial quantity of prohibited plants, namely 1,549 cannabis plants; and
4. That at the same time and place he supplied a prohibited drug, namely 8.14 kilograms of cannabis.

6The plea was entered on 7 September 2010 and there was a sentencing hearing on 9 September 2010 during which Mr Grant was cross-examined extensively. On 15 September 2010, the primary judge sentenced Mr Grant for imprisonment for a term of 12 years, commencing 13 February 2011, with a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months, for manslaughter. His Honour imposed a fixed term of 1 year's imprisonment for unlawfully disposing of the body, which was wholly subsumed by the sentence for manslaughter. For the cultivation offence, the primary judge sentenced Mr Grant for imprisonment for 5 years and 4 months, with a non-parole period of 4 years, commencing 13 February 2009. The sentence for the supply offence was wholly subsumed within the sentence for cultivation.

7This application for leave is confined to the sentence for manslaughter. Two of the other three sentences have wholly expired, as has the non-parole period of the sentence for cultivation. A new solicitor, Mr Jason Hanna, was retained by the Legal Aid Commission on 15 November 2010. He sought and obtained a series of extensions of time within which to file an application for leave to appeal against sentence. The last of those extensions expired on 31 January 2013. The application for leave, supporting affidavits, and written submissions were filed on 19 March 2013. On Monday 2 December 2013 the Registrar extended the time to permit the late application. However, the delay remains relevant to proposed Ground 3.

Factual background

8There was no formal, signed, agreed statement of facts. At the sentencing hearing, the Crown tendered, and Mr John Weller, solicitor, who appeared for Mr Grant, expressly agreed with, the Crown Case Statement. The following matters are taken from that statement. 

9Mr Grant resided on a 7 acre property in Condong, in northern New South Wales. There were two sheds and a second residential dwelling on the property, in which no fewer than 1,549 cannabis plants were being cultivated. Police also found approximately 8 kilograms of dried cannabis and some ecstasy tablets on the property. 

10On 15 January 2009, the deceased and a friend, Mr Russo, travelled by car to Mr Grant's property with the intent of stealing cannabis from Mr Grant. Mr Matheson entered the open front door of the second dwelling where he confronted Mr Grant who produced and discharged a firearm twice. Both bullets hit the deceased in the chest. Mr Grant moved his arm and pointed the gun towards Mr Russo. Mr Matheson turned and ran from the room and pushed Mr Russo out of the way. Mr Russo fled the scene. He last saw his friend Mr Matheson rushing from the dwelling towards the road. 

11Mr Grant placed Mr Matheson's body in the rear of the tray of his Toyota Landcruiser and drove some 110 kilometres to the Border Ranges National Park near Kyogle. Telephone records indicated that Mr Grant's mobile phone was activated at 8.52pm on 15 January 2009 within the operational capacity of a mobile phone cell tower located in Kyogle. 

12Mr Grant's vehicle was set alight that weekend and recovered by police on 19 January 2009. A forensic examination of the vehicle revealed blood-like stains which were observed to be consistent with a dragging motion exiting the rear of the vehicle tray. Scientific analyses confirmed that it was the blood of the deceased. 

13Not until 30 January 2009 was the deceased's body found, resting against a tree approximately 20 metres below the roadway within the National Park. In the meantime, Mr Grant remained at large. He attended Byron Bay Police Station on 13 February 2009 in the company of his legal representative Mr Weller. He was cautioned, charged and bail was refused. He declined to participate in an ERISP with the police. On Tuesday 24 February 2009, Mr Grant was arrested at Grafton Police Station in relation to the murder of Jethro Matheson. He participated in an ERISP on that day. 

14A statement made by Mr Grant on 22 April 2009 of 8 pages and 30 paragraphs was tendered and he was cross-examined on it. That statement had been prepared by Mr Weller. It referred to financial difficulties Mr Grant had suffered as a banana farmer, and later strawberry farmer using a substantial hydroponics set-up, and his decision to use his hydroponics knowledge to grow cannabis in 2008. At the time his first batch of successful plants was reaching maturity, around August 2008, he said he was assaulted and seriously injured by two men who came to his property, one with a cane knife, the other with a steel hoe. Thereafter, he installed a security alarm and surveillance cameras and acquired a pistol and ammunition. He said that he had never possessed or used a pistol, although his father had always had a .22 rifle which he used around the farm. 

15The whole of his statement in relation to the events of 15 January 2009 was as follows:

""26. On the 15th of January late in the afternoon I had finished work and was sitting in the second house having a beer and a man burst in through the open door and ran at me with two hands above his head brandishing a crow bar and growling loudly. He was dressed in camouflage clothing and I recognised him as the man who threatened to kill me the last time I was attacked and I thought that this time he was going to kill me. I moved towards him with my hands up trying to stop him and he smashed the crow bar down on my head causing me to fall backwards. I struggled to my feet and I turned to run away, my only thought was to escape and I wasn't concerned about the cannabis, I just wanted to get away. Almost immediately I was struck again severely on my left shoulder and neck area. This blow pushed me towards the bench where I had the pistol. I got the gun and spun and said ""Stop"" but he kept rushing towards me and growling, as if he was crazy, holding the crow bar with both his hands above his head about to smash it down onto my head. I thought I was going to die and I had no other choice, to save my life I fired the pistol but he kept coming at me growling loudly, I was terrified and I fired it again. He stopped and turned and ran out the door. I stood shaking and then went to the door and saw him running down the driveway and I also saw a hand approximately 10 metres away go around the side of the house. 

27. I was injured and in shock and I wandered around and saw his body near my large shed and I could tell he was dead. I don't remember how long I stood there for I was in complete shock. I then panicked and put his body in the back of my truck and drove around for hours before leaving it in a forest area. 

28. I returned home and hid outside but didn't sleep all night, as I was extremely frightened that the other men that had been with the man I had shot would come back and kill me. 

29. On the 16th of January 2009 I was still in shock and very upset and frightened and in panic I decided to leave my farm and cannabis and go into hiding as I feared for my life. Prior to leaving the area I disposed of the firearm and my motor vehicle and arranged for the crow bar to be retained but due to circumstances beyond my control I don't know where it is at this time. 

30. On the 13th of February I voluntarily went to the Byron Bay Police Station and handed myself in to Police."" 

16Neither the firearm used by Mr Grant, nor the crowbar said to have been used by Mr Matheson, were recovered. Because Mr Grant went into hiding for four weeks, there was no independent evidence of the injuries he said he had suffered. As noted above, the vehicle was disposed of by its being set alight shortly after the incident. 

Application for leave to appeal against sentence

17Mr Grant's application for leave to appeal against sentence was confined to his sentence for manslaughter. By his amended grounds of appeal filed 3 December 2013, he relied upon four proposed grounds:

1. The findings of facts made by the sentencing Judge were not consistent with manslaughter based on excessive self-defence but were consistent with murder in breach of the rule in R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. 

2. There was a miscarriage of justice based on the admission made by the Applicant's legal representative concerning intent to kill as the basis for the plea of guilty having been entered. 

3. There was a miscarriage of justice based on the failure by the Applicant's legal representative to obtain background reports concerning the Applicant's condition at the time of the offence. 

4. The sentence imposed for the offence of manslaughter was manifestly excessive.

Proposed Grounds 2 and 3 raise factual questions about the conduct of the trial and in particular the quality and competency of Mr Grant's representation. The application for leave was listed for hearing on 6 December 2013. On that day, affidavits of Mr Grant and Mr Weller were read, and both men were cross-examined in relation to those two grounds. 

Evidence bearing on proposed Ground Two

18The Crown accepted a plea of guilty for manslaughter on the basis of excessive self-defence. The primary judge squarely asked Mr Weller (appearing for Mr Grant) these questions:

""His Honour: What was the intention then of the accused?

Mr Weller: Your Honour, he was in a situation - 

His Honour: What was the specific intent?

Mr Weller: The specific intent was to defend himself.

His Honour: What was the specific intent for murder? Did he intend to kill; did he intend to do grievous bodily harm; what is the position?

Mr Weller: Well, he intended to kill, your Honour.""

[NB. No transcript seems to have been provided for 7 September - this quote is taken from p 7 of the appellant's submissions]

19That was the unequivocal admission which is central to proposed Ground 2.

20Mr Grant was, naturally, present while this occurred. He swore in paragraphs 6-8 of an affidavit dated 31 October 2012 that:

""6. I did not instruct Mr Weller that I intended to kill the deceased as opposed to cause him grievous bodily harm. I did not want the deceased to die. I just wanted him to stop attacking me. I was not trying to kill him. 

7. I was trying to stop the deceased from hitting me over the head with the iron bar. I pointed the gun at him and said 'stop'. He kept coming towards me. I then shot at him to protect myself. He was about three metres away from me. After I shot at him the first time, he kept coming towards me so I shot at him a second time again to protect myself. As soon as he commenced to leave my home, I did not fire any further shots. When he left, I did not know he was going to die. If I was trying to kill him I would have kept on shooting him. 

8. I was in Court when Mr Weller made the admission that I intended to kill the deceased. I didn't understand a lot of what was being said during the proceedings. I certainly did not understand the significance of this admission that Mr Weller had made on my behalf. It was never discussed beforehand. It was never explained to me what it meant. If it had been explained to me I would have told Mr Weller that I intended to cause grievous bodily harm not to kill.""

21 When cross-examined in this Court he was asked:

""Q. ... did you then hear Justice Barr saying that you had an intention to kill?
A. I didn't take it - I didn't understand it at all, Miss. And I was never asked about any of it. 

Q. I suggest to you that that was because it was consistent with your instructions to Mr Weller?
A. That is not true at all. I was always protecting myself. I never meant to kill anyone, Miss.""

22He was also asked:

""Q. At the time, you considered yourself to be in a kill or be killed situation?
A. No Miss, I just wanted to defend myself. 

...

Q. You say that when you fired the gun first time he didn't stop?
A. No Miss.

Q. And you fired again?
A. I did because he was still attacking me.

Q. And you fired again?
A. Yes Miss.

Q. When you fired again you say he was just two metres away from you? 
A. Roughly that Miss.

Q. And you were terrified you say?
A. I was terrified yes. 

Q. I suggest to you that you didn't think that rather than kill him you thought I would just wound him?
A. I just wanted to stop him Miss. I wanted to stop him attacking me with the iron bar. 

Q. I suggest that you fired the gun, that you did not intend to do anything other than to kill him?
A. No Miss. I'm not a violent person like that. I was just trying to defend myself. 

Q. You were you say terrified and scared? 
A. Absolutely.

Q. I suggest to you that you did not measure what you needed to do was to harm and not kill?
A. I didn't want to kill him at all Miss no. I just wanted to stop him attacking me with the iron bar Miss.""

23Mr Grant denied that he gave instructions to Mr Weller that he found himself in a ""kill or be killed"" situation. He was not otherwise cross-examined about paragraph 8 of his affidavit.

24On the other hand, Mr Weller said that he had detailed instructions from Mr Grant on the issue of excessive self-defence. He said in his affidavit, which was admitted without objection, that the evidence given by Mr Grant was consistent with those instructions and the overall circumstances of the case ""namely, that [Mr Grant] instructed me he found himself in a kill or be killed situation created by a committed and very violent aggressor"". Mr Weller said that his response to the primary judge was consistent with those instructions, and his duty of candour to the Court. His affidavit stated that when asked by his Honour:

""15. ... my initial and subsequent responses were consistent with the entirety of the discussions I had with the Applicant and the overall circumstances of the Applicant's case (it was also consistent with my duty of candour to the Court) in particular -

(a) The Applicant shot the deceased twice in the chest area at close range. There was also evidence the offender had purchased the pistol for protection;

(b) The Applicant said in evidence that he knew he had killed the deceased ""What have I done? I have killed a man.""

(c) The Applicant's explanation for shooting the deceased was to ""Stop him"" - ""I just wanted to stop him"" because he thought unless he ""stopped him"" he would be killed.

(d) Clearly the only way to have stopped the deceased, given their antecedent encounter and extreme aggression shown by the deceased, was to use lethal force upon the deceased.

(e) The offender ""couldn't understand why I did what I did"" ie why he shot and killed the deceased.

16. In essence the Applicant's instructions were consistent with an episode whereby he had used excessive lethal force against the deceased to protect himself against and extremely violent, illegal drug robber who was determined to visit lethal physical damage upon the Applicant. The Applicant's instructions were clear that the only way to stop the deceased's violent attack was to resort to lethal force, manifestation of which was two gunshots to the chest of the deceased at close range."" 

25When being cross-examined, Mr Weller said that he made a deliberate decision not to include in the statement whether Mr Grant had an intention to kill or merely to cause grievous bodily harm. He said:

""I thought it was in his interests to have the emphasis on his real intention was to defend himself and stop this person and I took it no further than that. Similarly in the statement I didn't go into great detail about the disposal of the gun, the body or those matters.""

26Although Mr Weller maintained that he well appreciated the difference between an intention to kill and an intention to cause grievous bodily harm, he said:

""Well when I spoke to him about what went through his mind, he repeatedly stated that he wanted to stop the man, that was his primary intention and that he did everything possible to stop him and he was attacking him with this jemmy bar, and that's what was going through his mind and that it was only after he'd been cracked on the skull I think once in the back, when he grabbed the pistol that he then called ""Stop"". And then I questioned him quite strongly about then you shot him twice in the chest at close range and that's when he said, ""Well it was a kill or be killed situation but I never wanted it to happen"". That was the extent of the instructions, and the major focus of the affidavit was to really put emphasis on what I believed to be his real focus and intention was to save himself."" 

27Mr Weller maintained that he actually recalled the instructions that he was in a ""kill or be killed situation"". Mr Weller gave oral evidence that his notes of instructions given by Mr Grant had been sent by him to Legal Aid, when a new solicitor was appointed for the sentencing appeal. This Court was told that that oral evidence was the first time either party had been told, squarely, that there were contemporaneous notes of Mr Grant's instructions which had been sent to Legal Aid, although both parties told the Court that they had, without success, made informal attempts to obtain the file from Legal Aid. 

28Finally, Mr Weller was asked:

""Q. Do you accept that the admission that you made to the Supreme Court about intent to kill, was based on a judgment on your part rather than on any express instructions from him?

A. It partly was based on a judgment on my part, yes and partly on the discussions and the way that he described the attack and why he shot the way he did.""

No objection was taken to both Mr Grant and Mr Weller being cross-examined before this Court. Nevertheless, this should not necessarily be regarded as an endorsement of this practice: Mortada v R [2014] NSWCCA 36 at [57]. 

29The hearing was adjourned, to permit a subpoena to the Legal Aid Commission for Mr Weller's file to be issued and complied with. That caused delay. However, against the chance that there was a contemporaneous note of the instructions said to have been given by Mr Grant to Mr Weller as to his intent when he shot and killed Mr Matheson, and given the diametrically opposed evidence of Mr Grant and Mr Weller, and the importance of the issue to both of them, that course seemed necessary and appropriate, and was acceded to by the parties. 

30Although the matter was re-listed in January 2014 to be allocated a date in February (which occurred), the hearing could not resume until March (through faultless unavailability of counsel appearing for the Crown, which was accommodated by the applicant). There was no production by the Legal Aid Commission, but, in accordance with this Court's directions, an affidavit was served explaining what steps had been taken to search for the file and that there was no record of it being received. The affidavit also confirmed that the Commission had received an application for a grant of legal aid on 9 November 2010 (the day of the sentencing hearing) and had assigned it to Mr Hanna on 15 November 2010 (the day sentence was imposed). The interrelationship of this timing was otherwise unexplored in the evidence. 

31In relation to proposed Ground 3, as to the absence of any psychological or psychiatric evidence, there was also conflicting evidence given in this Court by Mr Grant and Mr Weller. It will be convenient to deal with this evidence when addressing that ground.

Proposed Ground One: did the findings of fact contravene the rule in R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383

32This proposed ground of appeal is:

""The findings of fact made by the sentencing judge were not consistent with manslaughter based on excessive self-defence but were consistent with murder in breach of the rule in R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383.""

33The primary judge made it plain that he either rejected or was sceptical of important aspects of Mr Grant's evidence. Mr Grant's submissions identified three matters in particular. The first was the rejection of his evidence that he had purchased a pistol and ammunition ""on the spur of the moment"". Mr Grant had given evidence that he was not looking for a gun, but was considering measures by which he could protect himself. The primary judge was sceptical, doubting that ""somebody at the hotel happened to mention that somebody else at the hotel had a firearm for sale"". His Honour formed and expressed the view that the steps taken by Mr Grant were carefully thought out. 

34Secondly, his Honour was sceptical as to whether Mr Grant had been attacked by a crowbar. The friend to whom he said he had given the crowbar for safekeeping was not named and there was no independent evidence of any instrument used by the deceased, or of any injury received by Mr Grant. His Honour said:

""It is possible that he is telling the truth about those matters, though I am left unsure because I am not confident that he has always told the truth."" 

35Thirdly, his Honour rejected a submission that the fact that the pistol was at hand was ""in some way fortuitous or unplanned"". His Honour said:

""While I do not doubt that the events of that occasion happened quickly, I am not satisfied that it was by accident or good fortune that the offender was able to seize the pistol. I think that he was prepared to meet the deceased and acted as he had intended ever since he bought the pistol and ammunition.""

36Counsel for Mr Grant conceded, properly, that it was open to the primary judge to reject aspects of his evidence. However, it was not open for his Honour to reject the plea of guilty that he had entered, which had been accepted by the Crown, and it was not open to the primary judge to sentence Mr Grant in relation to facts consistent with murder rather than manslaughter. Mr Grant relied on the statement in De Simoni at 389:

"" ... a judge, in imposing sentence, is entitled to consider all the conduct of the accused, including that which would aggravate the offence, but cannot take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence.""

37This was described in Magaming v The Queen [2013] HCA 40; 87 ALJR 1060 at [15] as a common law principle of sentencing. It is a consequence of the fact that the court is sentencing the offender for the offence, and not some different offence for which the offender was not charged or convicted: Elias v The Queen; Issa v The Queen [2013] HCA 31; 248 CLR 483 at [26]. If such circumstances are taken into account, then an extraneous or irrelevant consideration will have affected the sentencing decision: R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 195 at [52]. 

38This proposed ground falls to be assessed in the light of a fair reading of the reasons as a whole, which are not to be subjected to minute scrutiny in the search of error: see for example Fisher v R [2008] NSWCCA 129 at [24]. Read as a whole, the sentencing remarks disclose no such error. We deal with each of the three matters raised by Mr Grant in turn.

39In respect of the first matter, immediately after the primary judge expressed scepticism about the existence of the crowbar and the injuries inflicted by the deceased, his Honour said:

""However, I am satisfied that the deceased was a violent and frightening man who attacked the offender in August 2008 and on the occasion of the shooting. I do not doubt that the offender was afraid of him. I do not doubt that one of his reasons for maintaining a loaded pistol was to protect himself. The Crown's acceptance of the plea of guilty of manslaughter requires a finding that the offender acted as he did because he believed it necessary to do so.""

40Similarly, in relation to his Honour's scepticism that Mr Grant came by the pistol less serendipitously than described in his evidence, his Honour expressly accepted that Mr Grant ""was, of course, concerned about his own safety"" although adding that there was more at stake, namely, protecting his commercial interest in the cannabis crop. 

41In relation to the third matter, although his Honour found that Mr Grant was ""prepared to meet the deceased and acted as he had intended ever since he bought the pistol and ammunition"", that finding is not inconsistent with Mr Grant acting because he believed it necessary to do so in order to defend himself. 

42As the Crown observed, there is a vast range of circumstances affecting culpability in the case of manslaughter. His Honour was therefore required to make findings on the key facts leading up to Mr Matheson's death, including the acquisition of the weapon, the circumstances in which Mr Matheson attacked Mr Grant, and how Mr Grant came to shoot him. It is plain from the sentencing remarks that his Honour was conscious of the factual matters essential to the plea. Further, an element of premeditation in Mr Grant's acquisition of the weapon and ammunition is not inconsistent with the use of excessive self-defence when he was attacked by two men intent on harming him and stealing his crop. The rejection of parts of Mr Grant's testimony did not amount to a rejection of his plea of guilty to manslaughter. Nor did it result in the imposition of a sentence on facts consistent with murder. We would not grant leave to raise this ground. 

Proposed Ground Three: failure to obtain background reports

43Mr Grant had sworn in his affidavit dated 31 October 2012 that Mr Weller had advised him that ""this is a straightforward case and a psychologist report is not needed"". 

44Mr Weller denied that at any time he had formed the opinion that there was a need for a psychologist's report. He said that Mr Grant had no history of mental health issues, had the strong support and love from his ex-wife and children, and said that ""[t]here was nothing about his demeanour or his ability to recall information that suggested a need for or reference to psychological or psychiatric intervention"". 

45For the purpose of advancing this ground, two expert reports were tendered: that of Ms Laura Durkin, forensic psychologist, and that of Dr Jonathon Adams, forensic psychiatrist. The first was based upon a three hour interview at the Lithgow Correctional Centre on 18 October 2012, the second was based upon an interview by audiovisual link on 29 January 2013. Both experts drew attention, very properly, to the difficulty they had in expressing opinions as to Mr Grant's mental state in January 2009 based solely upon his interviews some four years later.

46Ms Durkin said that Mr Grant described symptoms commensurate with the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the period after August 2008 (he said that he was bedridden for at least two to three weeks after the assault in August 2008, he described hypervigilance (barricading his doors and windows) and hypersensitivity and difficulties with sleep). Ms Durkin made it clear that ""Mr Grant does not meet criteria for PTSD currently"".

47Similarly, Dr Adams said that Mr Grant's account was ""in my opinion in keeping with the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder"", but added:

""It must be borne in mind that my formulation of Mr Grant's clinical presentation at this time is based primarily upon his account, which in part is explained by the lack of collateral information due to Mr Grant reportedly not informing others of his mental state.""

48Both Ms Durkin and Dr Adams referred to Mr Grant's account of heavy consumption of alcohol after the attack in August 2008, and occasional cannabis use. 

49The starting point for the evaluation of proposed Ground 3 is that this is evidence which was not before the primary judge. Although the reports of 2012 and 2013 only came into existence after the sentencing, they are in the category of ""new"", as opposed to ""fresh"", evidence: they are directed to opinion evidence of Mr Grant's state of mind at the time he killed Mr Matheson. The probative value of the evidence is, plainly enough, diminished by the passage of time. 

50The matter was assigned to Mr Grant's current solicitor on 15 November 2010. The material before this Court does not disclose when the view was formed that this ground might be advanced; it discloses only that counsel had advised, some time prior to 4 October 2012, that a psychologist report be obtained. To the extent that there is any merit in the ground, it is a ground that required no exhaustive examination of the record before it could be investigated: it was obvious on the face of the tender list, or upon reading the transcript of the sentencing hearing or remarks, that no such expert evidence had been obtained. Given the lack of detail on this point in Mr Hanna's affidavit, which was directed to obtaining an extension of time, the Court proceeds on the basis that there was no good explanation for the extensive delay in obtaining expert evidence. 

51The applicable principles were reviewed in this Court in Monteiro v R [2011] NSWCCA 113, PFC v R [2011] NSWCCA 275, Winter v R [2013] NSWCCA 231 and Outram v R [2013] NSWCCA 329. All four judgments confirmed the continuing applicability of what Gleeson CJ had said in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 683 and 685:

""As a general rule, a party is bound by the conduct of his or her counsel, and counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are conducted. Decisions as to what witnesses to call, what questions to ask or not to ask, what lines of argument to pursue and what points to abandon, are all matters within the discretion of counsel and frequently involve difficult problems of judgment, including judgment as to tactics. The authorities concerning the rights and duties of counsel are replete with emphatic statements which stress both the independent role of the barrister and the binding consequences for the client of decisions taken by a barrister in the course of running a case. 

...

... As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence.

... However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of 'flagrant incompetence' of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.""

52The question ultimately is whether what occurred or did not occur at the trial occasioned a miscarriage of justice: TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 at [79] (McHugh J); Ali v The Queen [2005] HCA 8; 214 ALR 1 at [18] (Hayne J); Matthews v R [2013] NSWCCA 187 at [62]. 

53In TKWJ, Gaudron J, with whom Gummow and Hayne JJ agreed, said (at [29]) that failures by defence counsel had traditionally been said to involve ""flagrant incompetence"", ""egregious error"", ""extreme conduct"" or ""significant fault"", but noted that the ultimate question was that posed by s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, namely, whether the act or omission resulted in a miscarriage of justice: at [30]-[31]. McHugh J made the same point at [83], after saying at [79]:

""The critical issue in an appeal like the present is not whether counsel erred in some way but whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred. However, 'whether counsel has been negligent or otherwise remiss ... remains relevant as an intermediate or subsidiary issue'. That is because the issue of miscarriage of justice in such cases ordinarily subsumes two issues. First, did counsel's conduct result in a material irregularity in the trial? Second, is there a significant possibility that the irregularity affected the outcome? ... The appellant must show that the failing or error of counsel was a material irregularity and that there is a significant possibility that it affected the outcome of the trial.""

54More recent decisions have emphasised that it is not ordinarily for the appellate court to review the decisions made by counsel at trial: Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; 162 A Crim R 301 at [8]; KLM v Western Australia [2009] WASCA 73; 194 A Crim R 503 at [51].

55Most recently, these principles were considered by Schmidt J, with whom Beazley P and RA Hulme J agreed, in Tran v R [2014] NSWCCA 32, by reference to Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118 at [104]-[110]. Those principles include:

1. The general principle that parties to litigation, including criminal litigation, are bound by the manner in which their cases are presented at first instance and will not be permitted to enhance their cases on appeal by producing fresh, or new, evidence: R v Birks; R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 at 377.

2. That general principle applies no less to applications for leave to appeal against sentence than it does to conviction appeals: Khoury at [104]. 

3. The rule is far from absolute, particularly in criminal cases, having regard to the need to accommodate the interests of justice. A ""distinct sub-set of principles"" has evolved in relation to the admission and use of additional evidence on applications for leave to appeal against sentence: Khoury at [105]. 

4. ""Fresh"" evidence is evidence of which the accused was unaware at the time of his trial and which could not have been discovered with reasonable diligence: Lawless v The Queen (1979) 142 CLR 659 at 675; Khoury at [107]. ""New"" evidence is evidence which was available, or could with reasonable diligence have been obtained, at trial. 

56At [116]-[117] in Khoury, Simpson J said: 

""[116] In Abbott, one relevant consideration was that the applicant had been incompetently represented, with the result that evidence that could have been available as to her psychiatric condition was not presented. Similar arguments were, on the facts, rejected in R v Goodwin (1990) 51 A Crim R 328 and Stumbles. 

[117] Caution must be exercised in the admission of the evidence. As I have already indicated, in Lanham, it was held that a proper basis for the admission of the evidence must be established. In Ehrenburg, Loveday J, with whom Gleeson CJ agreed, described the case as ""most unusual""; Samuels JA, who also agreed, cautioned against allowing sympathy to lead the Court, against its duty to the community, to make an error of principle. In Ashton, Howie J warned that the Court must be careful to maintain a principled approach in dealing with appeals before it, and be scrupulous to ensure that there is a proper basis for receiving evidence of events that occur after sentence where there is no error established in the sentence imposed.""

57In Khoury, the approach taken was that a combination of circumstances, principally the inadequacy of the legal advice given to the applicant, and the strength of the proposed evidence led to the evidence being received. That was a case where counsel had said that it ""did not occur to him to call psychiatric evidence"", and where it was not suggested that there was the level of incompetence referred to in Birks and Abbott. The evidence disclosed that Mr Khoury, who had functioned effectively as a parish priest, was of low level intellectual functioning, which Simpson J regarded ""as an extremely relevant circumstance had it been made known to the sentencing judge"": at [146]. 

58In the present case, there is nothing to suggest that Mr Weller had failed in any material way to discharge his obligations to conduct the sentencing hearing. Moreover, the proposed new evidence is remarkable for its lack of probative value, not least because for reasons unexplained it has taken years to obtain it. Principally because of that delay, neither expert has been able to express a view that Mr Grant was suffering from a mental disorder in 2009; their evidence, in essence, is that years after the event he described to them symptoms consistent with PTSD.

59Mr Grant has failed to make out a case for the belated reception of new evidence which was available at the sentencing hearing. Even if he had made out such a case, the evidence is not such as to indicate that there has been a miscarriage of justice. Leave should not be granted to raise this proposed ground of appeal.

Proposed Ground Four: was the sentence manifestly excessive?

60In light of our conclusions in relation to Ground 2, and the need to resentence, it is unnecessary to determine this ground. The same issues (and more) fall to be considered by reason of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The same economical approach was adopted in Crawford v R [2013] NSWCCA 269 at [47] and HJ v R [2014] NSWCCA 21 at [83].

Proposed Ground Two: miscarriage of justice through wrong admission of intent to kill

61It was entirely correct for the primary judge to ask Mr Weller, appearing for Mr Grant, whether his client intended to kill Mr Matheson or merely intended to cause grievous bodily harm. When Mr Weller, unequivocally, answered the former, it was entirely correct for his Honour to sentence on that basis. This proposed ground of appeal turns centrally on whether this Court can and should go behind what Mr Grant's former advocate told the Court. As earlier recounted, evidence on this issue from both Mr Grant and Mr Weller was given, and tested, in this Court. 

62It is best to return to first principles. The Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) defines murder and manslaughter in s 18. Relevantly, s 18(1) defines murder where the act of the accused causing the death charged was done with reckless indifference to human life, or with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. However, other provisions provide that a killing which otherwise would amount to murder is to be treated as manslaughter; as was said in R v Lavender [2005] HCA 37; 222 CLR 67 at [2]: 

""In cases of voluntary manslaughter, on the other hand, the elements of murder are present, but the culpability of the offender's conduct is reduced by reason of provocation, or substantial impairment by abnormality of mind.""

63In addition to ss 23 and 23A, which will result in conviction for manslaughter when there is provocation or substantial impairment by abnormality of mind, s 421 of the Crimes Act reflects a third species of voluntary manslaughter, namely where the excessive self-defence of the accused has caused a death. It is this section, which was enacted so as to reverse the change in law effected by Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) (1987) 162 CLR 645, which is presently relevant. It applies, relevantly, where the person uses force that involves the infliction of death, and the conduct is not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them, but nevertheless the person believes the conduct is necessary to defend himself or herself or another person. In those circumstances, s 421(2) provides that:

""The person is not criminally responsible for murder but, on a trial for murder, the person is to be found guilty of manslaughter if the person is otherwise criminally responsible for manslaughter.""

64The operation of these provisions was most recently restated in Lane v R [2013] NSWCCA 317 at [50], where this Court said (emphasis added):

""For voluntary manslaughter to be proved, it is necessary that the Crown first prove all of the elements of murder ... With respect to s 23, if there is evidence that the act causing death was done or omitted to be done under provocation (as defined) the onus is on the prosecution to prove something additional - that the act was not done under provocation. Similarly, with respect to s 421, if the defence of self defence is raised, the onus is on the prosecution to prove that the act causing death was not done in self defence. The essential thing is that, before voluntary manslaughter can even be considered, all of the elements of murder must be proved.""

65Mr Grant's plea of guilty to manslaughter on the basis of excessive self-defence meant acceptance by Mr Grant that a reasonable person in his position would not have considered that his response was reasonable in the circumstances. Conversely, its acceptance by the Crown also meant that the Crown accepted the reasonable possibility that Mr Grant genuinely believed that it was necessary to shoot Mr Matheson in order to defend himself.

66What is more, Mr Grant's plea of guilty also meant that he accepted that he held one of the mental states sufficient to amount to murder, but for the availability of s 421. That meant an acceptance that he intended to kill, or to cause grievous bodily harm to, Mr Matheson, or else had acted with reckless indifference (the latter may be put to one side for present purposes, having regard to the evidence adduced on this appeal). Hence his Honour's repeated questions of Mr Weller as to Mr Grant's intent, including the question ""What was the specific intent for murder?"" 

67Mr Grant was originally charged with murder, and subsequently, with manslaughter. Mr Weller was acting for him at all relevant times. The propositions in the previous two paragraphs are basic.

68This proposed ground is not directed to some contestable forensic decision, such as whether to lead particular evidence from Mr Grant, or call a character witness, or cross-examine on a particular basis, where the difficulties referred to in the principles extracted above loom large. It is notoriously difficult to re-assess from the written record available to an appellate court the circumstances leading to such choices, and it is often the case that there is no axiomatically right or wrong approach to questions of that nature. This is one reason why, as Basten JA said in Lee v R [2013] NSWCCA 68 at [139], that ""statements as to counsel's beliefs are of doubtful relevance"" in an appeal. 

69To the contrary, proposed Ground 2 is directed to something which is basal. Mr Grant's plea necessarily accepted that he had killed Mr Matheson with an intent which, but for his excessive self-defence, would amount to murder. His state of mind at the time was crucially, and manifestly, relevant to sentence. His plea was consistent either with an intention to kill, or an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. The primary judge entirely properly and predictably asked Mr Weller for his position on that basic issue. 

70Yet the transcript conveys the impression that Mr Weller did not at the time of the sentencing hearing appreciate the distinction. Why else did the judge have to ask three times for the accused's intention before the answer ""Well, he intended to kill, your Honour"" was given? The impression gained from reading the exchange is that the question itself, and the fact that its answer was regarded as highly material by the sentencing judge, came as something of a surprise to Mr Weller.

71That impression was confirmed by Mr Weller's evidence in this Court, salient aspects of which are reproduced above, and in particular his evidence that Mr Grant repeatedly stated that his primary intention was to stop Mr Matheson. The inference to be drawn is that Mr Weller did not explain to his client the distinction between the two states of mind, both of which were consistent with manslaughter, and also with wanting to stop his attacked, and did not obtain clear instructions on this basic issue. 

72That impression is in no way undermined by the cross-examination of Mr Grant on the nature of the instructions he gave and the circumstances in which they were given. Although Mr Grant was cross-examined extensively on his state of mind when he shot Mr Matheson, he was scarcely cross-examined on his evidence (notably, paragraph 8 of his affidavit of 31 October 2012, reproduced above) directed to what he had been told by Mr Weller and the instructions he gave.

73It is not necessary for the purposes of this appeal to resolve the dispute between Mr Weller and Mr Grant as to whether the latter said that it was a ""kill or be killed"" situation. Let it be assumed, favourably to Mr Weller, as he repeatedly maintained (to the extent of saying he had an actual recollection), that that was how Mr Grant put it. We accept Mr Weller's evidence that ""[t]hat was the extent of the instructions"" and that, consequently, Mr Weller was exercising his own judgment in conveying to the primary judge that his client had an intention to kill. 

74The conclusion drawn by Mr Weller based on those instructions was not an inevitable one. ""Kill or be killed"" is a colloquial and evocative turn of phrase which is often used metaphorically rather than literally. It connotes a state of mind whereby Mr Grant felt that he was fighting for his life; cf R v Jones [2007] NSWSC 1333 at [76] and needed to stop Mr Matheson. But it does not inevitably connote that Mr Grant intended to kill his attacker. 

75We also reject the Crown submission, advanced in writing, that in the circumstances of this case, an intention to cause grievous bodily harm as opposed to an intention to kill was ""not material of such significance that the sentencing judge would have regarded it as having a real bearing upon his decision"". To be fair, counsel for the Crown made no attempt orally to support it. 

76Generally, an intention to kill reflects greater culpability than an intention to cause grievous bodily harm: Apps v R [2006] NSWCCA 290 at [49]. Whilst that is not inevitably so: see R v Hillsley [2006] NSWCCA 312 at [16], it is difficult to contemplate a case of excessive self-defence on the offender's own property where his or her state of mind would not be material. But in any event, it is clear that in the circumstances of this case, the gravity of Mr Grant's offence was affected by whether he intended to stop Mr Matheson's attack by killing him, or by causing him grievous bodily harm. 

77Here it was basic that Mr Weller had to obtain clear instructions about his client's state of mind. That did not occur. The primary judge was satisfied of an intention to kill because of Mr Weller's statement. That intention was not something otherwise proven beyond reasonable doubt, bearing in mind the circumstances of the shooting. Although the firing of two shots to the chest was consistent with such an intent, it was also consistent with Mr Grant's evidence in this Court, namely, an intent to cause grievous bodily harm so as to prevent Mr Matheson's imminent attack. Mr Grant's intent was material to the sentence imposed by his Honour. Mr Grant was entitled, on this basic point, to have his position correctly conveyed to the primary judge. There was in the circumstances a miscarriage of justice engaging the principles referred to in dealing with proposed Ground 3 above. In our view this ground is made out.

Is a lesser sentence warranted in law and resentencing

78On any view, this was a serious case of manslaughter. The occasion for the manslaughter came about because of Mr Grant's decision to grow commercial quantities of cannabis. As the primary judge put it ""Matheson wasn't going to come back, if he uprooted the crop and went back to strawberries"". The decision to purchase a pistol, and ammunition, was a deliberate one. It was accompanied by a decision to acquire surveillance cameras. 

79The primary judge said, with respect entirely correctly, that:

""[Mr Grant] could, by destroying or abandoning the crop or by reporting the matter to the authorities, have forestalled the confrontation he believed would arise. Instead, he took measures highly likely to lead to injury or death. It was carried out as part of a plan to protect a commercial criminal interest. It involved the use of a firearm.""

80Mr Matheson's death was immediately followed by deliberately dealing with the body in a way calculated to prevent a proper investigation of the circumstances of death. For that reason, the primary judge made the sentence on the count of wrongfully dealing with the body concurrent with the non-parole period of the sentence for manslaughter, but the same considerations heighten the seriousness of the manslaughter offence. 

81The maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years: Crimes Act, s 18(1)(b). There is no established range of sentences for manslaughter. The crime is ""almost unique in its protean character as an offence"": R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377 at [133]. 

82In determining the question posed by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, namely, whether a lesser sentence is required in law, this Court must have regard to evidence before it post-dating the sentencing hearing: Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 154; 159 A Crim R 154. That evidence discloses that Mr Grant has been in prison for slightly more than five years, since 12 February 2009. He is now 56. He has not committed any prison offences, and has made steady advances in classification. He was diagnosed, in 2013, with a benign brain tumour, which may require surgery in order to prevent it pressing upon his optic nerve. He has also been diagnosed with Addison's disease, which requires treatment with medication (with which he has been supplied while in prison).

83Those matters, coupled with the consideration that Mr Grant should be sentenced on the basis that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased, lead us to conclude that a lesser sentence than the 12 years imposed for Mr Matheson's death is warranted by law. That sentence will nevertheless reflect the fact that this was a serious case of manslaughter, that a man's life has been taken, that it only occurred through Mr Grant's long term plan to profit from serious criminal activity, and that the potential for causing grievous bodily harm was brought about by his acquisition of a pistol and ammunition. Mr Grant's crime warrants denunciation, considerations of general deterrence are significant, and the substantial harm done to the victim and the community should be reflected in this Court's sentence. 

84On the other hand, Mr Grant is now 56 and is unlikely to re-offend. His offer to plead guilty to manslaughter was made at an early stage, and he is entitled to the maximum allowance for the utilitarian value of the plea. 

85Like the sentencing judge, we do not think that special circumstances have been made out to warrant a longer non-parole period. He was not a person of good character. The primary judge found that he was a serious producer of cannabis, from whom the New South Wales Crime Commission extracted $20,000 by way of criminally derived assets. In this Court, Mr Grant said that he paid $60,000, plus $20,000 cash, in legal fees to Mr Weller. Although Mr Grant's illnesses if they were more serious might tend to support a finding of special circumstances, the evidence is that at present he is receiving adequate medical treatment within the prison system. 

86The primary judge accumulated the manslaughter sentence so that it overlapped very substantially with the cultivation sentence. Since this appeal is confined to the manslaughter sentence, there is no occasion to depart from his Honour's decision, nor did Mr Grant contend that this Court should do so.

87For this reason, we grant leave in respect of Ground 2, allow the appeal and set aside the manslaughter sentence imposed on 15 September 2010. The sentence this Court imposes is one of imprisonment for a period of 10 years, commencing from 13 February 2011. The non-parole period is 7 years and 6 months, commencing 13 February 2011 and expiring on 12 August 2018. The balance of the term is 2 years and 6 months, expiring 12 February 2021. The earliest date upon which Mr Grant is eligible for release to parole is 12 August 2018.

2705134,Lane v R [2014] NSWDC 102,"Judgment

1This is a case where the paperwork comprises only a few pages and the prosecution and the defence are in essential agreement about the outcome. But the case raises some serious issues for a sentencing judge. What will not be recorded in the transcript is that I have spent some minutes in silence on the Bench considering what my options are and what I should do. It raises the issues of the tension which always exists for a sentencing judge between the need for deterring offenders from committing further crimes; deterring other members of the community from committing crimes; protection of the community and those who are at the front line of protecting the community; rehabilitation; as well as the perennial question of mercy for a judge to take into account. This is the stuff of justice which a judge has to administer. Some cases, although quite short, can raise these fundamental issues very starkly. 

2The case I have to decide is an appeal. It is an appeal by Troy Lane. He was given a month gaol sentence by Magistrate Grogan sitting at the Local Court at Walgett on 25 September 2013. Troy Lane had pleaded guilty to a crime called intimidating police. That is an offence under s 60(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and Parliament has fixed a maximum of 5 years imprisonment to that crime. The jurisdictional limit of his Honour, however, was 2 years. The seriousness of the offence will become apparent once I start describing it. 

3It was Troy Lane's 20th birthday. He lived in Goodooga. He was celebrating and had had too much to drink. He went to the local hotel and the barman saw that he was too drunk and denied him service. He tried to climb over the bar. The barman sensibly told him that he would call the police. He got upset and said ""Fuck this, I'm going down there."" 

4Troy Lane then left the hotel and walked down to the Goodooga Police Station. Senior Constable Bennett and his partner were inside the police residence at the police station. They heard Troy Lane yelling outside. They saw him standing about two metres in front of the house with his shirt off and his hands raised. He was actually standing in the front yard of the police residence. He was yelling out ""Graham you cunt, come out here and fight me, you cunt. I heard you want a piece of me, well here I am you cunt so come out and fight me"". He looked very agitated and kept kicking and punching the Colorbond fence next to the police residence. He tried to get in but could not because of a bolt. He got more upset at that and started yelling out again loudly ""Come on you cunt, get out here."" He got hold of both gates and shook them, he kicked them and punched them. 

5The facts agreed between the prosecution and the defence, which are part of exhibit A, then say that the ""force of the accused shaking these gates so violently could be felt inside the nearby police residence."" He had another attempt to get through a gate but fortunately that was padlocked. Senior Constable Bennett left the police residence and ordered Troy Lane to leave the private police premises immediately. Troy Lane's response was to raise his fists in a boxing stance. He continued to threaten and intimidate the police officer. The facts record that he was ""yelling in a loud aggressive and uncontrollable manner"" further abusive words which were ""Ya nothing but a fucking cunt, I'll fight you, come out here you white copper cunt"". Bravely, Senior Constable Bennett called out, ""How dare you come here and threaten me at my private residence, now leave or you'll get locked up"". Troy Lane continued to yell at and threaten the police officer as well as punching and kicking the fence. Fortunately, a few moments later a car arrived. Obviously they were men who knew Troy Lane. They calmed him down and pulled him away. 

6The facts go on to record that as ""a result of this incident, the partner of Senior Constable Bennett was visibly shaken and upset by the threatening nature of the accused and the prolonged attempts he made to gain access to the private police residence."" Troy Lane had damaged the fence of the police residence. Although compensation is asked for, there is no detail before me for such a claim and apparently not before his Honour, the learned Magistrate. 

7The facts record that it is ""the view of Senior Constable Bennett that it is a gross display of disrespect that the accused act in a manner he acted towards Senior Constable Bennett and his partner by attempting to gain access to the private police residence. It was evidence that if access was gained, the accused would assault the sole police officer who was off duty at this time"". Senior Constable Bennett was quite right in expressing that view. It was not only a gross display of disrespect but a serious crime. 

8There are reasons for Parliament enacting legislation for crimes such as this. Police officers form the frontline of protection for other members of the community. It is the police officers who put themselves in the line of fire so that general members of the community can feel safe and secure and get about their own business. This must be particularly so, and this is one of the factors which concerns me most, in an isolated police station in a country town. Senior Constable Bennett was there, off duty, and with his partner. Despite this he was threatened and intimidated over an extended period of time. 

9I at first thought that s 21A(2)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) would apply as an aggravating factor but Mr C Dane, who appears for Troy Lane before me, corrected me appropriately because the offence itself concerns Parliament ensuring the protection of a police officer. In other words, the maximum penalty which has been fixed has taken into account that the offence is committed against a police officer. 

10I can quite understand his Honour imposing a sentence of 1 month imprisonment. The maximum is 5 years which would be for the most extreme case. On one view, a sentence of 1 month might be regarded as lenient. The available limit of 2 years to his Honour is a jurisdictional limit. I still must look at the seriousness of the offence by reference to the maximum of 5 years which Parliament regards as appropriate for the most serious kind of offence of this nature. 

11It has been said many times that one of the roles of a sentencing court is to impose penalties which will back up and support police officers in the role which they perform in protecting the community. That is why I can understand the sentence imposed. Such a sentence is important for not only stopping Troy Lane from doing such a thing again but would hopefully be taken into account by others who might think of committing the same offence. It is also a sentence which would serve to support the role of the police officer. 

12On the other hand - and this is where the tension arises - I am a sentencing judge and it is my job to take into account not only the seriousness of the crime but the circumstances of the individual who committed it. Troy Lane literally turned 20 on that day. He was a young man. When I look at his criminal record it contains only two offences; one was a traffic offence and the other was possessing a prohibited drug. He was fined for both offences. He comes before the Court as a young man who has no history of violent offending or assaults against the police whatsoever. 

13Mr Dane who appears for Mr Lane drew my attention to the need for a sentencing judge to take into account rehabilitation as well as the need to punish an offender. That is especially so when dealing with younger people. The Courts well know that young men who are yet to reach maturity and affected by alcohol can behave in very offensive ways. Not only was Troy Lane's behaviour very offensive but it was a serious crime committed against a person charged with a duty of protecting the community that he lived in. 

14A judge always pauses and then pauses again before sending a person into full time gaol for the first time. That causes me great concern. Although on one view, Troy Lane deserves a short sharp stint in full time custody because of what he did on that night, other factors point against that, namely, his own rehabilitation and the obvious fact that sending him to gaol means that he has a gaol sentence on his record which a future judge or magistrate would take into account. It also would expose him to influences which may, at his young age, lead him in the wrong direction in his life. He is apparently employed or obtains employment as a shearer when it is available. 

15I had thought that one option would be to suspend the 1 month sentence imposed by his Honour. Ms T Hennessy who appears for the respondent Director of Public Prosecutions correctly pointed out that it would leave too little time for supervision and the rehabilitation that Troy Lane obviously needs so far as mixing alcohol and his bad behaviour. I then thought of perhaps warning Mr Troy Lane that I propose to increase the sentence to 6 months or more and then imposing a suspended sentence. That option had many attractions but it was still a prison sentence which a future judicial officer may take into account. 

16I have to bear in mind that this is the first significant offence which Troy Lane has committed and hopefully the last. To receive a prison sentence for his first offence is a significant step for a judicial officer to take. Both Ms Hennessy and Mr Dane have suggested a good behaviour bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. They point to the fact that Troy Lane could be supervised and get assistance with issues such as alcohol and anger management. That option has a lot of appeal so far as Troy Lane's rehabilitation is concerned. Regrettably, it has very little appeal so far as punishment is concerned. Troy Lane must understand that he has committed a very serious crime. 

17Once again, I am confronted by the difficulty of imposing a sentence and suspending it or giving him a good behaviour bond. On balance, because of his young age and because of the fact that this is his first significant offence, I am going to favour imposing upon him a good behaviour bond. I am going to allow his appeal and give him a bond instead of a prison sentence.

18The formal orders which I make are these. Under s 20(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW), I determine this appeal against sentence by setting aside the sentence. Instead of that sentence and instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment, I make an order directing Troy Lane to enter into a good behaviour bond for 18 months. The good behaviour bond will have the following conditions: 

(1)That he be of good behaviour.
(2)That he notify the Registrar of this Court of any change in his residential address.
(3)That he attend Court if he receives a notice to do so.
(4)That he accepts supervision from the Community Corrections Office and any reasonable recommendations and directions from officers at that Service particularly with regard to anger management and alcohol issues. 

For that purpose he should report to the Community Corrections Office at Coonamble on or before this Friday, 9 May 2014. 

HIS HONOUR: Stand up, Troy Lane. 

19You have won your appeal and I have heard what Mr Dane has said on your behalf but you are so lucky to win your appeal. I think the Magistrate in a lot of ways did the right thing to send you to gaol for what you did to that police officer whose job is to look after the community and you scared the wits out of him and his partner and I am not surprised that you got the gaol sentence. But because of what Mr Dane said and Ms Hennessy acknowledged - your young age and the fact that you do not have any serious convictions, which is a credit to you - I am giving you a good behaviour bond for 18 months. You have got to stay out of trouble. That means no drink driving, no brawling, no dope or cannabis or stuff like that being found because if you breach your good behaviour bond you come back before me and I am the one who will remember what you did. If you change your address you have got to write or email to the Court here and tell them so they know where you are and if you get a notice in the mail to come to Court, you turn up and you let Community Corrections Office, the old Probation and Parole, look after you, manage you. Mr Dane will tell you where to go. You have got to go there by Friday and you let them supervise you so far as grog questions are concerned and your behaviour and anger management because the combination of the grog and your behaviour is why you are standing here in front of me and very lucky not to be in gaol. Do you understand that? All right. I expect you will stay out of trouble from here on by the sounds of it and I hope you have received a big fright because of what you did. Have you apologised yet?
APPELLANT: Yes, I have apologised to him in the Local Court.
HIS HONOUR: You have, say that again.
APPELLANT: I apologised to him at the Court--
HIS HONOUR: Thank you, good that is appropriate. Mr Dane will take you to the Registry now and sign you up for the bond. Good luck.
APPELLANT: Yes, your Honour, thank you.

		18 July 2014",2014-05-05 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705147,Tynan v R [2014] NSWCCA 75,"Judgment
1BATHURST CJ:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
2JOHNSON J:  For the reasons given by R A Hulme J I agree that leave to appeal should be refused.
3R A HULME J:  This is an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Armitage in the District Court at Parramatta on 3 December 2012.  The applicant was sentenced in respect of two offences of robbery whilst armed committed on 9 and 18 June 2012.  Such an offence is contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years.
4The applicant pleaded guilty at an early stage and the judge allowed a 25 percent reduction of the sentences on account of the utilitarian value of the pleas.  The sentence imposed in each case was 3 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years.  The sentences were accumulated by 6 months so that the total effective sentence was 4 years with a minimum custodial component of 2 years 6 months.
5The applicant also pleaded guilty to an offence of driving whilst disqualified which had been referred to the District Court pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).  A sentence of six months was imposed, to be served entirely concurrently with the first of the armed robbery offences.
6The proposed grounds of appeal concern the manner in which the judge had regard to the guideline for sentencing in commonly encountered armed robbery cases provided in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346.  Generally, it is contended that his Honour misapprehended the typical case there described for which it was suggested that a sentence in the range of 4 to 5 years was appropriate.  It is also contended that his Honour erred in his comparison of objective and subjective features of the case at hand with that typical case. 
7The robberies were similar to the typical case described in R v Henry but not in all respects.   They were robberies committed at service stations by a 26 year old offender who was armed with a steel rod in one case and an umbrella shaft in the other case.  The attendants were threatened and obviously put in some fear.  The proceeds amounted to several hundred dollars.    Other matters that the judge had to take into account included, on the one hand, that the applicant was on bail at the time of the offences but, on the other, that he had experienced some traumatic events in the past and had some mental health issues which the judge took into account in his favour in each of the mitigating respects described in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228.  An explanation for the applicant's offending was that he had become addicted to ice and had a gambling problem.  Indebtedness as a result of those activities was the motivation for committing the offences.
8The judge accepted various other matters in the applicant's favour including that he had experienced a troubled childhood; did not have a significant criminal record; was genuinely remorseful; would find custody difficult because of his mental health and other issues; had a reasonable history and future prospects of gainful employment; was motivated to seek treatment for his mental health and drug abuse issues; and had good prospects of rehabilitation and not re-offending.
9I accept that there were some erroneous ways in which the judge did apprehend the features of the typical case described in Henry: for example, regarding it as being concerned with what he called a ""street robbery"" and regarding the present matter as being more serious because it concerned robberies of ""commercial premises where an employee is particularly vulnerable"". But in the end, having regard to all of the objective and subjective features of the case, the sentences imposed, remembering that they related to not one armed robbery but two, were quite unremarkable.  Even if error was established, it would be necessary for the Court to be satisfied that a lesser sentence was warranted and should have been passed before intervention would be justified: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  In my view, no lesser sentence could be contemplated.
10An additional problem for the applicant is that the judge, rather unusually, forecast the terms of the sentence he proposed to impose and invited submissions as to whether ""it falls into appealable error either way or is too much or too little or whatever you wish"".  (POS 17.20)
11After a period of confusion about the mathematical calculation of the sentences, in terms of starting points before reduction for the pleas of guilty, the degree of partial accumulation, and the ratio of parole and non-parole periods, the judge finally announced what he proposed to impose.  The legal representative then appearing for the applicant took the opportunity of conferring with his client and announced, ""Your honour, my client understands that and I don't have any submissions"". 
12The proposed appeal is completely lacking in merit. 
13I propose the following order:
  Leave to appeal refused.

		08 May 2014",2014-05-06 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705156,Pitt v R [2014] NSWCCA 70,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: On 17 January 2011 the applicant was arrested and charged with the murder of Jamie Collins earlier that day. On 26 November 2012, he entered a plea of guilty to an alternative charge of manslaughter. The Crown accepted the plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. It accepted the plea on the basis that the applicant suffered a substantial impairment in his capacity to understand events, or to judge whether his actions were right or wrong, or to control himself due to an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, at the time of the offence, within the meaning of s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The offence of manslaughter is subject to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years.

2On 14 December 2012 Latham J sentenced the applicant. She imposed a term of imprisonment of 8 years, commencing on 17 January 2011, with a non-parole period of 6 years which will expire on 16 January 2017.

3The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. He contends that it is, in the circumstances, manifestly excessive. He also asserts error in that the sentence did not reflect special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act""), permitting a reduction in the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period.

The facts

4The facts of the offence were put before Latham J in the form of lengthy and highly detailed ""Crown Case Statement"". Also in evidence were transcripts of no fewer than 16 telephone calls made to the Emergency Triple 0 line. These are of some significance. The facts were, essentially, as follows.

5The applicant was the lessee of a Department of Housing home unit in Granville. As at January 2011, two other men occupied the unit with him. They were Jamie Collins and Travis Hunter. On occasions, Ben Collins (the brother of Jamie Collins) and his girlfriend, Jessica Raby, also stayed in the unit.

6On Sunday 16 January 2011 Ben and Jamie Collins spent some hours working on Raby's motor vehicle. By way of thanking them, Raby purchased some beer and spirits. The three went to the applicant's unit and began to consume the alcohol, giving some to the applicant. An argument soon broke out. At about 7.00pm Raby and the Collins brothers purchased more alcohol. When they returned to the unit after making that purchase, they found that the applicant had left a note on the door saying that he had gone away for two to three weeks. This was not true. They entered the unit and found that the applicant was present.

7What followed was a long and chaotic night during which the applicant and Jamie Collins repeatedly argued. The applicant was aggressive towards Jamie Collins. It appears that Jamie Collins was also aggressive towards the applicant. Indeed, there is good reason to believe that Jamie Collins, either alone or with his brother, initiated the aggression. Between 9.00pm and 11.30pm on that evening, a neighbour called police on four occasions because of the noise and apparent violence in the applicant's unit. The applicant himself called police on no fewer than 10 occasions, the first at just after 9.00pm. Police attended and arranged for an ambulance to convey the applicant to hospital. They advised Jamie Collins that they did not intend to charge him, but did intend to apply for an Apprehended Violence Order in favour of the applicant. Although it is not specifically so stated in the Crown Case Statement, it is clear that, at some time, the applicant was discharged from the hospital and returned home.

8Hospital records that were available at sentencing but not admitted into evidence apparently showed that the applicant was admitted shortly after 9.00pm and discharged at 3.35am on the morning of 17 January. His next call to the emergency number was made at 4.02am.

9The sounds of confrontation and violence continued. Police again attended at about 4.00am. Police entered the unit and observed broken furniture and beer bottles scattered around the living area. 

10The applicant asked police to remove Jamie Collins from his unit. The police informed the applicant that they had sought an Apprehended Violence Order, and advised him to seek the assistance of the Department of Housing or the Tenancy Tribunal to arrange for the eviction of Jamie Collins from his unit. 

11Just before 6.00am, the applicant attended the Merrylands Police Station, continuing to ask for the removal of Jamie Collins from his unit. Police took no action.

12The applicant returned to his unit, where he stabbed Jamie Collins in the chest. He immediately told a neighbouring resident what he had done. The neighbour contacted police. The applicant spoke to the police operator, repeating that he had stabbed Mr Collins and requested an ambulance. He remained at the premises until police arrived, and repeated his admission. On their arrival at the unit, police found the body of Jamie Collins. He had a single stab wound to the chest. The applicant was arrested. He has remained in custody since that date. 

13There is no direct evidence as to what took place in the applicant's unit immediately before, and at the time of, the stabbing. However, a clear picture of the events of the hours leading up to the stabbing can be discerned from the transcripts of the numerous calls to the emergency number. 

14The first call was made by the applicant at 9.04pm. He said:

""I need a policeman, I've been assaulted, all right. I took, I took a couple of boys in for a couple of days and - - -""

The operator asked who had assaulted him and he identified Jamie Collins. He told the operator that he had a head wound and was passing out. He gave his name.

15The second call was made by a neighbour, Ms Amira Yako, at 9.07pm. What she reported was consistent with what the applicant had said. Ms Yako said that she was calling on behalf of Unit 7 (which was the applicant's unit). She said that the applicant was ""bringing a lot young people in his place and using drugs a lot"". She said:

""... you can see the people one day using drugs, they come like crazy and they was fighting now and I don't know what's happened to him but for us it's very hard.""

She identified one of the ""boys"" present as ""Jimmy"" and another as ""Trevor"", and said there was another person. 

16The next call was made by the applicant at 9.13pm. Police arrived just as he made the call, presumably in response to his earlier call, or Ms Yako's call. The applicant told the operator:

""... I just want this person out of my unit tonight.""

It was after this call that the applicant was taken to the hospital.

17At 10.43pm Ms Yako rang again. Her son also participated in this conversation. The transcript of the call records that Mr Yako said:

""... there's a massive fight happening and shit and they're breaking all his furniture ...

We're thinking like all the banging and plates and things getting flung everywhere and things breaking and stuff like that ...

... we've seen them like verbally downstairs they were full of like abusin' each other verbally and then like they were going up and down the hallway and they were just swearing and slamming all their doors and stuff ...

... they dropping the furniture from the (indistinct) ...""

The operator told Mr and Ms Yako that the police had already been to the premises. Mr Yako said:

""... it's still happening.""

18At 11.12pm and 11.19pm, Ms Yako made two further calls to the emergency number. In the first she said:

""My neighbour's just been bashed by these people that are living in there ...

... he's been taken to hospital but they smashed up his place.""

She said she wanted the police to come and remove the perpetrators who, she said, were ""laughing about it"". She essentially repeated that in the subsequent call at 11.19pm.

19The next call was made by the applicant at 4.02am on 17 January. He told the operator that his place was ""being trashed"", and that this had happened while he was at Westmead Hospital. He identified Jamie Collins, Ben Collins and Travis (Hunter) as the perpetrators. He made this call from outside the unit. In response to a question from the operator, he said he did not know whether they were still inside. He said:

""I just had a look, a quick look in and it seemed an absolute disaster, you know. yeah I, I need the police here urgently, urgently.""

20The applicant was transferred to the Police Assistance Line and he repeated what he had said, again, identifying Jamie Collins as having smashed his property and assaulted him. He said he needed police urgently because he was too frightened to enter his own unit.

21The applicant called again at 4.20am. He said that he was running along High Street, being chased by Jamie Collins and Ben Collins. He said again that he had a head wound but had just returned from Westmead Hospital. He called again, again saying that he was being chased, this time by people armed with knives. At an early stage in this call, he said:

""Here they come, here they come, fuck, quick, I need help. I'm running ... towards Parramatta.""

22At 4.51am he called again, and said:

""... My name is Leonard Pitt and for the last, yeah nearly 4, 5 hours now I'm, it's just been absolute chaos at my unit.

... It happened with an assault by Jamie Collins and, and - - -""

23He called again at 4.58am, saying that:

""There's people that are coming back to my unit, yeah. 

... After trashing my unit, after trashing my unit?""

24He complained that when police had attended:

""... they apprehended one and just let him go like, he was just some sort of jaywalker and yeah, yeah.""

25At 5.07am the applicant called again, identifying himself and saying that the police had not arrived:

""... but in the meantime, some, the one that they're lookin' to talk to has arrived back and makin' threats. I, I can't stay with, I can't have people stayin' with me, makin' threats, I can't have people stayin' with me makin' threats, I can't have people - - -

... One assaulted me, the other one's have made threats and, and, and when I gave 'em adequate notice to leave my unit, they - - - 

... It's just that my place is trashed ...""

26The applicant called again 5.19am, complaining, of the police:

""They, they're, they're refusing to give me quality care and, and, and they're being abusive to me, I'm runnin' - - -""

The operator then spoke to police, who were at the premises. A police officer said:

""I'd say this place has been the, like an absolute nightmare tonight.""

The operator replied:

""I know, I know I've spoken to this chap, I think four times alone.""

27The final call at 6.56am, was made by the neighbour to whom the applicant spoke in the street. He told the operator that he needed police to attend, that:

""Just a gentleman come here and he said he stabbed someone.""

He gave the applicant's name as that person. The applicant then spoke to the operator, who asked where Jamie Collins was at that time. The applicant replied:

""Yeah. I think he's dead.""

The operator asked where he stabbed Jamie Collins and he said ""in the heart"".

The applicant's personal circumstances

28A wealth of material concerning the applicant's personal circumstances was placed before the sentencing judge. He was born in December 1970 in Moree, the eldest of five children of an Aboriginal family. Evidence of his early life was given in the form of an affidavit sworn by his younger brother, known as Keith Reber. When the applicant was less than three years old, he and Keith were fostered to the Reber family in Sydney. They lived with the family, first in northwest Sydney, and then in the central west of NSW, until the applicant left school after about year 8 or 9 and returned to Sydney. The applicant's foster parents were sensitive to the children's Aboriginal heritage and sympathetic to their mother. They provided a nurturing environment. However, the applicant began using alcohol at an early age, and, according to Keith Reber, became addicted. After leaving school the applicant worked for some time as a tyre fitter, and then, for 10 years, as a clerk with TAFE. Notwithstanding his alcohol addiction, he has a very limited criminal history. In 1987, at the age of 16, he was found guilty in the Children's Court of stealing. He was committed to the care of Mr and Mrs Reber until 18 years of age, conditioned to be of good behaviour. Thereafter, he has convictions for offensive language, resisting police and having goods in custody. He has always been dealt with by way of non-custodial penalty and has never previously been sentenced to imprisonment. He has no convictions for offences of violence. 

29Also in evidence were two references, each attesting to the absence of aggressive behaviour by the applicant. Ms Rosemary Clark, a registered psychologist working in a facility specifically to provide support to sufferers of schizophrenia, said that she had known the applicant for about 5 years, and that he had been a very popular and exceptional member of the facility, and had enthusiastically participated in self-development groups and goal-setting programmes. She described him as demonstrating respect, gentleness and kindness in his interactions at the facility.

30However, it has long been known that the applicant suffers from a severe mental disorder.

Psychiatric history

31A very detailed chronology of the applicant's psychiatric history was provided to the sentencing judge, drawn, it appears, from comprehensive medical records, which were available to the court, but did not ultimately become part of the evidence (and are therefore not available to this Court). Instead, a detailed summary was provided. 

32The chronology reveals that the applicant was, in 1995, admitted to Tamworth Hospital, with a history of drug and alcohol problems. He was diagnosed, inter alia, with psychosis, paranoid persecutory delusions, and showing ""overt violence"". He was also said to have suicidal ideation. He was then 24 years of age. Medication was prescribed for him.

33Psychotic disorder and suicidal ideation - and suicide attempts - are recurrent themes in the reports of the numerous admissions to psychiatric facilities that followed.

34In April 2002 the applicant was diagnosed as suffering from polydrug use and schizoaffective disorder; in October of the same year, the diagnosis was drug induced psychosis and schizophrenia. That diagnosis has been repeated many times. Different medications - or, at least, medications with different trade names - have been prescribed.

35Included in the lengthy history are many instances of non-compliance with prescribed medication. For some years prior to the offence, the applicant's medication was a drug called Clopixol. He had ceased taking this medication about one month prior to the offence.

36On his arrest on 17 January 2011, the applicant was taken to the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre (""MRRC"") and assessed. In May he was transferred to the mental health accommodation area of the MRRC where he came under the care of Justice Health. His treating doctor was then Dr Andrew White, a Career Medical Officer with specialty in psychiatry. The applicant appears to have remained in that unit until January 2012 when he was again transferred, this time as a ""correctional patient"" under the provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) (""the MH(FP) Act"") to the Long Bay Prison hospital. Dr White reinstituted the treatment regime that had been prescribed for the applicant prior to his arrest. The provisions of the MH(FP) Act have required regular reviews of the applicant's condition. These reviews have been conducted by Dr Gordon Hyde, psychiatry registrar.

37Initially, in January 2012, the applicant was assessed by Dr White as unfit to be tried. However, by May 2012 Dr White assessed him as fit to be tried. 

38For the purposes of sentencing, the applicant was examined by Dr Bruce Westmore and Dr Richard Furst, both forensic psychiatrists. Each took a similar history, consistent with the chronology to which I have referred.

39Dr Westmore examined the applicant in September 2011. At this time he had been receiving a drug called Clozapine, which appears to be similar to Clopixol he had been receiving prior to arrest.

40Dr Westmore reported on his mental state examination as follows:

""Mr Pitt presented as an Aboriginal man who was pleasant and cooperative. Eye contact was significantly reduced in fact there was almost no direct eye contact at all. He spoke spontaneously and expansively but his history was a little rambling and disjointed and he occasionally demonstrated unusual mannerisms with his hands and the position of his head. The rate and flow of his speech patterns were normal and he was not suffering form or thought disorder (sic). His affect was very flat and his mood state restricted. He described a history [of] auditory hallucinations and ideas of reference. These may still be present but are reducing in intensity. He was generally alert and attentive.""

41Having reviewed the material concerning the events of 16-17 January, Dr Westmore said:

""Based on his own history and the history noted in the Justice Health file after he was incarcerated, it is probable that he was mentally ill at the time of the offence. On the history he provides, I am not able to link in a direct way his mental illness to the stabbing of the deceased, but I believe he could raise the defence of substantial impairment. He was suffering an underlying condition, specifically a chronic paranoid schizophrenic illness, which is likely to have been exacerbated as the result of his failing to take medication leading up to the incident.""

42Dr Furst reported on 5 November 2012. He also reviewed the applicant's psychiatric history and his account of the offence. He considered that the applicant was:

""... suffering from an acute relapse of his chronic schizophrenia at the time in question before the court as a consequence of his non-compliance with medication, relapse into drinking alcohol, and signs of treatment resistance.""

He reported:

""At the time of the offence in question, he was showing a number of signs of psychosis and was probably intoxicated. He had been frustrated in his efforts to have his 'flatmates' including Jamie Collins, evicted. There was some evidence that he was assaulted earlier that evening and his unit was 'trashed'. He was also chased by the brother of the deceased. 

In my opinion, he probably lacked capacity to judge the wrongfulness of his actions by virtue of his mental illness acute paranoia and the threat he felt at the time. I doubt that he was able to control himself at the time or think through the consequences of his actions in a rational and calm manner.""

43Dr Stephen Allnutt was retained by the Director of Public Prosecutions to provide a report with specific emphasis on the issues relevant to s 23A of the Crimes Act. On 28 October 2012 Dr Allnutt reported:

""I believe there would be reasonable grounds to conclude he might have discontinued medication as a consequence of break through symptoms of psychosis that he was experiencing as early as August 2010 and that as a consequence he likely experienced a further deterioration in his mental state in the time leading up to the alleged offence so that as a consequence of his underlying condition (paranoid schizophrenia) he was at the material time experiencing auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions - 'an abnormality of mind'.""

The Remarks on Sentence

44After recounting in some detail the relevant facts of the offence, Latham J said:

""23 The objective gravity of the offence may be legitimately assessed as considerable, if regard is had to the force required to inflict the wound and the position of the wound on the body. There is no suggestion that the victim was armed, although I accept that the victim may have physically assaulted the offender shortly before he was stabbed and I accept that the victim and/or his brother had provoked the offender earlier by damaging his personal belongings.

24 There are however a number of features of the offence that, whilst technically not purely objective, impact upon the moral culpability of the offender and therefore impact indirectly upon the gravity of the offence. These factors include a complex interrelationship between the offender's psychiatric state and his perception of the threat posed to him by the victim and the victim's brother. In order to appreciate the offender's state of mind, some brief reference to his psychiatric history is required.""

Her Honour then reviewed the psychiatric evidence.

45Notwithstanding Dr Westmore's inability directly to link the applicant's mental illness with the commission of the offence, Latham J found:

""37 Having regard to the offender's psychiatric history and the fact that the offence is entirely consistent with the offender's past symptomatology, I have reached the conclusion that the offender's substantial impairment was a significant contributor to the course of events that culminated in the offender taking the victim's life.""

46Also by reason of the applicant's psychiatric history, her Honour declared herself unable to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his intention was to kill Jamie Collins; rather, she held, he intended to cause serious physical harm. 

47Accordingly, she characterised the applicant's moral culpability as ""of a low order"". She expressly said that, in coming to that conclusion, she did not overlook the fact that the applicant had ceased his medication and treatment as early as September or October 2010. She held that that too was also a consequence of his inadequately controlled psychosis.

48Having regard to those findings, her Honour held that the applicant's mental illness rendered him an unsuitable vehicle for general deterrence. She considered specific deterrence to be of more relevance, although she accepted that the treatment he is now receiving is more likely to stabilise his schizophrenia.

49Her Honour then said:

""45 Notwithstanding the offender's subjective features, it is necessary to impose a sentence of imprisonment that recognises the offender's role in taking the victim's life. That sentence will be discounted by 20% to take account of the offender's offer to plead to manslaughter in May of this year. Whilst I accept that the offender's mental illness is capable of affecting the relative length of the non parole period, his need for ongoing treatment has already been factored into the sentencing exercise. In addition, the non parole period ought not be reduced below the point that adequately reflects the gravity of the offence.""

50Her Honour accordingly sentenced the applicant as set out above. It is to be observed that the non-parole period and the head sentence are in accordance with the statutory ratio referred to in s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. That is the basis for the second ground of the proposed appeal.

The application for leave to appeal

51Two grounds of appeal are identified. They are:

""GROUND 1: The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

GROUND 2: The sentencing judge erred in failing to find special circumstances. Alternatively the sentencing judge erred in failing to vary the statutory ratio to reflect special circumstances.""

Ground 1: manifest excess

52It was not submitted that a sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years following a plea of guilty was necessarily outside the range legitimately available in manslaughter cases. It is well known that because the range of conduct and circumstances that give rise to a conviction of manslaughter are so variable, the applicable sentences are also highly variable. What was submitted on behalf of the applicant was that, taking into account the particular circumstances of this offence, the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. In this regard considerable emphasis was placed upon the applicant's mental illness. There is no doubt that his psychiatric condition is severe.

53The manner in, and the extent to, which mental illness may affect a sentencing decision has been the subject of many decisions of this Court. In R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67, Gleeson CJ said:

""A moment's consideration will show that the interplay of the considerations relevant to sentencing may be complex and on occasion even intricate. In a given case, facts which point in one direction in relation to one of the considerations to be taken into account may point in a different direction in relation to some other consideration. For example, in the case of a particular offender, an aspect of the case which might mean that deterrence of others is of lesser importance, might, at the same time, mean that the protection of society is of greater importance. That was the particular problem being examined by the court in the case of Veen (No 2) [Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465]. Again, in a particular case, a feature which lessens what might otherwise be the importance of general deterrence, might, at the same time increase the importance of deterrence of the offender.""

54Later, with particular regard to the impact of mental illness on a sentencing decision the Chief Justice said:

""In truth however, for the reasons given at the commencement of this judgment, the question of the relationship, if any, between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence, goes to circumstances of the individual case to be taken into account in the application of the relevant principles. The existence of such a causal relationship in a particular case does not automatically produce the result that the offender will receive a lesser sentence, any more than the absence of such a causal connection produces the automatic result that an offender will not receive a lesser sentence in a particular case. For example, the existence of a causal connection between the mental disorder and the offence might reduce the importance of general deterrence, and increase the importance of particular deterrence or of the need to protect the public. By the same token, there may be a case in which there is an absence of connection between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence for which a person is being sentenced, but the mental disorder may be very important to considerations of rehabilitation, or the need for treatment outside the prison system.""

55In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1, McClellan CJ at CL summarised the relevant principles in the following way:

""177 ...

● Where the state of a person's mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence ...

● It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed ...

● It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced ...

● It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence ...

● Conversely, it may be that because of a person's mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence ... Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public ..."" (internal citations omitted)

56It will be seen from this list that, while, generally, the existence of relevant mental illness may, for different reasons, point to a more lenient sentence, the countervailing consideration is the possibility that the offender poses a danger to the community, with the result that considerations of specific deterrence indicate a more severe sentence, as may considerations of the need for community protection. In response to the applicant's submissions in respect of the approach taken by Latham J to the applicant's mental illness, the Crown relied upon the applicant's long history of non-compliance with medication. That can only be relevant, so far as I can see, if it provides the basis for an inference that, unless restrained, the applicant is likely to commit further offences. Certainly, it would not accord with principle to impose a lengthier sentence than would otherwise be required for the purpose of ensuring that the offender complied with a prescribed medication regime. The evidence denies any inference that the applicant, unless medicated, is likely to commit further offences. The many occasions on which he ceased taking prescribed medication were not associated with any criminal activity. Indeed, the applicant's relatively minor criminal history, in spite of his severe psychiatric condition, is very much to his credit. Even during periods of non-compliance with his medication, the applicant cannot be said, generally, to pose a threat to the community.

57Moreover, the contemporaneous record of events as disclosed in the emergency call transcripts shows that the applicant's offence was committed only after a long history of extreme provocation on the part of Jamie Collins, and, possibly, his brother. Even if the assessment of the applicant's perception of the events of that evening should be treated with some circumspection due to his mental illness, the parallel and consistent accounts contemporaneously given by Ms Yako and her son provide strong support for the conclusion that it was the Collins brothers who were the initial aggressors, and the principal aggressors, and that their aggression persisted, even when the applicant was absent at the hospital, and after his return.

58It was because of the applicant's psychiatric history that Latham J concluded that his moral culpability was ""of a low order"". In my opinion, that conclusion is not reflected in the sentence imposed. Moreover, there are other factors, not mentioned in the Remarks on Sentence, that also impact on the level of moral culpability. Those factors are the continuing behaviour of the Collins brothers to which I have just referred. 

59In my opinion, the conduct evidenced by these calls substantially reduces the applicant's culpability. It is not to be overlooked that the calls themselves represented his own repeated attempts to have the conduct that eventually resulted in the stabbing of Jamie Collins brought to an end. 

60For these reasons I am of the view that Ground 1 is made out.

61The applicant relied upon a number of previously decided cases to show that the sentence was out of alignment with other comparable cases. A schedule of cases involving sentences for manslaughter where manslaughter was accepted or found due to substantial impairment under s 23A of the Crimes Act was provided. Specific reference was made to three: R v Terrence David Kain [2013] NSWSC 638; R v Hollaway [2013] NSWSC 218 and R v Chen [2012] NSWSC 1000. It is not necessary to go into the detail of these cases. They do have significant parallels with the present case, and the Crown did not suggest otherwise. In each case, the sentence imposed was significantly less than the sentence imposed on the applicant. The Crown did not produce any comparable case in which a sentence of the magnitude of 8 years was imposed. 

62Individual cases, of course, cannot establish that a particular sentence is unjust. They can, however, provide some sense of prevailing sentencing patterns. The cases relied upon do not, in my opinion, of themselves establish that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. They do, however, provide some comfort, or assurance, that the view I have otherwise reached is correct.

Ground 2: special circumstances

63This ground is framed as it is because there is some doubt whether the sentencing judge found special circumstances or not. What she said is contained in para [45], set out above (at [49]). If she did intend to make such a finding, it was not reflected in the sentence imposed. 

64I am satisfied that this was a case in which special circumstances ought to have been found, and, indeed, the Crown at sentencing expressly so conceded. I am further of the view that such a finding ought significantly to reduce the proportion that the non-parole period bears to the head sentence. 

65The sentence I propose will reflect the severe degree of the applicant's mental illness, as well as the significant degree of provocation involved in the conduct of the Collins brothers towards the applicant (see Sentencing Procedure Act, s 21A(3)(c)).

66I propose that leave to appeal be granted, the sentence imposed be quashed, and in lieu thereof the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years, commencing on 17 January 2011, with a non-parole period of 3 years, expiring on 16 January 2014. The applicant would therefore be entitled to immediate consideration for parole. Of course, it will be necessary for the relevant authorities to make the appropriate inquires and determinations under the MH(FP) Act.

67It will be observed that, on the orders I propose, the time is past when the applicant would first have been eligible for consideration for release on parole. That comes about because it is now more than 3 years since the commission of the offence, and the applicant has been in custody for the whole of that time.

68The delay is attributable to a number of factors. One factor is the need for the applicant to be psychiatrically assessed with respect both to his fitness to be tried, and the s 23A (Crimes Act) issues. It is not clear how long those processes took, although, as is recorded in the Remarks on Sentence, the applicant offered a plea of guilty to manslaughter in May 2012.

69The applicant was sentenced on 14 December 2012. The Notice of Appeal is dated 9 October 2013. Just why it took 10 months for the Notice to be filed is not explained. The result, however, is that (should the orders I propose be made) the applicant is entitled to immediate consideration for parole. It is to be hoped that the relevant authorities act expeditiously to ensure that that assessment takes place.

70The orders I propose are:

(i) leave to appeal granted;

(ii) appeal allowed, sentence quashed;

(iii) in lieu thereof, the applicant be sentenced to 5 years imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 3 years, commencing on 17 January 2011 and expiring on 16 January 2014, with a balance of term of 2 years, expiring on 16 January 2016. 

71HALL J: I agree with Simpson J.

72HARRISON J: I agree with Simpson J.

		08 May 2014",2014-05-06 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705157,Powell v R [2014] NSWCCA 69,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  I agree with the orders proposed by Button J and with his reasons.
2BUTTON J: On 13 July 2012, Judge Conlon SC sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for three offences on which verdicts of guilty had been returned at the end of a trial by judge alone in the District Court of New South Wales.  The first count averred that, whilst in company, the applicant possessed an offensive weapon with intent to commit a serious indictable offence; namely, armed robbery.  That count was brought pursuant to s 33B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years.  The second count was larceny.  It was brought pursuant to s 117 of the Crimes Act, and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years.  The third count was firing a firearm into a dwelling house with reckless disregard for the safety of any person.  It was brought pursuant to section 93GA(1) of the Crimes Act, and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years.  None of the offences attracted a standard non-parole period.
3I shall recount the overarching sentence structure in more detail shortly, but it suffices to stay at this stage that his Honour imposed a total head sentence of imprisonment for 11 years with a total non-parole period of 7 years.  On count three, a head sentence of imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years was imposed.
4A single ground of appeal has been notified: 
The sentence with respect to count three was manifestly excessive having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence.
5It can be seen that the ground is not directed towards any aspect of the sentences imposed on counts one and two.  Nor does the ground focus on the place of the sentence imposed for count three in the overall sentence structure, and the degree to which that sentence is cumulative upon the other sentences.  Accordingly, I shall recount the facts of those two matters very briefly.
6About 6:25 PM on 13 April 2011, the applicant and his co-offender, Ian Curran, entered a family owned supermarket.  The co-offender was armed with a machete.  The applicant was disguised by way of a balaclava and was armed with a .22 calibre rifle.  The applicant pointed the rifle at an elderly customer and said ""Don't do anything stupid"" (count one).  Meanwhile, the proprietor had concealed herself.  The offenders grabbed $70 in cash and ran from the premises (count two).
7I turn to the facts underpinning count three.  The next evening, 14 April 2011, the applicant and Mr Curran attended a home at Albion Park.  A number of boarders lived there, though it seems that only the homeowner was present at the time.  Barking dogs caused the homeowner to look through the side glass panels of his front door.  There he saw the co-offender wearing a ""hoodie"" and carrying something that looked to the homeowner to be a machete or a knife.  The homeowner opened the door, and the co-offender said to him ""Is Brian there, I heard he was living here"".  The homeowner replied in the negative, and the co-offender walked off.  The homeowner heard the co-offender engage in a conversation with another male person who was out of sight.  The homeowner returned to his lounge room, and it was at that stage that he heard one or two shots.  In response, the homeowner went to ground for 10 to 15 seconds.  Several days later, the police identified a small hole in the blinds of the front bedroom window.  A projectile was found lodged in a section of gyprock in the kitchen/dining area.
8Five days later, the applicant was arrested in a motor vehicle in Nowra.  Located in that vehicle was a large machete and a shortened .22 calibre rifle.  Subsequent ballistic analysis proved that the projectile located in the home at Albion Park had been fired from that rifle.
9His Honour found that, although it was ""a little difficult to determine the level of planning involved"", nevertheless a shortened firearm was taken to the location, and it was not possible to characterise the offence as a ""random attack"".  He also referred to the fact that the offence must have caused distress, not only to the homeowner, but also to neighbours who either heard the shot or shots being fired or subsequently found out what had happened.
10Turning to subjective features, the applicant was 25 years of age when he stood for sentence.  His parents separated when he was five, and he left home at 14 years of age.  That was the end of his formal education, and he commenced to work as, amongst other things, a shearer.  From the age of 11, he abused prohibited drugs, and before the proceedings on sentence he had told a probation officer that he had used ""every drug known"".  He had failed in a drug rehabilitation centre, having found it ""too hard"".  As I have said, the convictions arose at the end of a trial, and the applicant expressed no remorse after that process ended adversely to him.  In custody he was said to be compliant and quiet.
11His criminal record began when he was a child, was not short, and featured a number of offences with a flavour of violence.  Importantly, in 2006, the applicant had been sentenced to imprisonment for an armed robbery by way of a head sentence of imprisonment for 4 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months.  In 2011, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 1 month for possessing a shortened firearm; namely, a .22 calibre rifle.
12With regard to count three, his Honour said that ""the indiscriminate use [discharge] of a firearm into the victim's residence had the potential to maim or kill.""  His Honour also remarked that ""the indiscriminate use of firearms at domestic dwellings requires stern punishment.""
13Turning to the structure of the sentences, for the count of larceny, his Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for 15 months to commence on 3 June 2011.  
14For possession of an offensive weapon with intent to commit an armed robbery, his Honour imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for 4 years 8 months with a non parole-period of 3 years 6 months.  That sentence commenced on the same date, namely 3 June 2011.  
15For the discharge of the firearm, his Honour imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for 9 years, with a non parole-period of 5 years, to date from 3 June 2013.  
16The accumulation of sentences and a finding that the applicant needed an extended period of supervision to assist his reintegration back into the community led to Judge Conlon SC making a finding of special circumstances.  The Crown did not challenge this finding during the hearing of the Appeal.
17A number of aspects of the sentence structure are noteworthy.  First, the fixed term for the larceny is wholly concurrent with and subsumed by the non parole-period of the sentence for the possession of the weapon with intent.  Secondly, the sentence for discharging the firearm is cumulative upon the non-parole period of the offence of possessing the weapon by two years.  Thirdly, the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence imposed for discharging the firearm is 55%.  Fourthly, the ratio between the total non parole-period and the total head sentence is 64%.
Submissions
18In support of the proposition that the sentence imposed on count three was manifestly excessive, counsel for the applicant focused upon a number of discrete aspects of the objective seriousness of the offence.  
19First, one could not be satisfied that more than one shot was fired ""at"" the home (and therefore constituted the offence).  Secondly, only one person was present within the home when the shot was fired into it.  Thirdly, the trajectory of the projectile (namely, somewhat above the height of the average person) made the criminal act somewhat less dangerous than it might otherwise have been.  Fourthly, the applicant would not have expected to harm the homeowner, in light of the homeowner's position when last seen and the entry point of the projectile.  Fifthly, the low calibre of the firearm also made the act somewhat less dangerous.  Sixthly, whilst conceding that there was a plan to confront the man Brian with the shortened firearm, counsel for the applicant submitted that one could not be satisfied that there was a settled plan to use the weapon in the sense of discharging it.  Seventhly, in light of the fact that the victim did not realise that the projectile had in fact been fired into his home until sometime later, his resultant distress would have been somewhat less.
20Counsel for the applicant concluded by pointing to the fact that statistics maintained by the Judicial Information Research System (JIRS) demonstrate that this is the longest sentence imposed for this offence since 2006 (the year in which the statistics commence).
21The Crown submitted that nothing would lead this Court to intervene.  
22First, it said that whether one or two bullets were fired was not to the point; the simple fact was that a projectile with the capacity to travel a long distance and to maim or kill was fired into a private home.  
23Secondly, it accepted that the evidence of the homeowner was that he was the only person at home.  But the point was made that the applicant was not to know that at the time.
24Thirdly, the Crown accepted that injury ""may have been unlikely"" in the event, but said that the trajectory was consistent with a reckless disregard for the consequences, which after all is the gravamen of the mental element of the offence.
25Fourthly, the Crown did not accept that there must have been an expectation on the part of the applicant that the homeowner was not at the window through which the projectile travelled.  The submission was that the applicant would have had no idea of the location of the homeowner within the premises when the shot was fired.
26Fifthly, as for the calibre of the weapon and the projectile, the Crown submitted that, in fact, the definition of a ""firearm"" within s 4 of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW) draws no distinction on the basis of the calibre of the weapon.  In any event, what is important is the objective seriousness of what actually occurred, not whether there may be more serious offences to do with machine guns and the like.
27Sixthly, it submitted that the elements of the offence were made out whether or not planning could be demonstrated.  Quite apart from that, emphasis was placed upon the finding of his Honour that a loaded firearm had been taken to the premises.
28Seventhly, it submitted that the fact that the undoubted initial belief of the homeowner that his home was being fired upon was not confirmed until some days later hardly calls into question the objective seriousness of the offence.
29In short, the Crown submitted that there is no basis upon which this Court would say that the sentence actually imposed was outside the proper exercise of his Honour's discretion and therefore manifestly excessive.
Determination
30The imposition of a lengthy sentence for this dangerous and antisocial criminal act was inevitable.  The question is whether the sentence actually imposed is so severe as to fall outside the legitimate exercise of the discretion reposed in the learned sentencing judge.
31Some of the submissions made by counsel for the applicant are not persuasive.  For example, a .22 calibre projectile can certainly be lethal.  As well as that, a trajectory that is slightly above the height of the average person is hardly lacking in danger.  Nor, to my mind, is it anything other than a matter of good luck that no-one was injured or killed as a result of the actions of the two offenders.  At the time of the shooting, the homeowner, by his actions, demonstrated that he believed that there was a real possibility that his home was under attack.
32On the other hand, it is true that one could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant and the co-offender attended the home with a settled plan to discharge the firearm.  In other words, it is reasonably possible that the decision to fire was a spontaneous one.  
33It is not clear whether two shots were fired; even if that were the case, the count was founded upon the one projectile proven to have been fired ""at"" the home.  
34Whilst the usefulness of a statistical analysis in support of the contention that a sentence is manifestly excessive is subject to well-known limitations, the fact that this is the longest of 19 sentences of imprisonment imposed since 2006 for this offence gives one pause for thought about the sentence.  
35Finally, the head sentence of imprisonment for 9 years, when compared with the maximum penalty of imprisonment of 14 years, is noteworthy, in light of the fact that one can, without difficulty, bring to mind a range of more serious examples of the offence.  
36To my mind, those factors are supportive of the error for which the applicant contends.
37I have come to the view that the sentence imposed exceeded the bounds open to the discretion of the learned sentencing judge, though not to an extreme degree.  I consider that the ground has been made out; it follows from the nature of the ground itself that I am persuaded that a lesser sentence is warranted in law.
38Having said that, I respectfully agree with the learned sentencing judge that offences of this kind require condign punishment.
39In re-sentencing, I have taken into account the brief affidavit of the applicant, not disputed by the Crown, which shows that he has been making reasonable progress in custody.
40I consider that the sentence for count three should comprise a head sentence of imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.  I would not interfere with the degree of accumulation that his Honour adopted; accordingly, the sentence will commence on 3 June 2013, that date being two years after the commencement of the sentences on the other two counts.  It follows that the total head sentence will be imprisonment for 9 years with a total non-parole period of 6 years.  Finally, it can be seen that I have virtually replicated the ratio between the total head sentence and the total non-parole period; it becomes 67%.
41I propose the following orders:
(1)Leave to appeal granted with regard to count three.
(2)Appeal allowed with regard to count three.
(3)Sentence on count three quashed.
(4)On count three, the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years to date from 3 June 2013 and expire on 2 June 2017, with a balance of term of 3 years to commence on 3 June 2017 and expire on 2 June 2020.
(5)The first date upon which the applicant will be eligible for consideration for release is 3 June 2017.
42RS HULME AJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Button J and with his Honour's reasons.

		07 May 2014",2014-05-06 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705163,R v Xie (No 4) [2014] NSWSC 500,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: The Accused, Lian Bin (Robert) Xie, is charged that on or about 18 July 2009 at North Epping in the State of New South Wales, he did murder the following persons:
	


(a)   Min (Norman) Lin;

(b)   Yun Li (Lily) Lin;

(c)   Yun Bin (Irene) Lin;

(d)   Henry Lin; and

(e)   Terry Lin.


	
	The trial of the Accused is fixed to commence before a jury on 8 May 2014 with an estimate of four months. Additional jurors will be selected for the jury in accordance with s.19(2) Jury Act 1977.
	


The Pretrial Applications


	
	By Notice of Motion filed on 18 November 2013, the Accused sought the exclusion of various categories of evidence.
	
	
	The grounds upon which the Accused sought exclusion of these categories of evidence were articulated in Schedules to the Notice of Motion dated 20 November 2013 (MFI8) and 10 March 2014 (MFI10).
	
	
	The orders sought by the Accused were as follows:
	


(a)   Order 1 - that evidence in relation to Stain 91, swabbed at 4 Beck Street, North Epping on 13 May 2010, not be admitted into evidence upon the basis that it is not relevant for the purpose of s.55 Evidence Act 1995;

(b)   Orders 2 and 3 - that evidence of DNA analysis relating to Item 550 (Stain 91) to be given by Mr Clayton Walton, Mr Robert Goetz, Ms Sharon Neville, Dr Simon Walsh and Dr Mark Perlin not be admitted on the ground of relevance under s.55 Evidence Act 1995 or, if relevant, be excluded in the exercise of discretion under ss.135 or 137 Evidence Act 1995;

(c)   Order 4 - that evidence of the Accused cutting up shoe boxes on the night of 6-7 May 2010 be excluded upon the ground that it was improperly or illegally obtained for the purpose of s.138 Evidence Act 1995 - in written submissions, the Accused sought, in the alternative, exclusion of this evidence under ss.135 or 137 Evidence Act 1995;

   (d)   Order 5 - not pressed;

(e)   Order 6 - evidence of conversations between the Accused and Kathy Lin or the Accused and Witness A (a person who was in custody with the Accused in and after July 2011) (including transcripts of those conversations) be excluded on the ground of relevance under s.55 Evidence Act 1995 and with derivative use of the contents of those conversations not to be otherwise permitted.


	
	The Court was informed, on 16 April 2014, that Order 6 was no longer sought as the parties had agreed concerning the surveillance device material and transcripts to be tendered.
	
	
	There is, however, a further issue concerning motive which arises from the surveillance device material, as to which oral and written submissions have been made by the parties. I will return to this topic later in the judgment.
	
	
	If the Court determines not to exclude Dr Perlin’s evidence in its entirety, the Accused objects to the Crown having leave to rely upon Dr Perlin’s supplementary material served upon the Accused on 3 March 2014. I will return to this issue after ruling upon the objections to Dr Perlin’s evidence generally.
	


The Pretrial Hearing


	
	The Accused was committed for trial from the Central Local Court on 20 December 2012.
	
	
	The pretrial case management of this matter had been undertaken in 2013 by Latham J. Following the announcement of her Honour’s appointment as the Commissioner of the Independent Commission Against Corruption, I assumed carriage of the proceedings shortly prior to the commencement of the pretrial hearing on 18 November 2013.
	
	
	The Accused was arraigned afresh before me on 18 November 2013: s.130(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	The pretrial hearing proceeded on 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 25 November 2013. A number of directions were given to progress the matter in advance of a resumed pretrial hearing date scheduled for February 2014.
	
	
	Issues arose concerning the funding of legal representation of the Accused, leading to a number of mentions of the proceedings in December 2013 and January-February 2014. Those issues having been resolved, the pretrial hearing resumed on 17 March 2014 and continued on 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 31 March 2014 and 1 April 2014.
	
	
	Directions were given for the filing and service of written submissions on the range of topics covered by the Accused’s Notice of Motion. On 14 April 2014, counsel made relatively brief oral submissions to supplement the detailed written submissions which had been furnished.
	
	
	The pretrial hearing extended beyond the topics raised in the Accused’s Notice of Motion in two respects.
	
	
	Firstly, a Basha Inquiry (R v Basha (1989) 39 A Crim R 337) was conducted where Witness A was called to give evidence and be cross-examined (PT70-260).
	
	
	Secondly, it was necessary for the Court to determine the question whether waiver of client legal privilege between the Accused and his former solicitor, Daniel Sheen, had occurred concerning one topic. Following a finding that privilege had been waived, evidence was adduced from Mr Sheen on a Basha Inquiry (PT400-408): R v Xie (No. 3) [2013] NSWSC 1840.
	
	
	A number of witnesses gave evidence at the pretrial hearing on forensic issues concerning the location of Stain 91 in the garage of the Accused’s premises at 4 Beck Street, North Epping, and subsequent examination and analysis, including DNA analysis undertaken with respect to Item 550 (Stain 91). The witnesses who were called at the pretrial hearing (by the Crown unless otherwise indicated) were as follows:
	


(a)   Ms Jae Gerhard of the Forensic Biology Unit, Forensic Services Group, New South Wales Police Force (PT282-345);

(b)   Dr Paula Jane Hallam, Forensic Scientist (called by the Accused) (PT346-391);

(c)   Dr Mark William Perlin, Chief Scientific Officer and Chief Executive Officer, Cybergenetics (PT471-659; 713-799; 1086-1198);

(d)   Mr Robert John Goetz, Acting Deputy Director of Criminalistics, NSW Forensic and Analytical Science Service (“FASS”) (PT667-712);

(e)   Ms Sharon Neville, Manager of DNA Laboratory, FASS (PT808-908);

(f)   Mr Clayton Everett Walton, Senior Forensic Scientist, FASS (PT910-923; 1011-1082);

(g)   Dr Simon Joseph Walsh, Chief Scientist, Forensic Portfolio, Australian Federal Police (PT925-998).


	
	In addition to the witnesses who gave evidence at the pretrial hearing in this Court, a number of persons gave evidence at the committal proceedings at Central Local Court and the transcript of their evidence was tendered on the pretrial hearing. A substantial volume of documentary material was tendered as well.
	


Outline of the Crown Case Against the Accused


	
	To place the issues requiring determination into context, it is appropriate to refer to the case against the Accused as summarised in the Crown Case Statement (“CCS”) handed up on 17 March 2014 (MFI11).
	
	
	In the early hours of Saturday, 18 July 2009, the five deceased persons were murdered in their family home at 55A Boundary Road, North Epping (“the Boundary Road premises”).
	


The Lin Family (CCS [1]-[3])


	
	Min Lin (45 years of age) and his wife Lily Lin (44 years of age) lived with their family at the Boundary Road premises. Lily Lin’s sister, Irene Lin (39 years of age) also lived with the family. Henry Lin (12 years of age) and Terry Lin (nine years old) were the children of Min and Lily Lin.
	
	
	Min and Lily Lin’s eldest daughter, Ms AB (then aged 15 years), was absent from the house on 18 July 2009. She was in New Caledonia on a school excursion. She is the sole survivor of the Lin family.
	


The Accused’s Family (CCS [4]-[8])


	
	The Accused (then aged 45 years) and his wife, Kathy Lin, lived at 4 Beck Street, North Epping (“the Beck Street premises”), with their son ""James"" (which is not his real name) (nine years of age). The Beck Street premises were about 250 metres walking distance from the Boundary Road premises. Kathy Lin is the sister of Min Lin.
	
	
	Also living in Australia were Mr Yang Fei Lin (“Mr Lin”) and Mrs Feng Qin Zhu (“Mrs Zhu”), the parents of Min Lin and Kathy Lin. Mr Lin and Mrs Zhu lived at 10 Birmingham Street, Merrylands.
	
	
	The Accused married Kathy Lin in China in 1999 and he moved to Australia permanently in 2002. Between the end of 2001 and 2005, the Accused and his wife owned a buffet restaurant in Melbourne.
	
	
	The business was sold in January 2005 and they moved to Sydney. The Accused had previously qualified as a medical practitioner in China and practised there for some time as an Ear Nose and Throat Specialist. As at 18 July 2009, the Accused was unemployed and had been since the sale of the Melbourne business in January 2005.
	
	
	During the time when the Accused and Kathy Lin lived in Melbourne, their son ""James"" was cared for by the grandparents, Mr Lin and Mrs Zhu, in Sydney. ""James"" appeared to have had some difficulties adapting to school, in terms of his language and other social development. It appears that one of the reasons for the decision made by the Accused and his wife to return to Sydney was to look after ""James"". The Crown points to a conversation recorded on a surveillance device at the Beck Street premises on 2 March 2010 in which the Accused states that the grandparents had “spoiled” ""James"" and taught ""James"" “the wrong things”, having shown “no respect” to him and Kathy Lin.
	


The Deceased Family (CCS [9]-[12])


	
	At the time of his death, Min Lin was self-employed at the Epping Central Newsagency at 52 Rawson Street, Epping. He had worked full time in the business, seven days a week and for up to 12 hours a day. He employed a number of casual workers, including his wife, Lily, and sister-in-law, Irene. Min Lin’s father also worked in the newsagency business with his son.
	
	
	The newsagency business was viable and profitable. Min Lin had significant assets. He also had a number of debts including mortgages on the Boundary Road premises and on a commercial investment property in Epping and a residential investment property in western Sydney where his elderly parents resided.
	
	
	Lily Lin was not employed on a full-time basis at the time of her death. She attended to home duties and assisted part time in the newsagency business. According to the CCS, it is likely that Lily Lin suffered from a depressive illness for a number of years that went generally untreated.
	
	
	Irene Lin was a student at Macquarie University at the time of her death. She arrived in Australia in June 2008 on a student visa, and had been studying and also working in the newsagency business since that time. Irene had resided at the Boundary Road premises since her arrival in Australia.
	
	
	As at 18 July 2009, Henry Lin was a student at Epping Boys’ High School and his younger brother, Terry, a student at Epping North Primary School.
	


Events on Evening of Friday, 17 July 2009 (CCS [13]-[16])


	
	On Friday, 17 July 2009, Min Lin, Terry Lin and Henry Lin attended a family dinner at Min Lin’s parents’ unit at 10 Birmingham Street, Merrylands. Also in attendance were the Accused, Kathy Lin and their son, ""James"". A dinner of this type was a regular occurrence in the life of the Lin family and that of the Accused.
	
	
	Lily Lin and Irene Lin did not attend the family dinner. As mentioned, Ms AB was overseas on a school excursion.
	
	
	Min Lin left the Merrylands apartment at about 9.00 pm. Terry and Henry Lin left at around 10.00 pm with the Accused, his wife and son. They returned to North Epping in the Lin family vehicle, a silver/grey Toyota Kluger driven by the Accused.
	
	
	According to Kathy Lin, the vehicle returned to the garage at the Boundary Road premises at about 10.30 pm. Kathy Lin states that Terry and Henry Lin entered the house. She told police that there were no lights on upstairs, but there was a light on in the dining area when she dropped the children home at 10.30 pm. The front door was unlocked at that time. She did not turn lights off as she left. She locked and checked the front door of the Boundary Road premises as she left.
	
	
	The Accused told his father-in-law that he had told Henry and Terry to be quiet because the parents must be asleep as the lights were on downstairs, but not upstairs. He told police that there was no light on in the lounge room downstairs, and said that normally it was not on. The Accused said that his wife would normally turn the light on when she went inside and it would then be bright. The Accused said that his wife did not do that on this evening and he was sure about this.
	
	
	Kathy Lin, the Accused and ""James"" then went to their own car, a Toyota Corolla, which had previously been parked at the Boundary Road premises. They drove the short distance to their home at the Beck Street premises.
	


Activity in the Boundary Road Premises After the Lin Family Returned on 17 July 2009 (CCS [17])


	
	Henry Lin chatted online to a friend on MSN until the friend signed out at about 11.40 pm that night. Computer records show that the computer was turned off at 00:01:38.
	


A Dark Night (CCS [18])


	
	The night of 17 July and the early hours of 18 July 2009 were dark. At 2.00 am, there was virtually no moon (moon rise was at 02:43 and moon set at 12:46). At its peak in the sky, only 23% of the moon was visible. The Boundary Road premises were likely in darkness as the electricity switch was off.
	


The Manner, Order and Time of Death of the Deceased Persons (CCS [18]-[24])


	
	The Crown case is that the killer necessarily had knowledge of the layout of the home in order to be able to successfully navigate it in darkness.
	
	
	All of the deceased were found dead in their respective bedrooms. All were on or near their beds. All had obvious and significant wounds to their head and face.
	
	
	The Crown case is that there is an overwhelming inference that each deceased was quickly incapacitated. The concentration of blunt force injury to the head and face, together with asphyxial injuries, indicate that there may have been action taken to prevent the deceased from vocalising. The Crown contends that there is an available inference that all of the deceased were attacked whilst they were asleep, rather than earlier in the evening.
	
	
	There was no disturbance of any items in the adults’ rooms to suggest a struggle whilst they were awake. There were no items out of place down stairs.
	
	
	In relation to the time of the deaths, the Crown relies upon circumstantial evidence as to when the deceased were last seen alive. Henry finished his chat session on the computer in his bedroom at 11.40 pm and the computer was turned off shortly after midnight. Min Lin did not attend the newsagency early on Saturday morning. The Crown contends that this period includes the time period when the Accused had an opportunity to commit the crimes, that is after 2.00 am.
	
	
	A next-door neighbour, Janelle Wraith, of 53 Boundary Road, was awake until 1.00 am. She described herself as a light sleeper and she did not hear anything that night. The Crown contends that there is an available inference that there was very little noise during the attack as the deceased were attacked unawares in their beds. It is said that the logical inference is that the deaths occurred in the early hours of the morning.
	
	
	Blood spatter and DNA evidence was considered by Detective Sergeant Harkins, an expert in blood stain analysis. The Crown contends that this evidence indicates the order of the deaths. It is said to illustrate that the killer had prior knowledge regarding which bedrooms various people were sleeping in and knew which to target first, in order to minimise the risk of opposition.
	
	
	If the lights were off and the killer made a check once inside the house, the Crown contends that this would have been difficult to discern without running the risk of waking the occupants.
	
	
	The Crown contends that the person most likely to offer significant resistance, Min Lin, was killed first, together with his wife, Lily Lin. The killer would also have known he first picked the room with two adults and to disable those people quickly. The Crown contends that it is extremely likely that the severe injuries to the heads of the deceased would have been readily incapacitating.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the other adult in the house, Irene Lin, was attacked next. She represented the next highest threat.
	
	
	This was followed by the attack on the two boys who would have been the easiest to subdue. Even they were killed in their bedroom, indicating that the murder of the three adults did not awaken them in time to exit their bedrooms.
	
	
	The Crown contends that the lack of blood evidence in or near Ms AB’s room, from either shoe impressions or blood smears on the door handles, provides an available inference that the killer had knowledge that Ms AB was away. The Crown says that for a person outside the family, with no prior knowledge of the layout of the bedrooms to go into them to see who was there, would have posed an unacceptable risk of waking the occupants and raising the risk of serious opposition. According to the Crown, the absence of this makes it highly unlikely that the assailant needed to explore the house.
	
	
	There were impressions from only one type of shoe (other than those from police boots consistent with having been deposited during the discovery of the bodies and initial investigation of the crime scene).
	


Events on Saturday, 18 July 2009 (CCS [25]-[26])


	
	On Saturday, 18 July 2009, the Accused got up at about 8.00 am. According to his interview with police on 22 July 2009, the Accused carried out some gardening work in the front and back yards. He said also “I have a little bit clean up for the floor of the garage, because it was quite dirty” (Q/A26). In his interview with Detective Sergeant Maree, the Accused said he was “maybe [in the] garage to get some tool or something”.
	
	
	Between 9.00 am and 9.43 am, Kathy Lin received a number of telephone calls from various people, who told her that Min Lin’s newsagency had not been opened as expected. Kathy Lin attempted unsuccessfully to contact Min Lin on his mobile telephone number at 9.37 am. She did not try to contact any of the other residents of the Boundary Road premises.
	
	
	When interviewed, Kathy Lin said that at that point she was not concerned, believing her brother may have been delayed by his vehicle breaking down or similar whilst he was doing his usual home deliveries, and that other members of the family may have been out shopping. Kathy Lin told one of the friends that contacted her that she was going out shopping and would drive past her brother’s house on the way to try and locate him.
	


Arrival of the Accused and Kathy Lin at the Boundary Road Premises (CCS [26]-[31])


	
	Kathy Lin, the Accused and their son, ""James"", drove to the Boundary Road premises in Kathy Lin’s red Toyota Corolla. Upon arrival at the Boundary Road premises, Kathy Lin got out of the car before the Accused had turned off the engine. The Accused followed her into the house, rather than waiting in the car. According to his answers in his first record of interview, the Accused then told ""James"" to stay in the car. The Crown contends that there is an available inference that the Accused wanted to avoid his wife finding the bodies because he knew they were there, but she went inside before he could stop her.
	
	
	Kathy Lin went up the stairs first and the Accused followed her. She ultimately saw the body of Lily, and the blood in the master bedroom. However, she told police in her first interview that when they first approached that room and went in, she could not see anything as it was dark, but the Accused (who was behind her at the time) cuddled her and told her not to look. The Accused did this from a position where the Crown says he could not have seen the deceased. The bed in the room does not extend beyond the wall in the entry area.
	
	
	Kathy Lin recounted these events a second time in her first interview, saying she couldn’t see anything and at that time, the Accused (who was behind her) said “Don’t watch that”. She then turned to the right and saw her sister-in-law, Irene. The Accused said that Kathy went two metres into the dark room, that he was one metre behind her and he grabbed Kathy from behind and said “Don’t look”. In his interview with Detective Sergeant Maree on 16 March 2010, the Accused said that he did not go in very deep, just inside the door. From that position, he could not have seen the two deceased.
	
	
	The Crown contends that the available inference is that the Accused already had knowledge that the bodies were there. In his interview with police on 22 July 2009, the Accused said that he held Kathy, but believed that she had already seen the bodies. He said that once he saw his sister-in-law, he held his wife and said “Kathy, don’t look at it”.
	
	
	There was also a conversation between the Accused and Kathy Lin about their relative positions that was captured on a surveillance device recording on 29 April 2010, in which the Crown contends that the Accused can be heard schooling his wife about what she should say.
	
	
	The Crown case is that the Accused took hold of Kathy Lin and told her not to look inside the main bedroom, before he himself had entered the room, because he already knew that the bodies of the victims were in that room.
	
	
	After leaving the main bedroom, the Accused followed Kathy Lin to the other bedrooms where they discovered the bodies of other victims. Irene Lin was in one bedroom and the boys, Henry and Terry Lin, were in another bedroom. According to Kathy Lin, at no stage did the Accused check on the condition of these victims, despite being previously a qualified medical practitioner in China. The Crown contends, in all of his accounts to police, the Accused is vague regarding this aspect, indicating at one point that Kathy Lin would not let him check the vital signs of the boys.
	
	
	At no point of the morning of 18 July 2009 did the Accused inform police that he had seen Min Lin inside the premises. Police had spent several hours conducting a search for Min Lin as a suspect. In fact, his body was hidden under bedcovers, and was not discovered for some hours.
	
	
	On 17 March 2010, the day after his interview with police, the Accused contacted investigating police and in a telephone conversation, recorded by telephone intercept, attempted to explain what he had told police about seeing Min Lin in the bedroom during his interview. The Accused informed police that he had spoken to a police officer at the scene on the relevant morning and informed him that he was not sure whether there were four or five bodies in the house. The Accused did not inform any police at the scene that the body of Min Lin may have been inside the premises.
	
	
	Police were in fact informed by Kathy Lin shortly before 2.00 pm that afternoon at Hornsby Hospital that she had seen something else on the bed. It was at this time that police checked the main bedroom and located the body of Min Lin under bedcovers.
	


The “000” Calls on 18 July 2009 (CCS [32]-[38])


	
	After discovering the bodies of the victims, Kathy Lin made the first of three calls from her mobile telephone to “000”.
	
	
	According to mobile telephone and Telstra records, the first “000” call was made at about 9.47 am to Telstra’s Emergency Service Answer Point. This call was recorded and lasted for 63 seconds. Towards the end of this call, Kathy Lin can be heard asking the Accused to take their son, ""James"", home and to come back immediately. The Accused left Kathy Lin alone at the crime scene and drove their son the short distance to the Beck Street premises where ""James"" remained by himself. After the service operator transferred the call, it was not put through to New South Wales Police and terminated at approximately 09:48:14.
	
	
	Kathy Lin then made another call which was successfully transferred to police at approximately 9.50 am. The duration of the call was approximately three minutes and this call was also recorded. During the call, Kathy Lin spoke initially to the operator in English and relayed information, including her location and the discovery of the victims. As the call continued, Kathy Lin became emotional and also spoke and ultimately yelled and screamed (in Cantonese) at the Accused.
	
	
	The Accused could be heard in the background of the recording responding to Kathy Lin. Due to her apparently emotional state, the “000” operator asked Kathy Lin if he could speak to the other person. Towards the end of the call, Kathy Lin was walking quickly or running after the Accused, pleading with him to stay with her, however a car is heard driving off and the call is terminated by Kathy Lin. At one point during the call, Kathy Lin is heard saying to the Accused “I am more scared than you are”.
	
	
	Telephone records show that a third call was made to “000” at 9.54 am. This call was also recorded and its duration was about three minutes and 29 seconds. During this call, Kathy Lin attempted to provide the operator with further information and then remained on the line until police arrived.
	
	
	During his interview on 16 March 2010, the Accused indicated that he remained with Kathy Lin whilst she made the telephone calls to “000” stating that she was on the phone for some time. He indicated that he remained with Kathy after the “000” call to wait for the police and ambulance, before deciding with Kathy Lin that he should leave and tell her parents what had happened.
	
	
	The Accused left his wife alone at the crime scene and drove ""James"" to their home a short distance away and left him there alone, stating that he was going to pick up Min Lin’s parents at their Merrylands unit. The Crown contends that, for all the Accused knew, if he was not involved, the killer could have been close by.
	
	
	The Accused did not tell Kathy’s parents what had been discovered during their car trip back to the scene from Merrylands, so there was no reason that ""James"" could not have gone with the Accused. Even if it was Kathy Lin’s idea to do this, the Crown contends that there is an inference available that the Accused decided to take this step because he knew that there was no genuine threat to his son in the neighbourhood. The Accused did not want to be present when police arrived at the scene. In recorded surveillance device material, the Crown contends that the Accused said words to the effect that police would consider the first people at the scene as a suspect.
	
	
	Mr Lin, Min Lin’s father, stated in his recorded interview on 24 June 2010 that it was in fact the Accused who rang him, telling him that “something terrible” had happened to Min’s family, without going into further details and asking that Mr Lin and Mrs Zhu take a train to Epping. It was only after Mr Lin said that there were no regular trains running between their home in Merrylands and Epping that the Accused agreed to pick them up. This call took place at 9.54 am, after the second “000” call, and occupied some 69 seconds.
	
	
	Evidence obtained from two witnesses is that shortly before 10.00 am on 18 July 2009, they witnessed an argument between a male and female person of Asian appearance at the top of the driveway at the Boundary Road premises. The Crown case is that the two people seen by the witnesses were the Accused and Kathy Lin. The argument took place before the arrival of police and ambulance and the Accused is described as driving a small red-coloured motor vehicle.
	
	
	The Crown contends that the evidence supports the inference available from the second “000” made by Kathy Lin, during which she and the Accused were in strong disagreement. During conversations later recorded on surveillance devices, Kathy Lin and the Accused discussed this topic. She states that she was very scared that morning and that she did not want the Accused to leave her alone at the premises, and that there was no urgency for him to leave to inform her parents. Even if she did not initially want him to leave and collect her parents, the Accused could have waited for the police to arrive.
	
	
	Despite Kathy Lin’s agreement, or otherwise, about this situation, the Crown contends that the fact that the Accused left his wife at the scene demonstrates that he knew that she was not in any danger. There is an available inference that he was confident of her safety because he knew that there was no killer nearby.
	


Examination for Blood and Concern for the Safety of the Accused’s Family (CCS [39]-[43])


	
	The motor vehicle used by the Accused on the morning of 18 July 2009 (to attend the crime scene at the Boundary Road premises, then return to the Beck Street premises and then drive to Merrylands to pick up Mr Lin and Mrs Zhu and return to the Boundary Road premises) was examined by police and was found to have no traces of blood.
	
	
	The shoes worn by the Accused on the same morning were also examined and found to have no traces of blood. Forensic examinations of the staircase, downstairs floors (including the front door foyer) and the outside driveway area of the Boundary Road premises revealed no traces of any blood.
	
	
	Police wanted to move the Accused and his family away from the Beck Street premises for safety reasons. The Accused was reluctant to leave, citing a preference for his own bed. The Crown contends that the Accused was not keen to go because he knew there was no genuine threat from a killer.
	
	
	Mr Lin bought some extra security devices (safety chains) for installation to the doors at the Beck Street premises after the murders, as he was frightened for the family and their safety. The Accused declined and said that it was not necessary as it was very safe.
	
	
	A threatening letter was received on 7 October 2009. The Accused brought it to the police the next day and said “I was a little bit worried about my safety not much … I am also thinking it might be a bit of a joke”. The Crown contends that the available inference is that he was not concerned because he knew he was not in danger as there was no real threat.
	


Police Investigation of Deceased Family (CCS [44])


	
	The Crown contends that extensive investigations regarding the background of the victims, including their financial dealings and personal relationships, did not disclose any other individuals with a motive for the murders.
	


Installation and Use of Surveillance Devices in the Beck Street Premises (CCS [45]-[48])


	
	In January 2010, warrants were issued authorising the installation of surveillance devices in the Beck Street premises. Between February and May 2010, conversations between the Accused and other people in the premises were lawfully monitored and recorded by police. These conversations were recorded during a period of the investigation when the Accused, Kathy Lin and a number of other persons were reinterviewed by police, including the ERISP interviews conducted on 16 and 22 March 2010. The Crown contends that there are a number of recurring topics that are continuously raised by the Accused during the recorded conversations.
	
	
	According to the Crown, the evidence suggests an attempt by the Accused to convince Kathy Lin and Ms AB that the reason that the police were focusing their investigation on him was that the grandparents, Mr Lin and, in particular, his wife, Mrs Zhu, had intentionally supplied false information to the police upon which the police were acting and giving undue weight. The Accused is repeatedly recorded emphasising in conversations with Kathy Lin and Ms AB that the relationship with the grandparents changed solely following a court dispute over Ms AB’s guardianship after the murder of her parents, during which Ms AB opted for Kathy Lin as her guardian over the grandparents. The Accused alleges that out of hatred towards him and Kathy Lin, the grandparents were fabricating lies about the Accused and were supplying them to police to frame the Accused as the prime suspect. The Accused states that the grandparents, in order to create a financial motive for the murders, had alleged to the police that the Accused was unemployed and bankrupt because of losses on the share market.
	
	
	Contrary to the assertions of the Accused, however, Mr Lin and Mrs Zhu insisted in police interviews conducted as late as July and August 2010, that they did not believe that the Accused was responsible for the murders.
	
	
	During some of the recorded conversations, the Accused discussed at length with Kathy Lin, Ms AB and others different aspects of the evidence and police investigations. During such conversations, the Accused told Kathy Lin of police suspicions and discussed with her areas of the evidence that were of importance in the Crown case.
	
	
	Amongst other matters, the Accused discussed in detail the Accused’s and Kathy Lin’s movements on the night of the murders, and re-enacted with Kathy Lin at their home the discovery of the victims the following morning.
	
	
	In what the Crown will allege is an attempt to cover up his own involvement, the Accused was recorded coaching Kathy Lin and Ms AB about what they should say to police when they are interviewed, and what questions they should or should not answer. The Accused is recorded telling Ms AB that, being the only surviving family member, she is a police suspect and advising her to attend further police interviews in the presence of a solicitor only. The Accused also warned Kathy Lin and Ms AB that police will “trick” them into providing inculpatory information about him, and that they must take great care in answering questions relating to him.
	


Execution of Crime Scene Warrant at Beck Street Premises on 11 May 2010 (CCS [49])


	
	On 11 May 2010, police executed a crime scene warrant at the Accused’s Beck Street premises. A detailed forensic examination and search of the premises was conducted. The search continued until 15 May 2010.
	
	
	The forensic examination included the garage, where a number of swabs and samples were obtained of stains and markings believed to be blood.
	


Location of Stain 91 and Initial Testing (CCS [50]-[53])


	
	Underneath a desk in the garage, police located a small amount of what appeared to be blood (positive presumptive test) which was given the designation Stain 91 (later Item 550). It was sampled and sent for DNA analysis to the Division of Analytical Laboratories (“DAL”) in the New South Wales Department of Health.
	
	
	Stain 91 was of a grey/brown colour. An Orthotolidine (“Otol”) test conducted by the police was strongly positive for blood. The appearance of the stain was consistent with blood.
	
	
	Dr Paula Hallam, Jae Gerhard, Nicole Campbell and Melanie LeCompte expressed the joint opinion that Stain 91 is “possibly blood”. Their opinion is based on “the visual appearance of the stain, the positive presumption ortho-tolidine result and the negative Luminol result”. Dr Hallam and Ms Gerhard expressed a further joint opinion that Stain 91 “is of human origin” based on the DNA profile generated.
	
	
	Whilst the expert witnesses, Dr Hallam, Ms Gerhard, Ms Campbell and Ms LeCompte cannot definitively state that it is blood, the Crown case is that because of its colour, the strong reaction to the Otol test, and the fact that it contains human DNA from a number of contributors, that the only reasonable conclusion is that Stain 91 is human blood.
	


DNA Analysis of Stain 91 (CCS [54]-[62])


	
	The following testing in relation to Stain 91 was conducted at DAL:
	


(a)   “Profiler Plus” (nine areas plus sex) was done four times (two worked well, one partially and one did not work because of low levels):

(b)   “Identifiler” (15 areas, including all nine from “Profiler Plus” plus sex), was done twice (one worked well, one partially);

(c)   “Y-Filer” was done twice (one gave a partial profile and the other a full profile);

(d)   “PowerPlex 21” (20 areas, including all 15 from “Identifiler” plus sex) was done once.


	
	Each test was done on a different run of the same sample. All of the results from “Profiler Plus” and “Identifiler” were consistent with each other and yielded a mixed DNA profile. There were good reference samples from each of the comparison persons (the deceased persons).
	
	
	Mr Clayton Walton from DAL was of the opinion that there are at least three contributors to Stain 91, with at least three in the major component and probably at least four or more taking into account minor contributors.
	
	
	The results of the “Profiler Plus” testing raised the possibility of inter-relatedness amongst contributors based upon common alleles. Mr Walton opined that Min Lin, Henry Lin and Terry Lin could not be excluded as possible contributors to Stain 91, whilst the Accused and his family could be excluded as possible contributors. Mr Walton applied the “Random Man Not Excluded” (“RNME”) formula, and determined that one-in-five people in the general population could not be excluded as a potential contributor. Mr Walton adopted this formula due to uncertainty over the number of contributors to the mixed profile.
	
	
	Mr Walton could not tell the age of the DNA from the testing, or whether each contributor’s DNA was deposited at different times or if the sample was mixed prior to being deposited on the garage floor.
	
	
	However, the Crown case is that the fact that there are at least three contributors mixed into the one sample, coupled with the location of the sample underneath a desk on the floor of the garage, makes it inevitable that the different contributors were mixed prior to being deposited on the garage floor.
	
	
	The Crown contends that this is supported by the fact that some very similar mixtures are found at the crime scene at the Boundary Road premises, including the mixtures in Item 47 (a swab of the interior door handle from Bedroom 2), Item 223 (a swab from the south wall of Bedroom 3) and Item 616 (a stain from the mattress in Bedroom 3).
	
	
	Dr Mark Perlin received the DNA data generated by DAL in New South Wales when processing the reference samples (for the Accused and five deceased persons) and a number of crime scene samples (Items 47, 223, 550 and 616). Dr Perlin processed the DNA data using the “TrueAllele Casework” system. TrueAllele Casework is a computerised DNA interpretation system that objectively infers genetic profiles (genotypes) from DNA samples. The inferred genotypes can then be compared to reference genotypes. The Crown contends that TrueAllele Casework has been validated on synthetic and casework data and results have been admitted into evidence in the United Kingdom.
	
	
	The results for Stain 91 (Item 550) were processed on the assumption that it contained three, four or five contributors. Dr Perlin expressed the following opinions based upon the results of the TrueAllele processing:
	


(a)   a match between a contributor to Stain 91 and Yun Bin Lin is 4,410 times more probable than a coincidental match to an unrelated Asian person;

(b)   a match between a contributor to Stain 91 and Yun Li Lin is 27.1 times more probable than a coincidental match to an unrelated Asian person;

(c)   a match between a contributor to Stain 91 and Min Lin is 379,000 times more probable than a coincidental match to an unrelated Asian person;

(d)   a match between a contributor to Stain 91 and Henry Lin is 1.33 billion times more probable than a coincidental match to an unrelated Asian person; and

(e)   a match between a contributor to Stain 91 and Terry Lin is 1.03 quintillion times more probable than a coincidental match to an unrelated Asian person.


	
	Dr Perlin further conducted “evidence to evidence” comparison using TrueAllele and expressed the following opinions based on the results:
	


(a)   a contributor to Stain 91 (Item 550) matches a contributor to Item 47 with a likelihood ratio of 1.78 billion relative to an Asian population;

(b)   a contributor to Stain 91 (Item 550) matches a contributor to Item 223 with a likelihood ratio of 327,000 relative to an Asian population; and

(c)   a contributor to Stain 91 (Item 550) matches a contributor to Item 616 with a likelihood ratio of 9.56 quadrillion relative to an Asian population.


	
	Dr Simon Walsh described the mixed profiles from Stain 91 (Item 550) and Item 616 (based upon PowerPlex 21 testing) as “consistent, with a large amount of overlapping information, present in similar proportions”. He expressed the opinion that there was a “very high degree of similarity for complex mixed profiles of this nature, particularly considering these observations under a proposition that the mixed profiles arose independently from each other”. He was not able to make a statistical assessment of the observed similarities.
	
	
	Y-Filer testing of Stain 91 (Item 550) yielded a single, unmixed haplotype consistent with that of Min Lin, Henry Lin and Terry Lin (and different to that of the Accused and his son). Dr Walsh compared the Y-chromosome DNA profile against a global database of Y-chromosome haplotypes known as the “Y chromosome haplotype reference database” (“YHRD”) with the following results:
	


(a)   searching all meta-populations in the YHRD, there were no matching Y-chromosome haplotypes found amongst 55,827 haplotypes - it is 99% probable that the haplotype frequency in all meta-populations is not more than one in 12,000; and

(b)   searching only the Chinese meta-population in the YHRD, there were no matching Y-chromosome haplotypes found amongst 7,418 haplotypes - it is 99% probable that the haplotype frequency in the Chinese meta-population is not more than one in 1,600.


	
	The Crown contends that the evidence relating to Stain 91 (Item 550) is probative of the Accused’s involvement in the five deaths at the crime scene several hundred metres from the Accused’s home.
	


Autopsy Findings, the Likely Weapon Used and the Order of the Killings (CCS [63]-[67])


	
	The autopsy findings indicated the following causes of death in each instance:
	


(a)   Min Lin - blunt force injuries of the head and asphyxia;

(b)   Lily Lin - asphyxia and blunt force injuries of the head;

(c)   Irene Lin - blunt force injuries of the head;

(d)   Henry Lin - asphyxia and blunt force injuries of the head; and

(e)   Terry Lin - blunt force injuries of the head and asphyxia.


	
	As stated earlier, the evidence indicates that the time of the deaths was in the early hours of the morning of 18 July 2009.
	
	
	Each of the five victims were attacked and killed in their respective bedrooms in the Boundary Road premises. The type of weapon was a hammer-like object. Some of the deceased had injuries that, the Crown contends, were classic in appearance with having been inflicted by a hammer. There is also a possibility that a “V”-shaped mark on the baby mattress in Bedroom 3 was made by a claw hammer. Given the rope pattern marks found at the scene, the weapon had a rope attached.
	
	
	There was no evidence of a different kind of weapon. The Crown contends that the available inference is that there was a single killer.
	
	
	The autopsy results and crime scene examinations indicated that Min Lin and Lily Lin were attacked whilst asleep, as they had no defensive injuries and there were no signs of a struggle. The Crown case is that Min Lin and Lily Lin were attacked first. Irene Lin may have been awake at the time she was attacked, as she appears to have moved in her bed, and also suffered defensive injuries.
	
	
	Henry and Terry Lin were likely the last to be killed - there were signs of a violent struggle within that bedroom and there were a large number of defensive injuries to the boys, in particular to Terry Lin. The autopsy findings indicate that Terry Lin may have survived for between one-to-two hours after being attacked.
	
	
	The Crown case is that the Accused had a close relationship with the Lin family, and was well acquainted with the family’s sleeping arrangements. The Crown contends that the Accused attacked the adult victims first to reduce the possibility of detection.
	


No Evidence of Forced Entry or Theft from the Boundary Road Premises (CCS [69]-[72])


	
	The Boundary Road premises contain a two-storey dwelling on a battle-axe block. It is accessed by a driveway that is approximately 77 metres in length from the street frontage. Crime scene examinations of the Boundary Road premises showed no evidence of forced entry and minimal activity on the ground floor, except for the front door foyer area. The Crown case is that the Accused had access to a key to the front door of the victim’s home and, at the time of the murders, lived at the Beck Street premises, only 250 metres away.
	
	
	The main power switch to the Boundary Road premises was switched off some time during the night or the early morning of 18 July 2009, indicating that the house was in darkness at the time when the victim’s were attacked. The bedrooms of all the victims were located on the second floor.
	
	
	There was a large number of electrical items located at the Lin family home during the crime scene examinations, including computers, game consoles and mobile phones. In addition, Min Lin’s wallet containing personal papers and $1,420.00 in cash was found a short distance from his body. The Crown case is that robbery was not a motive for entering the house or committing the murders.
	
	
	Police enquiries in the immediate vicinity of the Boundary Road premises failed to locate any witnesses who had seen or, in particular, heard anything unusual that night, with the exception of a dog barking. The house is at the end of a long battle-axe block, and is surrounded on all sides by a number of other residential premises, and was generally very quiet, particularly during the time the Crown alleges the murders were committed.
	


Shoe Prints in the Boundary Road Premises (CCS [73]-[74])


	
	A detailed forensic examination of the carpets on the first floor of the Boundary Road premises revealed approximately 42 shoe impressions or shoe marks in blood. An examination of these impressions and marks revealed a number of different sole pattern types. Eight of the impressions/marks had insufficient detail to allow a comparison. A further 10 of the impressions/marks were identified as either police or ambulance footwear or similar.
	
	
	A further 24 of the impressions/marks located in blood were made by a shoe with the same tread pattern. The majority of these 24 shoe impressions had been matched to the tread used on five models of ASICS brand men’s running shoes, and one model of ASICS brand women’s running shoe. A number of those 24 ASICS impressions were found to have been made by a men’s US-size between 8.5 and 10.5.
	
	
	The Accused owned a number of pairs of ASICS brand runners in men’s size US9.5. Kathy Lin said that ASICS was the Accused’s favourite brand of sports shoes. Police located a number of photographs taken in 2006 at different times and locations, showing the Accused wearing a pair of one of the matched-model ASICS men’s running shoes, being a “GEL EVATION II TN333”. An extensive police search of the Accused’s home in May 2010 failed to locate the shoes shown in these photographs.
	


Events on 6 May 2010 and the Cutting Up of Shoe Boxes by the Accused (CCS [75]-[77])


	
	On 6 May 2010, Kathy Lin was questioned about the shoe impressions at the NSW Crime Commission in the presence of her solicitor, Daniel Sheen. Following the hearing, Kathy Lin and the Accused went to Mr Sheen’s office. During the conversation, the solicitor told Kathy Lin, in the presence of the Accused, that her husband was a suspect and that the shoe impressions appeared to have been identified as coming from an ASICS shoe of the same size as that worn by the Accused.
	
	
	The Crown case is that later that night, the Accused is recorded on video (as part of the surveillance devices installed under warrant) retrieving objects that appear to be shoe boxes, and is later recorded on video cutting up these shoe boxes with scissors and placing the pieced into a shredder, and also into a bucket containing a liquid. The Accused flushed the contents of the bucket down the toilet. The Crown case is that one of the objects disposed of by the Accused was the shoe box that had previously contained the “GEL EVATION II TN333” men’s running shoes owned by him.
	
	
	A crime scene examination of the Accused’s premises in May 2010 showed that the Accused had a number of pairs of shoes stored in shoe boxes, each of which was individually labelled with a small blue sticker. Also located during that examination was a quantity of shredded paper in the Accused’s garbage bin. A forensic reconstruction of that material revealed shredded pieces of a small blue sticker identical to those located on the shoe boxes.
	


No Sign of Entry to Ms AB’s Bedroom (CCS [78])


	
	The forensic examination of the carpets and bloodied shoe impressions at the Boundary Road premises showed that there was no indication that the bedroom of Ms AB had been entered. Ms AB was overseas in New Caledonia at the time of the murders.
	
	
	Further, forensic examination of the four bedroom doors revealed that three of the four had blood smears or marks. The only bedroom door that had no such marks was that normally occupied by Ms AB.
	
	
	The Crown case is that the Accused was one of only a small group of people aware that Ms AB was overseas on 18 July 2009, and therefore did not have to enter or check that bedroom. The Crown case is that the Accused and his wife had a particularly close relationship with Ms AB.
	


Evidence from Witness A, “Harry” and Recordings of Conversations with the Accused (CCS [79]-[85])


	
	In November 2010, Witness A was arrested by police and placed into custody. In July 2011, he was in custody with the Accused. Witness A and the Accused formed a relationship and they discussed various matters including their backgrounds, business dealings, the charges they faced and their respective court proceedings.
	
	
	In December 2011, Witness A contacted police and passed on information regarding conversations he had had with the Accused. In January 2012, Witness A provided police with the first of a number of statements, and agreed to assist further in the investigation, including by covertly recording conversations with the Accused. Witness A recounted conversations to police in a number of letters and telephone calls.
	
	
	On 19 May 2012 and thereafter, Witness A had a number of conversations with the Accused at the Long Bay Correctional Centre. These were lawfully recorded by surveillance device. The Accused and Witness A discussed various matters, some of which they had spoken about in the previous months.
	
	
	The Crown contends that recorded and unrecorded conversations between Witness A and the Accused included reference to the following topics:
	


(a)   that the Accused’s wife, Kathy Lin, was sedated by him on the night of the murders;

(b)   that the Accused had purchased a hammer (the Crown case is that this was the murder weapon) at a Two Dollar shop which, to his knowledge, had dummy cameras (and therefore no record of his purchase);

(c)   the use of a pressure point on the neck was demonstrated or described by the Accused as a method whereby he could incapacitate, and therefore attack five people - there was related discussion that he should not tell his solicitors this;

(d)   discussion about the best place to use a hammer to hit someone on the head;

(e)   the Accused gave Witness A details and a drawing of the Lin family home front door key, so as to have one made in order to plant and implicate someone else;

(f)   the Accused planned to invent a story of some mechanical work with the deceased, Min Lin, in his garage, to explain Min Lin’s blood on the floor of the garage;

(g)   alternatively, he would attempt to explain the blood on the garage floor as having originated from the prior ownership of the home by a vet and it being animal blood;

(h)   conversations about a “Plan B” - if the Accused was committed for trial and was not granted bail, he would get “Harry”, an associate of Witness A with access to a funeral parlour (who, unbeknown to the Accused was in fact an undercover police officer), to manufacture evidence by planting the DNA and/or fingerprints of a male person of Asian origin with a criminal background on the murder weapon - the available inference was that he had continuing access to the murder weapon;

(i)   the Accused explained his motive - loss of “face” because his parents-in-law considered Min Lin to be a better businessman than him - they did not like him and had not wanted him to marry their daughter;

(j)   Lily Lin had a secret mobile phone that the Accused destroyed;

(k)   the Accused’s desire not to be the first to arrive at the crime scene so as to avoid being a suspect;

(l)   that a person that was not a near neighbour saw something on the night of the murders; and

(m)   that the Accused did not drive to the Lin family house on the night of the killings because he did not need to drive as it was so close.


	
	Between December 2012 and February 2013, Witness A and the Accused continued their relationship at the Long Bay Correctional Centre. During that period, they had further discussions about the plan to have Witness A and “Harry” plant evidence on another person in an effort to frame that person for the murders.
	
	
	The Accused supplied Witness A with further information to be used as part of the plan to incriminate an anonymous person by the name of “Rob” (who was having an affair with Lily Lin) with the commission of the murders.
	
	
	Witness A forwarded information to police, including that the Accused had shown him Ms AB’s travel itinerary, statements of witnesses, and had provided him with Min Lin’s mobile telephone number and the Lin family’s landline telephone number. Witness A supplied police with a number of documents given to him by the Accused, including the sketch plan of the Lin family’s home, a sketch plan of the Epping newsagency and its opening hours, a drawing of the key to the family home and various exhibit photos thereof, as well as other material and information from the brief of evidence.
	
	
	Police examined the documents and the Accused’s fingerprints were found on a number of those documents.
	
	
	Witness A received a reduced sentence for his prior and future assistance.
	
	
	On 21 February 2013, the Accused was transferred from Long Bay Correctional Centre to the Parklea Correctional Centre.
	
	
	On 26 April 2013, an undercover police officer, “Harry”, visited the Accused. “Harry” informed the Accused that he had received the “paperwork” from Witness A, and the Accused told “Harry” that Witness A had told him that they had a “candidate” (that is, access to a body whose DNA and/or fingerprints could be planted on evidence to frame another person for the murders) and he told “Harry” to speak to Witness A about the matter. Later in the conversation, “Harry” asked the Accused what he should do, to which the Accused replied, “Go ahead”.
	
	
	On 9 May 2013, “Harry”, along with the Accused’s wife, visited the Accused at the Parklea Correctional Centre. The conversation between “Harry”, the Accused and Kathy Lin was lawfully recorded by a surveillance device. However, the majority of the recording is totally inaudible.
	
	
	On 24 May 2013, the undercover police officer, “Harry”, visited the Accused and they had a conversation that was lawfully recorded on surveillance device. During that conversation, the Accused discussed his case and retrieving the murder weapon and having it planted on another person in an attempt to frame that person for the murders.
	


Provisions of Evidence Act 1995 and Applicable Principles


	
	Recurring reference will be made in this judgment to provisions of the Evidence Act 1995, and principles to be applied in determining objections to evidence under one or more of those provisions. It is useful, at this point, to refer to those provisions and principles.
	


Statutory Provisions


	
	Sections 55 and 56 Evidence Act 1995 provide as follows:
	


“55    Relevant evidence

(1)     The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.

(2)    In particular, evidence is not taken to be irrelevant only because it relates only to:

(a)    the credibility of a witness, or

(b)    the admissibility of other evidence, or

(c)    a failure to adduce evidence.

56    Relevant evidence to be admissible

(1)    Except as otherwise provided by this Act, evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is admissible in the proceeding.

(2)    Evidence that is not relevant in the proceeding is not admissible.”


	
	Sections 135 and 137 Evidence Act 1995 provide:
	


“135    General discretion to exclude evidence

The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might:

(a)    be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or

(b)    be misleading or confusing, or

(c)    cause or result in undue waste of time.

…

137    Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings

In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.”


	
	Section 138 provides:
	


“138    Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence

(1)    Evidence that was obtained:

(a)    improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or

(b)    in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law,

is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.

(2)    Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning:

(a)    did, or omitted to do, an act in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally to the questioning, or

(b)    made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission.

(3)    Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:

(a)    the probative value of the evidence, and

(b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and

(c)    the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and

(d)    the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and

(e)    whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and

(f)    whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and

(g)    whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and

(h)    the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.

Note. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is set out in Schedule 2 to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 of the Commonwealth.”

Some Applicable Principles


	
	The appropriate enquiry for the purpose of determining relevance under s.55 Evidence Act 1995 focuses upon the capability of the evidence to affect the determination or conclusions of the tribunal of fact: R v Burton [2013] NSWCCA 335; 237 A Crim R 238 at 270 [145]-[146]. It does not direct attention to what a tribunal of fact is likely to conclude. For the purposes of assessing this capability, it is assumed that the evidence would be accepted by the tribunal of fact and it is taken at its highest: R v Sood [2007] NSWCCA 214 at [38].
	
	
	Section 55 speaks of a rational effect that is brought about “directly or indirectly”. This is very broad language and suggests a wide rather than a narrow focus to the enquiry whether a proffered piece of evidence has the rational potential which s.55 requires: R v Le [2000] NSWCCA 49 at [19]; R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 9 at [95].
	
	
	In approaching an objection based on relevance, it is necessary to keep in mind the observations of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Smith v The Queen [2001] HCA 50; 206 CLR 650 at 653-654 [6]-[7] (footnotes excluded):
	


“[6]    … although questions of relevance may raise nice questions of judgment, no discretion falls to be exercised. Evidence is relevant or it is not. If the evidence is not relevant, no further question arises about its admissibility. Irrelevant evidence may not be received. Only if the evidence is relevant do questions about its admissibility arise. These propositions are fundamental to the law of evidence and well settled. They reflect two axioms propounded by Thayer and adopted by Wigmore:

‘None but facts having rational probative value are admissible’,

and

‘All facts having rational probative value are admissible, unless some specific rule forbids.’

[7]    In determining relevance, it is fundamentally important to identify what are the issues at the trial. On a criminal trial the ultimate issues will be expressed in terms of the elements of the offence with which the accused stands charged. They will, therefore, be issues about the facts which constitute those elements. Behind those ultimate issues there will often be many issues about facts relevant to facts in issue. In proceedings in which the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) applies, as it did here, the question of relevance must be answered by applying Pt3.1 of the Act and s55 in particular. Thus, the question is whether the evidence, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment by the tribunal of fact, here the jury, of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.”


	
	In Evans v The Queen [2007] HCA 59; 235 CLR 521, Gummow and Hayne JJ said at 529 [23] (footnotes excluded):
	


“The answer to the questions just posed is provided by proper application of the test of relevance. As this Court's decision in Smith v The Queen demonstrates, questions of relevance require careful analysis. In particular, they require careful identification of the process of reasoning that is invited. Only then can it be seen whether the evidence in question could ‘rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue’ (emphasis added).”


	
	In the same case, Kirby J stated at 546-547 [95]-[98] (footnotes excluded):
	


“[95]   The foregoing tests are stated in all their generality for application to millions of questions asked every year in the great variety of cases to which the Uniform Evidence Acts apply. According to s 55(1) of the Evidence Act, the test for relevance requires no more than that the evidence ‘if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding’. That test must necessarily be given an extremely broad ambit.

[96]   Other provisions of the Evidence Act reinforce the impression that the test of relevance is not a narrow or stringent one (see eg ss 57, 58). A broad interpretation alone is the one compatible with the purpose of the Act which is to aid the court process (effectively of quelling controversies brought to the court for that purpose, taking into account all evidence which has a bearing upon the questions in issue) rather than to delay or needlessly complicate the resolution of that process.

[97]   What is, or is not, relevant to an issue in proceedings is much more likely to be perceived by advocates and judges of trial than by an appellate court. Still more so than by the ultimate national appellate court, concluding for the first time for itself that an issue, which everyone else has considered to be relevant, is irrelevant.

[98]   I cannot say that this course could not properly happen. Indeed, in the experience of this Court it has already happened, at least once, in Smith v The Queen. I disagreed with the approach on that occasion. In this appeal, I have considered whether the circumstances of the case are sufficiently analogous to require me to suppress my objection to the course favoured in the joint reasons and to conform to it. However, questions of relevance are always highly fact-specific. No general rule could be laid down that was not anchored in the proof of the facts in issue in the particular proceeding.”


	
	It will be observed in a moment that case law establishes that the application of s.137 does not involve the Court weighing possible alternative explanations or competing inferences in determining whether to exclude evidence under s.137. As the Crown submits, it is self evidently the case that a ruling as to relevance under ss.55 and 56 does not require or permit the Court to have regard to alternative explanations or competing inferences in determining the antecedent question of relevance. Nor does the Court consider issues concerning reliability of evidence at this point.
	


Sections 135 and 137 Evidence Act 1995


	
	Section 135 is based upon an assumption that the evidence is otherwise admissible. It confers a power to refuse to admit such evidence if the particular opinion is formed. A discretionary process is involved, with the formation of the relevant opinion requiring a balancing exercise. The power to reject evidence will only be engaged if the probative value of the evidence is “substantially outweighed” by a “danger” of the kind identified in s.135(a), (b) or (c): Dyldam Developments Pty Limited v Jones [2008] NSWCA 56 at [78].
	
	
	In Dyldam Developments Pty Limited v Jones, Basten JA observed at [93] that the apparent purpose of s.135(c) (the “undue waste of time” provision) was to allow a trial Judge to avoid an inappropriate expansion of the trial caused by the parties tendering, and then seeking to meet, evidence of slight or peripheral relevance to the facts in issue. His Honour observed (at [93]) that “once it is accepted that the probative value of the proffered evidence is significant or substantial, there may be limited scope for exclusion on the basis of a danger of ‘undue waste of time’”.
	
	
	In R v Burton, Simpson J (RA Hulme J and Barr AJ agreeing) said with respect to s.137 (at 266 [134]):
	


“The section requires two separate assessments and a judgment: first, an assessment of the probative value of the evidence sought to be adduced by the Crown, second, an assessment of the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant (that might be caused by its admission), and, finally, a judgment as to whether any such danger outweighs the probative value of the evidence. If the result of the assessment process is that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, the court is obliged to exclude the evidence. There is a danger of unfair prejudice if there is a real risk that the jury will make improper use of the evidence: R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131.”


	
	The Court in R v Burton considered the role of an alternative explanation or competing inference in a s.137 objection. As will be seen, this issue is relevant to the objection to the Stain 91 and DNA evidence. Simpson J said at 272 [156]-[158]:
	


“156   I do have difficulty with the logic of the proposition that the existence of an alternative interpretation robs the evidence of the respondent's words of probative value, or diminishes its probative value. The probative value of evidence depends upon what the tribunal of fact draws from the evidence. If the jury accept the Crown interpretation, the probative value of the evidence will (as a matter of fact and reality) be high.

157   A number of provisions in the Evidence Act (s 97, s 98, s 101, s 103, s 135, s 137 and s 138) make the admissibility of evidence dependent upon an assessment, by the trial judge, of the probative value of the evidence. Two things may be said about the actual probative value to be assigned to any item of evidence. The first is that the actual probative value to be assigned to the evidence is in the province of the tribunal of fact - in most criminal trials, the jury. The second is that the actual probative value cannot be determined until all of the evidence in the trial is complete. By way of example, evidence of a positive identification of an accused person as the perpetrator of a crime may appear to have powerful probative value when it is admitted. Its actual probative value may diminish, even to the point of extinction, in the light of other evidence, whether given in cross-examination, or by other witnesses.

158   The provisions which make admissibility of evidence dependent upon an assessment of its probative value are not, and cannot be, concerned, with the actual probative value of the evidence; they must be concerned with the potential probative value of the evidence on completion of the trial, as assessed by the trial judge at the time the admission of the evidence in question - what Spigelman CJ in Shamouil called the ‘capability’ of the evidence to affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue.”


	
	Simpson J continued at 273 [160]-[162]:
	


“160   Where an item of evidence is capable of different interpretations, or is susceptible of ‘competing inferences’, its actual probative value will depend upon what interpretation is placed on it, or what inferences are actually drawn from it. It is no part of the judge's function to make that assessment. The function of the judge is to assess the extent to which the evidence has the capacity to bear upon the proof of the fact or facts in issue. This was the approach taken by James J, with whom Rothman and Harrison JJ agreed, in R v SJRC [2007] NSWCCA 142; his Honour said:

‘38    It not infrequently happens that evidence sought to be relied on by the Crown in a criminal trial is open to more than one interpretation or is capable of giving rise to more than one inference. However, provided that the evidence is capable of bearing the interpretation or of giving rise to the interference (scil - inference) contended for by the Crown, the fact that the defence can suggest some other interpretation or inference which would be consistent with the innocence of the accused does not, of itself, show that any probative value the evidence has is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

39    It is part of the function of the jury as the judges of the facts to determine what interpretation should be given to evidence they accept and to determine what inferences should be drawn from evidence they accept. It is frequently part of the function of the jury to determine which, if any, of a number of competing inferences should be drawn.’

161   Obviously, in determining the admissibility of evidence by reference to probative value, a trial judge is making the assessment on the basis of the information available at the time the question of admissibility is under consideration. In R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; 156 A Crim R 308 and R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437; 158 A Crim R 504 I described the process as an exercise that is ‘predictive and evaluative’. The predictive element is not a prediction of what the jury will make of that item of evidence on completion of the evidence in the trial; it is a prediction of the potential value of the evidence when the mosaic of evidence is complete.

162   The exercise necessarily requires that the assessment of probative value, in that sense, be made on the basis that the evidence will be accepted as reliable and credible - that is, at its most favourable for the tendering party, or, as has been said, ‘at its highest’ (for example, Shamouil at [87]). That is in accordance with a long line of authority.”


	
	Following an examination of authority, Simpson J said at 280 [196]-[197]:
	


“196   I am unable to accept that the existence of ‘competing inferences’ available to be drawn from (or alternative interpretations of) the proposed prosecution evidence has any part to play in the assessment of probative value for the purpose of s 137 of the Evidence Act. That is because of the different exercise required by (for example) s 98, and s 137. Section 98 requires an assessment of the significance of the probative value of the evidence tendered as coincidence evidence in the context of the whole of the case of the tendering party. That is why, in DSJ, it was held that the existence of alternative explanations could have a bearing on the significance of the probative value of the evidence.

197   Section 137 requires assessment of the probative value of the evidence without regard to other evidence in the Crown case (s 137 applies only to evidence tendered by the prosecution) but balanced against the danger of any unfair prejudice.”


	
	With respect to ss.135 and 137 Evidence Act 1995, it is necessary to keep in mind the statement of McHugh J in Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 at 325 [91] that evidence is not unfairly prejudicial “merely because it makes it more likely that the defendant will be convicted”. The relevant enquiry is whether the jury may misuse the evidence in some unfair way: Papakosmas v The Queen at 325 [91]; R v Clark [2001] NSWCCA 494; 123 A Crim R 506 at 582-584 [163]-[165].
	
	
	Unfairly prejudicial evidence is not evidence that advances the Crown case or weakens the defence case, but is evidence that is dangerous to the defence case in some way: R v Suteski [2002] NSWCCA 509 at [116]. There must be a risk that the evidence will provide some irrational, emotional or illogical response or a risk of the evidence being given more weight than it truly deserves: BJS v R [2013] NSWCCA 123; 231 A Crim R 537 at 549-550 [51].
	


Improperly Obtained Evidence and s.138 Evidence Act 1995


	
	The Accused bears the onus of establishing impropriety on an objection under s.138: Robinson v Woolworths Limited [2005] NSWCCA 426; 64 NSWLR 612 at 621 [33], 632 [106].
	
	
	The Evidence Act 1995 does not define the concept of “impropriety”. The principles collected in Ridgeway v The Queen [1995] HCA 66; 184 CLR 19 remain pertinent and those principles ought to be applied when considering whether conduct constitutes “impropriety” in a particular case: Robinson v Woolworths Limited at 618-619 [22]-[24], 622-623 [36]-[37], 631-632 [102]. In Robinson v Woolworths Limited, Basten JA (Barr J agreeing) said at 618-619 [23]:
	


“It follows that the identification of impropriety requires attention to the following propositions. First, it is necessary to identify what, in a particular context, may be viewed as ‘the minimum standards which a society such as ours should expect and require of those entrusted with powers of law enforcement’. Secondly, the conduct in question must not merely blur or contravene those standards in some minor respect; it must be ‘quite inconsistent with’ or ‘clearly inconsistent with’ those standards. Thirdly, the concepts of ‘harassment’ and ‘manipulation’ suggest some level of encouragement, persuasion or importunity in relation to the commission of an offence: thus, in describing the first category of cases (at 39) the joint judgment in Ridgeway referred to offences being procured or induced.”


	
	Basten JA (Barr J agreeing) made the following observations at 622-623 [36]-[37] concerning the minimum standards test:
	


“In circumstances where there is no unlawfulness on the part of any law enforcement officer, mere doubts about the desirability or appropriateness of particular conduct will not be sufficient to demonstrate impropriety.

Before leaving these broad principles, it is necessary to note the indeterminacy of the test identified by reference to inconsistency with ‘the minimum standards which a society such as ours should expect and require of those entrusted with powers of law enforcement’: Ridgeway at 36. Such a test invites assertion and counter-assertion, with no objective touchstone to assist in deciding which to accept and which to reject. It is at least doubtful whether a majority of the Australian community would have shared the High Court’s view of the ‘entrapment’ of Mr Ridgeway: see for example, the comments of McHugh J at 85. The answer is not necessarily to eschew the task, but to establish, in advance, standards of conduct against which a claim of impropriety can be assessed. Where no relevant pre-existing standard has been breached, it should be a rare case in which impropriety would lead to exclusion. (Of course, standards may themselves require scrutiny, but no relevant standard was identified in the present case.) And the test of such a case must involve judicial appraisal of all potentially relevant public policy considerations, being the task actually undertaken in Ridgeway. Appeals to ‘community standards’ will tend to substitute subjective reactions for careful analysis, albeit of ill-defined concepts.”


	
	In R v Cornwell [2003] NSWSC 97; 57 NSWLR 82, Howie J considered a s.138 objection alleging impropriety in the context of incorrect statements made in an application for a listening device warrant. His Honour said at 87-88 [20]-[21]:
	


“I am of the view that, otherwise than when subs 138(2) or s 139 apply, the court should determine whether the section is engaged having regard to the particular facts and circumstances before it but with due regard to the seriousness of a finding that evidence was obtained improperly or as a consequence of an impropriety and the outcome of such a finding. Not every defect, inadequacy, or failing in an investigation should result in a finding that the section applies merely because it may be considered that, as a result of those defects, inadequacies or failings, the investigation was not properly conducted or that the police did not act properly in a particular respect. On the other hand the terms of subs 138(3)(e), which subsection requires the court to take into account whether the ‘impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless’, make it clear that the conduct need not necessarily be wilful or committed in bad faith or as an abuse of power.

I am prepared to accept for present purposes that any misstatement of fact in an affidavit in support of a warrant for the use of a listening device on private premises may be an impropriety within s138, notwithstanding that the misstatement was not intended by the person preparing the affidavit to influence the officer who was to act upon that material in determining whether to issue the warrant. I accept the submission made by Mr Boulten that a person preparing an affidavit for the purposes of obtaining a warrant for the use of a listening device in a private home must be scrupulous to ensure that the contents of the affidavit fully and accurately set out the factual material relevant to the determination whether the warrant should be issued. The question of whether the misstatement was intentional, reckless, or inadvertent and the motive, if any, for the misstatement will be matters which are relevant to the gravity of the impropriety and the exercise of discretion to permit the Crown to lead the evidence notwithstanding that it was obtained improperly or as a consequence of an impropriety.”


	
	Section 142 Evidence Act 1995 addresses the standard of proof when issues concerning admissibility of evidence arise. Section 142 provides:
	


“142    Admissibility of evidence: standard of proof

(1)    Except as otherwise provided by this Act, in any proceeding the court is to find that the facts necessary for deciding:

(a)    a question whether evidence should be admitted or not admitted, whether in the exercise of a discretion or not, or

(b)    any other question arising under this Act,

have been proved if it is satisfied that they have been proved on the balance of probabilities.

(2)    In determining whether it is so satisfied, the matters that the court must take into account include:

(a)    the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and

(b)    the gravity of the matters alleged in relation to the question.”


	
	In R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 8) [2007] NSWSC 82, I observed at [17]-[18]:
	


“17   Section 142(2) Evidence Act 1995 appears to import the Briginshaw principle in requiring a court, when considering whether it is satisfied on the balance of probabilities on a ruling concerning admissibility of evidence, to take into account the gravity of the matters alleged in relation to the question. It has been observed that s.140 Evidence Act 1995, including the reference to ‘the gravity of the matter alleged’ in s.140(2)(c), is reflective of the law, including the Briginshaw principle, and provides for no new principle: Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden [2002] NSWCA 419 at [61]; Palmer v Dorman [2005] NSWCA 361 at [40]-[47].

18   I am satisfied that the Briginshaw principle has application where objection is taken to the admissibility of evidence in a criminal proceeding under s.138 of the Act and it is contended that a person or persons have acted improperly or illegally. The need to take into account ‘the gravity of the matters alleged in relation to a question’ in s.142(2)(b) invokes the Briginshaw principle. This is especially so where the allegation is that a person has consciously and knowingly acted in an improper way involving, as is contended here by the Accused, the making of fraudulent statements and misrepresentations which found their way into applications for warrants.”


	
	I adopt this approach with respect to the submission for the Accused that impropriety is demonstrated in the circumstances of the present case.
	
	
	An imperfection or defect in procedures utilised by law enforcement officers will not necessarily equate to impropriety within the meaning of s.138, nor will all inappropriate conduct of a law enforcement officer necessarily be improper within the meaning of that term in s.138(1)(a): Director of Public Prosecutions v AM [2006] NSWSC 348; 161 A Crim R 219 at 230 [45].
	
	
	If impropriety is established by the Accused, it remains necessary, in the present context, for the Accused to establish that the impropriety resulted in the obtaining of the evidence to which objection is taken. The Accused must satisfy the Court that there is causal connection between the impropriety and the obtaining of the impugned evidence: R v Dalley (2002) 132 A Crim R 169 at 186 [86]; R v Cornwell at 89 [25]. If the Court cannot be satisfied of that matter, s.138 has no application. A connection between the improper conduct and the obtaining of the evidence may be indirect. There could be a sufficient connection found between a misstatement in an application or affidavit in support of a warrant and the evidence obtained as a result of the issuing of the warrant so as to engage s.138(1) of the Act: R v Cornwell at 89 [25].
	
	
	In the event that the Accused establishes the elements of impropriety and causation for the purposes of s.138(1), the evidence is not to be admitted unless the Crown establishes, on the balance of probabilities, that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained. In considering this question, the Court is to take into account the factors identified in s.138(3) of the Act.
	


Expert Opinion Evidence - s.79 Evidence Act 1995


	
	In its written submissions, the Crown referred to relevant authorities concerning the admissibility of expert evidence and the construction and application of s.79 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	The written submissions of the Accused did not contend that the evidence of relevant Crown witnesses did not satisfy the requirements under s.79. A passing oral submission was made, but not developed, with respect to an aspect of the evidence of Dr Walsh (PT1235-1236). In these circumstances, brief reference may be made to the relevant principles.
	
	
	Section 79 Evidence Act 1995 provides an exception to the exclusionary rule in s.76, where evidence is given by a person who has specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience and the opinion evidence of that person is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.
	
	
	In Dasreef Pty Limited v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21; 243 CLR 588 at 604 [37], the plurality described the s.79 admissibility test in the following way:
	


“It should be unnecessary, but it is nonetheless important, to emphasise that what was said by Gleeson CJ in HG (and later by Heydon JA in the Court of Appeal in Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [(2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at 743-744 [85]] is to be read with one basic proposition at the forefront of consideration. The admissibility of opinion evidence is to be determined by application of the requirements of the Evidence Act rather than by any attempt to parse and analyse particular statements in decided cases divorced from the context in which those statements were made. Accepting that to be so, it remains useful to record that it is ordinarily the case, as Heydon JA said in Makita [(2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at 744 [85]], that ‘the expert's evidence must explain how the field of 'specialised knowledge' in which the witness is expert by reason of 'training, study or experience', and on which the opinion is 'wholly or substantially based', applies to the facts assumed or observed so as to produce the opinion propounded’. The way in which s 79(1) is drafted necessarily makes the description of these requirements very long. But that is not to say that the requirements cannot be met in many, perhaps most, cases very quickly and easily. That a specialist medical practitioner expressing a diagnostic opinion in his or her relevant field of specialisation is applying ‘specialised knowledge’ based on his or her ‘training, study or experience’, being an opinion ‘wholly or substantially based’ on that ‘specialised knowledge’, will require little explicit articulation or amplification once the witness has described his or her qualifications and experience, and has identified the subject matter about which the opinion is proffered.”

Order 4 - Application to Exclude Evidence of the Accused Cutting Up Shoe Boxes Under ss.138 Evidence Act 1995 or ss.135(a) or 137 Evidence Act 1995


	
	As with other grounds of objection addressed in this judgment, the parties provided detailed written submissions. It is not necessary for the purposes of this judgment to rehearse those submissions in very great detail. The submissions in question (MFIs15 and 19) are on the Court file. It is sufficient to set out the essence of those submissions to assist an understanding of the decision which I have reached. Before doing so, some context is required.
	


Factual Background


	
	The basic factual matters relating to this objection are not in dispute. Some of them were referred to in the CCS (at [125]-[127] above).
	
	
	I touched upon this topic in R v Xie (No. 3) at [9]-[13]:
	


“9   In May 2010, Mr Sheen was acting as the solicitor for the Accused and Kathy Lin. The Accused had not been charged with the alleged offences of murder at that time.

10   On 3 and 6 May 2010, Mr Sheen accompanied Kathy Lin to, and represented her at, private hearings before the New South Wales Crime Commission (“the Commission”) (Exhibit PTN, Tabs 1 and 2). Those hearings were held in camera. It is an offence to disclose anything said at a private hearing under s.13 New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985. That Act applied to the 2010 private hearings, although it has since been repealed and replaced by the Crime Commission Act 2012.

11   During the course of the private hearing on 6 May 2010, Kathy Lin was examined by Counsel Assisting the Commission concerning the type, brand and size of shoes which the Accused ordinarily wore. That evidence was subject to the confidentiality provisions referred to above.

12   After the Accused was charged with the murders, committal proceedings took place before a Magistrate in connection with those charges. On 21 August 2012, Kathy Lin was called as a witness by the Crown. Mr Corish, of counsel, appeared for Kathy Lin on that occasion. Mr Turnbull SC appeared for the Accused. Mr Tedeschi QC, Senior Crown Prosecutor, appeared for the Crown at those proceedings.

13   It was the case that an audio-visual surveillance device had been placed by investigators in the home of the Accused and Kathy Lin at 4 Beck Street, North Epping prior to 6 May 2010. That surveillance device captured certain images, which the Crown says depict the Accused cutting up shoe boxes and disposing of them in the early hours of 7 May 2010 (Exhibits PTO and PTP).”


	
	During the examination before the NSW Crime Commission on 6 May 2010, Kathy Lin was informed by counsel assisting that the police were of the view:
	


(a)   that there was a single killer;

(b)   that the killer was wearing ASICS brand sneakers;

(c)   that the killer at no stage went near Ms AB ‘s room;

(d)   that the shoes worn by the killer were a men’s US-size 9.5, the same shoe size as that of the Accused.


	
	Items (a), (b) and (c) in the preceding paragraph were, in fact, accurate statements of the belief of the investigating police. However, Item (d) was inaccurate in that the evidence indicated that the killer’s shoe size was between men’s US-size 8.5 and 10.5, rather than 9.5.
	
	
	There is no dispute that, following the NSW Crime Commission hearing on 6 May 2010, the Accused came to learn of the questions asked during the hearing concerning the killer’s shoes and the shoes of the Accused. Evidence given by Kathy Lin at the committal proceedings touched upon this topic.
	
	
	There is some controversy as to how the Accused came to learn of the questions asked of Kathy Lin at the NSW Crime Commission private hearing and the answers given by her. The evidence of Kathy Lin at the committal proceedings indicated that it was Mr Sheen who had disclosed these matters. The evidence of Mr Sheen at the Basha Inquiry in this Court in November 2013 was that there had been no discussion at all in his presence with the Accused or Kathy Lin concerning the Accused’s shoes or shoe size. He denied that he had conveyed to the Accused any information that he had become aware of in the NSW Crime Commission about the investigation of the matter.
	
	
	By whichever of these two means, it seems clear that the Accused was informed of what was said during the examination of his wife at the private hearing on 6 May 2010 concerning shoes. Later that evening, the Accused was captured by visual surveillance device apparently cutting up shoe boxes in the presence of his wife.
	


Submissions of the Accused


	
	It was submitted for the Accused that the questioning of Kathy Lin before the NSW Crime Commission on 6 May 2010 was the result of collaboration between the NSW Crime Commission and the New South Wales Police. It was submitted that the questioning was deliberate and intentionally provocative.
	
	
	The Accused submitted that the evidence of cutting up shoes was obtained improperly, with the impropriety being:
	


(a)   the deliberate and provocative questioning of Kathy Lin before the NSW Crime Commission, with the expectation that she would breach the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 by telling her husband what was put to her at the hearing - it is said that Kathy Lin was an innocent third party being used to illicit a response from the Accused, who was a suspect;

(b)   the improper use of the NSW Crime Commission being to provoke a response from the Accused;

(c)   propositions were put to Kathy Lin which were either deliberately or recklessly not factually correct, in order to exaggerate the state of the evidence against her husband.


	
	Counsel for the Accused submitted that events between February and May 2010 constituted a form of pressure upon the Accused and Kathy Lin, leading up to her examination before the NSW Crime Commission. It was submitted that Kathy Lin had been subjected to intemperate, unfair and belligerent questioning which would not have been allowed in a courtroom.
	
	
	It was submitted that the strategy was to confront Kathy Lin with provocative questioning, and allegations concerning her husband’s involvement, in the hope of gathering evidence to incriminate the Accused. At the committal proceedings, Detective Sergeant Maree accepted that the police strategy was to “rattle their cage and see what happens” (T14-15, committal proceedings, 23 November 2012).
	
	
	The Accused submitted that Kathy Lin was questioned in a deliberate and provocative way before the NSW Crime Commission, with the expectation that she would breach the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 by telling the Accused what was put to her at the hearing.
	
	
	It was submitted further that propositions put to Kathy Lin at the hearing were either deliberately or recklessly not factually correct, with particular reference being made to the statement that the killer’s shoe size was “the same as your husband” (T63, NSW Crime Commission, 6 May 2010), when the true position was that the evidence disclosed the killer’s shoe size to be between men’s US-size 8.5-10.5, and not 9.5.
	
	
	It was submitted that the examination of Kathy Lin in this way went beyond the true confines of the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985. The Accused submitted that impropriety had been demonstrated and that the Court should exclude the evidence under challenge.
	
	
	The Accused accepted the probative value of the evidence, bearing as it did upon the issue of consciousness of guilt. However, it was submitted that the impropriety here was grave so that the evidence should be excluded in the exercise of discretion.
	
	
	If the s.138 objection did not succeed, the Accused objected to the tender of the evidence under ss.135(a) and 137 Evidence Act 1995 on the basis that the evidence is unfairly prejudicial, or that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the Accused. In this respect, it was submitted that there is an evident basis that gives rise to an equivocal motivation for the Accused’s conduct in cutting up shoe boxes, which negates what is said to be the probative value of the evidence. It was submitted that there were extraordinary pressures on the Accused and Kathy Lin arising from the murders of five members of their family, and that they were vulnerable in the circumstances then prevailing.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that no impropriety had been demonstrated on the part of the NSW Crime Commission or the New South Wales Police. It was noted that this was the first occasion on which Kathy Lin had been questioned about her husband’s possession of ASICS shoes of the same kind as those used by the killer.
	
	
	The Crown noted the evidence of Detective Sergeant Maree as to his purpose in providing information to Kathy Lin about the shoes (to “rattle their cage” to “see what happened”). The Crown submitted that there was nothing improper in this approach by the police or indeed by the NSW Crime Commission.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the provision of information about the shoes to Kathy Lin in no way incited her or encouraged her to break the law by conveying information to her husband in breach of the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985. The Crown noted, in any event, that it was her evidence that she did not convey this information to her husband but that the solicitor, Mr Sheen, did so.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that no impropriety or illegality had been established by the Accused. Whilst acknowledging that an inaccurate statement had been made to Kathy Lin during the examination concerning the killer’s shoe size (US-men’s size 9.5 instead of US-men’s size 8.5-10.5), the Crown submitted that this did not constitute impropriety.
	
	
	Even if impropriety did arise, the Crown submitted that it was trivial and not such as would lead to the exclusion of the evidence. By reference to the factors in s.138(3) Evidence Act 1995, the Crown submitted that the probative value of the evidence was high and that, if the point was reached where the relevant balancing exercise was to be undertaken, the evidence ought be admitted.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the actions of the NSW Crime Commission or of Detective Sergeant Maree were incapable of amounting to a degree of harassment or manipulation which was inconsistent with minimum standards of acceptable conduct in the circumstances.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the objections under ss.138, 135(a) and 137 Evidence Act 1995 should be overruled.
	


Decision


	
	The primary focus of the present objection is s.138. A subsidiary objection was made by reference to ss.135(a) and 137 Evidence Act 1995. The Accused did not submit that the evidence concerning the cutting up of shoe boxes was not relevant, for the purpose of ss.55 and 56 Evidence Act 1995. The Crown contends that this evidence is relevant as demonstrating consciousness of guilt, and the Accused did not seek to contradict that proposition.
	
	
	The applicable principles surrounding a s.138 objection appear at [162]-[171] above.
	
	
	Topics (a) and (b) at [185] above may be considered together. Each contends the improper use of the NSW Crime Commission. This is said to arise from what is described as the deliberate and provocative questioning of Kathy Lin in circumstances where she was to be used to elicit a response from her husband.
	
	
	There is limited evidence before this Court concerning the hearing on 6 May 2010 before the NSW Crime Commission. It is clear that Kathy Lin had been called to be examined on 3 and 6 May 2010. She was legally represented by Mr Sheen. It may be inferred that the hearing was part of an investigation by the NSW Crime Commission relating to the five murders of members of the Lin family.
	
	
	It may be concluded that the New South Wales Police Force and the NSW Crime Commission were acting co-operatively in this investigation.
	
	
	In my view, it is unremarkable that an investigation by an inquisitorial or investigative body such as the NSW Crime Commission would proceed with persons being called to be examined in relation to the subject matter of the investigation. The NSW Crime Commission is not bound by the rules or practice of evidence and can inform itself on any matter in such manner as it considers appropriate: s.13A New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985.
	
	
	Kathy Lin was represented by a solicitor at the hearing on 3 and 6 May 2010. One of the roles of a legal representative for a witness at such a hearing is to assist the witness by taking appropriate objection, or making an appropriate submission if the examination is considered to exceed the bounds of a proper examination. No objection was taken by the legal representative on 6 May 2010, nor any submission made complaining of the tone or the content of the questions being asked.
	
	
	The concept of asking questions of a person during a criminal investigation for the purpose of “rattling their cage” is not, of itself, improper. A range of investigative techniques are undertaken by law enforcement authorities which may have in mind seeing what a person or persons may do in the event that certain information is provided to them.
	
	
	The fact that Kathy Lin was informed of matters which the police had discovered concerning shoe prints and shoe size at the crime scene was not improper. Nothing was said or done which compelled or pressured Kathy Lin to pass on this information to the Accused. Indeed, it is her account that she did not do so.
	
	
	For the purpose of this ruling, it may be taken that the Accused came to learn of what had been said to Kathy Lin on 6 May 2010 concerning shoe prints and shoe size.
	
	
	It has not been submitted that the events in question constituted a breach of the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985, with no claim of illegality being advanced on behalf of the Accused in support of the s.138 objection. The written submissions for the Accused acknowledge the statement of Basten JA in SD v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] NSWCA 48; 84 NSWLR 456 at 465 [29] that a primary purpose of the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 was to enhance the likelihood of the laying of charges and the prosecution of such charges at trial. What has occurred here appears to accord with this statement.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that any impropriety has been established in the circumstances surrounding the calling of Kathy Lin to give evidence before the NSW Crime Commission on 6 May 2010, nor in the questioning of her on that occasion.
	
	
	The remaining basis of claimed impropriety is what was described as the putting of propositions to Kathy Lin which were either deliberately or recklessly not factually correct, in order to exaggerate the state of the evidence against the Accused (see [185](c) above).
	
	
	There was no inaccuracy in what was put to Kathy Lin on 6 May 2010 concerning shoes and shoe size, apart from the conceded inaccuracy concerning the precision of the killer’s shoe size (see [180] above).
	
	
	As authorities such as R v Cornwell  and Director of Public Prosecutions v AM make clear, the making of an inaccurate statement in a warrant application may, depending upon the circumstances, constitute impropriety for the purpose of s.138. The present case does not involve a warrant application. Rather, it involves the questioning of a person before an investigatory body. I am content to determine this objection upon the basis that the approach in R v Cornwell is capable of applying by analogy in the circumstances of this case.
	
	
	It is necessary to consider the particular inaccuracy in this case. Only one of several propositions put to Kathy Lin was inaccurate. The particular inaccuracy was to attribute a greater degree of precision concerning the killer’s shoe size than the evidence indicated. The evidence available to police indicated that the killer’s shoe size was within the range of US men’s size 8.5-10.5. The proposition put to Kathy Lin was that the killer’s shoe size was US men’s size 9.5, which was said to be the same size as that of the Accused.
	
	
	This is not a case where the Accused’s shoe size in fact lay outside the relatively narrow range of shoe size indicated by the evidence. As it happens, the Accused’s shoe size lay in the middle of that range.
	
	
	I accept, for present purposes, that the making of an inaccurate statement of this type during an examination before the NSW Crime Commission has the capacity to clear the first hurdle in establishing impropriety. However, in the circumstances of this case, I am simply not persuaded that impropriety has been demonstrated.
	
	
	Even if this circumstance did demonstrate impropriety for the purpose of s.138, it would be necessary to consider whether there was any causal link between that impropriety and the obtaining of the evidence in question. The matter may be tested in this way. Would there have been any material difference in what occurred if what was said to Kathy Lin was that the killer’s shoe size was US men’s size 8.5-10.5, rather than US men’s size 9.5? It is difficult to see that that would be so. There is the additional complication here that Kathy Lin asserts that she did not pass on this information to the Accused.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that a causal link has been demonstrated, if impropriety had otherwise been established.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the Accused has not established impropriety, and the necessary causal link, so as to raise for consideration the balancing exercise required under s.138(3), upon which the Crown would bear the onus of proof to the civil standard.
	
	
	If this point had been reached, I would have been well satisfied that the discretion ought be exercised in favour of admission of the evidence. In my view, the evidence is of substantial probative value: s.138(3)(a). The evidence is important in the proceeding (s.138(3)(b)) and the nature of the subject matter of the proceeding is very grave, involving five counts of murder (s.138(3)(c)).
	
	
	The only impropriety which I would have found (but have not done so) arises from the inaccurate statement concerning shoe size. Such an impropriety, which I would not characterise as being deliberate or reckless (s.138(3)(e)) could fairly be characterised as trivial (s.138(3)(d)). Other subparagraphs (s.138(3)(f)-(h)) would not, in my view, operate against admission of the evidence in the circumstances of this case.
	
	
	I decline to exclude the evidence under challenge by reference to s.138 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	The objections by the Accused under ss.135(a) and 137 were dealt with briefly in submissions, and a similar approach may be adopted in ruling upon them in this judgment. The relevant principles appear at [154]-[161] above.
	
	
	It is submitted for the Accused that the Court should refuse to admit this evidence as its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to the Accused: s.135(a). Alternatively, it is submitted that the Court must refuse to admit the evidence if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the Accused: s.137.
	
	
	In support of this aspect of the objection, it was submitted for the Accused that innocent explanations may be available to the Accused for cutting up the shoe boxes, arising from the pressures which had existed for some time on the Accused and Kathy Lin as a result of the deaths of five members of the family.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the evidence of the Accused cutting up the shoe boxes is of substantial probative value. I am not satisfied that the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to the Accused. Nor am I satisfied that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the Accused.
	
	
	The question of any alternative explanation or competing inference concerning the cutting up of shoe boxes by the Accused will be matters for the jury to consider. It is not a basis upon which the Court should exclude evidence under s.137: R v Burton (at [157]-[159] above).
	
	
	It will be a matter for the jury to determine what weight ought be given to this evidence in determining the question of the guilt of the Accused.
	
	
	I decline to exclude this evidence under ss.135(a) or 137 Evidence Act 1995.
	


Orders 1, 2 and 3 - Objection to All Evidence Concerning Stain 91 (Item 550) Including Evidence of Its Location in the Garage at the Beck Street Premises and Subsequent Forensic and DNA Analysis and Opinion Evidence Arising From It


	
	The CCS referred to the location of Stain 91 and subsequent testing and DNA analysis (at [94]-[110] above).
	
	
	The parties have provided very detailed written submissions concerning two interrelated topics:
	


(a)   whether Stain 91 is human blood (MFIs16, 25 and 31);

(b)   whether DNA analysis and opinion evidence concerning Stain 91 (Item 550) ought be admitted (MFIs29 and 32).


	
	In addition to the written submissions, short oral submissions were made on these topics on 14 April 2014 (PT1232-1241).
	


A Topic-by-Topic Examination or an Overall Examination?


	
	The written submissions of the parties approach the objection to this body of evidence in different ways.
	
	
	The submissions of the Accused challenge particular aspects of the technical and scientific evidence at different points along the way, commencing with the location of Stain 91 in the garage at the Beck Street premises on 13 May 2010, the sampling methods used and subsequent analysis and conclusions, as well as the process of DNA analysis undertaken at FASS, the opinion evidence of Dr Walsh and the processes undertaken by Dr Walsh and Dr Perlin and the conclusions reached by them.
	
	
	The Crown submissions approach these issues in two overlapping steps:
	


(a)   the Crown submits that the combination of all the evidence surrounding Stain 91 (Item 550) is overwhelmingly capable of proving that the stain was blood, that it is relevant and admissible evidence with issues surroundings its deposition and composition being proper questions for the jury to consider and determine;

(b)   the Crown case in relation to the relevance and significance of the presence of the mixed DNA profile found in the Accused’s garage is straightforward - as part of the circumstantial case, the fact that a mixed DNA profile with the extant properties it has, including the number of contributors, the likely contributors (including evidence of the Y-Filer haplotype), the presence of certain alleles and peak heights of those alleles, the fact that the mixture can readily be explained by the presence of the DNA from a combination of the five deceased, is similar to other samples from the crime scene, and the associated likelihood ratios, can be used persuasively to link the Accused to the crime scene.


	
	It may be seen that the competing approaches of the parties on the question of admissibility of this evidence call for some assessment as to the appropriate method to consider the objection in this case.
	
	
	As will be seen, I prefer the Crown’s approach of determining the admissibility issue having regard to what is said to be the overall and cumulative effect of the evidence. For example, it would be unduly narrow, and conducive to error, to focus tightly upon the question whether, in light of the evidence concerning the location and sampling of Stain 91, it ought be excluded given the evidence of witnesses that it is “possibly blood”. It is relevant to take into account, amongst other things, the evidence of DNA analysis which tends to confirm the presence of DNA, and thus human material, in Stain 91. The evidence adduced on the DNA issue is capable of shedding light upon the question as to whether Stain 91 is blood.
	
	
	As will be seen, there is, in addition, non-scientific evidence arising from the alleged actions and statements of the Accused, which bears upon this topic as well.
	


Events Leading to the Location of Stain 91


	
	The Crown submission on the admissibility of Stain 91 (MFI25) contains a useful summary of aspects of the evidence leading to the discovery of Stain 91. It is helpful to set out this part of the Crown submission (MFI25, paragraphs 3-10) (footnotes excluded):
	


“Forensic examinations in relation to Stain 91 during the execution of the search warrant at 4 Beck Street, Epping on 11 May 2010

3.   On 11 May 2010, police executed a Crime Scene Warrant at the accused's home at 4 Beck Street and a detailed forensic examination and search of the premises was conducted. The search continued until 15 May 2010. On 13 May 2010, the forensic examination included the garage, where a number of swabs and samples were obtained of stains and markings believed to be blood. Underneath furniture in the garage, police located a small amount of what appeared to be blood which was sampled and sent for DNA analysis.

Evidence from forensic officers searching the garage 

4.    At the Committal, evidence was called from biologists Melanie LeCompte and Nicole Campbell, who were then attached to the Forensic Biology Section. Ms LeCompte attended 4 Beck Street between 12 to 14 May 2010. Ms Campbell attended the premises on 13 and 14 May 2010. Ms Gerhard, who was also then a reporting officer in the Forensic Biology Unit, attended on 12 May 2010.

5.    Ms LeCompte gave evidence on 29 August and 30 August 2012. Ms Campbell was called as a witness on 13 November 2012. Ms Gerhard, together with the defence expert Dr Paula Hallam, gave evidence during the voir dire proceedings on 21 and 22 November 2013.

6.    The biologists that were present at the time gave evidence in relation to a briefing that was provided to the forensic officers prior to the start of the search on each of the mornings, the areas that were examined at 4 Beck St, and the details and procedure of the forensic examinations, in particular, with regard to the garage floor and Stain 91.

7.    The defence expert Dr Hallam did not have the advantage of any direct observation of the screening, detection, examination and swabbing of Stain 91. …

Briefing

8.    The forensic biologists were explicitly tasked with conducting an examination at 4 Beck Street that was focussed on detecting blood evidence. Ms LeCompte gave evidence that the forensic officers who conducted the search of the garage were briefed in the morning of 13 May 2010 to ‘look for blood and therefore anything that we possibly could believe that was blood we would test to see if there is the possibility that the stain is a blood stain'.

9.    Ms Campbell stated that the information she received from Ms LeCompte on the drive to the premises of 4 Beck Street on 13 May 2010 was that they were going to concentrate the search on this particular day on the garage. She was further informed that, ‘they believed that the occupant of the house had been in the garage and they wanted to see if there was any blood staining in it’. Ms Campbell stated that, ‘a plan was formed that we would concentrate on the garage that day that we would be looking for any sort of blood staining on any of the furniture, on the floor or on any of the tools. Basically, all the contents of the garage was to be searched’. Ms Gerhard confirmed that the biologists were given particular instructions to screen the premises for blood.

Examination of the garage floor

10.    Ms LeCompte gave evidence that the examination of the garage floor commenced at 4.45 pm. The searching team included Nicole Campbell and Jae Gerhard. The search started with a 'hands and knees' search of the floor, followed by a visual examination with white light and the application of a presumptive screening test for blood using the chemicals Orthotolidine ('Otol') and hydrogen peroxide. The evidence was that all officers were searching the floor in relation to discoloured areas and conducting testing thereof, with Ms LeCompte being primarily responsible for the note taking. Ms Gerhard gave evidence that on the portion of the floor that had been allocated to her, she would estimate that she conducted 300-400 Otol tests alone. Ms Gerhard gave a detailed description of what is involved in the two-step Otol test.”


	
	The Crown submissions then turned to the discovery of Stain 91 and what was done thereafter.
	


Submissions of the Accused on the Question Whether Stain 91 is Blood (MFI31)


	
	I turn to the submissions advanced on behalf of the Accused. Although not attempting an exhaustive recital of them, it is appropriate to provide some detail to assist an understanding of the objection.
	
	
	The submissions for the Accused pointed to evidence from a number of witnesses which was said to demonstrate difficulties which the Crown have on this issue. Put shortly, it was submitted that what was said to be a small and ill-defined stain on a dirty and dusty concrete garage floor, which gave a positive reaction to one presumptive test and a negative reaction to another (as to blood), with no control testing having been done of the stain and with no swabbing of an area around the stain raised very grave doubt that Stain 91 was in fact blood.
	
	
	It was submitted that Stain 91 has to be blood, on the Crown case, as otherwise there is no link between the Accused and the murders of the deceased.
	
	
	The Accused submitted that the evidence in relation to Stain 91 being “possibly blood” should not be admitted because it is not relevant.
	
	
	Submissions were made in support of this proposition by reference to the evidence of Ms LeCompte, Ms Campbell and Ms Gerhard, together with the defence expert witness, Dr Hallam. These submissions involved a number of propositions:
	


(a)   there were limitations on presumptive tests and an absence of control and confirmatory testing;

(b)   there was no guarantee that the stain, and nothing other than the stain, was swabbed in the process of obtaining Stain 91;

(c)   the limited assistance of the appearance of the stain and its reaction to Otol;

(d)   the absence of direct evidence as to how the stain was deposited;

(e)   the biological source of the DNA cannot be determined.


	
	The Accused submitted that one of the facts in issue in the trial is whether the stain found in the Accused’s garage, 10 months after the killings, was blood from the deceased killed in the Boundary Road premises. In order to prove this, the Crown has to prove that the stain found in the garage is human blood containing the DNA of some or all of the deceased, and which the Accused deposited after he murdered them.
	
	
	The Accused submitted that the question whether the stain found in the garage is actually blood, is a fact in the Crown circumstantial case against the Accused that is so fundamental to the process of reasoning in relation to his guilt, that it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt: Shepherd v The Queen [1990] HCA 56; 170 CLR 573 at 585. It is submitted that this conclusion of fact is an indispensable, intermediate step in the reasoning process towards an inference of guilt, so that the conclusion must be established beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	Reference was made to Davidson v R [2009] NSWCCA 150; 75 NSWLR 150 at 165 [74] where Simpson J (Spigelman CJ and James J agreeing) said that an intermediate fact will be “indispensable” where the absence of evidence of that fact means there is no fit case to go to a jury.
	
	
	The Accused submits that the question whether the stain is blood is indispensable. If it cannot be proved that the stain is blood, the Accused submits that the stain is not relevant as there is no link to the murders. If the stain is not blood, it is submitted that it must not be placed before the jury.
	
	
	The Accused submits that the very highest the experts can put it is that the stain is “possibly blood”. In light of the evidence given by expert witnesses at the committal proceedings and the pretrial hearing, it was submitted that it is now even less possible that the stain is blood, with the issue involving no more than speculation.
	
	
	The Accused sought to rely upon Armstrong v R [2013] NSWCCA 113 as being illustrative of the dangers of the admission of presumptive testing. There, Harrison J (Simpson and Bellew JJ agreeing) stated (at [24]) that a presumptive test does not positively establish the presence of blood, and that the jury was arguably misled by a Crown submission that there was in fact blood found when the evidence in support of that submission did not rise above presumptive testing (at [29]).
	
	
	Further submissions were made for the Accused pointing to aspects of the evidence of Dr Perlin, Mr Walton, Dr Walsh, Mr Goetz and Ms Neville. It was submitted that this evidence did not advance the Crown case that Stain 91 was blood.
	
	
	It was noted that the Crown case was that Stain 91 involved at least three contributors mixed into the one sample (see [103] above). The Accused submitted that the Crown case that, because there were a number of contributors mixed into the sample, it was inevitable that they were mixed before being deposited on the garage floor, was pure speculation. It was submitted further that the manner of collection of the swab will affect the DNA analysis. It was submitted that Ms Campbell could not guarantee that she swabbed the stain, and the stain only, in taking the sample which is Stain 91.
	
	
	The submissions summarised so far constituted the defence challenge to the relevance, and thus admissibility, of Stain 91.
	


Submissions of the Accused on the DNA Evidence (MFI29)


	
	The Accused made separate and detailed written submissions directed to the exclusion of the DNA analysis and opinion evidence.
	
	
	A range of topics were explored in cross-examination of Crown witnesses called at the pretrial hearing and, in particular, Dr Perlin. Not all challenges apparently made in the course of cross-examination, in particular of Dr Perlin, have translated into submissions for the Accused objecting to the tender of the evidence.
	
	
	The Accused challenges the admissibility of the DNA evidence arising from Stain 91 (Item 550). It was submitted that, in order for this evidence to be relevant, the Crown has to establish:
	


(a)   the stain swabbed in May 2010 in the Accused’s garage was blood - if the Crown cannot prove that the stain swabbed is blood, there is no need to turn to the analysis of the DNA said to come from the stain;

(b)   the blood-to-blood sample from the garage is the same as the sample from the crime scene - the Crown refers to “evidence to evidence” comparisons in the CCS (at [107] above) - the Crown seeks to establish that the samples came from the same source, being the victims’ blood shared and mixed at the time of their deaths in the Boundary Road premises;

(c)   the sample in the garage was a part of a larger sample from the crime scene - the alleged killer, the Accused, transported it from the Boundary Road premises to the Beck Street premises.


	
	The Accused submitted that Item 550 was a degraded and inhibited sample, and a complex mixture of related people. These aspects are relevant to the analysis of the sample and how the results are interpreted.
	
	
	The Accused submitted that Dr Perlin’s TrueAllele program had not been validated for five-person related mixtures. It was submitted that TrueAllele had not been validated by FASS and, although a limited TrueAllele program is used, FASS is still in the process of preparing it and getting it ready for use. The Accused submitted that STRmix is the only validated program used by FASS.
	
	
	It was submitted further that TrueAllele has not been validated for PowerPlex 21.
	
	
	The Accused pointed to evidence that scientific staff from New South Wales Police and FASS carried out an evaluation of the Cybergenetics TrueAllele expert system and prepared an evaluation report for the Biologist Specialist Advisory Group (“BSAG”), a group with a senior representative from each of the Australasian jurisdictional forensic DNA laboratories. This group, in consultation with the Australasian Scientific Working Group on Statistics and Interpretation, identified that a move towards a continuous probabilistic model was the way forward for DNA interpretation and national standardisation (statement of Sharon Neville, 4 February 2014, Exhibit PTK1, Tab A). However, the Accused submitted that the BSAG evaluation process revealed a number of problems, including analytical artefacts, the modelling of stutter and other matters referred to in the Accused’s written submissions on DNA evidence (MFI29, paragraph 43).
	
	
	The Accused submitted that Dr Perlin’s first report of 23 September 2013 was prepared before TrueAllele was validated.
	
	
	A submission was developed that TrueAllele does not produce a relevant sample-to-sample comparison. TrueAllele generates likelihood ratios which are a measure of the extent to which the evidence changes beliefs in a hypothesis. A submission was developed by reference to the use by TrueAllele of inferred genotypes, and not actual evidence samples.
	
	
	The Accused submitted that the TrueAllele analysis has no relevance to the fact in issue. It is entirely possible that one contributor to the garage mixture is the same as one contributor to the crime scene. However, the issue is whether all the contributors to the garage sample are found in the crime scene samples. The Accused submits that this is the only relevant hypothesis which supports the Crown case and that Dr Perlin’s analysis does not address this question, let alone resolve it.
	
	
	It was submitted further that TrueAllele is not capable of dealing with contributors who are related. It is not capable of dealing with a different number of contributors in each alternate hypothesis that the software considers. As a result, the likelihood ratios generated are said not to be relevant.
	
	
	It was submitted further that the likelihood that individual persons may have contributed to the mixture is not relevant to the question of whether the sample is inevitably a combination of contributors, all of whom must be deceased to support the Crown theory.
	
	
	The Accused submitted that TrueAllele will only answer the question it is asked. In this case, it was asked to identify the inferred genotypes for the deceased, and then identify the individual genotype in various evidence samples. It did not consider whether there were unknown contributors. It did not consider whether Ms AB’s inferred genotype was in the mixture in the same manner. It did not consider if any other known reference sample, other than the Accused, was in the mixture.
	
	
	The Accused submitted that the Crown case in relation to the DNA evidence may end up being that there are at least three contributors to Stain 91, with at least three in the major component or probably at least four or more taking into account minor contributors. The results of the Profiler Plus testing raised the possibility of interrelatedness amongst contributors based upon common alleles. Min Lin, Henry Lin and Terry Lin could not be excluded as possible contributors to Stain 91 (see [101] above). The CCS noted that Mr Walton applied the RMNE formula, and determined that one in five people in the general population could not be excluded as a potential contributor. It was noted that Mr Walton adopted this formula due to uncertainty over the number of contributors to the mixed profile (see [101] above).
	
	
	The Accused submitted that no expert who had given evidence at the pretrial hearing had determined the number of contributors to Item 550. Reference was made to the evidence of Mr Goetz, noting that he could not say there were five contributors in the mixture. Submissions were made, as well, on this topic by reference to the evidence of Dr Perlin.
	
	
	Submissions were made by reference to the defence request to Dr Perlin to have Ms AB’s sample tested using TrueAllele Casework. I note that Dr Perlin readily agreed to undertake this task. An adjournment of the pretrial hearing was allowed to permit the Accused’s legal representatives to consider Dr Perlin’s report in response to their request, and to take advice from their own expert advisor or advisors on the issues raised in it.
	
	
	The Accused seeks to rely upon part of Dr Perlin’s report dated 26 March 2014 as providing evidence of Ms AB’s DNA being contained in Item 550, noting that this conclusion would mean that Item 550 cannot be linked to the crime scene, as Ms AB is alive (MFI29, paragraph 80).
	
	
	The Accused made submissions concerning the concept of shadowing, mentioned in Dr Perlin’s evidence with respect to this report. Further submissions were made by reference to Dr Perlin’s report, the results of which were said to indicate that Ms AB was present in the crime scene samples and, in particular, Item 223, a swab taken from a wall in Bedroom 3 (the bedroom of Henry and Terry Lin). This sample was a direct swab of blood and it was noted that Ms AB was not present and did not bleed. This aspect was relied upon to challenge the reliability of Dr Perlin’s evidence.
	
	
	Submissions were made by reference to Dr Perlin’s evidence concerning mixture weights. It was submitted that Dr Perlin’s report of 26 March 2014 (Exhibit PTK20), being the report provided by Dr Perlin in response to the defence request (concerning Ms AB) made in the course of the pretrial hearing, provided an insight into the complexity of the mixture. Reference was made to concepts of shadowing and false positives, which were said to manifest the actual difficulties which TrueAllele has in dealing with five-person related mixtures which are compromised. It was said to constitute effectively an acknowledgement of an important area of imprecision in TrueAllele’s capacities, being an imprecision previously demonstrated by the differing likelihood ratios in Dr Perlin’s first two reports, and the error corrected in the third report that arose in applying an incorrect theta value.
	
	
	The Accused noted that the Crown case is that the mixed profiles from Stain 91 (Item 550) and Item 626 (based upon PowerPlex 21 testing) are “consistent, with a large amount of overlapping information, present in similar proportions”. The Crown bases its case on this aspect on Dr Walsh, who said there was a “very high degree of similarity for complex mixed profiles of this nature, particularly considering these observations under a proposition that the mixed profiles arose independently from each other” (see [108] above).
	
	
	The Accused submits that Items 550 and 616 are not, in fact, the same. There are features of the DNA profiles which are different. Peak heights and peak-height ratios, within and between loci, are different. There are 61 alleles in the mixed profile of Item 616. Those Item 616 alleles are present in the mixed profile from Item 550, but there are an additional 14 alleles designated in Item 550. It is submitted that the proportion of the allele distribution is not identical.
	
	
	The Accused submitted that there were limitations on Dr Walsh’s analysis. It was submitted that he had no specialised knowledge or experience in comparing complex mixtures. He had never made a comparative analysis such as this before. It was this aspect which led to a s.79 objection to this evidence of Dr Walsh.
	
	
	Dr Walsh was also unfamiliar with the performance of 3500s, a particular machine that works on PowerPlex 21. He did not have any direct involvement using those instruments. For the interpretation of the profiles, he was almost entirely reliant on the FASS staff. Dr Walsh sought advice in relation to criteria applied to interpret profiles, and stated that if there were questions regarding the profile designation itself, he would defer to the FASS laboratory.
	
	
	The Accused developed a submission by reference to the additional 14 alleles in Item 550 which were not in Item 616. It was submitted, as well, that the fact that the sample comprised people who were related raised further difficulties when trying to establish similarities, and their significance.
	
	
	Particular reference should be made to the following part of the Accused’s written submission on the DNA evidence (MFI29, paragraphs 105-106):
	


“105.   The evidence in this case will be that [Ms AB], Henry and Terry Lin spent significant time at the home and in the garage at 4 Beck Street, which was only 250 metres away from their house. All the deceased had been to 4 Beck Street. Min, [Ms AB], Henry and Terry had been in the garage. The children played in the garage. Kathy Lin’s parents and [Ms AB] lived at Beck Street for around 10 months before the garage was sampled in May 2010. Numerous items from the Boundary Road house, from the newsagency, and Jimmy Hue were placed inside the garage before the garage was searched in May 2010. None of these items were filmed as police and forensic biologists moved them. With regard to these items, their nature, position, location, source and time of placement were not accounted for.

106.    There is therefore a very clear explanation for the presence of their DNA in the garage.”


	
	I will return to this aspect later in the judgment. It is appropriate to observe at this point, however, that there was no evidence of these factual matters adduced at the pretrial hearing. Further, these matters seem to foreshadow evidence which may be adduced at the trial which would be available to a jury to take into account in determining whether there is, in effect, an innocent explanation for the presence of DNA from persons including some of the deceased persons in the garage and, in particular, in Stain 91.
	
	
	This aspect of the Accused’s written submission appears to raise issues for a jury, and not matters bearing upon the question of admissibility.
	
	
	As has been noted earlier (see [153], [157]-[159] above), the fact that the Accused advances these matters in submissions, as a possible alternative explanation for the presence of Stain 91 (and its DNA components), does not support the exclusion of the evidence. Indeed, it serves to fortify the view that the evidence ought be admitted, with the jury to assess the use to be made of this evidence, in light of all evidence adduced at the trial.
	
	
	The Accused submitted that one of the significant failings of TrueAllele is that it cannot deal with related people. It was submitted that proportions in the profiles are not the same, with reference being made to parts of the evidence of Dr Walsh. The Accused noted that Dr Walsh made no statistical assessment of similarities.
	
	
	It was submitted that there is no scientific basis upon which it can be concluded that Item 550 is relevantly similar to the crime scene sample.
	
	
	The Accused submitted that there was no evidence upon which a reasonably instructed jury could conclude that the garage sample is relevantly or probatively similar to the crime scene sample. In order to have probative value, it was submitted that the similarities must advance the proposition that the DNA derived from blood at the crime scene. It is not in dispute that there are some generic similarities between the garage sample and the crime scene samples - the sample contains DNA, it is a complex mixture, it has multiple contributors, the contributors are male and female and the samples contain a number of very common alleles. It was submitted, however, that DAL analysed about 640 samples from the crime scene and not one of these samples has the same DNA profile as Item 550, despite emanating supposedly from the same location.
	
	
	The Accused submitted that a points of similarity approach has no scientific validity. It was submitted that comparing profiles does not involve adding up alleles in common.
	
	
	The Accused submitted that it is not possible to determine if Items 550 and 616 were once part of the same mixture. It was submitted that there is no evidence that one sample is a sub-sample of the other sample. It was said that the Crown case has to be that Items 550 and 616 have come from the same pool of blood, but there is no evidence to support this.
	
	
	With respect to the discretionary exclusion of the DNA evidence pursuant to ss.135 and 137 Evidence Act 1995, the Accused relied upon the following contentions:
	


(a)   there is no true statistical phenomenon for something as complex as low template DNA profiles;

(b)   TrueAllele is the “new frontier”;

(c)   TrueAllele is a work in progress.


	
	The Accused submitted that the time line of TrueAllele’s analysis of the sample, and the time line of various TrueAllele studies, suggest the real possibility that TrueAllele is racing to provide a result in advance of proper scientific analysis and verification. It is said that its approach here is case specific, not conceptually or scientifically specific. It was submitted that the orderly development of reliable science and its implementation is evident from the significant work done by sanctioning jurisdictions before implementation.
	
	
	The Accused submits that, no matter what the future holds for probabilistic analysis, it is clear that at this point the Accused in this case is the experiment and that it would be utterly unfair, unreliable and dangerous to admit this evidence.
	
	
	Other matters are relied upon in support of discretionary exclusion were identified (without elaboration) (MFI29, paragraph 136):
	


(a)   the quality of the sample involved;

(b)   the complexity of the science involved in the matter;

(c)   the emotional effect that the staggering numbers that TrueAllele generates will have on the jury;

(d)   the subtlety of the distinction between the CCS and the notion of a sample-to-sample comparison;

(e)   the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might cause or result in an undue waste of time;

(f)   the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be misleading or confusing;

(g)   the evidence led by the Crown will have to be addressed by a significant defence case;

(h)   there are contrary approaches to statistical analysis of DNA profiles (the work of Dr Mitchell and Professor Balding) which have not been explained or considered.


	
	The Accused submits that the Crown’s DNA evidence should not be admitted or, alternatively, should be excluded in the exercise of the Court’s discretion.
	


Submissions of the Crown on the Question Whether Stain 91 is Blood (MFI25)


	
	The Crown submits that the evidence is that the appearance of Stain 91 is consistent with an aged blood stain. The forensic scientists used a scale to describe stains and what could be seen of the stain is consistent with the characteristics of an old blood stain.
	
	
	The Crown points to the joint report authored by Ms LeCompte, Ms Campbell, Ms Gerhard and Dr Hallam which states (paragraph 13):
	


“Whilst this stain did not exhibit a classic red-brown colour of a fresh or well-preserved blood stain the appearance of the stain fell within the expected range for an aged blood stain considering the surface upon which it was deposited, and the environmental conditions to which it may have been subjected.""


	
	In response to the defence submissions concerning presumptive screening tests, the Crown submits that it is necessary to keep in mind that the area of the garage was not outdoors and that Stain 91 was in a well-protected area of the floor, under furniture. There was no evidence that the floor was in fact exposed to oxidising agents that would have generated a false positive. The Crown submitted that, in essence, the entire floor was itself a control, indicating that a false positive was highly unlikely.
	
	
	The Crown emphasised that it does not rely on the presumptive test to establish that the stain was blood, but a combination of all the evidence. The strong reaction to Otol does not conclusively prove that the stain was blood, but it is a persuasive matter that a jury can consider.
	
	
	With respect to the defence submissions concerning lack of confirmatory testing, the Crown submitted that there is no requirement for such a test. It is not a precondition for admissibility. As there was a small sample, DNA testing would clearly yield the most information. It was noted that, in answer to a question in cross-examination as to whether, if confronted with a situation where a sample would be consumed by a confirmatory test for blood, a DNA test instead would be chosen, Dr Hallam, the defence expert agreed. The Crown submitted that what had occurred in this case accords with that approach.
	
	
	With respect to the defence submission based upon the lack of a control test concerning Stain 91, the Crown submitted that control tests near the stain were not necessary, as the testing method employed on the floor was essentially a control test in itself, with reference being made to aspects of the evidence of Ms Campbell and Ms Gerhard.
	
	
	The Crown noted that each of Ms Campbell and Ms LeCompte were cross-examined in relation to the measurements of Stain 91 and the level of care that was taken to ensure that only the stain itself, and not areas outside its edges, were swabbed. Ms Campbell confirmed that she would have ensured to swab the discolouration only, therefore avoiding the swab getting into contact with any of the surrounding areas.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that Ms Campbell was a trained and skilled forensic biologist. It was her evidence that she tried not to get into any areas outside of the stain. She was at the scene to test stains and to perform this task.
	
	
	It was submitted that there is no precondition for admissibility that the swab be taken from the stain only. If this were the case, the Crown observed that there would be very little forensic evidence of this nature admitted in criminal trials. Any perceived deficiencies with the sampling process could be explored before the jury, to be taken into account by the jury in assessing the evidence.
	
	
	With respect to the defence submission that Stain 91 gave a negative reaction to Luminol testing, the Crown observed that the Luminol testing was not performed by the examining biologist, but by crime scene officers following the examination and swabbing of the garage floor. The Crown addressed the inconsistency in the positive result of Stain 91 to Otol testing as opposed to the negative reaction to the Luminol testing, referring in this regard to the evidence of Ms Gerhard.
	
	
	With respect to the defence submission concerning possible transfer and the possibility that the moving and clearing out of furniture and boxes during the search of the garage may have caused an item to move onto Stain 91 and thus being responsible for the stain, the Crown pointed to the evidence of Ms Campbell that she did not believe that this was the case “as there was furniture already on top of that stain”. Stain 91 was detected in a protected area. The Crown submitted that Stain 91 was not located in an area that could be regarded as a suitable thoroughfare for a person to travel through the garage to put out a refuse bin.
	
	
	The Crown noted the defence submission that the biological source of the stain cannot be determined. The Crown submitted that the presence of a great deal of DNA information from Stain 91 is indicative that the stain is not from small amounts of trace DNA.
	
	
	It was submitted, in any event, that proving the biological source of Stain 91 is not a precondition for admissibility. It was submitted that the defence contention that what could have been on this stain was skin cells, blood, saliva, semen or a mixture of those materials was simply an alternative hypothesis for a jury to consider. Putting aside what the Crown submitted was the inherent improbability of the deposition by a combination of licking or dribbling, ejaculation, bleeding or rubbing off of skin cells onto the identical tiny protected spot in the garage, the Crown submitted that a jury would be entitled to conclude, from all the evidence, that the stain was blood.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to the joint report of the four blood experts (both Crown and defence) which observed that, in determining whether Stain 91 is of human origin, the DNA profile should be considered as it would assist in determining whether the stain has human origins.
	
	
	It was noted that Ms Gerhard and the defence expert, Dr Hallam, possessed relevant qualifications to comment on the DNA result. They provided an addendum report addressing the DNA profile obtained from Stain 91, which resulted in the consensus position:
	


“Based on the DNA profile generated it is agreed that the stain is of human origin.”


	
	Ms Gerhard stated that this opinion was based on the amplification test and the DNA analysis itself which is human specific.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that Dr Hallam’s evidence that there was a small amount of DNA recovered from Stain 91 should be considered in the light of Dr Hallam’s vastly lesser degree of relevant experience relative to the other DNA experts who have described the DNA quantities as possessing a lot of information.
	
	
	As part of its submission that the question of admissibility of evidence concerning Stain 91 involved consideration of all evidence bearing upon that question, and not a narrow enquiry focusing upon discrete parts of the scientific evidence, the Crown relied upon what is said to be the Accused’s admissions to Witness A as to the need to account for the finding of blood in his garage. It was submitted that the jury would be entitled to find that the Accused had made admissions as to the presence of blood in that location give Witness A’s statements that:
	


(a)   the Accused planned to invent a story of some mechanical work with Min Lin in his garage to explain Min Lin’s blood on the floor of the garage; and

(b)   alternatively, he attempted to explain the blood on the garage floor as having originated from the prior ownership of the home by a vet with it being animal blood.


	
	The Crown submitted that the fact in issue in this trial, the existence of which the evidence in question is said to be rationally capable of affecting, is whether or not the Accused committed the five alleged murders. It was submitted that the CCS makes clear (see [110] above) that the Crown case is that the stain on the garage floor links the Accused to the crime scene, because it is the blood of the deceased from that crime scene.
	
	
	The Accused agrees that this is the relevant fact in issue.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, if the jury was satisfied that the stain was mixed blood from the crime scene, which the Crown contends is the overwhelming inference, this is powerful evidence in the Crown case. It is submitted that the evidence undoubtedly has the capacity to rationally affect, directly or indirectly, the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue.
	
	
	The Crown contends that the overwhelming inference is that the stain is mixed blood from the crime scene. Alternatively, any assessment of competing hypotheses is a question of fact for a jury to resolve.
	
	
	The Crown accepts that its case is that Stain 91, part of which became Item 550, is a blood stain yielding a mixed DNA profile from which the deceased cannot be excluded as contributors. The Crown accepts that the tribunal of fact would need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Stain 91 is blood, indeed blood from the crime scene, to use it to reason towards guilt. However, the Crown submits that such a conclusion is not an indispensable link in a chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt of the type referred to in Shepherd v The Queen. The Crown submits that this not a “link in the chain” circumstantial case.
	
	
	The Crown does not accept that a tribunal of fact would be confined in their consideration of that question to the evidence of the blood experts, being Ms Gerhard, Ms LeCompte, Ms Campbell and Dr Hallam. The fact that the experts put it no higher than “possibly blood” is, the Crown submits, of little moment. The experts have considered but a small part of the Crown case in expressing that expert opinion. The Crown notes that the jury will be asked to consider the Crown case in its entirety.
	
	
	The Crown relies upon the following factors in establishing that the biological source of Stain 91 (Item 550) is human blood:
	


(a)   the results of presumptive testing - specifically the strong positive reaction to an Otol test;

(b)   the appearance of the stain, which is within the range of what might be expected of an aged blood stain;

(c)   the method or mode of deposition of the stain - a transfer mechanism - being consistent with deposition from a “wet” source;

(d)   the presence of human DNA;

(e)   the presence of a mixed profile with three, four or more contributors;

(f)   the presence in that profile of alleles consistent in all respects with the DNA profiles of the deceased;

(g)   the similar DNA profiles resolved from what were blood stains at the crime scene, such as Item 616 - both in terms of the alleles present and the peak heights and ratios of the DNA mixtures;

(h)   evidence indicating the presence of the Accused in the garage in the period shortly after the murders (his statement to police that he cleaned up the dirty garage floor on the morning of Saturday, 18 July 2009 - see [55] above) - evidence of at least one opportunity to have deposited the blood from the crime scene; and

(i)   admissions by the Accused to Witness A.


	
	Whilst noting that the blood experts cannot state definitively that Item 550 is blood, the Crown submits that definitive proof is not the applicable legal standard. The blood experts jointly opine that it is “possibly blood” based on factors which they took into account. Their opinion is based upon the realms of scientific possibility. Their joint opinion forms part of a larger circumstantial Crown case.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the tribunal of fact will also have before it the evidence of mixed samples from the crime scene, including Item 616 which was described by Dr Walsh as displaying a “very high degree of similarity” to Item 550, with Item 616 having been sourced from a swab of an apparent blood stain on a mattress in the bedroom in which Henry Lin and Terry Lin were killed.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the tribunal of fact will be entitled to engage their common sense in determining what possible sources of DNA could have yielded the DNA profile extracted from Item 550, with it being inherently unlikely to come from mixed saliva or mixed epithelial cells. In the circumstances, the Crown submits that it will be open to the tribunal of fact to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Item 550 is blood, and that it is blood that has been deposited from the crime scene.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the defence focus upon the blood experts’ opinion that Stain 91 was “possibly blood” involves misconceived reasoning, which divorces impermissibly that expert evidence from other persuasive evidence in the Crown case which will be before the jury, including the presence of human DNA and the analysis of that DNA.
	
	
	The Crown distinguishes Armstrong v R which relates to the use of the evidence, and not its admissibility.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the two separate bodies of expert evidence concerning Stain 91 and DNA evidence, and any conclusions as to its biological origin as human blood, are inextricably connected. There is little or no significance in a blood stain being found in the garage of the Accused’s home if it cannot be said to be the blood of one or more of the deceased. Similarly, there is little significance in a collation of the DNA of one or more of the deceased being found in the garage of the Accused’s home unless it is in some way connected to the crime scene, most obviously as blood from the crime scene. The Crown submits that the evidence must be considered collectively in resolving each issue.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the combination of all the evidence surrounding Stain 91 (Item 550) is overwhelmingly capable of proving that the stain is blood. It is relevant and admissible evidence having that clear capacity, with issues surrounding its deposition and composition being proper questions for the jury to consider and determine.
	


Crown Submissions Concerning DNA Evidence (MFI32)


	
	The Crown submissions summarised the evidence in a manner which I accept and incorporate later in the judgment. The Crown then responded to the defence submissions concerning the DNA evidence (MFI32, paragraph 77ff).
	
	
	By way of general observation, the Crown noted that challenges to scientific innovations are routine. Reference was made to the statement of Thomas LJ in R v Reed [2009] EWCA Crim 2698; [2010] 1 Cr App R 23 at [111] that there is no closed category where evidence cannot be placed before a jury, and that it would be wrong to deny to the law of evidence the advances to be gained from new techniques and new advances in science with particular reference, in this context, to DNA evidence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there is nothing unfairly prejudicial in the DNA evidence. There is no inflammatory or emotional quality to the evidence. Directions will ensure that no improper use is made of the evidence. If the jury determined that the DNA evidence establishes a link between the Accused and the crime scene, this evidence is highly probative. There is simply no unfair prejudice against this that needs to be weighed in the balance.
	
	
	Alternatively, if there be a risk that the evidence would be accorded more weight than it deserved, any such risk would be ameliorated by directions.
	
	
	In response to the defence argument concerning Dr Walsh’s evidence, the Crown submitted that it does not assert, and does not need to demonstrate, that Item 550 is the same as any of the crime scene samples. It is inevitable that there would be differences between the samples. The relevance, the Crown submits, arises from the connection to the crime scene.
	
	
	In response to the defence submission on the issue of similarity, the Crown submits that evidence of similarity is routinely admitted. The illustration is provided of evidence of identification being admissible in a circumstantial case, even where it is weak evidence: Festa v The Queen [2001] HCA 72; 208 CLR 593 at 611 [56].
	
	
	The Crown referred expressly to the decision of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in R v Dlugosz and Ors [2013] EWCA Crim 2; [2013] 1 Cr App R 32 in support of this submission.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, in the present case, Dr Walsh’s opinions about the similarities between Item 550 and other crime scene samples are analogous to evidence allowed in R v Dlugosz. It was submitted that Dr Walsh’s appropriate caution when expressing those opinions was apparent, and the limitations on the evidence would be crystal clear to the jury. The experts themselves were at pains to point out the limitations. The Crown noted that Mr Goetz and Ms Neville, coming as they do from a rubric of statistical reporting, had referred the Crown to Dr Perlin, having noted the “interesting similarities”. The provision of Dr Perlin’s statistical evidence did not mean that evidence of the noted similarities is inadmissible.
	
	
	The Crown joins issue with a number of particular submissions advanced on behalf of the Accused, contending at different points that the submissions are not supported by the evidence. It was submitted that the defence contention that a degraded sample causes real limitations to a TrueAllele analysis is not supported by the evidence. Further, the Crown submits that degradation is a known phenomenon that is routinely observed, and taken into account, in the process of DNA profile interpretation and analysis.
	
	
	In response to the defence submissions that TrueAllele had not been validated for five-person related mixtures, the Crown referred to the 2013 New York State Police Crime Laboratory System TrueAllele Validation Addendum (four-person mixture and familial study) which extended the TrueAllele validation beyond three-person mixtures (Exhibit PTK2, Perlin, Tab 9). The Crown submitted that this study concluded that the validation findings supported and extended the previous New York State Police data for low template samples and three-person mixtures, and strongly recommended the current methods of autosomal STR interpretation be replaced by TrueAllele for mixtures involving related and unrelated individuals.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that what is clear from the validation is that all of the data is capable of being reliably used. The increased complexity of the samples was accounted for, and a reduction in match statistics is the result of any less clear-cut separation of genotypes because of shared alleles in family members or for mixture weight similarities.
	
	
	The Crown pointed to a 2014 publication in which Cybergenetics, in collaboration with the Kern Regional Crime Laboratory in California, assessed TrueAllele’s capacity to deal with five-person mixtures: “TrueAllele Genotype Identification on DNA Mixtures Containing Up to Five Unknown Contributors” (Exhibit PTK2, Perlin, Tab 10).
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the validation studies contained in the evidence provide clear support for TrueAllele’s robustness and suitability for analysing the complex data in this case. Stringent validation has included shared alleles and multiple contributors up to five. What those studies illustrate is that where the capacity of TrueAllele to extract information is logically and necessarily reduced by levels of complexity, this is reflected in lower and hence more conservative LRs and not in any compromised data. More complex samples produce more conservative results.
	
	
	The Crown points to Ms Neville’s evidence in which she expressed her belief that TrueAllele is capable of carrying out an interpretation of a complex mixture such as has occurred in this case (PT907).
	
	
	The Crown noted that Dr Perlin had been cross-examined upon the basis that TrueAllele could not be adequately tested because it was a “black box”. The Crown observed, however, that no submission had been made on this topic by the Accused.
	
	
	The Crown submitted, in any event, that both Ms Neville (PT894) and Dr Perlin (PT587) had rejected the characterisation of TrueAllele as a “black box”.
	
	
	The Crown referred to the decision in R v Karger [2001] SASC 64; 83 SASR 1, where Mullighan J rejected a challenge to the admissibility of evidence obtained by way of a Profiler Plus system upon the basis, inter alia, that it was a “black box” (at 96-100 [449]-[465]).
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it was not accurate to state that Dr Perlin’s first report had been completed before PowerPlex 21 validation. Further, the Crown pointed to evidence from Ms Neville concerning the BSAG report and the introduction of STRmix at FASS, none of which involved a critical conclusion or rejection or non-validation of TrueAllele.
	
	
	Contrary to the defence assertion, the Crown submitted that Dr Perlin did in fact make an evidence-to-evidence comparison, which he explained in some detail in evidence. He made this comparison by reference to genotypes. The same process of inferring genotypes was applied to each of the samples. The inferred genotypes were then used for the purposes of comparison. The raw data of the samples was necessarily converted into information (the inferred genotypes) that could be used in the formulation of an LR. The mathematical underpinning of the LR calculation was described in evidence.
	
	
	In response to the defence submission that there had been no consideration of whether Ms AB’s genotype was in the mixture, the Crown pointed to Dr Perlin’s supplementary report (Exhibit PTK20) in direct response to the defence request (Exhibit PTK19) dealing with the reference sample of Ms AB. Ultimately, Dr Perlin provided a probability figure and concluded that “in light of all the data, [Ms AB], there’s no statistical support for [Ms AB] having contributed her DNA to item 550 or item 616” (PT1088).
	
	
	In response to the defence submission that there was no evidence of the number of contributors to the garage mixture, the Crown submitted that there was consistency across the evidence of all the experts that there were at least three contributors. The evidence was summarised in the following way (MFI32, paragraph 170):
	



	
		
			
			Expert
			
			
			Item 550
			
		
	
	
		
			
			Clayton Walton
			
			
			At least 3 in the major (2 males, possibly one female)
			
		
		
			
			Robert Goetz
			
			
			At least 4 (at least 2 males)
			
		
		
			
			Sharon Neville
			
			
			Possibly 4
			
		
		
			
			Dr Simon Walsh
			
			
			550A: at least 3 (Terry, Henry, Min Lin)

			550B: at least 4 (Terry, Henry, Min Lin, Yun Bin Lin)
			
		
		
			
			Dr Mark Perlin
			
			
			3, 4 or 5
			
		
	



	
	In response to the defence submission that Dr Perlin had not referred to “shadowing” in earlier reports, the Crown noted that Dr Perlin explained that the presence of a relative at a lower match statistic may result in a “false positive”. To address this issue, Dr Perlin used a “peeling” process to provide further clarity in relation to any statistical support for the presence or absence of the DNA profile of Ms AB in Items 550 and 616. The Crown referred to evidence given by Dr Perlin concerning shadowing.
	
	
	The Crown indicated that it did not seek to rely on evidence of “peeling” in evidence in chief at the trial. The Crown would necessarily rely on this evidence to rebut any defence suggestion that there is scientific support for the presence of Ms AB’s DNA in Items 550 and 616. The Crown submits that, in light of the material in Dr Perlin’s most recent report, to do so would be misleading. In these circumstances, the Crown submitted that it was not necessary for there to be any ruling on the evidence derived from the “peeling” process at this stage.
	
	
	With respect to the defence argument that there is an alternative hypothesis or competing inference available to explain the mixed DNA sample in Stain 91 (see [280] above), the Crown submitted that to assert that the mixed sample from the garage came to be there by way of family members’ overlaying DNA samples, from disparate biological sources at separate times, is manifestly absurd. In any event, the Crown submits that these are questions of fact for the jury to determine with the assistance of directions. The availability of a competing inference does not make the evidence inadmissible.
	
	
	The Crown responded to the defence submission that TrueAllele was not validated and that it constituted a “work in progress”. The Crown submitted that TrueAllele is not an unfinished product. It is a highly validated method that has been in use, in its current 25th version, for over five years.
	
	
	Reference was made to evidence of 20 TrueAllele validation studies having been done, five of them peer reviewed. It was noted that low template, complex three, four and five person mixtures were studied in the Kern Report (Exhibit PTK2, Tab 10).
	
	
	The Crown submitted that TrueAllele is validated, and has been accepted in other jurisdictions on numerous occasions. In addition to Dr Perlin’s evidence given in more than 20 trials, there have been a number of admissibility hearings in different overseas jurisdictions. These include:
	


(a)   Commonwealth v Foley (2012) 38 A.3d 882 - evidence admitted at first instance with the decision being affirmed by the Superior Court of Pennsylvania;

(b)   R v Duffy and Shivers [2012] NICC 1 - Hart J of the Northern Ireland Crown Court allowed Dr Perlin to give evidence with respect to TrueAllele results;

(c)   Commonwealth of Virginia v Brady (unreported, Virginia Circuit Court, 17 December 2013) - the Court overruled an objection to evidence from Dr Perlin of TrueAllele analysis;

(d)   R v Broughton (unreported, Oxford Crown Court, 29 June 2010) - Eccles J excluded TrueAllele evidence, notwithstanding his view that “this evidence is capable of being admitted in evidence in the United Kingdom”, with his Honour indicating that reasons would later be given but with this (for reasons unknown) not having occurred;

(e)   California v Lawton, Langston and Harper (unreported, Superior Court of California (Kern County), 1 October 2013) - the Court admitted evidence concerning TrueAllele analysis.


	
	The Crown noted that, whenever there is a new advance in DNA technology or analysis, there is inevitably a challenge to the admissibility of the evidence garnered as a result. The Profiler Plus kit was challenged extensively at first instance in South Australia before the decision of Mullighan J in R v Karger.
	
	
	In R v McIntryre [2001] NSWSC 311, Bell J considered the admissibility of opinion evidence regarding DNA results using the Profiler Plus system. Her Honour declined to exclude the evidence, referring to R v Karger.
	
	
	The Crown pointed, as well, to R v Fuller [2013] SADC 150, where a challenge to STRmix evidence was rejected and the evidence admitted.
	
	
	The Crown referred to authorities, including R v Karger at [179], which emphasised the roles of the prosecution, defence counsel, expert witnesses and the trial Judge in the process of adducing expert DNA evidence, addressing the jury and giving directions to the jury in a manner intended to reduce or remove any tendency of such evidence to mislead, prejudice or confuse the jury.
	
	
	Reference was made to R v MK [2012] NSWCCA 110; 223 A Crim R 572, where the Court of Criminal Appeal allowed a Crown appeal from the exclusion by a trial Judge of mixed DNA evidence involving a major component and a weak minor component, with the Profiler Plus kit having been used as well as Y-Filer testing. There was uncertainty surrounding the number of contributors. The Crown referred to the decision of the High Court in Aytugrul v The Queen [2012] HCA 15; 247 CLR 170 in support of the admission of the evidence in the present case.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, if there was any prospect of a danger that the jury would attribute weight to the DNA evidence that was unjustified because it was complex evidence, directions would ensure that that was not the case.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the evidence of DNA analysis was relevant and that it was the product of appropriate expertise. It was submitted that it should be admitted, with scope for any appropriate challenge to the evidence being available by way of cross-examination, evidence from defence experts and submissions concerning the evidence.
	
	
	It was submitted that the evidence in this trial was not collected from a sterile environment, but from a garage floor and a biologically complex crime scene. Complexity is inherent in any such collected profile and information is lost if human methods of interpretation are applied.
	
	
	In a complex mixture such as Item 550, it was noted that much data is lost in the calculation of LRs because of the complexity of the mixture and the application of arbitrary thresholds. The DNA evidence extracted from evidence items undoubtedly contains relevant information.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that TrueAllele’s significant advantage over human methods is that it uses all of the data obtained in the analyses performed, and assigns corresponding probabilities to different hypotheses that explain the data. TrueAllele calculates an accurate result based on the entirety of the available data. In addition, there is no prospect of contextual bias as the analysis is an objective one, a situation reflected in the LRs generated.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the DNA evidence is relevant, admissible evidence and ought not be excluded on any discretionary basis.
	


Summary of the Evidence of Mr Walton, Mr Goetz, Dr Walsh and Dr Perlin


	
	The Crown submissions (MFI32) contain a summary of the evidence of Mr Walton, Mr Goetz, Dr Walsh and Dr Perlin which I consider (for the purpose of this ruling) to be accurate, and incorporate in this part of the judgment.
	
	
	Mr Walton gave evidence of the steps he had taken in the laboratory in respect of the testing of Item 550. The first round of testing conducted on Item 550 did not return a result. Item 550 was then subjected to a process of robotic automation called Microcon, which allows the washing of the DNA to try to remove inhibitors. A second amplification process took place which permitted more effective testing and results.
	
	
	Mr Walton outlined the process of Y-filer, Identifiler and PowerPlex 21 testing. His evidence on 28 March 2014 (PT1015) involved an explanation by him of the concepts of threshold, artefacts, stutter and post-stutter. Mr Walton concluded that there were no alleles present in Item 550 that could not be accounted by reference to the combined DNA profiles of the deceased.
	
	
	Mr Walton gave evidence about the number of contributors to Item 550. The statistical opinions expressed by Mr Walton were summarised in a table contained in the Crown written submissions (MFI32, paragraph 13) which constitutes an accurate summary. That table is reproduced below (excluding footnotes):

	Mr Goetz stated that each of the alleles designated in Items 47, 223, 550 and 616 were consistent with alleles in the reference samples of the five deceased. He described the similarities between Items 550 and 616 as (PT 673):
	


“… interesting, because I've looked at thousands of profiles over the years … and to see two that are that similar, it is quite interesting.”


	
	Mr Goetz later described his use of the term “interesting” as meaning that the similarities “have some sort of scientific merit”. However he was unable to attribute statistical significance to the similarities. Mr Goetz later stated:
	


“… I found the similarity between the profile in the house on the mattress in particular and the profile in the garage to be unusual, that is why it was interesting because the amount of alleles that were there were similar, the peak heights were similar, and you don't tend to see that in two in theory unrelated scenes”.


	
	Mr Goetz did not agree that the samples were “low template mixtures”. He considered that the sample “had a reasonable quantity of DNA present” (PT708).
	
	
	Mr Goetz was of the view that there were at least three, and possibly four or five contributors to Item 550 (PT684). He later stated that “there are at least four” (PT690). Concerning the possibility of five persons, Mr Goetz said (PT684):
	


“... the relationship between the mattress and the garage, it is throwing doubt on the whole possibility you are dealing with related people in the garage and therefore you could not be sure that you are dealing with only four people. It could be five”.


	
	Mr Goetz considered that the DNA profile taken from Item 550 showed signs of relatedness amongst contributors (PT 688). He considered that the sample in the garage (Item 550) was a stronger sample than the sample from the bedroom mattress (Item 616) (PT686).
	
	
	It was Mr Goetz’s belief that the validation of TrueAllele by FASS had been completed, but had not been written up. He stated that, in part, FASS had moved in another direction, utilising STRmix, due to considerations such as cost and the length of time TrueAllele took to generate results. A concern about the reliability of TrueAllele was not a factor and he agreed that he considered TrueAllele to be a reliable system (PT707). Mr Goetz was confident in the results generated by TrueAllele (PT708).
	
	
	In re-examination, Mr Goetz was asked concerning the comparative validation of STRmix and TrueAllele (PT707):
	


“Q. In terms of comparison between STRmix and TrueAllele is either system more validated than the other insofar as you are aware?

A. In my opinion probably TrueAllele is. It has been around a lot longer and has been used in overseas cases. It has undergone scrutiny by overseas experts and had a couple of documents written about the validation of it. To me it probably had more inspection of the system than STRmix had. Given another year STRmix would have probably been just the same.”


	
	Dr Simon Walsh is an important witness in the Crown case. The Crown written submission described his background and experience in the following way, which I consider to be accurate (MFI32, paragraph 36) (footnotes excluded):
	


“Dr Walsh holds the position of Chief Scientist at the AFP in Canberra. He has been employed with the AFP since November 2006. In 2009, Dr Walsh completed a PhD in forensic science on the topic of ‘Evaluating the role and impact of forensic DNA profiling on the criminal justice system’. Dr Walsh has been involved in the field of forensic DNA and forensic criminal casework for almost 20 years, and has regularly interpreted complex mixed DNA profiles. Dr Walsh has published widely, and given evidence in Court on numerous occasions. He is the co-author of three books, two of which have been published (with the third awaiting publication): ‘Forensic DNA Evidence interpretation’ and ‘Case Study in Forensic Science’. Dr Walsh maintains membership of a number of relevant professional organisations and holds the position of adjunct Professor at the University of Canberra Dr Walsh is a pre-eminent DNA practitioner in Australia and New Zealand. The Crown relies on Dr Walsh’s experience in interpreting complex DNA samples in the forensic area.”


	
	Dr Walsh’s experience and training are of particular significance given the s.79 objection taken to part of his evidence.
	
	
	Dr Walsh considered the results obtained by FASS from the Profiler Plus, Identifiler, Y-Filer and PowerPlex 21 for Item 550 and compared them to other items from the crime scene that he considered similar, namely Items 47, 224 and 616.
	
	
	Dr Walsh initially interpreted Item 550 relying on two separate profiles obtained by FASS as a result of two amplification processes. Profile 550A was obtained on 10 June 2010 following amplification with the electrophoreses system, whilst Profile 550B arose from a further amplification on 18 June 2010. Dr Walsh expressed the opinion that Profile 550A contained the profile of at least three different individuals that could be explained by Terry, Henry and Min Lin. In relation to Profile 550B, Dr Walsh concluded that this profile arose from at least four individuals, with the additional DNA present in that sample being explained by Yun Bin (Irene) Lin further to Terry, Henry and Min Lin.
	
	
	Dr Walsh gave evidence concerning similarities with other samples from the crime scene. He undertook a comparison between Item 550 and Item 616 following PowerPlex 21 testing. Whilst Dr Walsh stated that his familiarity with the PowerPlex 21 kit, and the associated capillary electrophoreses machine 3500s, is limited due to the recent introduction of the kit, his experience with the performance of the established kits informed his ability to interpret PowerPlex 21 data. Dr Walsh was asked (PT934):
	


“Q. When you did consider item 550 against item 616, what was your opinion about the relative similarity of those two mixed profiles?

A. Well, my opinion is that they are similar. There was a high level of consistency between the two profiles, a high level of overlapping

information”


	
	The following similarities between Item 550 and Item 616 were observed by Dr Walsh and were considered significant:
	


(a)   all 61 alleles designated in Item 616 were present in Item 550;

(b)   there was an observable similarity between those samples in terms of the proportions of the alleles they have in common;

(c)   there was no example of a considerable departure from the general consistency;

(d)   each sample was in itself a complex mixture arising from at least three contributors;

(e)   there was no association or reason for these profiles to be similar.


	
	The cross-examination of Dr Walsh focused on, inter alia, dissimilarities observed between samples. Dr Walsh acknowledged the presence of dissimilarities, but maintained his position. Dr Walsh was of the opinion that “there is a lot more similar information in there than there are dissimilar pieces of information” (PT941).
	
	
	A challenge was made to Dr Walsh in cross-examination concerning his capacity to express an expert opinion in relation to similarity (PT942):
	


“Q. You just - I mean, really this is your evidence: ""I've looked at it,

I'm an expert and I reckon they are relatively similar""; that's it, isn't

it?

A. I would probably summarise it a little differently. I would say that

what I am looking at are two objective pieces of scientific data, each of which are highly complex with a high amount of information. To generate any of those complex pieces of data can only occur under a certain limited amount of circumstances.”


	
	The Crown relies on Dr Walsh’s expertise in the area of forensic DNA interpretation and submits that he is qualified to comment on the observed similarities between Item 550 and Item 616, which he considers significant, without the provision of a statistic. I will return to this topic.
	
	
	In relation to the haplotype present in Item 550 that was consistent with Min, Terry and Henry Lin, Dr Walsh consulted the “Y chromosome haplotype reference database”, the largest of its kind (PT982-983).
	
	
	The evidence reveals Dr Perlin’s substantial background and expertise in the area of DNA mixture interpretation. He is the Chief Scientific Officer and Chief Executive Officer of Cybergenetics, a bio-information company based in Pittsburgh, PA, United States which was formed 20 years ago. Dr Perlin is an expert on DNA mixture interpretation and the likelihood ratio. He holds a PhD in computer science, a PhD in mathematics and a medical degree.
	
	
	TrueAllele is the software system developed and employed by Cybergenetics and Dr Perlin. It is currently in its 25th version, and has remained the same since 2009. The software in its first form was designed 20 years ago.
	
	
	TrueAllele applies a probabilistic method of DNA typing. The system objectively infers genotypes from the entirety of the data. Contrary to the defence submissions, the Crown submits that is this one of the qualities of the TrueAllele system. It means that there is no loss of information due to thresholds, and that the system looks at the data without considering any of the known reference samples. These inferred genotypes then allow comparisons to be made with other evidence items of reference samples, producing a match statistic in the form of a likelihood ratio, that is the probability of a match.
	
	
	Having considered the evidence given by Dr Perlin over several days, there is force in the Crown submission that the probabilistic method utilised with TrueAllele represents a strength, and not a weakness, in assessing issues relevant to the admissibility of the evidence.
	
	
	Dr Perlin gave evidence concerning the relationship between evidence items, inferred genotypes and reference samples.
	
	
	Cybergenetics received electropherograms (“EPGs”) for Items 550, 616, 13, 47, 205, 221, 223, 224 and 229, and the reference samples from the five deceased, the Accused and Ms AB, together with all of the results of the Profiler Plus, Identifiler, Y-Filer and PowerPlex 21 testing runs.
	
	
	TrueAllele requires the human operator to provide a range of contributor numbers to be considered prior to the start of the computer process. For Item 550, three, four or five contributors were assumed. The number of peak heights that are observed are a decisive factor in this consideration. TrueAllele can be set to assume any number of contributors up to 10. Once a sufficient number of contributors are assumed, the behaviour of the system is the same statistically (PT626) and the system does not overstate (PT790).
	
	
	Dr Perlin explained that the way the system expresses the challenge to use all of the information results in a conservative approach, a negative log likelihood ratio (“LR”).
	
	
	The probability statistics (LRs) provided in Dr Perlin’s updated report dated 21 March 2014, taking into account the higher theta value (co-ancestry coefficient), are reflected in the following table (MFI32, paragraph 76):

Decision


	
	I commenced an examination of this topic (at [234]-[239] above) by noting the competing approaches of the Accused and the Crown to the admissibility of evidence concerning Stain 91 and subsequent DNA analysis and LR evidence arising from Item 550.
	
	
	It will be recalled that the Crown invited an approach which considered all matters bearing upon the relevance of this evidence, both scientific and non-scientific. The Accused, on the other hand, focused upon what were said to be particular weaknesses, or areas of vulnerability, with respect to discrete aspects of the scientific evidence.
	
	
	The primary question to be considered is the issue of the relevance under ss.55-56 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	It is necessary to identify the facts in issue in the trial to allow an assessment of the question whether the evidence, if accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment by the tribunal of fact (the jury) of the probability of a fact in issue in the proceeding: Smith v The Queen at 654 [7] (at [150] above). The parties agree that the following formulation identifies the facts in issue for this purpose.
	
	
	The ultimate fact in issue in the trial is whether the Accused committed the five alleged murders. The Crown contends that the stain on the garage floor (Stain 91) links the Accused to the crime scene because it is the blood of the deceased from that crime scene. If the jury was satisfied that the stain was mixed blood from the crime scene, the Crown contends that this is powerful evidence in the Crown case.
	
	
	Questions of relevance require careful analysis, and identification of the process of reasoning that is invited: Evans v The Queen at 529 [23] (at [151] above).
	
	
	Although questions of relevance may raise nice questions of judgment, no discretion falls to be exercised: Smith v The Queen at 653 [6]. The relevance test is to be given a broad ambit and the test is not a narrow or stringent one: Evans v The Queen at 546-547 [95]-[96] (at [152] above).
	
	
	I have set out in some little detail the arguments advanced on the question of admissibility of this evidence. The further the Court has proceeded to assess the competing arguments, the clearer is the response, in my view, to the initial question concerning the relevance of the evidence.
	
	
	It is necessary to keep in mind the areas of scientific and non-scientific evidence which bear upon the relevance issue. The non-scientific evidence should not be overlooked. Firstly, the Accused informed police that he had undertaken some cleaning of the garage floor on the morning of Saturday, 18 July 2009. That aspect presented both opportunity for the deposition of material (which may be said to relate to the crime scene), together with a stated desire to clean the garage floor at a time of some significance to the case. Secondly, there is the evidence of conversations said to have occurred between the Accused and Witness A, including the need to find explanations for blood on the garage floor.
	
	
	These matters are not raised, of course, for the purpose of expressing any view concerning the weight to be given to this evidence. What they demonstrate, however, is that it would be erroneous to consider, in an unduly narrow fashion, the issue of relevance of the evidence concerning Stain 91 and the DNA evidence.
	
	
	The submissions of the Accused are directed almost entirely to the reliability of the evidence and the weight to be attached to it. There is scope for argument concerning the strengths or weaknesses of various pieces of evidence along the way, commencing with the location of Stain 91 on the garage floor and concluding with the opinions expressed by Mr Walton, Dr Walsh and finally, Dr Perlin. These are, in truth, areas which may be challenged or explored in the presence of the jury, with the ultimate weight to be attached to the evidence, and the conclusions to be drawn from it, being matters for the jury.
	
	
	I do not think that Armstrong v R assists the present objection. The present case involves far more than presumptive testing of blood.
	
	
	Submissions which advance suggested alternative explanations or competing inferences with respect to the suggested presence of DNA of the deceased on the garage floor are not issues which bear upon the relevance objection (see [153] above).
	
	
	I accept the common submission of the parties that it would be necessary for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Stain 91 contained blood from the crime scene, for the purpose of evidence arising from this source operating against the Accused at trial. However, this issue is not to be determined solely by reference to the scientific evidence, with other areas of evidence already mentioned to be taken into account, together with such further evidence as may be adduced at the trial which bears upon that question.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that any submission advanced by the Accused warrants the exclusion of evidence concerning Stain 91 and the DNA analysis and LR opinion evidence of Dr Perlin upon the basis that relevance has not been demonstrated for the purpose of ss.55 and 56 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	The question of discretionary rejection of the evidence under ss.135 or 137 Evidence Act 1995 then arises.
	
	
	As R v Burton at 266 [134] makes clear (see [156] above), s.137 requires two separate assessments and a judgment:
	


(a)   an assessment of the probative value of the evidence sought to be adduced by the Crown;

(b)   an assessment of the danger of unfair prejudice to the Accused that may be caused by its admission; and

(c)   a judgment as to whether any such danger outweighs the probative value of the evidence.


	
	This process has regard to the potential probative value of the evidence. The function of the Judge is to assess the extent to which the evidence has the capacity to bear upon the proof of the fact or facts in issue: R v Burton at 273 [160]-[161] (see [158] above).
	
	
	The availability of alternative explanations or competing inferences are not to be taken into account (see extracts from R v Burton at [157]-[159] above).
	
	
	Applying these principles, I assess the probative value of the Stain 91 and DNA evidence as being substantial.
	
	
	An assessment of the danger of unfair prejudice involves the concept of “unfair prejudice” as explained in pertinent authorities (see [160]-[161] above).
	
	
	Arguments which sought to challenge the reliability of the blood and DNA evidence, and the suggestion of alternative explanations or competing inferences, do not demonstrate the danger of unfair prejudice in this case.
	
	
	Beyond those matters, the Accused pointed to a number of matters in support of discretionary exclusion under ss.135 or 137 (see [289]-[292] above).
	
	
	I express my broad agreement with the Crown submissions made with respect to these issues, and make the following additional comments.
	
	
	The fact that aspects of the scientific evidence, including DNA analysis and LR opinion evidence from Dr Perlin, may be complex is not a reason to exclude it. The Courts have recognised that the development of modern science has given rise to areas of evidence of some complexity in jury trials in the criminal courts. As is made clear in R v Karger at 44 [179], Aytugrul v The Queen at 183-187 [20]-[34] and R v MK at 583 [48], the complexity of evidence of this type is not a reason to exclude it.
	
	
	The contemporary jury system operates upon the basis that a jury will be assisted by witnesses, counsel and the trial Judge in understanding expert evidence given, by appropriate examination and cross-examination by counsel, and the making of submissions by reference to the evidence by counsel, with the task of the trial Judge including the giving of directions to assist the jury by reference to the evidence and submissions.
	
	
	It may be taken that there are aspects of this case which will require counsel and myself, as trial Judge, to undertake our respective duties in a careful and diligent manner. For the purpose of ruling upon the present objection, I will approach the issue upon the basis that the jury will receive that assistance in this trial.
	
	
	The various criticisms of the testing process with respect to Stain 91, and the Crown responses to those criticisms, will no doubt be the subject of evidence before the jury, to assist the jury in its fact-finding function in that respect. Those are matters which may be explored before the jury, but do not warrant exclusion under ss.135 or 137: R v Ngo [2001] NSWSC 595; 122 A Crim R 467 at 469 [7].
	
	
	The evidence of Mr Goetz, Ms Neville, Mr Walton, Dr Walsh or Dr Perlin does not, on its face, raise any question concerning the validation of the TrueAllele system. Indeed, the evidence of the Australian witnesses serves to fortify a conclusion that TrueAllele is accepted by objective experts in the field in this country. The evidence contradicts any suggestion that TrueAllele constitutes a “black box”, a concept floated in cross-examination, but not advanced in the submissions of the Accused. Validation is not a legal concept. It is a shorthand term which may be called in aid when evidence of this type may be challenged upon the basis that it involves new, or relatively new, scientific processes.
	
	
	Absolute certainty of result or unanimity of scientific opinion is not required for admissibility: R v Gilmore [1977] 2 NSWLR 935 at 939-941.
	
	
	The evidence adduced at the pretrial hearing provides strong evidence of validation of TrueAllele in the United States of America, and its use by well-known law enforcement agencies in that jurisdiction. The validation evidence is contained in Exhibit PTK2, and extends to a range of validation studies by reputable bodies. The validation studies include a study entitled “TrueAllele Genotype Identification on DNA Mixtures Containing up to Five Unknown Contributors” (February 2014) carried out by Cybergenetics and the Kern Regional Crime Laboratory, Bakersfield, California (Exhibit PTK2, Perlin, Tab 10). This study has direct relevance to the circumstances of the present case.
	
	
	In addition, there is evidence of judicial determinations in the United States of America and the United Kingdom, where objections to evidence from Dr Perlin concerning TrueAllele analysis have been overruled. These aspects of the evidence fortify a conclusion that Dr Perlin’s evidence ought not be excluded upon the basis that it is, in some way, the product of a scientifically unformed or incomplete process not worthy of admission at a criminal trial. The evidence suggests the contrary.
	
	
	I note that although Dr Perlin was cross-examined on these matters, no defence evidence was called or tendered which served to undermine the validation evidence adduced by the Crown.
	
	
	The evidence from Mr Goetz, Ms Neville, Mr Clayton and Dr Walsh has a cumulative effect which supports its admission in the trial. No challenge was made to the credibility of these witnesses in the substantial pretrial hearing at which each was cross-examined in some detail. Each of these witnesses explained the processes undertaken by them in a manner which was, on the face of it, conservative and cautious.
	
	
	The Accused has not called any witness at the pretrial hearing apart from Dr Hallam. The position is to be contrasted with other cases where defence expert witnesses were called to give evidence on voir dires concerning admissibility of DNA evidence: R v Karger; R v McIntyre; R v Gallagher [2001] NSWSC 462 and R v MK.
	
	
	The evidence of Dr Walsh concerning similarities between Items 550 and 616 does not involve a statistical comparison. I am satisfied, however, that it constitutes admissible expert opinion evidence. Dr Walsh is highly qualified in the field. He explained, in some detail, the factors taken into account in his opinion concerning similarity. This conclusion is supported by R v Dlugosz, where the Court allowed non-statistical expert DNA evidence to be given. I am satisfied that the necessary foundation has been demonstrated for the purpose of s.79 Evidence Act 1995 for evidence of this type to be given, in particular by Dr Walsh.
	
	
	Short conclusions may be expressed with respect to the Accused’s submissions concerning ss.135 and 137 (at [289] and [292] above).
	
	
	As to [289](a), there is no evidence that Item 550 was, in fact, low template DNA. The evidence of Mr Goetz and Dr Walsh does not support this proposition.
	
	
	As to [289](b) and (c), the evidence does not support a conclusion that TrueAllele “requires more work” and is “a work in progress”. The evidence reveals that the process is established and validated and has been used by reputable agencies and admitted into evidence in courts in other jurisdictions.
	
	
	As to [292](a), the quality of the sample involved has permitted a range of detailed examinations to be undertaken, as illustrated in the evidence adduced at the pretrial hearing. Any issue concerning sample quality may be taken up, if considered appropriate, before the jury.
	
	
	As to [292](b), the science involved is complex, but the courts have adjusted to this phenomenon, as cases such as R v Karger, Aytugrul v The Queen and R v MK illustrate. The jury is entitled to receive assistance from counsel and the trial Judge, with appropriate directions to be provided by reference to the evidence and submissions.
	
	
	As to [292](c), the use of large numbers as part of the LR evidence resulting from the TrueAllele process will be a topic for explanation and assistance during evidence, submissions and directions to the jury: Aytugrul v R [2010] NSWCCA 157; 205 A Crim R 157 at 186 [162]; Aytugrul v The Queen at 186-187 [32], 203-204 [75].
	
	
	As to [292](d), I do not detect readily a distinction between the CCS and the evidence, but any issue in this respect is capable of clarification in the course of the trial.
	
	
	As to [292](e), I am not persuaded that there is a danger that the evidence might cause or result in undue waste of time so as to warrant exclusion under s.135(c). The evidence is not of peripheral relevance. It has significant probative value.
	
	
	As to [292](f), I am not persuaded that there is a danger that the evidence might be misleading or confusing so as to warrant exclusion under s.135(b). It is to be expected that the evidence will be given in the manner foreshadowed during Dr Perlin’s evidence at the pretrial hearing. The presentation of the evidence, and its use at the trial, will involve the witness, counsel and myself as trial Judge, in assisting the jury with appropriate directions.
	
	
	As to [292](g), the suggestion that there may be a need for a significant defence case is not a basis for excluding the Crown evidence. Nor does it assist with respect to the s.135 objection. The witnesses called by the Crown were cross-examined in detail at the pretrial hearing, so that the Accused ought be aware of the case he has to meet, and to adduce evidence in the defence case if it is considered appropriate to do so.
	
	
	As to [292](h), the fact that there may be contrary or alternative approaches to statistical evidence does not point to exclusion of the Crown evidence. This topic was touched upon in cross-examination of Dr Perlin, with his responses referring to the work of Dr Mitchell and Professor Balding (PT1143-1148, 1157, 1159). No evidence was called by the Accused on these aspects.
	
	
	Having undertaken the assessments under s.137 referred to in R v Burton at 266 [134], I record my judgment that the probative value of the evidence is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the Accused.
	
	
	In summary, the evidence under challenge is relevant and admissible, and I am not satisfied that any discretionary basis has been demonstrated for its exclusion under ss.135 or 137 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	I decline to make Orders 1, 2 or 3 as sought in the Accused’s Notice of Motion.
	


The Motive Issue


	
	I have mentioned already that the parties have agreed concerning the surveillance device evidence to be admitted at trial. An issue which emerged in the course of closing submissions concerned the Crown’s intention to rely upon a new area concerning motive.
	
	
	The Crown articulated this topic in a written submission (part MFI30) and in oral submissions on 14 April 2014 (PT1225-1229).
	
	
	Thereafter, submissions were received for the Accused (dated 16 April 2014) and the Crown (dated 16 April 2014) on the motive issue.
	
	
	There is, of course, no obligation upon the Crown to prove motive in the trial. It is not an element of the crime. However, a jury will ordinarily be directed that motive can be an issue in the trial and that the presence or absence of motive, or the nature of any motive suggested, may bear upon a determination as to whether the jury is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the Accused who killed the five deceased persons: De Gruchy v The Queen [2002] HCA 33; 211 CLR 85 at 92-93 [28]-[32]; R v Vjestica [2008] VSCA 47; 182 A Crim R 350 at 382-383 [112]-[115].
	
	
	The CCS referred to a possible motive relating to the comparative perception of Min Lin being a success and the Accused a failure (see [134](i) above).
	
	
	The Crown foreshadowed, by reference to transcripts of surveillance device material, an intention to rely upon a further suggested motive namely that the Accused had been in a relationship with Lily Lin, and that this may have constituted a motive to murder her and other members of her family. Objection was taken on behalf of the Accused to this matter being raised very late in circumstances where it was said that it was, at best, highly speculative.
	
	
	The written submissions of the Crown indicate that it is not intended to open on this issue to the jury. The Crown wished to identify this as a motive which may be relied upon, depending upon the state of the evidence, so that the Accused was on notice of this prospect.
	
	
	It may be said that this issue is being raised at a relatively late point in time given the history of this matter, and the apparent availability to the Crown of the material which is said to give rise to this possible motive.
	
	
	The issue has been the subject of relatively brief written submissions. It remains an open question as to whether the Crown will seek to rely upon it at trial. The Accused is on notice that this may occur. The Crown will not advert to this issue in opening. It is not necessary to express a view on this issue at this time. However, the topic should not be raised in the trial without prior notification to the Accused and the Court, so that further submissions may be made on the issue.
	


Crown Application for Leave to Rely Upon Dr Perlin’s Material Served on 3 March 2014


	
	In 2013, directions were given by Latham J, and later by me, with respect to the service by the Crown of evidence upon which it would seek to rely, including DNA evidence. Applications by the Crown to extend the timetable in this respect were met with resistance and criticism on behalf of the Accused.
	
	
	The Crown requires an extension of time to rely upon Dr Perlin’s material served on 3 March 2014. The Accused opposes that grant of leave, pointing to the history of extensions of time during 2013 and the consequences of those extensions for the Accused. It is submitted that the Court should not accede to the Crown application for a further extension of time.
	
	
	It is the case that a number of delays occurred during 2013, for reasons as to which there is some debate. Given the point that has been reached in the proceedings, I do not consider that much is to be gained by any detailed historical narrative with respect to events and orders in 2013.
	
	
	Dr Perlin had been identified as a Crown witness in late 2013 and his first report served. The pretrial hearing commenced before me on 18 November 2013. Orders were made by me intended to progress the foreshadowed DNA pretrial hearing, then expected to occur in February 2014. Orders were made for the service of DNA evidence by the Crown and the Accused.
	
	
	As it happened, issues surrounding the Accused’s legal representation saw a number of orders not being complied with.
	
	
	During the course of the pretrial hearing in 2014, it was clear that senior counsel for the Accused was obtaining expert advice concerning the DNA evidence being given by the Crown witnesses, including Dr Perlin.
	
	
	Dr Perlin’s additional material was served on 3 March 2014, some two weeks prior to the resumed pretrial hearing.
	
	
	What transpired has involved not only the provision by the Crown of Dr Perlin’s reports to the defence, but an extended cross-examination of Dr Perlin as part of the pretrial hearing. This occurred over a number of days, when Dr Perlin was present in Sydney, with the cross-examination continuing by audio-visual link from Pittsburgh.
	
	
	As mentioned earlier, the cross-examination of Dr Perlin was adjourned at one point when a further report was provided by him on 26 March 2014 in response to a defence request that he undertake certain work with respect to Ms AB. As Mr Turnbull SC made clear, expert advice was being obtained with respect to Dr Perlin’s reports, including the report provided as a result of a defence request.
	
	
	Having had an opportunity to take advice in this respect, senior counsel for the Accused then continued and concluded a detailed cross-examination of Dr Perlin, on all matters upon which he sought to cross-examine the witness.
	
	
	The Crown’s leave application must now be considered in the practical context whereby there has to be an opportunity for the Accused to test at length the evidence of Dr Perlin, together with the evidence of Mr Goetz, Ms Neville, Mr Walton and Dr Walsh.
	
	
	It is submitted for the Accused that there is prejudice to him if the Crown is permitted to rely upon Dr Perlin’s further material for which leave is required. However, there is no articulated area of prejudice, let alone any evidence identifying what would need to be done by any defence expert, and pointing to difficulties with it being done in the context of this trial.
	
	
	The trial is scheduled to commence on 8 May 2014. It has a four-month estimate. It may be expected that any DNA evidence to be adduced by the Crown will be called at least some weeks into the trial. The evidence of Dr Perlin was compl",2014-04-29 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705168,Boral Bricks Pty Ltd v Cosmidis (No 2) [2014] NSWCA 139,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]


On 18 April 2008, Mr Orestis Cosmidis (the respondent) was delivering a tanker load of fuel to premises occupied by Boral Bricks Pty Ltd (the appellant). When walking back to his truck, he was hit from behind by a forklift, suffering major injuries. The respondent was aware that forklifts operated in the area.

The appellant was found liable in negligence but the respondent was found not to be contributorily negligent for failing to keep a proper lookout. The appellant accepted liability but challenged on appeal the finding that there was no contributory negligence (and certain heads of damage).

On 18 December 2013, the Court of Appeal set aside the finding that there was no contributory negligence and directed that the parties have an opportunity to make submissions on the issue of contributory negligence for further hearing by the Court: Boral Bricks Pty Ltd v Cosmidis [2013] NSWCA 443. 

The Court (by majority) held: contributory negligence assessed at 30%; (McColl JA would have assessed contributory negligence at 10%).

(per Basten JA, Emmett JA agreeing)

1. Section 5R of the Civil Liability Act reflects the policy that people are to take responsibility for their own lives and safety. That the likely seriousness of harm caused by the driver's conduct is greater than the pedestrian's does not diminish the responsibility of either for the accident. If each were equally careless, liability should be shared equally. The approach taken in earlier authorities that the culpability of a person controlling a potentially dangerous heavy vehicle is necessarily greater no longer applies: [99]-[100]

Talbot-Butt v Holloway (1990) 12 MVR 70 distinguished.

2. The appellant's share of responsibility for the accident derives from its duty as an occupier to ensure the safety of the premises and the failure of the driver of the forklift to keep a proper lookout; the respondent's share from a failure to look in all directions when walking into an area where he knew forklifts operated: [114]-[115]

(per McColl JA dissenting)

3. Section 5R of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) says nothing about how the relative culpabilities of the plaintiff and defendant are to be determined. The applicable test for apportionment is the ""just and equitable"" test as found in s 138(3) of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW). Just and equitable apportionment requires a comparison of the culpability of the parties and the importance of their acts in causing the damage: [48]-[52]

			Judgment

1McCOLL JA: In Boral Bricks Pty Ltd v Cosmidis; Boral Bricks Pty Ltd v DM & BP Wiskich Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 443 (""Boral Bricks 1"") the Court (Basten JA (McColl and Emmett JA agreeing)) held that the primary judge's assessment of the contributory negligence issue miscarried and, accordingly, his Honour's finding that there was no contributory negligence must be set aside. The Court also gave the parties the opportunity either to submit that the issue of contributory negligence should be remitted to the District Court or to supplement its or his written submissions concerning contributory negligence with a view to that issue being determined by this Court. The parties have pursued the latter course. Their primary submissions on the issue were, as directed, furnished by the same date. Accordingly each exercised its and his right of reply to the other's primary submissions.

2These reasons should be read as incorporating the findings made in Boral Bricks 1 which will be repeated to the extent necessary, as will uncontroversial findings from the primary judgment: Cosmidis v Boral Bricks Pty Ltd [2012] NSWDC 144.

3The respondent, Orestis Cosmidis, was injured on 18 April 2008 when he was struck from behind by a forklift truck driven by Daniel Mohr. Boral Bricks Pty Ltd, the appellant, employed Mr Mohr. The accident occurred on its premises. The respondent had just delivered a load of fuel to the premises and was walking back to his truck from an office when the accident occurred.

4The appellant's premises comprised ""a very large site"" which did not include any dedicated pathways, roads or tracks for the exclusive use of forklifts: primary judgment (at [28]). The primary judge relevantly found (at [36] - [47]):

""36. During the time the plaintiff was on the site on the afternoon of the accident he had seen the forklift in question travelling around the site on a total of three occasions, whilst laden with bricks in its carrying compartment and also whilst unladen. He had the impression that on at least one of those occasions the forklift was being driven erratically at speed, and had turned a corner with a tilt because of the speed at which it had been driven.

37. The plaintiff knew that the forklift was being used to transport bricks for stacking on the site. When the forklift was laden with bricks, the bottom bar of its carrying tray or cage was about 150mm from the ground. When it was unladen, the bottom bar of the carrying arms or grabs were located in a much higher position up the mast, and over a metre above the ground.

38. After completing the transfer of fuel and dealing with the resultant paperwork at the site office, the plaintiff left the office, after being there for about 30 seconds. He then left the office via the door through which he had earlier entered ... He was guided in his path of exit by a series of 3 red safety cones and safety tape which indicated by their placement, that he should not enter upon the road directly.

39. At that time, the pumping equipment on the plaintiff's truck was making a noise as it was in high idle mode. He was wearing safety boots, long cotton pants, a long sleeved fluorescent yellow coloured safety shirt (Exhibit 'D'), safety glasses, earplugs and a cap. The plaintiff wore ear plugs not only because of the loud noise associated with the pumping equipment on his truck, but also because of noise near the workshop and office where machinery or conveyors were being operated.

...

41. The plaintiff ... said he had taken some three or four casual steps forward, after passing the third safety cone, and as he did so, he was hit from behind by the forklift truck which was travelling in the same direction of travel as he had been walking.

...

45. Exhibit ""2"" shows a view of the exit path from the office where the plaintiff walked out and turned to his left. Above the door is an elevated sign stating 'Forklifts in use' ...

46. ... The roadway in question was some 8 or 10 metres in width. The roadway covered a distance of about 4 to 6 metres in the plaintiff's general direction of travel. There was no marked walking path reserved for pedestrians beyond the position of the last of those safety cones.

47. The forklift approached the plaintiff from behind and the plaintiff had no notice of its approach ... "" 

5The respondent conceded he probably saw the ""Forklifts in use"" sign as he left the office: primary judgment (at [135]). 

6The appellant's system of work required entrants to its premises to sign a Visitor's Pass, on which the statement ""10. Forklifts have right of way"" appeared. The respondent gave evidence that he never read what was written on the Visitor's Pass and assumed it was a form of identification. The appellant relied upon the warning in the Visitor's Pass in its defence: primary judgment (at [25] - [27]).

7Although the driver of the forklift, Mr Mohr, did not give evidence, it is apparent from his statement to the Police (Exhibit ""E"") that immediately before the accident, he had driven past the door from which the respondent had emerged and travelled approximately 10 to 15 metres further when he heard a scream, stopped the forklift and saw the yellow sleeve of the respondent's shirt ""on the bottom of the grabs"": primary judgment (at [50]). The primary judge inferred (and the appellant did not dispute on appeal) that Mr Mohr had not seen the respondent before the impact or before hearing his screams: primary judgment (at [51]).

8The appellant relied upon a defence of obvious risk pursuant to s 5F, Div 4, Part 1A of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) (the ""CLA""). The primary judge found (at [4]) that the accident occurred in circumstances which fell within the definition of ""motor accident"" for the purposes of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW) and concluded by reference to s 3B(1)(e) of the CLA, that the latter did not apply. That was not correct: see s 3B(2)(a), CLA. Nevertheless against the possibility that he was wrong in this conclusion, the primary judge dealt with the obvious risk defence and made the following relevant findings.

9First, his Honour was not persuaded that prior to the accident the respondent was relevantly aware of the risk of being struck from behind by the forklift: primary judgment (at [123]). His Honour found (at [125]) that the risk was not obvious to the respondent ""because he had no notice of the approach of the forklift truck"". Secondly, he rejected the appellant's submission that the respondent was on notice of the risk of forklift travel on the site by virtue of the Visitor's Pass (on the assumption the respondent signed one to gain entry to the site, on the day of the accident) because he concluded that the contents of that document were not drawn to the respondent's attention: primary judgment (at [127] - [132]).

Boral Bricks 1

10The following passages from Boral Bricks 1 are relevant to consideration of the contributory negligence issue. In order to understand the description of the incident set out in the primary judgment (at [35] - [48]) Basten JA analysed photographs taken on the afternoon of the accident and reached the following conclusions:

""18. ... [I]t is probable on the basis of the evidence given of the plaintiff who had watched the forklift operating while he was delivering fuel, that the forklift in fact came down the right hand open area shown in photograph 2, between the stack of bricks immediately opposite the door and the edge of the covered area. The forklift then turned to its right, across the front of the doorway, travelled the length of the building parallel to the plaintiff's walkway and commenced to turn left at the end of the building, as indicated by the angle at which it came to rest.

19. Photograph 13 provides a view of the forklift from the front. The yellow metal vertical tines, with a bar across the bottom, were used to hold several pallets of bricks. At the time of the accident, the forklift was returning, unladen, to collect further pallets. The plaintiff was struck in the back by the yellow bars, presumably towards the left hand side, as indicated by the X on the lower 'grab bar' marked on photograph 10.""

11In considering, albeit concluding it was unnecessary finally to decide, the issue whether the driver saw the respondent before he hit him, Basten JA said:

""24. Mr Mohr stated that he had been travelling at approximately 10km/h ... [He] said that he had gone approximately 10-15 metres past the door to the workshop when he heard the scream.

25. At that speed, the forklift would have covered approximately three metres per second. It would therefore have taken 3 - 4 seconds to cover the distance from the doorway out of which the plaintiff came until the point of impact. It is likely that the plaintiff would have been in view before the forklift passed the doorway. However, as demonstrated by photograph 6, taken from inside the forklift looking in the direction of travel, the driver's vision was somewhat restricted. In any event, there is no issue as to the negligence of the driver for the purposes of the appeal and the question of when he first saw the plaintiff (if he did) need not be pursued further."" (Emphasis added)

12The appellant's case at trial on contributory negligence was run on the basis that the respondent failed to keep a proper lookout based on what he saw or should have seen. Basten JA addressed (at [26] ff) the issue as to the respondent's position at various points and why, as he asserted, he did not see the forklift before it hit him. That issue arose in the context of the primary judge's unchallenged acceptance (primary judgment (at [43])) of the respondent's evidence that he did not hear the forklift because he was wearing earplugs (at his employer's direction), and, too, that the noise of the pumping equipment on his truck in ""high idle mode"" would have made it unlikely in any event that he would have heard the engine of the forklift. Basten JA said:

""27. At the point at which he came out of the office doorway, he said that he looked both to right and left, but did not see the forklift which he had earlier noticed operating in the area. With the assistance of the photographs, the plaintiff gave extensive evidence as to the three occasions on which, whilst unloading his fuel, he saw the forklift operating: Tcpt, 23/04/12, pp 30-38. On the first (and third) occasions, the forklift, carrying a load of bricks, came from the area into which it appears to have been travelling at the time that it hit him. Thus, viewed from his position at the fuel depot, whilst facing the doorway of the office, the forklift when laden came from his right; the driver then turned the forklift to its right so as to travel towards the doorway. When it passed the doorway, it made a left hand turn between two stacks of bricks, which the plaintiff indicated by marking an X on photograph 9: Tcpt, p 33. Because the forklift undoubtedly came past the office doorway and hit the plaintiff from behind, there were, as it appeared from the photographs, only two courses the driver could have taken. One was to come out from the pavement to the right of the large stack of pallets visible when looking out from the doorway (see photograph 2), or from the covered area further to the right looking out from the doorway (as shown in photograph 9). As will be seen shortly, Mr Johnston estimated a time lapse of 10 seconds from when the plaintiff came out of the doorway until the point of impact. However, even without that evidence, a similar calculation could readily be made, using the speed at which Mr Mohr estimated he was travelling. It is difficult to see how the forklift could not have been within the visual field of the plaintiff, had he indeed looked to the right (as he said he did) when he came out of the door. He did not need to be warned to lookout for forklifts: he knew there was a large forklift operating in the area and had observed its operations during the half hour he had been unloading fuel.

28. These considerations were directly relevant to any assessment of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff. They were not addressed by the trial judge.

29. There was a further implausibility about the findings made. As appears from the photographs, the line of three safety cones ended well before the corner of the building along the side of which the plaintiff was walking. The plaintiff said that he was hit after taking some three or four steps past the third cone and without stepping to the right of the line of the cones.

30. That description is implausible for a number of reasons. First, it would place the left hand extremity of the cage in front of the forklift within a metre of the oxyacetylene cylinders beside which the plaintiff was walking. It would also mean that the forklift would have come close to knocking over the safety cones. Each of those propositions is highly implausible. Further, it is clear from the position of the forklift (as shown, for example, in photograph 1), first, that the point of impact must have been well beyond the area of the safety cones and, secondly, that the course taken by the forklift, before it started to turn to its left, must have placed it (as might be expected) in the middle of the paved area along which it was travelling. Again, these difficulties were not addressed by the trial judge.

31. It is clear that, in order to return to his truck, the plaintiff was required to walk down the line of the building (no doubt inside the safety tape for as far as it extended) and then cross over the paved area in the direction of the fuel depot. It seems likely that he had already commenced to make that crossing when he was struck, given the angle of the forklift, which had already started to turn to the left to round the corner of the building. Accordingly, at that point the plaintiff must have been in an open area in which he knew a large forklift was operating. Assuming (in his favour) that he could not expect to hear the forklift approaching, taking reasonable care for his safety would have required that he look both behind him and to his left before crossing the open area. Had he done so, he would inevitably have seen the forklift approaching and could have stepped out of the way. Again, this consideration was not addressed by the trial judge."" (Emphasis added)

13The appellant sought to tender at trial a report prepared by a consulting engineer, Mr Johnston, which it asserted demonstrated its system of work was sufficient to discharge its duty of care, demonstrated the accident could not have occurred as the respondent contended and established the latter's contributory negligence. The primary judge rejected the tender, a ruling which this Court found to be erroneous: Boral Bricks 1 (at [33] - 47]). 

14Basten JA analysed Mr Johnston's report as follows:

""35. Section 4 described the forklift, the author noting that neither the actual forklift nor one of the same model was operating at the site at the time of his inspection. He stated at paragraph 4.4 that he had conducted a 'speed assessment' on an available forklift. Section 5 was described as 'incident analysis'. It provided calculations of the time it would have taken the plaintiff to walk from the doorway to the point of impact and the distance the forklift would have covered in the same time. As will be seen from figure 5.1 (set out in the appendix) Mr Johnston estimated that the plaintiff would have taken 10 seconds to walk from the doorway to the point of impact at the corner of the building. He assumed in that figure that the forklift which hit the plaintiff was coming out from under the covered area, indicating by his diagram that it would have been at the edge of the covered area at the time the plaintiff came out of the doorway. As has been noted above, the description given by the plaintiff indicated that on its prior trips, the forklift had not entered the covered area, but had turned into or out of the open area between the covered walkway and the line of pallets immediate across from the doorway. Figure 5.1 does not describe such a route, but it may readily be inferred that, in order to reach the point of impact at the time that the plaintiff reached that point, the forklift would probably already have been moving in the general direction of the doorway down the open area. In combination with photograph 2 taken on the day of the accident, it is highly implausible that, had he looked in the direction from which he might have expected the forklift to be coming, he would not have seen it (as Mr Johnston said in a passage set out below).

36. Mr Johnston also considered whether there may have been difficulties for the driver to see a pedestrian. At paragraphs 5.18-5.20, he considered the visibility of a pedestrian, both in high contrast yellow or wearing more subdued colouring. (The trial judge accepted that the plaintiff was wearing a high visibility safety vest.)

37. Section 7 provided the response to specific questions. These were largely statements of inferences which could be readily be drawn from the descriptive material in the incident analysis. However, relevantly for present purposes, it is convenient to set out question 6 and the answer:

'6. If you apply the Worker's version of events and the Forklift came from between brick stacks directly in front of the workshop door, where would that place the forklift at the time the Worker came out of the workshop, having regard to where the Worker was eventually struck?

Immediately in front of the pedestrian probably no more than about 15 metres away.'"" (Emphasis added)

15For the purposes of considering the contributory negligence issue, it is relevant to set out Mr Johnston's [5.18] and [5.20] as follows: 

""5.18. In my opinion the driver should have been able to spot a pedestrian wearing high visibility clothing at some stage during the ten second interval noting that the hardware on the front of the forklift and the a-pillar will have blocked the view of at least some or all of the pedestrian for most but not all of the 10 second interval. The pedestrian will pass across different sight obstructions as the forklift approaches the pedestrian from behind and to the left side of the forklift. The operator was generally looking towards a busy background with the side of the building and what appears to be a series of brick bunkers containing neutral coloured gas cylinders as shown in Figure 5.4. In my opinion a high contrast yellow or orange shirt should stand out sufficiently against the background such that even if only a small part of the shirt is seen it should be identifiable as a probable person.

...

5.20. Therefore although the forklift had right of way based on the operating conditions at the site the operator was still responsible for keeping a lookout and avoiding objects and persons with whom he might collide. In my opinion he probably had an obligation to identify the pedestrian if he was walking along the roadway for about 10 seconds prior to impact and should have done so even given the restricted vision from the cabin of the forklift if the pedestrian was wearing appropriate high visibility clothing, noting that the whole shape of the pedestrian would probably never be available simply a portion of the pedestrian would be seen between objects on the forklift. In those circumstances he should have been able to avoid impacting with the pedestrian. (Emphasis added) 

16In Section 7 of his report Mr Johnston's opinion as to the likely scenario to explain the collision was, relevantly:

""The worker has exited from the doorway and turned and walked towards the fuel depot where his truck was parked. He has failed to check for approaching forklifts as he exited the doorway and anytime leading up to the collision. The forklift has approached him from behind and the left end of the grab bar has struck the pedestrian in the back knocking him to the ground. The operator of the forklift has never identified the presence of the pedestrian due to the sight obstruction caused by the forklift hardware in front of the operator significantly restricting forward visibility ... "" 

Contributory negligence submissions

17In further submissions on the contributory negligence issue filed pursuant to the leave granted in Boral Bricks 1, both parties relied on their original submissions on appeal on this issue as well as adopting passages of Basten JA's reasons for reaching this conclusion. It is unnecessary to identify the passages each adopted as the emphasis they placed on them will be apparent when their submissions are recounted. 

18The following encapsulates both the parties' written submissions prior to Boral Bricks 1 and those made pursuant to the leave granted in that judgment.
Appellant's submissions 

19The appellant submitted that the issue of contributory negligence was to be determined in accordance with s 5R of the CLA as explained in Council of the City of Greater Taree v Wells [2010] NSWCA 147 (at [81] - [83]). The respondent did not demur. 

20The appellant's essential submission was that the respondent's conduct indicated a significant departure by him from the standard of care to be expected of a reasonable person in the circumstances, and, in particular, a far greater degree of culpability when compared with Mr Mohr's breach. It submitted that the only negligence that could be attributed to it for the purposes of contributory negligence was its vicarious liability for Mr Mohr's failure to see the respondent in time to avoid him even though he was driving at a reasonable speed.

21The appellant relied upon the following matters to make good these propositions.

22In its written submissions in the principal appeal prior to delivery of Boral Bricks 1, the appellant pointed to what it contended was evidence consistent with contributory negligence on the respondent's part in failing to keep a proper lookout both at the point when he emerged from the office and when he walked past the third cone, wearing earplugs and failing to observe the two warnings about the use of forklifts on the site. This evidence included the facts that the respondent had commenced delivery of fuel to the site two years earlier and he thereafter attended the site approximately every month or two, that he acknowledged that he may have read some of the matters contained in the Visitor's Pass, that he was aware that there were forklifts operating on the site and that he had to keep a lookout for them, that he had seen the sign warning of the presence of forklifts and had walked out the door where the sign was situated on many occasions before, that he recognised that the witches' hats and tape created a path for him to follow, that while he was filling the fuel tank from his truck he saw a forklift operating in the general area where the accident occurred on at least three occasions, that he was aware from the observations that he had made of a forklift going fast or driving erratically that he could see the forklift, but could not actually hear it and, finally, that it was apparent from the contemporaneous photographs that there was good vision for the respondent such that he would have seen the forklift if he had looked for it. The appellant further contended, on the basis of the respondent's evidence that when he got to the third cone he made no attempt to look for a forklift, that he had failed to keep a proper lookout at that point too. 

23The appellant contended by reference to the photographs taken on the day of the accident and the measurements in Mr Johnston's report, that the forklift was clearly visible and was no more than 15 metres away from the respondent as he left the office, such that he could not have failed to see it as it came between the stacks of bricks directly in front of the office door. It argued that in order for the respondent to have been struck where he was, he must have walked out in front of the forklift, which he should earlier have observed approaching him between the stack of bricks, following the path he had seen it follow earlier that day, albeit in the opposite direction. This was in circumstances where, by choosing to wear earplugs, the respondent was left to rely solely upon his visual observations to ensure his safety. The circumstances were also such that he was, or a reasonable person in his position should have been, aware that the site was purpose built for the storage and movement of pallets by large forklifts, whose drivers might have obstructed views. 

24Further, the appellant submitted (relying in part upon Basten JA's observations in Boral Bricks 1 (at [18])), that the respondent should have recollected his previous observations concerning the movement of the forklift which ultimately struck him and its likely path, being information he should have used to determine what precautions he should have taken as he left the path parallel with the witches hats before venturing out onto the open roadway. 

25Thus, the appellant contended, it was not open to the respondent to treat the site as if it was a normal pedestrian thoroughfare such as he might have encountered on a footpath adjacent to a public road. It criticised the respondent's evidence at trial to the effect that when he walked down a street he did not ""turn around to see if there is a car coming behind me"" as manifesting a significant degree of departure from the standard of care to be expected of a reasonable person in his position. It emphasised that the circumstances of the work site were such as to call for a greater degree of care than might be expected of a pedestrian on a public street. It contended the respondent's conduct was to be likened to a pedestrian wearing headphones who decided to cross a road in the path of oncoming traffic without looking to either side.

Respondent's submissions

26The respondent submitted that the proper consideration of the contributory negligence issue, and the relative apportionment of responsibility as between the appellant and himself, involved more than a comparative analysis of the reasonableness of his behaviour and that of the driver of the forklift, and also required the Court to take into account the appellant's breach of its duty as occupier to take care for the safety of a lawful entrant upon its premises. His essential submission was that the appellant's negligence was properly characterised as of a major systemic nature which, taken into account with Mr Mohr's negligence greatly outweighed his momentary or casual failure to take care for his own safety. 

27The respondent accepted, as found in Boral Bricks 1, that if he had looked he would have seen the approaching forklift in sufficient time to move out of its path. However he argued that his failure to look back and see the forklift should be considered to have been a momentary and casual want of care. He also contended that his obligation to look back in order to keep an eye on what might be approaching from behind him was not his only obligation in terms of keeping a proper lookout as he was also aware of forklift trucks having emerged previously from around the corner of the building ahead of him such that he had to keep that corner under observation as well. He submitted that there was no basis for a finding that he in fact looked and saw the forklift, but decided to continue walking regardless.

28Next the respondent adopted Basten JA's inference that Mr Mohr had not seen the respondent before the accident (Boral Bricks 1 (at [23])), an inference he contended was supported by Mr Mohr's statement to the police which made no reference to him having been aware of the respondent until he heard him scream. He also adopted Basten JA's findings that, on the basis of the speed at which Mr Mohr told the police he was travelling (10 kilometres per hour) and the distance he had travelled past the doorway from which the respondent had exited prior to hearing the respondent scream (10 - 15 metres), it would have taken Mr Mohr 3 - 4 seconds to cover the distance from the doorway out of which the plaintiff came until the point of impact: Boral Bricks 1 (at [24] - [25]).

29The respondent accepted Basten JA's findings that it was ""difficult to see how the forklift could not have been within the visual field of the plaintiff, had he indeed looked to the right (as he said he did) when he came out of the door (Boral Bricks 1 (at [27])), that it seemed ""likely that he had already commenced to make that crossing when he was struck, given the angle of the forklift, which had already started to turn to the left to round the corner of the building"" (Boral Bricks 1 (at [31])), that it might readily be inferred that in order to reach the point of impact at the time that the respondent reached that point, the forklift would probably already have been moving in the general direction of the doorway down the open area (Boral Bricks 1 (at [35])) and, finally, that ""taking reasonable care for his safety would have required that he look both behind him and to his left before crossing the open area [and that] had he done so, he would inevitably have seen the forklift approaching and could have stepped out of the way: Boral Bricks 1 (at [31]).

30However the respondent submitted that the use of forklifts in areas where pedestrians were obliged to walk created a risk of serious injury given that they were relatively large for the areas in which they were permitted to operate and the visibility of the driver was obscured by the presence of the masts and carrying mechanisms located at the front of the vehicle which were deployed at variable heights. Accordingly, the respondent contended that the appellant ought to have foreseen that a forklift driver might not observe the presence of a pedestrian and might run such a person down causing severe, if not fatal, injuries. He relied upon the evidence of Mr Roditis, an employee of the appellant, who had previously driven the forklift that struck him, who confirmed it had ""blind spots"" for a driver.

31Accordingly, the respondent argued that the actions of the appellant in placing cones and tape extending only a limited distance from the workshop office door did not address the risk of contact between a pedestrian exiting the workshop office door to return to the fuel tank area because, at some point, such a person would be required to travel beyond the length of the tape and walk in a different direction. In this respect, the respondent referred to, and relied upon, documents the appellant produced on subpoena at trial concerning safe working procedures for forklifts at its premises, two of which recommended that pedestrians be excluded from areas where forklifts operated. I refer to those documents in greater detail later in these reasons.

32The respondent also relied upon the fact that after the accident, the appellant installed a convex mirror on the roof of the fuel tank cover which enabled pedestrians to see vehicles approaching from behind and around the corner in front of them as demonstrating a precaution that could and should have been taken to avoid the accident. He pointed out that this precaution had been recommended in a C & C Safety Procedure Forklifts document dated 27 February 2007 and, accordingly, submitted that the omission to take this step prior to his accident should be taken into account in assessing the appellant's relative culpability.

33Accordingly the respondent submitted that the Court should find his responsibility for the harm that befell him should be assessed at between five percent and ten percent.

Reply submissions

34The appellant submitted in reply that it was open to the Court to find that the respondent saw the forklift, and contended that that was the only finding open on the evidence. It resisted the respondent's submissions that his culpability could be described as ""momentary inattention"", contending that it fell into the most significant breach of duty and causal potency. It emphasised that the site was well laid out with clear lines of visibility of approaching forklifts and that the conditions were not cramped, that there were rules made in an effort to give forklifts right-of-way having regard to ""their inevitable restrictions on visibility"", that the witches hats and safety tape provided sufficient guidance away from the office door to avoid people walking into the path of forklifts and, finally, that it was entitled to expect that people entering the site would exercise appropriate care for their own safety when moving about it, referring to Thompson v Woolworths [2005] HCA 19; (2005) 221 CLR 234 (at [35]).

35The respondent submitted in reply that, even if (which he disputed) the only relevant comparison was between his and Mr Mohr's negligence, the causal potency of the latter's omission, bearing in mind he was driving an 8 tonne brick carrier, greatly exceeded his own, whereas his conduct ""posed no danger to anyone but"" himself, referring to Talbot-Butt v Holloway (1990) 12 MVR 70 (at 88) per Handley JA (referred to with approval in Joslyn v Berryman [2003] HCA 34; (2003) 214 CLR 552; (at [127]) per Kirby J).

36The respondent emphasised the fact that the Court found in Boral Bricks 1 (at [25]) that he would have been in view before the forklift passed the drive doorway, but that Mr Mohr did not see him before running over him even though he was wearing a high visibility vest. 

37The respondent further submitted that the appellant's culpability could not be confined to Mr Mohr's conduct and repeated his earlier submission that the Court had to take into consideration the fact that the appellant was in breach of its duty as the occupier with care and control of the premises because it failed to implement reasonably practical measures which might have obviated the accident in circumstances where the system of work to which it exposed lawful entrants included interaction with heavy forklift trucks moving around the site with drivers having limited visibility and where there were no adequate precautions taken to keep safeguard pedestrians from the risk of harm in such circumstances.

Contributory negligence: consideration
38The primary judge found (at [4]) that the accident was a motor accident within the meaning of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW) (the ""MAC Act"") and, accordingly was governed by that legislation rather than the CLA. As I have said, the latter conclusion was incorrect, at least as a general proposition, because some parts of the CLA applied, notwithstanding that provisions of the MAC Act were also relevant. 

39In the present context mention needs only be made of s 138(1), (3), (4) and (6) of the MAC Act which provide:

""(1) The common law and enacted law as to contributory negligence apply to an award of damages in respect of a motor accident, except as provided by this section.

...

(3) The damages recoverable in respect of the motor accident are to be reduced by such percentage as the court thinks just and equitable in the circumstances of the case.
(4) The court must state its reasons for determining the particular percentage.

...

(6) This section does not exclude any other ground on which a finding of contributory negligence may be made.""

40In addition, s 138(2) of the MAC Act provides that the court must, in the circumstances there specified, make a finding of contributory negligence. None of those circumstances apply to this case.

41Section 138 substantially reproduced s 74 of the Motor Accidents Act 1988 (the ""MAA""). Relevantly, s 138(3) is on all fours with s 74(3) of the MAA.

42Save as to s 138(2), s 138 does not address how a court should determine whether a person has been guilty of contributory negligence. Rather, that task is left to the ""common law and enacted law"": s 138(1). 

43At common law, a plaintiff is guilty of contributory negligence when the plaintiff exposes himself or herself to a risk of injury which might reasonably have been foreseen and avoided and suffers an injury within the class of risk to which the plaintiff was exposed: Joslyn v Berryman (at [16]) per McHugh J. 

44Further at common law, it was an essential element of establishing contributory negligence that the plaintiff's lack of care for his or her own safety ""actually contributed to the occurrence of the injury or the nature or extent of it"": Nicholson v Nicholson (1994) 35 NSWLR 308 (at 333) per Mahoney JA; Astley v Austrust Ltd [1999] HCA 6; (1991) 197 CLR 1 (at [21]) per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; Ackland v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] NSWCA 250 (at [138]) per Ipp JA (McColl JA agreeing), referring to Caswell v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd [1940] AC 152 (at 165). 

45Thus, as Campbell JA (Mason P and Beazley JA agreeing) explained in Monie v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] NSWCA 230 (at [102]):

""The culpability element in contributory negligence is concerned with a situation where the conduct of a plaintiff is a cause of the particular damage that the plaintiff has suffered. The culpability element enquires whether the plaintiff's carelessness for his or her own interests means that to some extent the plaintiff can be blamed for the injuries he or she has suffered.""

46The enacted law of contributory negligence includes s 5R of the CLA: Taheer v Australian Associated Motor Insurers Ltd (trading as AAMI) [2010] NSWCA 191 (at [36]) per Giles JA (Harrison J agreeing); Nominal Defendant v Meakes [2012] NSWCA 66; (2012) 60 MVR 380 (at [79]) per Sackville AJA (McColl JA agreeing); Mikaera v Newman Transport Pty Ltd [2013] NSWCA 464 (at [32]) per McColl JA (Macfarlan JA agreeing). However, even if s 5R was not part of the ""enacted law"", it would apply by virtue of s 3B(2)(a) of the CLA because it is found in Division 8, Part 1A of that Act. It provides:

""5R Standard of contributory negligence

(1) The principles that are applicable in determining whether a person has been negligent also apply in determining whether the person who suffered harm has been contributorily negligent in failing to take precautions against the risk of that harm.

(2) For that purpose:

(a) the standard of care required of the person who suffered harm is that of a reasonable person in the position of that person, and

(b) the matter is to be determined on the basis of what that person knew or ought to have known at the time.""

47The correct legal question in determining the issue of contributory negligence in accordance with s 5R is ""whether a reasonable person in the position of the [plaintiff], i.e. having the knowledge which the [plaintiff] had or ought to have had, was negligent"": Origin Energy LPG Ltd v BestCare Foods Ltd [2012] NSWCA 407 (at [217]) per Hoeben JA (Macfarlan and Ward JJA agreeing) applying Council of the City of Greater Taree v Wells [2010] NSWCA 147; (2010) 174 LGERA 208 (at [107] - [108]) per Basten JA

48While s 5R must be applied to determine whether a person has been guilty of contributory negligence, it says nothing about how, if that issue is determined by a finding adverse to a plaintiff, the relative culpability of the plaintiff and defendant are determined. That exercise is governed prima facie, by s 138(3) and, arguably also by s 9 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965 (NSW) (the ""1965 Act"") which deals with apportionment of liability in cases of contributory negligence and, in particular, s 9(1)(b) which provides that ""the damages recoverable in respect of the wrong are to be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant's share in the responsibility for the damage"". 

49Section 9 is also part of the enacted law as to contributory negligence captured by s 138(1): Nominal Defendant v Rooskov [2012] NSWCA 43; (2012) 60 MVR 350 (at [117]) per Campbell JA (Young JA agreeing); see also Joslyn v Berryman (at [69]) per Gummow and Callinan JJ (referring to s 10(1) of the 1965 Act which, at the time applicable to the accident in that case, dealt with apportionment of liability in cases of contributory negligence.)

50However there are differences between s 138(3) of the MAC Act and s 9(1)(b) of the 1965 Act. As Kirby J explained in Joslyn v Berryman (at [133]), albeit by reference to s 74(3) of the MAA (which as I have said is relevantly on all fours with s 138(3) of the MAC Act):

""Secondly, in s 74(3) of the Motor Accidents Act, Parliament has avoided the more complex statement of the criteria found in s 10(1) of the 1965 Act. There is no reference to the respective 'faults' of the persons involved. Nor is there a reference to the 'responsibility for the damage'. In s 74(3) provision is simply made for the reduction of the damages recoverable 'as the court thinks just and equitable in the circumstances of the case'. It is not entirely clear whether this more limited formula replaced the previous statement of the 'enacted law' set out in the 1965 Act. On the face of things, it appears to do so and thus leaves wholly at large the reduction for contributory negligence, made by reference to nothing more than what 'the court thinks just and equitable'""

51Hayne J also considered the operation of s 74(3) and concluded (at [157]) that it required the decision-maker to undertake the process of apportionment as described in Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 34; (1985) 59 ALJR 492 (at 494). In Mackenzie v the Nominal Defendant [2005] NSWCA 180 (at [60] ff) (special leave refused, Nominal Defendant v Mackenzie [2005] HCATrans 844) Giles JA (Stein AJA and Gzell J agreeing) considered the different wording of s 9(1)(b) and s 138(3) and concluded (at [62] - [63]) that the latter still required the court to apply Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd. His Honour accepted that s 138(3) was the applicable provision no doubt because the case involved an intoxicated plaintiff in which circumstance s 138(2) as then in force was invoked. However as s 138(1) only captures the ""common law and enacted law as to contributory negligence ... except as provided by this section"", in my view the apportionment exercise must be undertaken in accordance with s 138(3). As is apparent from what follows this may be a distinction without a difference. 

52Neither party referred to either s 9(1)(b) or s 138(3), both being content to submit that the question of apportionment the ""just and equitable"" test invokes requires attention to the ""degree of departure from the standard of care of the reasonable man"": Pennington v Norris [1956] HCA 26; (1956) 96 CLR 10 (at 16). The reasoning in Pennington v Norris finds reflection in the statement in Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd (at 494) that the just and equitable apportionment test requires:

""... a comparison both of culpability, i.e. of the degree of departure from the standard of care of the reasonable man (Pennington v Norris (1956) 96 CLR 10 at 16) and of the relative importance of the acts of the parties in causing the damage: Stapley v Gypsum Mines Ltd [1953] AC 663 at 682; Smith v McIntyre [1958] Tas SR 36 at 42-49 and Broadhurst v Millman [1976] VR 208 at 219 and cases there cited. It is the whole conduct of each negligent party in relation to the circumstances of the accident which must be subjected to comparative examination.""

These statements were re-affirmed in Wynbergen v Hoyts Corp Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 52; (1997) 72 ALJR 65 (at 66) per Hayne J (Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby JJ agreeing).

The operation of s 5R

53Section 5R and s 5S of the Civil Liability Act presuppose that someone has been contributorily negligent. They operate to modify the way in which the law of contributory negligence operates under the 1965 Act rather than creating by themselves any particular rights or defences: ACQ Pty Ltd v Cook (2008) 72 NSWLR 318; [2008] NSWCA 161 (at [158]) per Campbell JA (Beazley and Giles JJA agreeing); Motorcycling Events Group Australia Pty Ltd v Kelly [2013] NSWCA 361; (2013) 279 FLR 202 (at [180]) per Gleeson JA (Basten and Meagher JJA agreeing). 

54The question whether a person has been guilty of contributory negligence is determined objectively, the question being whether the plaintiff has taken that degree of care for his or her own safety that an ordinary reasonable person would take: Stojan (No 9) Pty Ltd v Kenway [2009] NSWCA 364; [2009] Aust Torts Reps ¶82-043 (at [146]) per McColl JA (Ipp JA agreeing); Council of the City of Greater Taree v Wells (at [83]) per Beazley JA (McColl and Basten JJA agreeing); Nominal Defendant v Meakes (at [80]) per Sackville AJA (McColl JA agreeing).

55Section 5R reflects the concept expressed by Callinan and Heydon JJ in Vairy v Wyong Shire Council [2005] HCA 62; (2005) 223 CLR 422 (at [220]), ""that the duty to take reasonable care for one's own safety does not 'disregard the burden, by way of social security and other obligations that a civilised and democratic society will assume towards [a plaintiff] if he is injured' [as well as]... the expectation, expressed in the Negligence Review [Review of the Law of Negligence, Final Report, September 2002] at para 8.10, that 'people will take as much care for themselves as they expect others to take for them'"": Waverley Council v Ferreira [2005] NSWCA 418; [2005] Aust Torts Reps ¶81 - 818 (at [85] - [87]); Consolidated Broken Hill Ltd v Edwards [2005] NSWCA 380; [2005] Aust Torts Reps ¶81 - 815 (at [68] - [70]) per Ipp JA (Giles and Hunt AJA agreeing).

56The words ""reasonable person in the position of that person"" in s 5R are equivalent to the words ""a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position"": Waverley Council v Ferreira (at [87]); Carey v Lake Macquarie City Council [2007] NSWCA 4 (at [10]); Pollard v Baulderstone Hornibrook Engineering Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 99; [2008] 172 IR 453 (at [14]) per McColl JA (Mason P and Beazley JA agreeing).

57The fact that s 5R reflects a plaintiff's duty to take care for his or her own safety, rather than a duty to anyone else should be emphasised. Thus ""a plaintiff can be guilty of contributory negligence notwithstanding that he or she owes no duty to the defendant or any third person [as reflected in the proposition that a] pedestrian ... owes no duty to a speeding driver to avoid being run down but is guilty of contributory negligence if he or she fails to take reasonable care to keep a proper lookout for speeding vehicles"": Astley v Austrust Ltd (at [21]) per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ.

58Thus, it can be seen that s 5R, insofar as it picks up s 5B of the Civil Liability Act, reflects the common law proposition concerning contributory negligence McHugh J explained in Joslyn v Berryman (at [16]) (see above at [43]). As his Honour added, ""[i]n principle, any fact or circumstance is relevant in determining contributory negligence if it proves, or assists in proving, a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury to the plaintiff in engaging in the conduct that gave rise to the injury suffered"": Joslyn v Berryman (at [16]).

59It is not apparent that s 5R goes further than invoking s 5B (and probably s 5C) of the CLA. This matter was not argued, but on this assumption, the common law requirement as to the role of the plaintiff's negligence in contributing to the injury applies, rather than the ""necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm"" test in s 5D(1)(a).

The relative culpability of the parties

60In considering the degree to which the appellant and respondent departed from the standard of what is reasonable, it is necessary to have regard to the duty of care the appellant owed the respondent: Astley v Austrust Ltd (at [30]). That subject received no consideration at trial (or in the parties' submissions on appeal), it presumably having been common ground that the appellant, as occupier, owed the respondent as entrant a duty to take reasonable care to prevent injury to him on the assumption he was using reasonable care for his own safety: Australian Safeways Stores Pty Ltd v Zaluzna [1987] HCA 7; (1987) 162 CLR 479 (at 488) per Mason, Wilson, Deane and Dawson JJ; Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer [2007] HCA 42 ; (2007) 234 CLR 330 (at [45]) per Gummow J; 

61As the High Court (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Kirby, Hayne and Heydon JJ) explained in Thompson v Woolworths (Queensland) Pty Ltd (at [24] - [27]) the following factors are relevant to the relationship between the parties. First, the status of the appellant as occupier of the land on which the respondent was injured gave the appellant a measure of control that is regarded by the law as important in identifying the existence and nature of a duty of care. Secondly, the purpose for which, and the circumstances in which, the respondent was on the appellant's land. Just as in Thompson v Woolworths (Queensland) Pty Ltd the respondent was on the appellant's land delivering goods, in this case fuel, to the appellant for use in the course of the appellant's business. Thus, ""[s]ince the [appellant] established the system to which the [respondent] was required to conform, the [appellant's] duty covered not only the static condition of the premises but also the system of delivery"": Thompson v Woolworths (Queensland) Pty Ltd (at [26]). 

62The delivery system included the requirement that the respondent walk to and from the office to obtain a key to the fuel tank into which his load was to be pumped and to complete paper work: primary judgment (at [24]). 

63Accordingly, as ""the [appellant] established and maintained a system ... its obligation to exercise reasonable care for the safety of people who came on to its premises extended to exercising reasonable care that its system did not expose people who made deliveries to unreasonable risk of physical injury"": Thompson v Woolworths (Queensland) Pty Ltd (at [27]). It was incumbent upon the appellant, in my view, to ensure that its system took into account that pedestrians in and around its site, particularly strangers to the premises (even those who had made regular visits) might be inattentive or even negligent in regards to their appreciation of the travel of forklifts in the area: cf Thompson v Woolworths (Queensland) Pty Ltd (at [35]); Taheer v Australian Associated Motor Insurers Ltd (trading as AAMI) (at [42]).

64Insofar as the respondent is concerned, it is relevant that his relationship with the appellant was not that of an employee, but an entrant: Thompson v Woolworths (Queensland) Pty Ltd (at [40]). In that context, perhaps somewhat more emphasis might be placed on his obligation to take reasonable care for his own safety, although what that means will depend upon the circumstances of the case: Thompson v Woolworths (Queensland) Pty Ltd (at [35]). 

65Turning to s 5B, it is apparent that the appellant appreciated the risk of harm to pedestrians who had to interact with the forklifts using the premises. The risk of physical injury to such persons was clearly not insignificant and had been adverted to by the appellant prior to the accident. It is apparent from the pre-accident recommendation to the appellant in the C & C Safety Procedure Document that it install a convex mirror ""especially in areas where there are risks"", that the appellant was alive to the risk of forklifts operating in areas where pedestrians were present. This was also emphasised earlier in the document which warned that ""[t]he use of forklift trucks ... in industry is often associated with substantial risks [including] severe injuries and fatalities ... [and] the risk to both the operator and other persons in the vicinity is still significant if proper safe systems of work are not in place"". In that light, no doubt, the document recommended under the heading ""Safe Work Areas"" that:

""5.7... Barricades: ... pedestrian and traffic areas should be barricaded or clearly designated. Where possible, pedestrian traffic should be separated from forklifts and other vehicles."" 

66These recommendations, which one might think were a matter of common sense, were not implemented. Instead the appellant required entrants such as the respondent to move about its site without adequate separation from forklifts, without any means other than visual observations to alert them as to the possible arrival of a forklift from at least two directions (in the case of the instant accident) and, most importantly without any knowledge of the limited observations of the forklift driver of those in his path. Even if the respondent had seen the direction on the Visitor's Pass that forklifts had right of way, its meaning was obscure insofar as pedestrians were concerned. A reasonable person reading it might well conclude that it applied to vehicles (such as that the respondent drove onto the site), rather than to pedestrian traffic. 

67Insofar as Mr Mohr is concerned his conduct also manifested a severe departure from the standard of reasonable care. There was, as Basten JA said in Boral Bricks 1 (at [25]), no issue that Mr Mohr was guilty of negligence. As Mr Johnston opined, and in any event as one might expect, he was obliged to keep a proper lookout. Indeed, the C & C Safety Procedure document advised in the section dealing with ""Safe Systems of Work"" that ""5.4.2 ... pedestrians must be given right of way"". Had he done so Mr Johnston further opined he ought to have seen the respondent during the time which elapsed between when the respondent exited the office door and the accident. 

68Turning to the respondent, it is relevant to note that while the appellant relied upon his knowledge that forklifts should have right of way (a fact which it has not been found he was aware of) or, at least, his knowledge that there were forklifts travelling in and around the site, there has been no suggestion that he knew, or a reasonable person in his position should have been aware, that forklift drivers had limited vision, such that Mr Mohr's ability to see the respondent, notwithstanding his high visibility clothing, may have been compromised. There is no basis in the evidence, in my view, for the appellant's submission that the respondent must have seen the forklift yet walked straight into its path. 

69I accept, as the appellant submits, that the respondent should have been alert to his environment and should have, but did not, look to see whether a forklift was in the vicinity prior to walking either along the path separated by cones from the road, or when stepping beyond them. In that respect he exposed himself to a risk of injury which might reasonably have been foreseen and hence was guilty of contributory negligence. 

70Turning to the apportionment issue, it is relevant to take into account in assessing the parties' relative culpability both the appellant's control of the site and implementation of the systems in which its employees as well as entrants were required to work as well as the fact that a driver is ""in charge of a powerful vehicle [and has] obligations to exercise care for pedestrians in the position of the appellant"": Anikin v Sierra [2004] HCA 64; (2004) 79 ALJR 452 (at [46]) whereas the pedestrian's conduct, although contributorily negligent, does not endanger the driver of the vehicle or anybody else: Pennington v Norris [1956] HCA 26; (1956) 96 CLR 10 (at 16); Smith v Zhang [2012] NSWCA 142; (2012) 60 MVR 525 (at [13] - [16]) per Macfarlan JA; (at [29] per Meagher JA (with whom Tobias AJA agreed).

71In my view the appellant's culpability for the accident, having regard to its obligations as occupier of the site to ensure that its system of work did not expose entrants to unreasonable risk of physical injury and its responsibility for Mr Mohr's failure to keep a proper lookout manifestly exceeded the respondent's culpability. In that respect I would accept the respondent's submission that his failure to keep a proper lookout should be characterised as an act of momentary inattention, albeit that it did constitute a departure from the standard of care he ought to have exercised in the circumstances in which he was walking. It is clear that his omission contributed to the harm which befell him.

72I would assess the respondent's contributory negligence at 10 per cent.

73I agree with Basten JA's reasons on the costs issue.

74I agree with Basten JA's orders, save that in lieu of the judgment of $717,970 his Honour proposes in order (2), I would order that there be judgment for the respondent against the first defendant in the amount of $923,104.80, being 90 per cent of the damages assessed by the primary judge as reduced on appeal: see Boral Bricks 1 (at [104]).

75BASTEN JA: On 18 April 2008 the respondent, Mr Orestis Cosmidis, delivered a tanker load of fuel to premises occupied by the appellant, Boral Bricks Pty Ltd, at Badgery's Creek, south-west of Sydney. After completing the delivery and attending the appellant's office, he walked back towards his tanker. He was hit from behind by a forklift and suffered significant injuries.

76The respondent obtained a judgment from the District Court against Boral Bricks, which was found liable in negligence. Boral Bricks did not challenge the finding of liability, but did appeal from the finding that there was no contributory negligence on the part of Mr Cosmidis. (The extent of the appeal is considered further below.) On 18 December 2013 the Court upheld the appeal: Boral Bricks Pty Ltd v Cosmidis [2013] NSWCA 443. The Court directed that the parties have an opportunity to make further submissions as to whether:
(a)the question of contributory negligence should be remitted to the District Court;
(b)if not, there should be a further hearing on the issue in this Court, 

and were given an opportunity to file further written submissions with respect to -

(c)the issue of contributory negligence, and
(d)the appropriate orders as to costs.

77In accordance with those directions, both parties filed submissions on 24 January 2014. The parties were agreed that this Court should determine the issue of contributory negligence and, as confirmed by submissions in reply filed on 5 February 2014 on behalf of the respondent, neither party sought a further oral hearing.

Contributory negligence
78Both parties made submissions as to contributory negligence prior to the hearing of the appeal on 25 November 2013; both supplemented their submissions in writing in accordance with the directions given on 18 December 2013. It is necessary to identify the relevant principles before considering their application to the facts of the case.

(a) relevant principles
79The appellant submitted that the case must be decided by reference to s 5R of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW). That section provides:

5R Standard of contributory negligence

(1) The principles that are applicable in determining whether a person has been negligent also apply in determining whether the person who suffered harm has been contributorily negligent in failing to take precautions against the risk of that harm.

(2) For that purpose:

(a) the standard of care required of the person who suffered harm is that of a reasonable person in the position of that person, and
(b) the matter is to be determined on the basis of what that person knew or ought to have known at the time.

80The appellant further submitted that the relevant principles had been summarised by Beazley JA (with whom McColl JA agreed) in Council of the City of Greater Taree v Wells [2010] NSWCA 147 in the following terms:

""[82] In Consolidated Broken Hill Ltd v Edwards [2005] NSWCA 380; (2005) Aust Torts Reports 81-815 at [67] and [68], Ipp JA (Giles JA and Hunt AJA agreeing) noted that in determining whether a plaintiff has been contributorily negligent it is necessary to have regard to the plaintiff's personal responsibility for his or her own safety. As Callinan and Heydon JJ remarked in Vairy v Wyong Shire Council [2005] HCA 62; (2005) 223 CLR 422, at [220] 483, a person owes a duty:

'... not just to look out for himself, but not to act in a way which may put him at risk, in the knowledge that society may come under obligations of various kinds to him if the risk is realized.'

These remarks are consistent with the provisions of the Civil Liability Act, s 5R(1): Consolidated Broken Hill per Ipp JA at [67] 558-559.

[83] Contributory negligence is determined objectively from the facts and circumstances of a case, which includes what the plaintiff knew or ought to have known at the time: s 5R(2)(b); Joslyn v Berryman [2003] HCA 34; (2003) 214 CLR 552 at [16].""

81The appellant referred to the statement of the High Court in Podrebersek v Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 34; 59 ALJR 492 at 494 that:

""The making of an apportionment as between a plaintiff and a defendant of their respective shares in the responsibility for the damage involves a comparison both of culpability, ie of the degree of departure from the standard of care of the reasonable man (Pennington v Norris (1956) 96 CLR 10 at 16) and of the relative importance of the acts of the parties in causing the damage: Stapley v Gypsum Mines Ltd [1953] AC 663 at 682 ....""

82The respondent adopted the same passage from Podrebersek, but added a reference to Talbot-Butt v Holloway (1990) 12 MVR 70, where Handley JA stated at 88, reflecting the reasoning in Pennington v Norris [1956] HCA 26; 96 CLR 10:

""The evaluation and assessment of the culpability of the plaintiff and the defendant must take proper account of the fact that ... the plaintiff's conduct posed no danger to anyone but herself, while the defendant who was driving (the vehicle) ... was in charge of a machine that was capable of doing great damage to any human being who got in its way.""

83One feature of recent case law is the frequent reference to the ""common law rules of contributory negligence"". (Even under the common law it was rarely helpful to refer to 'rules' as opposed to 'principles': see Alford v Magee [1952] HCA 3; 85 CLR 437 at 456 and 460.) However, were it not for the terms of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW) and the Civil Liability Act, contributory negligence would be assessed in accordance with s 9 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965 (NSW) (""the 1965 Act""). That section relevantly provides:

9 Apportionment of liability in cases of contributory negligence

(1) If a person (the claimant) suffers damage as the result partly of the claimant's failure to take reasonable care (contributory negligence) and partly of the wrong of any other person:

...
(b) the damages recoverable in respect of the wrong are to be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant's share in the responsibility for the damage.

84The Motor Accidents Compensation Act provides that ""[t]he common law and enacted law as to contributory negligence apply to an award of damages in respect of a motor accident, except as provided by this section"": s 138(1). The section then provides that findings of contributory negligence must be made in particular cases, but expressly preserves any other ground: s 138(2) and (6). Section 138(3) states that ""[t]he damages recoverable in respect of the motor accident are to be reduced by such percentage as the court thinks just and equitable in the circumstances of the case."" Although this last provision is not identical in terms to s 9(1)(b) of the 1965 Act, because s 138 does not purport to impinge on the obligation to have regard to the injured person's share in the responsibility for the damage, it should not be read as an exception to which s 9(1) is made subject by s 138(1) of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act.

85Section 5R of the Civil Liability Act is found in Div 8 of Pt 1A. Those provisions expressly apply to motor accidents: Civil Liability Act, s 3B(2)(a). The Civil Liability Act being enacted later than the Motor Accidents Compensation Act, and making specific provision in s 3B for its operation with respect to motor accidents, should not be taken as subject to s 138. Rather, it should be given operation according to its terms.

86In this somewhat complex statutory scheme it is not clear what role is to be played by the ""common law"", including the reference in s 138(1) of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act. If (as must be the case) it means no more than the way courts have construed the statutory provisions, it is not only otiose, but ""is apt to distract attention from the supreme importance of statute law"", to adopt the language of Gummow J in Sons of Gwalia Ltd v Margaretic [2007] HCA 1; 231 CLR 160 at [35]; and see Walker Corporation v Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority [2008] HCA 5; 233 CLR 259 at [30]-[31] (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ); Apotex Pty Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis Australia Pty Ltd [2013] HCA 50; 304 ALR 1 at [18] (French CJ). For example, s 5R(2) of the Civil Liability Act deals with the ""standard of care"", which may or may not affect the ""just and equitable"" test in s 9 of the 1965 Act.

87The references in the case law are often to the ""rules"" identified by McHugh J in Joslyn v Berryman [2003] HCA 34; 214 CLR 552 at [16]ff. These references are curious for a number of reasons. First, Joslyn was concerned with the application of s 74(2) of the Motor Accidents Act 1988 (NSW), not the common law (assuming the intended distinction is between the common law and statute; cf Leeming JA in Frost v Kourouche [2014] NSWCA 39 at [31]). McHugh J was indeed conscious of that distinction, making clear the importance of the statutory test at [14]. The following paragraphs of his judgment involved an historical account of the ""common law"" of contributory negligence, at a time when contributory negligence was a complete defence and the common law devised a number of mechanisms to diminish the unsatisfactory consequences. Secondly, no other member of the Court expressly adopted the reasoning of McHugh J. Thirdly, whilst doubting the current applicability of the reasoning of the High Court in Cook v Cook [1986] HCA 73; 162 CLR 376 (in respect of the duty of a care owed by a learner driver to an instructor) Joslyn pre-dated the decision in Imbree v McNeilly [2008] HCA 40; 236 CLR 510 which overruled Cook.

88Finally, although there have been statements in this Court to the effect that s 5R(2) reflects the principle stated by McHugh J in Joslyn, the correctness of that statement is not self-evident and the reasoning underlying it has never been fully exposed, no doubt because it has been accorded the status of received wisdom. However, McHugh J described the test of contributory negligence as ""an objective one"": Joslyn, at [32]. He described it as one which ""eliminates the personal equation and is independent of the idiosyncrasies of the particular person whose conduct is in question"", quoting Glasgow Corporation v Muir [1943] AC 448 at 457 (Lord Macmillan). McHugh J noted exceptions in respect of children and possibly certain other ""special and exceptional circumstances"" (referring to Cook) at [30] and [32]. The standard identified in s 5R(2)(a) is at best a qualified objective test: it is not one that conforms to the language adopted by McHugh J in Joslyn.

89For present purposes, it is not necessary to consider whether those statements remain correct, a matter which depends not at all on the common law, but on the meaning of the phrase ""a reasonable person in the position of [the injured person]"". However, what does need to be determined is the extent to which the approach adopted in Pennington v Norris, and relied on in Talbot-Butt, continues to operate.

90There are, as I sought to explain in Council of the City of Greater Taree v Wells at [107]-[108], considerable difficulties in applying the same legal principles in determining negligence of the defendant and determining whether the injured party was contributorily negligent in failing to take precautions ""against the risk of that harm"". Secondly, it is not entirely clear whether, by an implication from the statement in sub-s (1) that the principles applicable in determining negligence also apply in determining contributory negligence, the standard of care identified in sub-s (2) in relation to the injured person also applies to the person causing the injury: cf D Villa, Annotated Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) (2nd ed, 2013, Lawbook Co) at 247.

91Thus, in the present case, the appellant is vicariously liable for the negligent operation by the driver of the forklift, and is liable for any lack of reasonable care in providing a safe system of work as the operator of a commercial venture on land which it occupied and controlled. By contrast, the injured respondent was a visitor to the premises, with no control over the operation of vehicles (other than his own) on the premises and was a pedestrian when struck. In Pennington v Norris, the Court (Dixon CJ, Webb, Fullagar, Kitto JJ) said with respect to a pedestrian run down at night on a public road (at 16):

""The plaintiff's conduct was ex hypothesi careless and unreasonable but, after all, it was the sort of thing that is very commonly done: he simply did not look when a reasonably careful man would have looked. We think too that in this case the very fact that his conduct did not endanger the defendant or anybody else is a material consideration. The defendant's position was entirely different.""

92The judgment then noted that the defendant did not merely fail to keep a proper lookout, but drove too fast in circumstances where it was a misty night, the road was wet and visibility was impaired in part by mistiness on the inside and outside of the windscreen. Driving at 30 miles per hour in a town at night under those circumstances was described as ""an obviously dangerous thing"": at 17. 

93Findings of fact are not, of course, binding on this Court. It would be open to a court in such circumstances to find that a pedestrian walking carelessly across the road had endangered others, because of the very real risk that a car forced to swerve violently to miss a pedestrian might collide with another vehicle, or even another pedestrian. Further, although the Court eschewed any attribution of ""moral blameworthiness"" the assessment of ""culpability"" did not appear to involve markedly different considerations. If the respective dangerousness of a pedestrian's conduct and the conduct of a driver is always a substantial factor, the most careless pedestrian will recover a significant proportion of his loss even though the negligence of the driver was limited, because it is the latter who is driving, in the words of Handley JA, ""a machine that was capable of doing great damage to any human being who got in its way"".

94The intended purpose of s 5R is clearer than its actual operation. It was intended to apply to the assessment of contributory negligence the general principles set out in s 5B (and arguably s 5C) in determining the negligence of the defendant. Like s 5B(1)(c), s 5R(2) adopts the qualified objective test of ""a reasonable person in the position of [the plaintiff]"". 

95According to the final report entitled Review of the Law of Negligence (September 2002, commonly referred to as the Ipp Report) the provision was intended to change current practices. Somewhat rhetorically, the report asked at paragraph 8.7:

""Should the law allow people to take less care for their own safety than it requires others to take for their safety? ... Another way of putting this question is to ask whether the standard of care applicable to victims of the negligent conduct of others should be different from that applicable to the negligent person merely because they are victims?""

96The Report then stated at par 8.11:

""Leading text book writers have asserted that in practice, the standard of care applied to contributory negligence is lower than that applied to negligence despite the fact that, in theory, the standard should be the same. There is a perception (which may reflect the reality) that many lower courts are more indulgent to plaintiffs than to defendants. In some cases judges have expressly applied a lower standard of care for contributory negligence. This may result, for example, in motorists being required to keep a better lookout than pedestrians. In the Panel's view, this approach should not be supported.""

97The penultimate sentence was supported by reference to three judgments in the High Court and two in the South Australian Supreme Court. The comments of Murphy J in Watt v Bretag (1982) 56 ALJR 760 at 762-763, are in point. Referring to the South Australian equivalent of the 1965 Act, s 9(1)(b), Murphy J stated:

""The speed and size and weight of the vehicles in contributing to the severity of the damage should be taken into account, not merely those factors which contributed to the collision. ... For example, where the collision is between a semi-trailer or other juggernaut vehicle and a pedal bicycle, even if the driver and the plaintiff rider each made an equal contribution to causing the collision, it would generally be just and equitable to reduce the plaintiff's damages not by half, but by much less. Similarly, excessive speed may greatly increase the damage, even though the fault of the other driver was the major cause of the collision.""

98There is some irony in placing reliance on the reasoning of Handley JA in Talbot-Butt: his was a dissenting judgment. Further, in the following paragraph, he was inclined to diminish the weight to be given to the factor which he had identified. On the other hand, Clarke JA (who, with Kirby P, constituted the majority) expressed a similar view at 78(45). Clarke JA described this factor as being of ""primary relevance"" in determining the relative responsibilities, referring to Evers v Bennett (1982) 31 SASR 228 at 234, where Zelling J stated that ""[t]he train of authority over many years is to hold the motorist, who is capable of doing considerable injury to a pedestrian, more culpable than the pedestrian in such circumstances."" Evers was one of the cases identified in the Ipp Report as expressly applying a lower standard of care to plaintiffs.

99Assuming that the requirement that people should take responsibility for their own lives and safety is now reflected in s 5R, and was intended to override the approach of Murphy J in Watt, there is a question as to whether the statements in Talbot-Butt still reflect the law in this State. The potential dangerousness of heavy machinery and fast vehicles can no doubt be applied universally, although the consequence of its application will vary depending on whether one, both or neither party is in control of such a vehicle. On the other hand, applying the general principles in s 5B(2) one could approach the matter differently. Thus, the probability that harm would occur if care were not taken and the likely seriousness of the harm would operate differentially with respect to the driver of the forklift and the pedestrian, but with the same result. That is, no distinction is made between the fact that from one perspective the driver is in control of a vehicle that could cause serious harm to a pedestrian, whilst from the perspective of the pedestrian, it was the likelihood of serious harm which was to be considered. If the plaintiff were aware, or ought to have been aware, of the presence of a large forklift operating in the area and if the forklift driver were aware, or should have been aware, of the likely presence of pedestrians, and if each were equally careless, liability should be shared equally.

100A purposive approach to the operation of s 5R (and s 5B) requires that this approach be adopted. To approach the matter in this way is not to decline to follow applicable earlier authority of this Court. Talbot-Butt long pre-dated the Civil Liability Act; it also pre-dated s 74 of the Motor Accidents Act, the forebear of s 138 of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act.

(b) application of principles
101It is convenient to deal first with the appellant's share of the responsibility for the accident. Because it did not challenge its liability on appeal, it was not necessary to consider the basis of that liability in the earlier judgment of this Court. To do that, it is necessary to refer to the reasons given by the trial judge, Levy DCJ, relevant to that issue.

102The trial judge found the appellant liable on two bases, namely vicarious liability for the negligent driving of its employee and, directly, for not implementing its own system for managing traffic. 

103As to vicarious liability, the trial judge stated at [161]:

""In this case, the plain fact is that the plaintiff was struck, knocked down and dragged along by the forklift because [the driver] had not seen him. In my view, those circumstances bespeak a clear failure on the part of [the driver] to keep a proper lookout whilst driving the forklift in circumstances where he must have known it was likely that persons such as the plaintiff could be walking about on site.""

104The next sentence appeared to qualify this finding to an extent, stating that ""[t]his clearly amounted to negligence where [the driver's] view of the path ahead had been obscured"". The reference to obscured vision was to an earlier statement that ""forklifts were being driven about by drivers with a restricted view of what was ahead, whether this was because of the nature of the loads or because of the position of the grabbing mechanism and forklift masts"": at [142]. As will be seen, the appellant had identified the potential problem and devised a system to reduce the risk of collision. The driver's limited vision may have lessened his share of responsibility for the accident, but that aspect was, in effect, transferred to the appellant, as the party responsible for the operations of the forklift and health and safety on its site.

105There was in evidence a document (Ex L) entitled ""Safe Working Procedures - Traffic Management Plan"", which was dated 17 June 2008, having been produced two months after the accident. The trial judge referred to the contents of that document at [30]-[32], without referring to the date. When he returned to a discussion of Ex L at [139]-[143], the inference was drawn that ""the problem that emerged in this case was one of ensuring that the above systems were implemented and adequately maintained on the site"": at [142]. Again, there was no identification of the fact that Ex L post-dated the accident.

106By contrast, when describing what was identified as ""another Boral Safety Procedures manual"" (Ex K), the date of the document, namely 27 February 2007 (pre-dating the accident) was expressly noted: at [33]. The document stated that ""[e]nsuring the safety of pedestrians is a critical aspect of workplace traffic management"": at par 5.10. The document then stated in capitals, ""Protecting pedestrians at the workplace requires decisive action to prevent, not just discourage, pedestrians and forklifts from coming into close proximity."" It identified matters for consideration including the provision of ""clearly marked 'No Go' or exclusion zones for both pedestrians and forklifts"" and the erection of ""physical barriers to protect all marked pedestrian walkways and/or enclose designated forklift operating areas to prevent pedestrian access"". 

107Exhibit J was a training manual for forklift safety, prepared in 2006 by an independent entity. The trial judge did not make a finding as to Boral's knowledge of the contents of that document, although he noted that the manual ""required that pedestrians be excluded from all areas where forklifts operated"", a safety requirement which he said ""was not implemented"": at [150]. As Ex K made a similar recommendation, the provenance of Ex J need not be considered further.

108The primary findings made at trial with respect to Boral's own negligence was as follows:

""[139] As to the provision for an adequate system of managing traffic, Boral did in fact have such a system, albeit a cumbersome one, as identified in Exhibit 'L', and summarised at paragraphs [29] to [32] above, and which provided for the deployment of a person described as a spotter, to advise and guide the forklift driver when the view ahead was obstructed.

[140] In my view, Boral's designated system of requiring a forklift to cease operating immediately and to give way to a pedestrian if the forklift was within 3 metres of a pedestrian, and for the deployment of a spotter to work in conjunction with the forklift, was an appropriate one for the site given the nature of the operations on site. ...

[141] In the absence of specified or designated traffic areas providing for the separation of pedestrians and vehicular traffic, including the provision of crossing points for pedestrians and vehicles where necessary, the requirement that forklifts give way to pedestrians was a sensible appropriate one, as was the requirement that forklifts not travel closer than 3m to pedestrians: Exhibit 'L'.

...

[143] Although Boral's safety manual Exhibit 'L' provided for the deployment of a spotter in such circumstances, for some unexplained reason, this was not done at the time of the accident. It is plain that if a person in the role of a spotter had been deployed, as was envisaged by the site operations manual to which I have already referred, the plaintiff's accident would have been an unlikely occurrence. I consider that the non-deployment of a spotter in the circumstances of the movement of the forklift about the site where the driver had a restricted view, and the subsequent occurrence of the plaintiff's accident, fulfilled all the requirements of s 5B and s 5D of the CL Act to properly base a finding of negligence.""

109No doubt the ""unexplained reason"" for not following the directions in Ex L was that it did not exist at the time of the accident. Further, the trial judge appears to have treated the contents of Ex L as a basis for finding negligence. Whilst it was open to the judge to find that the need for a ""spotter"" should have been foreseen prior to the accident, it was important to bear in mind the requirements of s 5C(c) that ""the subsequent taking of action that would (had the action been taken earlier) have avoided a risk of harm does not of itself give rise to or affect liability in respect of the risk and does not of itself constitute an admission of liability in connection with the risk"". The fact that the trial judge thought the use of a ""spotter"" to be ""cumbersome"" suggests that a more careful assessment of that particular of negligence was required. While the finding was not challenged, its weight on a comparative basis remains to be determined.

110Three factors are of critical significance in assessing the respective responsibilities of the parties. First, it was apparent that the procedures (not shown to be unreasonable in themselves) which involved the respondent walking from the fuel tank to the office involved him crossing an area in which forklifts were operating. There was a contention that the forklifts could have avoided crossing that area, but there was no assessment of the practicality of the alternative route. The evidence did not warrant a finding that an exclusion zone was reasonably practicable.

111Secondly, while it was true that a ""spotter"" might have been a mechanism for greater safety, there must have been a question as to where the spotter would have been at the time of the accident. It is clear that the forklift was travelling faster than the respondent's walking speed and that it was not carrying a load at the time of the accident. Presumably the spotter was not to walk in front of it carrying a red flag. Exhibit L suggested that a spotter must be used where ""a load or obstacle impedes or blocks the view of the Operator"". It is by no means clear that this requirement would have been engaged at the time of the accident. 

112Thirdly, a number of possible safety features, such as the fitting of a horn to enable a warning to be sounded by the driver of the forklift would have been ineffective in the present case: no warning would have been sounded because the driver did not see the respondent. The trial judge apparently did not know whether there was a horn or other warning device attached to the forklift: see [156] and [157]. Nevertheless, he concluded that the failure to operate the device was a relevant breach of duty: at [157] and [158]. Again the finding is not challenged, but in terms of responsibility for the accident, that appears to have been no more than a consequence of a failure to keep a proper lookout by the driver.

113Something was sought to be made in the course of the trial of the conditions contained on the visitor's pass with which the respondent was issued at the gateway to the site. One condition stated that ""[f]orklifts have right of way"". The trial judge did not consider that the responsibility of the respondent for the injury was affected by his failure to comply with such a direction. In the absence of any evidence that the direction was drawn to his attention, that finding should be accepted as applicable to contributory negligence also.

Conclusion - contributory negligence
114With respect to the appellant's share of responsibility for the accident, the dangers of forklifts operating in areas where there were pedestrians were well understood by it. It had control of the site and was responsible for ensuring that adequate safety precautions were in force. Whilst the finding that a ""spotter"" should have been used should be accepted, in the absence of any challenge, the causal effect of the failure is limited. 

115The trial judge concluded that although the row of safety cones and tape provided protection so far as they went, there should have been provision ""for delineating a safe and segregated pathway for pedestrians who had a need to continue walking beyond the point of the last of the row of safety cones"": at [152]. Presumably that meant some marking on the roadway, of which the forklift driver would also be required to take note. This finding was somewhat imprecise, but may be accepted as a particular of negligence.

116Although the driver's view was obstructed by elements of the machinery, it is clear that he must have failed to keep a proper lookout, or he should have seen the respondent in his yellow safety vest. 

117With respect to the respondent's share of responsibility for the accident, this Court found in its first judgment that ""the position of the forklift, the apparent point of initial impact and the implausibility of the suggestion that the plaintiff had looked to right and to left after he came out of the office but did not see the offending forklift anywhere"" supported a finding of contributory negligence: at [65]. It is not possible, on the evidence, and in the face of the respondent's denial, to be satisfied that he did see the forklift. However, if he looked in all directions when he came out of the office, he should have seen the forklift. Further, having walked down the line of safety cones, whilst wearing earplugs, he proceeded into an area where he knew that the forklift operated without looking behind him. 

118The circumstances in which the accident occurred are more fully set out in the Court's first judgment, rejecting the finding that there was no contributory negligence. Given those circumstances (which need not be repeated) and the elements of negligence on the part of the appellant, an appropriate finding is that the respondent was 30% contributorily negligent for the accident. The damages awarded must be reduced accordingly.

119The damages assessed by the trial judge, as reduced on appeal - see first judgment at [104] - are assessed at $1,025,672, 70% of which is $717,970. There should be judgment for the respondent in that sum. The judgment should take effect from the date of the judgment in the District Court, namely 13 September 2012.

Costs
120Both parties made submissions with respect to the costs of the trial and of the appeal. Each also made an alternative submission that there should be a further opportunity to address costs once this judgment had been delivered. However, as the assumptions on which the submissions were made have largely been fulfilled, there is no need to provide a further opportunity.

121The trial judge ordered that the appellant pay the respondent's costs of the trial, to be assessed on the ordinary basis. Because of its success in overturning aspects of the trial judgment on appeal, the appellant submitted that it should only have to pay 75% of the costs of the trial. The basis of that apportionment was that the trial exceeded the three-day estimate and would not have done absent the errors.

122The trial in fact ran over five days: however, there is no basis beyond speculation for this Court to determine that there would have been a significant saving in time (let alone a reduction of two days) if, as the appellant contended, Mr Johnston's report had been admitted and the objections in relation to cross-examination had not been upheld. Since the respondent has retained the bulk of his judgment, there is no adequate basis to interfere with the costs order made by the trial judge.

123With respect to the costs of the appeal, the appellant contended that it had been successful ""with the substance of its appeal"" and therefore should have the costs of the appeal. In his initial supplementary submissions, the respondent contended that the Court should order that the appellant should pay the costs of the appeal as well as the trial. In reply, he abandoned that somewhat extravagant position and submitted that there should be no order as to the costs of the appeal, with the intent that the parties bear their own costs.

124This submission was based on the proposition that the appellant had had only limited success. Although the notice of appeal did not expressly challenge the finding on liability, it did contend that the constraints imposed on the cross-examination of the respondent and the refusal to allow it to amend its defence to include particulars of negligence on the part of the respondent's employer, necessitated a retrial. As the respondent noted, that approach was maintained up to the hearing of the appeal. That position was not accepted by the Court. 

125Of three challenges to heads of damages, the appellant was successful with respect to two, but not with respect to future economic loss, which was the largest single item of damages. With respect to contributory negligence, the appellant was successful in overturning the refusal of the trial judge to make any reduction on this account. However, it was not successful in its submission that the respondent's share of responsibility for the accident ""far exceeds"" that of the appellant. On the other hand, the respondent's submission that contributory negligence should be in the range between 5% and 10% was also not accepted.

126As explained in the first judgment, neither party maintained an entirely rational position with respect to the rejection of cross-examination and amendment to the defence. Given that each had a degree of success on the appeal, the respondent's submissions should be accepted, namely that there be no order as to the costs of the appeal, each party being left to bear its own costs.

Orders
127The Court should make the following orders:

(1) Allow the appeal in part and set aside order (1) made by the District Court on 13 September 2012.

(2) In place thereof, give judgment for the plaintiff against the first defendant in the amount of $717,970, such judgment to date from 13 September 2012.

(3) Make no order as to the costs of the appeal.

128EMMETT JA: On 18 December 2013, the Court published reasons for concluding that the appeal in these proceedings should be upheld in part. However, the parties were directed to make further written submissions on the question of contributory negligence on the part of Mr Cosmidis. The Court has now received further submissions on that question and the parties do not want any further oral hearing. 

129I have had the advantage of reading in draft form the proposed reasons of Basten JA for concluding that the extent of the contribution of the negligence of Mr Cosmidis to the accident in which he suffered his injuries was thirty percent. I agree with his Honour's conclusion and the orders proposed by him for the reasons given by him.

		10 December 2014",2014-05-06 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2705173,R v Trawin-Hadfield [2014] NSWSC 591,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Bradley Owen Trawin-Hadfield, (the accused), applies for a trial by judge alone pursuant to s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. As the accused's notice of motion was filed on 22 April 2014 and his trial was to commence today, the application requires the leave of the Court: s 132A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act. The Crown does not oppose the grant of leave but opposes the application.

2The accused is indicted on the charge that he on 12 October 2010 at Mount Pritchard in the State of New South Wales did unlawfully kill Wallace Ruiz-Sanchez (the deceased). This is a charge of manslaughter to which the accused pleads not guilty.

The Crown case

3The case against the accused is summarised in the Crown Case Statement. The deceased was shot dead on the front step of his home at Mount Pritchard. He died as a result of a single close range gunshot wound to the head. The Crown will seek to prove the gun discharged as a result of it being employed by Samuel Lockett to bludgeon the deceased on the head during an episode of unjustifiable violence. The Crown alleges that the deceased was a victim of a protracted assault that was carried out in a concerted manner and with the advantage of the force of numbers. 

4It is the Crown case that the accused was one of five adult men who attacked the deceased. The Crown will allege that although the accused did not carry out the action that brought about the discharge of the shotgun to the deceased's head, the accused was a party to a joint criminal enterprise that resulted in the unlawful killing of the deceased. The Crown alleges that Samuel Lockett was also a party to the joint criminal enterprise.

5The case against the accused is founded upon the principles of joint criminal enterprise manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. The Crown will also allege that the accused was an aider and abettor in the commission of the crime by Lockett. 

Issues at trial 
6The accused denies he was a party to a joint criminal enterprise. He further asserts that as a result of a combination of cognitive and intellectual deficits, he both lacked the capacity for and/or did not at any relevant time have the foresight necessary to attract criminal liability for manslaughter. 

7The accused takes issue with some of the evidence of the Crown witnesses, Ms Knaggs and Ms Riddell. He denies that he joined in the attack as alleged. The accused asserts he was not party to the initial assault upon the deceased and joined it only when he perceived that Lockett had been placed in a headlock by the deceased. He then struck the deceased twice in an attempt to free Lockett from the headlock. The accused asserts that his actions at the relevant time were done in the lawful defence of Lockett.

Grounds for the application

8The accused in written submissions contends that evidence of the events leading up to the movement of the five people from Jasmine Psaroudis' home to the home of the deceased relies almost entirely on the ERISP given by the accused following his arrest. Furthermore, the best evidence of the events on and in the vicinity of the verandah of the deceased's home leading up to the fatal shooting is contained in the accused's ERISP. 

9The defence case is said to rely essentially on expert evidence; the evidence of a forensic psychologist, Kathryn Wakely and Dr Giuffrida, a psychiatrist. It is also anticipated that the accused will give evidence. Mr Givorshner, who appears for the accused, told the court that the accused will give evidence of self-induced intoxication.

10The accused points out that in a report dated 6 May 2013, Dr Giuffrida expresses his belief in the accused's lack of capacity to have the foresight necessary to attract liability for manslaughter. The accused contends that the real difficulty for a jury will be dealing with differing and contradictory instructions concerning the importance of drug and alcohol consumption of a transient kind which was consumed by the accused on the day before and the day of the fatal shooting which they will be directed to disregard pursuant to s 428D of the Crimes Act 1900. However, they will be required to consider the permanent defects he has which are, in part at least, a consequence of a history of substance abuse.

11In relation to the claim by the accused that he was acting in the lawful defence of another, the accused submits that a jury would be told that they are to consider his consumption of alcohol and/or drugs in relation to the accused's perception of the need to take action in the exercise of that right, but would then be instructed to disregard it again in weighing the proportionality of the accused's response. The accused contends that the exercise of taking into account his drug and alcohol consumption for some purposes, but disregarding it for other purposes, is profoundly difficult and foreign to ordinary people but routine for judges. It is contended that this task will be even more difficult given they are also required to consider an accused ""with a raft of significant intellectual deficits and his capacity for foresight"" (AWS p3). The accused argues that ""the exercise is fraught with the risk of distraction and misapplication of the proper principles such that it is in the interests of justice to leave those tasks to a judge"" (AWS p3). 

12Another submission is that as a result of the accused's cognitive difficulties, his evidence would be difficult to elicit. It will be slow, punctuated by long pauses and concerns about the extent to which he understands what is being put to him. It was said that the accused is difficult to understand when he speaks, slurring his words, often to the point where he is incomprehensible.

13During oral submissions this morning, Mr Givorshner referred to ""a combination of highly complex directions"", particularly as to the mens rea required on the part of the accused. Mr Givorshner submits that this is a case that requires reasons from a judge rather than a verdict from a jury. 

14Before venturing further, it is convenient to refer to Dr Giuffrida's report dated 6 May 2013. Dr Giuffrida expresses the opinion that the accused has an impaired cognitive capacity. He opines it is likely the accused has an underlying structural brain damage due to unknown causes. Dr Giuffrida refers to the accused's epilepsy and lengthy history of serious hazardous alcohol and cannabis dependence which in more recent years has been complicated by an escalating pattern of stimulant abuse. Dr Giuffrida opines that the effect of long-term abuse of those substances leads to likely permanent cognitive impairment. Dr Giuffrida considers that even if the temporary effects of alcohol and other drugs are excluded, the accused would not have had the capacity to appreciate that an act will be committed that exposed the deceased to an appreciable risk of serious injury.







Consideration 

15Section 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act relevantly is as follows:

""(1) An accused person or the prosecutor in criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or District Court may apply to the court for an order that the accused person be tried by a Judge alone (a ""trial by judge order"").
(2) The court must make a trial by judge order if both the accused person and the prosecutor agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone.
(3) If the accused person does not agree to being tried by a Judge alone, the court must not make a trial by judge order.
(4) If the prosecutor does not agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone, the court may make a trial by judge order if it considers it is in the interests of justice to do so.
(5) Without limiting subsection (4), the court may refuse to make an order if it considers that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards, including (but not limited to) an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness.
...""

16The overriding principle in determining the application is whether it is in the interests of justice to grant it. There is no onus other than evidentiary upon the accused to justify the grant of a judge alone trial: The Queen v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86; The Queen v Dean [2013] NSWSC 661. 

17Where the Court considers that the trial will involve factual issues that require the application of objective community standards, including but not limited to an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness, the Court may refuse to make an order. As was said in Belghar by McClellan CJ at CL [100]:

""Where an alleged offence involves objective community standards, the Parliament has made plain that it may be preferable in the interests of justice that there should be trial by jury, however, where, as in the present case, the trial will not require the application of community standards to resolve any issue, the factors favouring a jury trial are diminished at least by the absence of that factor.""


18In the accused's trial there will be two factual issues that require the application of objective community standards. The first concerns an issue of reasonableness. It is the accused's case that he joined in the assault upon the deceased when he perceived that Lockett had been placed in a headlock by the deceased. He then struck the deceased twice in an attempt to free Lockett. 

19Should defence of another be raised in evidence at trial, the Crown bears the onus of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was not acting in Lockett's defence. The Crown may do this by proving beyond reasonable doubt either:

1. That the accused did not believe at the time he struck the deceased it was necessary to do what he did in order to defend Lockett; or, 

2. The striking of the deceased by the accused was not a reasonable response in the circumstances the accused perceived them to be. In determining whether what the accused did was reasonable, a jury would be instructed to stand back and consider the response from an objective viewpoint.

20The second factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards concerns an issue of dangerousness. It is the Crown's case that Lockett struck the deceased on the head with a gun which caused his death and that deliberate act was unlawful and dangerous. 

21The determination of dangerousness is objective. An act is dangerous if it is such that a reasonable person in the position of Lockett would have realised that by striking the deceased on the head with a gun, the deceased was being exposed to an appreciable risk of serious injury. 

22Although in the accused's trial the application of community standards will be required to resolve these issues, the Court is not obliged to reject the application for a judge alone trial. The interests of justice depend upon the circumstances of the case including the complexity of the issues at trial. However, the presence of that factor necessarily supports a jury trial as community standards of reasonableness and dangerousness are best decided by a jury of 12 than by a judge alone.

23One of the accused's concerns is that a jury would have difficulty dealing with evidence of the accused's drug and alcohol consumption when considering the issue of the accused's defence of Lockett. Intoxication is not infrequently raised in connection with self-defence and defence of another. Relevantly, the effects of the long term alcohol and drug dependence on the accused's brain and his consumption of alcohol and drugs on the day before and the day of the deceased's death, must be taken into account:

1. In determining whether the accused believed that his conduct was necessary to defend Lockett, and
2. In determining the circumstances as the accused perceived them to be.

24However, evidence of the accused self-induced intoxication is not to be taken into account in determining whether the accused's response to those circumstances was reasonable. A jury would be instructed that they are to consider what would have been a reasonable response by a sober person in the circumstances as the accused drunkenly perceived them.

25Juries have for many years been required to deal with issues arising from self-induced intoxication by alcohol and drugs and clear directions have been crafted to ensure that the jury understands its task. I do not consider that there is a real risk that the jury will not follow the Court's directions on defence of another or misapply them.

26Another matter that the accused raises is that a jury will experience difficulties in following the Court's directions in respect of the first essential legal element of joint criminal enterprise manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. It was submitted that a jury would be directed that they cannot take into account evidence of the accused's intoxication at the time of the alleged offence but would be obliged to consider evidence of his impaired cognitive capacity, which at least in part is a consequence of his long term drug and alcohol abuse. It is submitted that these are contradictory directions, which a jury will find hard to apply.

27The first essential legal element that the Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt is that the accused was party to a joint criminal enterprise, (an agreement) to assault the deceased, that is to apply physical force to the deceased's body without his consent and the accused understood that by the application of that physical force the deceased would be exposed to an appreciable risk of serious injury: TWL v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 57 at [36].

28Section 428D of the Crimes Act prohibits evidence of the accused's self-induced intoxication at the time of the offence being taken into account in determining whether the accused was a party to the agreement and whether he understood that by the application of that physical force the deceased would be exposed to an appreciable risk of serious injury. However, evidence of his impaired cognitive capacity and long term drug and alcohol abuse may be taken into account.

29As I have previously stated, juries have dealt with issues arising from self-induced intoxication for many years and I do not consider that a jury will have difficulty following the Court's directions on the first essential legal element that the Crown must prove.

30Another concern was that as a result of the accused's cognitive difficulties his evidence will be difficult to elicit and for the jury to understand. I have had the benefit of seeing and hearing the accused in the witness box when he gave evidence before me during the proceedings on sentence. I did not have any difficulty understanding the evidence given by the accused. I do not consider that a jury will not be able to understand his evidence.

31For these reasons I do not propose to make a trial by judge alone order as I do not consider it is in the interests of justice to do so.

32Accordingly, I make the following orders. 

1. Leave is granted to make the application out of time. 

2. The notice of motion is dismissed.

		15 May 2014",2014-04-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705181,Application by FB pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 485,"Judgment

1The applicant was convicted of an offence of aggravated sexual assault under s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The maximum penalty for that offence was 20 years imprisonment. The standard non-parole period was 10 years (see s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)). In November 2010, Lakatos DCJ sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment of 6 years, 6 months, with a non-parole period of 4 years. An appeal against conviction was dismissed, but a Crown appeal on sentence was allowed, with the result that the applicant was re-sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 years and a non-parole period of 6 years (see FB v Regina; Regina v FB [2011] NSWCCA 217). He is eligible for release on 8 August 2015.

2The applicant seeks a review of that sentence under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). He requests that his case be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal as an appeal against sentence, under s 79(1)(b) of that Act. The basis for the application is error in the Court of Criminal Appeal's sentencing decision of the kind discussed in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [26] - [27].

3Submissions have been made both by the applicant and by the New South Wales Attorney General. The Attorney General submitted that Muldrock substantially changed the way a sentencing court is to apply the provisions of Part 4, Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, with a standard non-parole period no longer being a dominant factor in sentencing. The Attorney General conceded that in the result, a fair reading of the appeal judgment established that the decision to allow the Crown appeal was made on the application of erroneous legal principle. The Attorney General accepted that the circumstances were such that the application ought to be granted, there being no discretionary reasons for its refusal.

4The applicant's circumstances are briefly that he was convicted of having penile/vaginal intercourse with a 14 year old, year 8 student of a school of which he was Principal, after giving her two tablets, while she was staying at his family home. She later awoke to find him having intercourse with her.

5At the time of sentencing the applicant was already serving a custodial sentence for other sexual intercourse offences. This offence had occurred earlier in time. It was found by the sentencing judge to have fallen just below the mid-range of objective seriousness. The sentence imposed was made concurrent with the sentence already being served.

6The grounds of appeal pressed by the Crown were that the sentence did not adequately reflect the objective seriousness of the offence, given the finding that it fell just below the middle range of objective seriousness and that it was manifestly inadequate.

7The sentence was found to be manifestly inadequate. As to the standard non-parole period it was observed at [150] - [154]:
150 It is plainly the position, the respondent having been found guilty after trial, that the standard non-parole period had direct application by force of statute. It was not merely there to serve as a guidepost on sentence in the situation where a plea of guilty has been entered (R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at 184 [68]). The sentencing judge was obliged to have regard to both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period (R v Achurch [2011] NSWCCA 186 per Garling J at [180]). 

151 In the present matter, the sentencing judge concluded that the objective gravity of the offence fell ""just below the mid range of objective seriousness"". Although perhaps somewhat generous to the respondent, there was no challenge by the Crown to this finding. 

152 The real question arising on the Crown appeal is whether there was any justification, in the findings his Honour made in relation to subjective circumstances or otherwise, that would permit the imposition of a non-parole period of no more than four years. The standard period for this offence if it were in the mid-range of objective seriousness was 10 years. In my opinion, with all due respect to the sentencing judge, I have been forced to conclude that his Honour's reasoning fails to justify such a substantial departure from the standard non-parole period. 

153 First, it may be observed that the non-parole period imposed is only 40 per cent of the standard non-parole period. Secondly, the overall term of the sentence was 6 years, a sentence itself well below the standard non-parole period. Each of these factors in itself is sufficient, in my opinion, to suggest or point strongly to error, unless the apparent discrepancy can be explained by the respondent's subjective circumstances, or by some other matter. 

154 However, there is nothing in those subjective circumstances, or elsewhere in the sentencing material, that would warrant such a substantial departure from the standard non-parole period. The respondent was entitled to have the sentencing court take into account his depressive state and the judge did so. However, this circumstance could not, in the present matter, possibly outweigh or undermine the objective seriousness of the offence. As the courts have repeatedly stated in this context, ill health cannot be allowed to become a licence to commit crime, nor should offenders expect to escape punishment because of the condition of their health. Of course, it will be the responsibility of the Correctional Service authorities to provide appropriate care and treatment for prisoners with illness and disabilities (R v Vachalec (1981) 1 NSWLR 351 at 353 - 354). This factor could not have explained the selection of a four year non-parole period. 


8The parties' agreement that these observations reveal Muldrock error must be accepted, it having there been concluded that R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 was wrongly decided. An approach to sentencing such as here, followed by a consideration as to whether a ""departure from the standard non-parole period"" was warranted, was not available as a matter of law. 

9Section 79(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act permits an application such as this to be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal only if ""there is a doubt or question as to ...any mitigating circumstances in the case"". The term ""mitigating circumstances"" is not defined. In Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383 it was concluded that a Muldrock error such as here occurred, can constitute a relevant ""mitigating circumstance"". In the result it was ordered that:
""[79] The form of the declaration should take account of the fact that Latham J was persuaded that the sentencing judge and Court of Criminal Appeal had applied sentencing principles which should not have been applied in the light of the High Court's judgment in Muldrock: at [9]. Both courts approached the sentencing exercise on an erroneous view of the law. That was an error capable of giving rise to a doubt or question as to the correctness of the sentence imposed. The court should make a declaration in the following terms:

Declare that an error of law on the part of the sentencing judge and, on appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal, which may have caused a sentence to be imposed of greater severity than would otherwise have been the case, constitutes an aspect of the proceedings giving rise to the sentence which may form the basis of a doubt or question as to circumstances having the potential to mitigate the sentence imposed, for the purpose of considering an application for an inquiry under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).


10If such a situation is established, the whole case is referred to be dealt with as an appeal, including all questions of fact and law involved (see Mallard v R [2005] HCA 68; 224 CLR 125 at [10] - [13]).

Conclusion

11In the result I am satisfied that there is sufficient evidence of Muldrock error in this case to justify the referral of the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The common position of the applicant and the Attorney General that the Court of Appeal's reliance on R v Way has sufficiently infected the sentence imposed that the Court must now intervene by granting this application, should be accepted as raising the sense of disquiet necessary to be established, before a reference under s 79 is made (see Application of Peter James Holland under s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2008] NSWSC 251 at [6]).

12The Crown raised the question of whether before such a reference, an inquiry should be held under s 79(1)(a). The result of such an inquiry may also lead to a referral of the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal under s 82(2). 

13This is not a case where the applicant seeks to rely on new evidence, but rather where the application of sentencing principles arises for consideration. Despite conceding the Muldrock error, the Crown does not concede that the sentence imposed on appeal was inappropriate. Given that there is no issue as to the nature of the error here in question, in my view the application should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to determine whether the Muldrock error affected the sentence imposed on the applicant as the result of the Crown appeal. 

14In the circumstances, that is a matter which must be determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal and does not require prior investigation under s 79(1)(a).

15The application is accordingly granted and the matter referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act.

2705193,Sokolowskyj v Regina [2014] NSWCCA 55,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL:
Offence and sentence
The appellant was committed for trial to the District Court sitting at Gosford on one count of assault with an act of indecency upon a person under the age of 10, contrary to s61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. On arraignment the appellant pleaded not guilty and his matter was listed for trial at the Gosford District Court on Monday, 20 February 2012.

2On Thursday, 16 February 2012 the trial date was vacated as the mother of the complainant had gone into premature labour. On 16 January 2012 the Crown served the defence with a Notice of Tendency Evidence. After the trial date was vacated, the pre-trial tendency argument was listed for Tuesday, 21 February 2012. The Crown served a fresh tendency notice on 21 February.

3On 21 February the matter proceeded before Ellis DCJ. His Honour gave judgment on 22 February 2012 allowing the Crown to rely upon the tendency evidence. The tendency relied upon by the Crown was that ""the accused had a tendency at the relevant time to have sexual urges and to act on them in public in circumstances where there was a reasonable likelihood of detection"". His Honour found that this tendency was established by the appellant's convictions in 2000, 2001 and 2003.

4The trial commenced on 30 July 2012 and closing addresses were made on 2 August 2012. His Honour's summing up commenced on 2 August and concluded on 3 August 2012. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on that same day.

5The issue at trial was whether the offence had occurred. The appellant denied committing the offence in an interview with the police on arrest. The appellant did not give evidence or call evidence at trial.

6On 9 November 2012 the appellant was sentenced by Judge Ellis to a term of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months, commencing 9 November 2012 and expiring 8 May 2015 with a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months expiring 8 February 2014. There was a direction that he be released to parole on that date.

7The appellant has appealed against his conviction. There is no appeal in respect of the sentence.

8The grounds of appeal are as follows:

Ground 1 - The trial judge erred in ruling admissible the evidence relied on by the Crown as tendency evidence.

Ground 2 - The admission of the tendency evidence resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

Crown case

9The Crown case may be summarised as follows. Between 28 August 2008 and 6 May 2009 the appellant and his girlfriend, Ms Van Hout, took the complainant shopping at Westfield Tuggerah. While they were there, Ms Van Hout went into the ladies toilet. The appellant then took the complainant (aged 8 years at the time) into the parents' room, pulled down her pants and underwear and touched her vagina. He threatened her and told her not to tell anyone. Tendency evidence was tendered through the officer in charge of the investigation that showed that the appellant had a tendency to act on his sexual urges, when he was in public, when there was a reasonable likelihood of detection. This was done by way of agreed facts (exhibit J).

10The complainant's recorded interview with the police, dated 24 June 2010, was played to the jury and the jury saw copies of the transcript of the interview. The complainant told the police that she had accompanied her mother's friend, Missy, to the shops at Tuggerah. While they were there, Missy went into the toilet. While they were waiting for Missy, the appellant pulled her down a hallway and into the toilet and touched her ""rude part"". He told her not to tell anyone and said that he would do something to her mum, her house or her car if she did. 

11The complainant was wearing jeans, a t-shirt, underwear and a jumper. She demonstrated on a diagram that the appellant touched her vagina. He pulled down her jeans and underwear and then touched her with his finger ""underneath her undies"". It happened for a short time. She was lying down on the chair and the appellant was standing up. The complainant said ""stop it, I don't like it"" and he said ""make me"". The appellant then unlatched the door and she ran out. She found Missy and they all went to the bottle shop and then they went back to the car and drove to her house.

12The complainant said that she did not speak about what had happened to anyone because she thought that it would start an argument. A few months before the police interview, the complainant told a neighbour, JH, about what had happened. JH then told the complainant's mother. The complainant subsequently told her father and her grandparents.

13The complainant's mother confirmed that on one Saturday morning, her friend Missy and the appellant visited the family house. That was sometime after the complainant's eighth birthday in August 2008. They came back about 1 - 1½ hours later. The family moved to Ourimbah in May 2009 and the complainant changed to a new school. 

14On 31 March 2010 a neighbour, who was looking after the complainant, told the complainant's mother when she arrived home that the complainant needed to tell her something. As a result the complainant's mother rang her husband and told him what the complainant had said. Her husband took the complainant to the police station. This was the first time that the complainant had said anything about the incident.

15Ms Van Hout recalled an occasion when accompanied by the appellant she went to the shops at Tuggerah and the complainant asked if she could come along. They went to Target and then Ms Van Hout needed to go to the toilet. She left the appellant and the complainant in between the shops by a laneway while she went inside. She was in the toilet for about 5 minutes. When she came out they were not where she left them - they were then at the entrance to the women's toilets which was about 5 metres from where she had left them. She did not notice anything unusual about the complainant or the appellant. They all then returned home.

16Exhibit J was in the following form:

""AGREED FACTS PURSUANT TO SECTION 191 EVIDENCE ACT 1995

For the purposes of these criminal proceedings, the abovenamed Accused upon the advice of his lawyer and the Crown have agreed upon the following facts pursuant to section 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW):

1. On 24 March 2000 a 15 year old girl was walking her dog along Koolang Road, Greenpoint near the Community Centre. The accused was standing near his motor vehicle having a cigarette. As the girl walked past the accused he pulled down the front of his tracksuit pants and exposed his penis to the girl.

2. On 2 May 2001 the accused was seen standing next to his motor vehicle parked about 10-15 metres away from the main entrance to the Gladesville Fitness Centre. At the time he was seen to have his fly to his trousers down and was masturbating his penis for about 30 seconds. At the time the accused was seen by a young female member of the gym and two female and one male employee.

3. On 16 September 2003 at about 6.15pm the accused was parked along a grass strip beside Townview Road, Mt Pritchard. His passenger side window was wound down. He had a sudden urge to masturbate, so he pulled down his tracksuit pants whilst still sitting in the driver's seat and started masturbating. At this time a 21 year old female who was walking her dog approached the vehicle. As she approached the vehicle the accused turned on the interior light. The female saw the accused was masturbating as she walked past the vehicle.""

Defence case

17The appellant denied that he touched the complainant's vagina. He could not remember taking her to Westfield. He argued that the complainant's evidence was inconsistent and unreliable.

18The appellant participated in a recorded interview with the police on 10 March 2011. In the interview he agreed that he knew the complainant and her parents. He used to work with her father at a carwash and lived with the family for a few months in their house in Wyoming. He said that he had never babysat the complainant, cuddled her or even taken her to the bathroom. 

19He agreed that he had a sexual problem ""years ago"" when he exposed himself to women and was caught masturbating in public, but he did not have the urges anymore and had not had the urges since 2003. 

20He said that it was not true that he dragged the complainant into the parent's room and rubbed her vagina. He was adamant that it never happened. He said that ""I've never seen that corridor and I've never been in that corridor with [the complainant] and I don't recall the inside, most of all of any parent's room"". He did not recall travelling with Ms Van Hout and the complainant in his red Corolla to Westfield Tuggerah.

21In relation to the offence, the appellant said:

""It makes me sick, angry and I don't even know how to explain it half the time because it's that distressing. I don't know how anybody could do it, let alone to a child, to anybody. Like I said to you, I've made stupid mistakes when it comes to indecent exposure and I hold that and I'll honestly put that on the table and I take full blame that I was an idiot. I was an idiot and I was foolish and there's many other words that go along with that but this, yuck, no, no it's not me, no way. No, not [the complainant], not to any kid, I would not do it.""

Decision of Ellis DCJ to allow Crown to lead tendency evidence

22His Honour identified as a threshold question whether the tendency evidence was relevant pursuant to s55 of the Evidence Act 1995 (the Act), i.e. ""could it rationally affect, directly or indirectly, the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue"".

23His Honour next referred to the authorities as to what constituted ""tendency evidence"". In that context, his Honour had regard to the provisions of s97(1)(b) and s101(2) of the Act to the effect that the tendency evidence must have significant probative value and its probative value must substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect. His Honour reviewed the authorities on the meaning of the terms ""significant probative value"" and ""prejudicial effect"".

24His Honour identified the function which he had to perform as:

""In summary this statutory regime, as set out in sections 97 through to and including 101 requires a court to conclude that the evidence either by itself or having regard to other evidence to be adduced has significant probative value. Further, s 101(2) requires a balancing process between probative force and prejudicial effect during which the court must make a judgment that probative value substantially outweighs prejudicial effect. There is little guidance as to the meaning of ""substantial"" but the Macquarie dictionary definition includes ""real or actual, of ample or considerable amount and of real worth or value"".

In the event that the court is satisfied that the proposed evidence has significant probative value and that that probative force substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused the court must still consider whether it is appropriate to limit the use made of such evidence pursuant to s 136 or whether the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused pursuant to s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995."" (Interlocutory judgment 4.3)

25His Honour reviewed some of the authorities relating to ""unfair prejudice"" in s137 and noted that the ""danger of unfair prejudice is lowered if clear and strong directions are given to the jury identifying the dangers and how the evidence can and cannot be used both generally and in the context of the particular case"" (interlocutory judgment 5.4).

26His Honour referred to the observations of Simpson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL agreed) in R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338 where her Honour said that a consideration of the admissibility of tendency evidence is a ""predictive and evaluative"" exercise, that it is a value decision upon which reasonable minds might differ and it is based upon information available to the court at the time the decision is made.

27His Honour set out the five steps identified by Simpson J in Fletcher as follows:

(i) The court must determine whether the tendency is ""capable of being ascribed probative value"".

(ii) The court must determine the extent to which the evidence has the capacity to affect the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.

(iii) The court must assess and predict the probative value a tribunal of fact might ascribe to the evidence, i.e. the capacity of the evidence to have the effect specified.

(iv) The court must refuse to admit the evidence if it concludes that the evidence either alone or in conjunction with other evidence, would not have significance (in the sense of important but not necessarily substantial) probative value.

(v) The court must determine whether the probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused.

28His Honour took as a guide the observation of Whealy JA (with whom Buddin and Harrison JJ agreed) in FB v Regina; Regina v FB [2011] NSWCCA 217 at [24] where his Honour said:

""24 More often than not, in a criminal trial, tendency evidence is placed before the jury as evidence tending to prove the guilt of the accused. However, evidence may be offered simply to show a tendency to act in a particular way, not necessarily in a criminal manner. Indeed, it is not necessary that the tendency [is] to commit a particular crime or, for that matter, to commit a crime at all. Section 97 applies to both civil and criminal proceedings. It represents a fresh start in relation to the issues involved in the categories of evidence known historically as propensity evidence and similar fact evidence. To assess whether evidence is capable of being admitted as tendency evidence, it is first necessary to consider the issues at trial, and the likely probative force of the evidence, having regard to those issues (Pfennig v R (1995) 182 CLR 461).""

29His Honour noted that the evidence of previous conduct upon which the Crown relied to establish a tendency was not in dispute. His Honour noted that although the Crown submission was that this material would lead a jury to conclude that the accused had a tendency at the relevant time ""to have sexual urges and to act on them in public in circumstances where there was a reasonable likelihood of detection"", the Crown did not submit that the previous conduct could establish that the accused had a tendency to indecently assault prepubescent girls. The Crown submitted that this tendency evidence was strongly supportive of the Crown case and that it bolstered the evidence of the complainant. The Crown submitted that it did so because if the accused had such a tendency, the evidence effectively negatived the likely criticism of the circumstances alleged by the complainant on the basis that they were so unlikely or unbelievable that they should not be accepted. 

30By reference to the Crown case, his Honour said:

""Based on these allegations it is clear that the circumstances were that there was a limited opportunity and that it was in a public place making detection reasonably likely had the complainant screamed or complained. If the Crown established that the accused had a tendency to act on sexual urges in public when detection was reasonably possible then that is relevant to whether he acted in that way on the day in question and indecently assaulted the complainant as she alleges.

The Crown acknowledges that on the complainant's version, absent the tendency material, there is a strong argument available to the defence that the complainant's version is so unlikely as to be untrue or at least unbelievable to the requisite standard. This defence argument, it is said, would be based on the proposition that no sane person would indecently assault an eight year old girl in such circumstance, namely in public with a huge risk of detection, even if the child did not protest or do anything to attract attention."" (Interlocutory judgment, 9.6)

31Against that background, his Honour summarised the probative value of the tendency evidence in this way:

""It is in the context of this strong anti-Crown credibility argument that the Crown says the probative value of the proposed tendency evidence should be considered or assessed. It is said that if it were established that the accused had a tendency to act out his sexual urges, even in public places and even when detection was the reasonably likely outcome then the circumstances as alleged by the complainant would no longer be unbelievable. That is, her credibility would no longer be undermined by a defence argument that it was so unlikely as to unbelievable. His tendency to act in that manner would be capable of supporting the complainant's allegation."" (Interlocutory judgment, 10.4)

32In relation to the possible prejudicial effect, his Honour said:

""The Crown acknowledges that without direction a jury might misuse the tendency evidence by using it to prove that he has a tendency to indecently assault young girls. By concluding that he has been a sexual deviant in the past so must have committed the alleged offence. By responding in an emotional manner which would make it impossible for them to act objectively and fairly in their assessment of the evidence.

However, the Crown submits that any and all possible prejudice can be remedied by appropriate jury directions. The Crown relies on cases such as R v Ford, R v DAO and R v Smith to establish that juries will follow direction and that even where tendency is strong and precisely the same as alleged in the trial, directions that clearly establish what can and cannot be made of the tendency evidence can dissipate any prejudicial effect."" (Interlocutory judgment, 11.5)

33His Honour set out his conclusion as follows:

""The tendency evidence the Crown seeks to lead before the jury is capable of being ascribed probative value as it has the capacity to affect the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. I am of the view that the evidence has significant probative value. Having regard to the judicial directions that will be given its probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect."" (Interlocutory judgment 12.5)

Consideration

34The admissibility of the tendency evidence is relevantly governed by the following sections of the Act: 

""97 The tendency rule

(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind unless:

(a) the party seeking to adduce the evidence gave reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence, and

(b) the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.

...

101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution

(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98.

(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.

...

137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings

In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.

35The dictionary to the Act includes:

""Probative value of evidence"" means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.

36Before this Court the parties accepted that the ""tendency evidence"" was relevant in accordance with the provisions of s55 of the Act. They also accepted that the ""tendency evidence"" did fit the description of such evidence in s97 in that it was evidence of the character or conduct or tendency of a person which was capable of establishing that a person had a tendency to act in a particular way. The issue between the parties was whether the evidence was capable, either by itself or by reference to other evidence, of having significant probative value and whether that probative value would substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect the evidence might have. It was also accepted by the parties that for the tendency to have ""probative value"" there was no need for the tendency to be to commit acts closely similar to those that constituted the crime charged (R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306 at [43] (Campbell JA with whom Howie and Rothman JJ agreed)).

37In Regina v Linard Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228 Spigelman CJ (with whom Simpson and Adams JJ agreed) said in relation to the definition of ""probative value"":

""61 In my opinion, the critical word in this regard is the word could in the definition of probative value as set out above, namely, ""the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment ..."". The focus on capability draws attention to what it is open for the tribunal of fact to conclude. It does not direct attention to what a tribunal of fact is likely to conclude. Evidence has ""probative value"", as defined, if it is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty.

62 This conclusion is reinforced by the test that evidence must ""rationally affect"" the assessment. As Gaudron J emphasised in Adam, a ""test"" of 'rationality' also directs attention to capability rather than weight."" (See also R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121; 84 NSWLR 363 Basten JA; Hoeben CJ at CL and Simpson J)

38As was set out by the trial judge, the probative value of the tendency evidence in this case, according to the Crown, was its capacity to effectively negative the very real criticism that the circumstances of the offence as alleged by the complainant were so unlikely or unbelievable as to leave a jury unable to accept her evidence. I do not understand the appellant to submit that the tendency evidence had no probative value. 

39An issue in the appeal was whether the tendency evidence had ""significant probative value"". In R v Ford Campbell JA said:

""50 The test for whether evidence not only has probative value, but also ""significant probative value"" was described by Lehane J in Zaknic Pty Ltd v Svelte Corporation Pty Ltd (1995) 61 FCR 171 at 175-6. His Honour said that relevance was not enough, but rather it must be shown that the evidence ""could rationally effect the assessment of the probability of the relevant fact in issue to a significant extent; ie, more is required than mere statutory relevance.

51 Similarly, in R v Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457 at 459 Hunt CJ at CL noted that the terms of the definition of ""probative value"" are substantially similar to those of the definition of ""relevance"" in the Act, and said:

""... the probative value of evidence is the degree of its relevance to the particular fact in issue. There is no definition of 'significant' probative value as that phrase is used in s 97. In its context as I have outlined it, however, 'significant' probative value must mean something more than mere relevance but something less than a 'substantial' degree of relevance ... One of the primary meanings of the adjective 'significant' is 'important', or 'of consequence'. In my opinion, that is the sense in which it is used in s 97. To some extent, it seems to me, the significance of the probative value of the tendency evidence ... must depend upon the nature of the fact in issue to which it is relevant and to the significance (or importance) which that evidence may have in establishing that fact.""

Hunt CJ at CL in substance repeated that analysis in R v Lock (1997) 91 A Crim R 356 at 360-1.

52 For a judge to decide that evidence has ""significant probative value"" is, like the decision about whether the evidence has ""probative value"" at all, a decision about the reasoning processes that are open to a jury.

53 It has previously been observed that the generality with which a tendency is stated may be such that it provides a handicap to that evidence having ""significant probative value"": Townsend v Townsend [2001] NSWCA 136 at [78] per Giles JA (with whom Hodgson JA agreed); Ibrahim v Pham [2007] NSWCA 215 at [264] per Campbell JA (with whom Hodgson and Santow JJA agreed).""

40One of the difficulties for the Crown in establishing ""significant probative value"" was the high level of generality of the tendency relied upon. A tendency to have sexual urges was so general as to be meaningless. The additional qualification to that tendency, i.e. to have sexual urges and to act on them in public circumstances where there was a reasonable likelihood of detection, refined the concept but not greatly. Its generality was such as to attract the criticism made by Giles JA in Townsend v Townsend [2001] NSWCA 136 at [78] where his Honour said: 

""78 Assuming that the evidence was tendency evidence, it was admissible unless his Honour considered that it would not have significant probative value. His Honour considered that it did have significant probative value, although with a qualification which tended to cast doubt on that status. I am inclined to the view, still assuming that it was tendency evidence, that the evidence should have been rejected as not having significant probative value. So far as appeared, the circumstances of the respondent's conduct towards Mrs Townsend were very different from the circumstances in which the incident between the appellant and the respondent took place; certainly the evidence was of such generality that little meaningful tendency was established.""

41Another difficulty for the Crown in establishing significant probative value for the tendency evidence was the marked dissimilarity between the conduct relied upon to establish the tendency and the offence under consideration by the jury. On the Crown case, key elements of the offence were a prepubescent victim and no public exhibition. The appellant is said to have latched the door to the change room (inferentially to achieve privacy) and then to have assaulted the complainant. The actions on which the tendency evidence was based had as their hallmark a public display with no prepubescent element in the victim. There was no active assault, rather the appellant's actions were ""passive"". Far from seeking to conceal his actions, the gist or thrill of the offences was the fact that they could be seen and were intended to be seen.

42In DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63 Simpson J (with whom Kirby and Schmidt JJ agreed) said in relation to that issue:

""180 ... Similarity or dissimilarity in the nature of the conduct alleged is relevant to the assessment of both whether the evidence has probative value, and, if so, whether it is significant. If the evidence has significant probative value (and, in a criminal case, subject to s 101) it is admissible.""

43I have concluded that the tendency evidence in this case did not reach the standard required for it to have ""significant probative value"". There is a large qualitative distinction between on the one hand offences of exhibitionism, involving either public masturbation or exposure of one's genitals, and on the other, engaging in non-consensual, physical contact with the genitals of an underage complainant. In relation to the actions on which the tendency evidence was based, public display was an essential ingredient and the sexual gratification or thrill was apparently achieved by such public exposure of his genitals to women. The offence under consideration was very different. The appellant is said to have taken steps to prevent discovery by latching the change room door and by warning the complainant not to tell anyone, otherwise he would take retributive action against her family.

44The flaw in the Crown case in support of the admission of the tendency evidence was that it failed to have regard to the fact that the evidence only had probative value if it increased the probability that the appellant committed the offence of indecently assaulting the complainant. In assessing the extent of the probative value of the evidence, the focus had to be on the fact in issue to which the evidence was said to logically relate. In that context, it was an error to generalise the conduct said to constitute the alleged offence in a way which removed the elements that made up the offence. In this case, the focus of the prosecution was on generalised sexual activity, which involved neither an assault nor a child. The focus of the tendency evidence should have been on the logical link to the elements of the offence charged, in this case involving both an assault and a child victim. The question was whether the evidence had ""significant probative value"" to prove the offence charged, i.e. indecently assaulting a young girl.

45It follows that the tendency evidence did not satisfy the requirements of s97(1)(b) of the Act. That is sufficient to resolve the appeal.

46To the extent that there was any doubt on that issue, it is resolved by the application of s101(2). I have concluded that the probative value of the tendency evidence did not substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect it might have on the appellant.

47The concept of ""prejudicial effect"" is understood in substantially the same way as ""unfair prejudice"". ""Unfair prejudice"" is used in s137, albeit with an emphasis on the way that the evidence ""may"" rather than necessarily will, impact adversely on a defendant.

48In the present case, one of the dangers of unfair prejudice was that the jury would use the evidence in the way they were directed not to use it - to show that the appellant was a sexual deviant who, as a result, was the sort of person who was likely to have committed the offence alleged against him. A second danger was that the jury would be so emotionally affected by the evidence that they would disregard the appellant's account in his police interview and disregard the directions to assess the evidence in an unemotional manner. A third danger was that the jury might be disinclined to give the appellant the benefit of any reasonable doubt.

49The danger of unfair prejudice has been variously described in the cases. In R v Watkins [2005] NSWCCA 164; 153 A Crim R 434 Barr J at [49] said:

""50 ... a real danger that the jury's recognition of the appellant's prior guilt was likely to divert them from a proper consideration of the evidence as bearing on the question of his intent in the charges before them."" 

50In R v GAC [2007] NSWCCA 315; 178 A Crim R 408 Giles JA said at [83] that the primary danger was that, notwithstanding any directions given by the trial judge, ""the jury might reason no more rationally than that, if the respondent molested [two other persons], he did the same to the complainant, and that emotion not rationality would govern"".

51Another difficulty for the Crown in seeking to uphold the admission of the tendency evidence was that his Honour did not carry out the weighing exercise required by s101 of the Act. While he clearly considered the question of ""probative value"", he did not consider the essential question required by s97(1)(b) of whether the probative value of the tendency evidence was ""significant"".

52That error was compounded when his Honour came to consider the s101 question in that there was no attempt to assess the prejudicial effect of the tendency evidence and to balance that against its probative value. What his Honour did was to assume that a judicial direction to the jury designed to minimise the risk of unfair prejudice would be completely effective. He did that without ever having assessed the risk of unfair prejudice.

53This approach involved two errors of principle. The first and most obvious was a failure to carry out the weighing exercise required by s101. The second was of the kind identified by Giles JA (with whom Hulme and Hislop JJ agreed) in R v GAC where his Honour said:

""87 The Crown further submitted that the judge was in error in not proceeding on the assumption that, if appropriate directions were given, the jury would act in accordance with the direction. It referred to McHugh J's emphasis in Gilbert v The Queen [2000] 201 CLR 414; 109 A Crim R 580 at [31] - [32] that the fundamental assumption of a criminal trial is that the jury acts on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge. Prejudicial effect, however, is to be evaluated without such a foreclosing assumption, and his Honour's remarks were not directed to the present situation. 

...

89 It was well open to the trial judge to see a real risk of unfair misuse of the tendency evidence, and to conclude that directions could not be given which would satisfactorily prevent it. ....""

54In Qualtieri v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 95; 171 A Crim R 463 McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Howie and Latham JJ agreed) said at [80] that ""prior illegal acts by the accused, especially where the charges relate to alleged sexual acts ... would inevitably be prejudicial"". In DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272; 200 A Crim R 206 (which involved evidence of uncharged acts of child sexual abuse) McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Hidden and Fullerton JJ agreed) said at [31]:

""31 ... The risk in a particular case of an impermissible course of reasoning by the jury which cannot be averted by directions must be a consideration when determining whether the evidence should be admitted.""

55In Patel v The Queen [2012] HCA 29; 247 CLR 531 the plurality (French CJ, Hayne, Kiefel and Bell JJ) said:

""113 Despite the fact that the trial judge gave careful and succinct directions as to some of the most prejudicial evidence, such as evidence of errors in surgery, it cannot be concluded that the directions were sufficient to overcome the prejudicial effects of the evidence, individually and collectively, upon the jury. The misgivings his Honour recorded in his ruling on the application to discharge the jury were well-founded.

...

128 ... In the present case, no weight can be given to the verdicts of guilty for the reason that so much irrelevant or unnecessary and prejudicial evidence was before the jury. The miscarriage of justice was grounded in the nature, significance and extent of the evidence to which the jury had been exposed. It would be expecting too much of a jury to attend to its task of determining the appellant's guilt on the four charges on the basis only of the appellant's judgment about whether to operate, putting to one side all that it had seen and heard concerning his competencies in other areas and his deficiencies as a person.

...

129 ... However, any consideration of the effect upon the jury's ability to undertake its now more confined task must take account of the evidence as a whole. The sheer extent of the prejudicial evidence in the context of a wide-ranging prosecution case is likely to have overwhelmed the jury. The jurors were not given directions that they must exclude much of it from their minds. In practical terms any such directions would have been useless.""

56A further consideration is this. An assumption that a judicial direction to the jury designed to minimise the risk of unfair prejudice will be completely effective would effectively prevent s101(2) operating as a safeguard against the potential risk of miscarriages of justice arising from the admission of tendency evidence. In the present case there was a real risk that, notwithstanding directions to the jury, the jury would see the appellant as a sexual deviant who had no credibility in denying the allegation against him, was not deserving of the benefit of any reasonable doubt and was the sort of person who was likely to have committed the offence alleged against him. 

57Members of the jury might have so proceeded subconsciously, even accepting that they would have tried to follow the directions given to them. Had his Honour carried out the weighing exercise required by s101, he should have concluded that the probative value of the evidence was not high and that it was substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. In that regard, the observations of McHugh J in Pfennig v R [1995] HCA 7; 182 CLR 461 at 528 - 529 are pertinent:

""39 ... the proposition that the probative value of the
evidence must outweigh its prejudicial effect is one that can be
easily misunderstood. The use of the term ""outweigh"" suggests an
almost arithmetical computation. But prejudicial effect and probative value are incommensurables. They have no standard of comparison. The probative value of the evidence goes to proof of an issue, the prejudicial effect to the fairness of the trial. ... If there is a real risk that the admission of such evidence may prejudice the fair trial of the criminal charge before the court, the interests of justice require the trial judge to make a value judgment, not a mathematical calculation. The judge must compare the probative strength of the evidence with the degree of risk of an unfair trial if the evidence is admitted. Admitting the evidence will serve the interests of justice only if the judge concludes that the probative force of the evidence compared to the degree of risk of an unfair trial is such that fair minded people would think that the public interest in adducing all relevant evidence of guilt must have priority over the risk of an unfair trial.""

58An issue arose in the appeal as to whether there should be an adjournment and a bench of five constituted to consider the related question of what test should be applied when an appellate court reviews the application of ss97 and 101 of the Act. In his submissions in reply, the appellant had identified the difference of opinion in this Court most recently referred to by Simpson J in DAO v R in relation to its approach to those sections on appeal. One line of opinion was that decisions under those sections were discretionary decisions and accordingly there should only be appellate intervention if a House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 error could be identified. The other line of authority was that the test for appellate review is that stated in Warren v Coombs [1979] HCA 9; 142 CLR 531.

59The Court refused the application. It did so because this matter was not an appropriate vehicle for such an analysis. The basis for that conclusion was that the error in the trial judge's approach in failing to weigh the probative value and unfair prejudice, and in assuming without analysis that directions to the jury would be capable of eliminating unfair prejudice, constituted a House v The King error. In those circumstances, the higher test was satisfied so that this Court could re-exercise his Honour's discretion in relation to ss 97 and 101 in any event.

60The error in admitting the tendency evidence was such that injustice has resulted and the appellant's conviction must be quashed.

61The orders which I propose are:

(1) The appeal is allowed.
(2) The appellant's conviction on 3 August 2012 is quashed.
(3) There should be a new trial.

62Since the appellant has already served the non-parole portion of his sentence of imprisonment, it is a matter for the prosecuting authority as to whether it wishes to undertake a new trial.

63ADAMS J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

64HALL J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2705199,Williams v R [2014] NSWCCA 57,"Judgment
1WARD JA:  I agree with RS Hulme AJ
2JOHNSON J: I agree with RS Hulme AJ
3RS HULME AJ:   On 11 September 2012 this Applicant for leave to appeal was sentenced by Wells SC DCJ to imprisonment for 6 years, including a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months, in respect of an offence of supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine.  
4The offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment and is one for which a standard non-parole period of 10 years' imprisonment has been prescribed.  The Applicant pleaded guilty and was awarded a discount of 40%, being 25% for his plea and the balance for what her Honour described as extensive assistance resulting in some danger to himself.
5The offence was constituted by the Applicant selling to an undercover police officer at the Rose Bay Hotel on 6 occasions between 18 March 2010 and 1 July 2010 a total of some 392.7 gm of cocaine worth $107,000.  Following the Applicant's arrest, police executed a search warrant at his premises, finding there or in his car, inter alia:-
a further 144.5 gm of cocaine594.9 gm of cannabissmall quantities of other drugs being methylamphetamine, ketamine and cannabis resintwo sets of scales and numerous small plastic resealable bags$23,000
6These items were the subject of charges placed on a Form 1.
7The Applicant gave evidence which appears to have been accepted by the Crown and her Honour that he had been selling the cocaine as a favour for a friend, his reward being allowed for his personal use a small proportion of the cocaine supplied to him.  Her Honour observed that the Applicant was more than a mere street runner, was trusted to handle substantial quantities of drugs and cash, and his offending occurred over a substantial period. 
8The Applicant was born in October 1954.  He had had a stable upbringing, was a high average student and school captain, completed year 12 and after leaving school completed a 4 year study course.  He played soccer at a professional level from age 16 to age 22.  He had two marriages, two children and two de facto relationships, the last of which ceased in October 2011 leaving the Applicant feeling lonely and depressed.
9He has had a substantial history of enterprise and employment, including some self-employment  in a number of fields for most of his adult life.  In the six years before sentence he was involved in event management and marketing of international celebrity tours and, at least up until March 2012, earning about $1,000 per week.
10The Applicant has been a long-term user of illicit drugs, mainly cocaine and cannabis.  The evidence is not all consistent as to the extent of, particularly the cocaine, use but for most of the time since it commenced in 1980 the Applicant's usage seems to have been substantial, escalating in times of stress such as a car accident in 2006, heart problems in 2007, attempted suicide by his son, three miscarriages suffered by a partner and her consequent emotional problems.  He also has abused alcohol for many years which, combined with his drug use, has led to liver and kidney damage.  
11The July 2006 car accident was significant.  Although his general practitioner had no awareness in this regard, Dr Hardy, a specialist in addiction medicine who commenced to treat the Applicant for his addiction problems in February 2012, diagnosed the Applicant as suffering from frontal lobe damage attributable to alcohol intake and head injuries sustained in the 2006 car accident.  Dr Hardy diagnosed the Applicant as also suffering from a number of other conditions including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  Dr Hardy's report of 7 May 2012 included the following :-
Mr Williams reported to me that the incident which led to his arrest occurred with one person over a number of interactions.  He mistakenly believed that he was helping a friend in a time of need.  Whilst we all accept that the provision of any illicit drug to any individual is harmful, the following points need to be made.  Firstly, Mr Williams had a significant history of low mood, resulting in social contraction, loss of meaningful friendships and an underlying need to help others.   Secondly, his PTSD and frontal lobe syndrome had profoundly affected his judgment, such that he found himself trying to assist a police officer in obtaining cocaine.
12A report from a Dr Hepner, a neuropsychologist to whom the Applicant was referred by Dr Hardy, was also tendered during the sentencing proceedings.  In it Dr Hepner stated - I quote from her Honour's summary that was not the subject of criticism - that there was:- 
... no evidence of impairment to (the Applicant's) current intellectual functioning nor was there impairment to his basic attention, speed of information processing and high level frontal executive functions that include verbal reasoning, social reasoning, verbal generate activity and speed and flexibility of thinking.  She does indicate though that there is some deficit in parts of frontal executive functioning, in particular in the Applicant's ability to adapt and regulate his behaviour when given feedback.""  
13Her Honour recorded Dr Hepner's view that what had been detected in cognitive testing and his self reporting did indicate or was consistent with frontal lobe dysfunction.  
14The Applicant has a small criminal history including possession of cannabis in 1982, three counts of possession and two of administration of a drug in 1987, and in 2000 one count of supplying greater than an indictable quantity of cannabis and another count of supplying a small quantity of some other drug.  On each of these charges a 2 year suspended sentence was ordered.
15Her Honour accepted that the Applicant was remorseful and had made significant efforts to rehabilitate himself, including undergoing weekly drug screening, spending a month in a residential rehabilitation program at Kedesh House and participating in therapy sessions with Dr Hardy.  Her Honour accepted that the Applicant had positive prospects of rehabilitation.
16Her Honour observed that the Applicant had serious mental and physical health problems which would deteriorate with time and found special circumstances in the fact that it was the Applicant's first time in custody and he would need a longer period on parole under supervision.  Earlier, her Honour had accepted that the Applicant's mental condition affected his judgment but only to a limited extent.   She did not accept that the Applicant's judgment was so affected that it substantially reduced his moral culpability.  Her Honour remarked that the Applicant chose not to do anything about his drug problems until after his arrest.  
17The grounds of Appeal are:-
The sentencing judge erred in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending in [finding] that the objective seriousness of the offence was increased by:
(i) taking into account the fact that there were six separate supplies of cocaine to the undercover officer over the relevant period; and
(ii taking into account motivation for financial gain.
18In her assessment of the objective seriousness of the Applicant's offending, her Honour certainly did take into account that there were six separate occasions of supply over a significant period observing that:-
In that sense this is not an isolated act.  His actions cannot be regarded then as impulsive.  His conduct necessarily involved premeditation and planning.  That is not to suggest that he had a role in planning it but he certainly had the opportunity to have regard to what he was doing in carrying out the acts that made up this offence six times between 18 March and 1 July 2010.

19On the topic of financial gain, her Honour said:-
The fourth matter is that as the offender is a drug user himself, in particular of cocaine, the offences could not be said to be purely motivated by financial gain which can aggravate an offence such as this.  However, unlike many user dealers he had available to him legitimate income or assets that could have funded his personal use, increasing and eating into his finances though it (sic) was.  He nevertheless could have done that by lawful means.  He had a car, a house and the ability to make a reasonable income.  He was making an income according to what he said on the pre-sentence report.  He was most certainly not in the class of offender who was destitute or desperate like so many drug addicts who sell drugs to finance their habit.
20There was no challenge to her Honour's account of primary facts referred to in these remarks.  Otherwise the remarks themselves are unexceptionable.  The Applicant chose crime, and repeated crime, as a way of supporting his cocaine use.  The choice and the Applicant's implementation of it were factors very relevant to sentencing him.
21In support of the first complaint, reference was made to Cicciarello v R [2009] NSWCCA 272 at [19] where it was said:-
19   Ground 3 concerned the way the sentencing judge took into account as an aggravating factor the fact that there was a series of criminal acts: the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act (1999) (NSW), s 21A(2)(m). The difficulty with this is that those multiple criminal acts were the foundation for the more serious offence with which he was charged, namely supply of not less than a commercial quantity of the drug for which a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment was provided. They were not strictly elements of the offence charged, as for example they would have been in an offence of on-going supply under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, s 25A. In such a case, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 21A would expressly prohibit a sentencing court from having additional regard to such matters as an aggravating factor. The risk of double counting in the assessment of objective seriousness in that case would thereby be avoided. Here, when the series of criminal acts leads to the more serious criminal charge being properly laid against the applicant, the prohibition against double counting is undermined if the same series of criminal acts is taken into account as an additional aggravating factor, in turn leading to an erroneous characterisation of the offence as one of mid-range seriousness. The above is consistent with Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145; 65 NSWLR 740 at 747 [29].

22The report of the case is very short and contains but a summary of the remarks of the original sentencing judge.  However, reading the passage cited, it is clear that what the Court was concerned to criticise was the use of the series of criminal acts as an ""additional aggravating factor"", not the use of them as an indication of the objective criminality.  That view is reinforced by the reference to Tadrosse v R where an offender was being sentenced for multiple offences and the sentencing judge had taken into account the multiple instances of criminality as aggravating conduct under s 21A(2)(m) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  There is nothing in either of the cases mentioned to suggest that the number of incidents making up the criminal conduct cannot be taken into account at all.
23Cicciarello v R was also referred to in support of the second aspect of the ground of appeal.  At [17] of that case it was said:-
17  Whilst one should be careful about generalising in relation to such factors outside the circumstances of any particular case, here, quite clearly, when one understands the background of this young man and what he was doing, he was not selling for greed or for financial gain, he was selling to feed a drug habit that he had acquired. This does not detract from the fact that he committed a serious offence, but what it does mean is that it was an error, and an important one, to characterise this as selling for financial gain and thus to characterise it as an offence falling within the mid-range. In our view, that latter conclusion must clearly have been affected by the finding of financial gain because no other basis in the facts could found such a conclusion.
24Her Honour's remarks recognise and reflect the distinction drawn in the passage just cited and, contrary to submissions of the Applicant's counsel, her Honour's recognition of the fact that the Applicant was not a destitute drug addict, was something that it was proper for her Honour to take into account.
25In what was a blatant attempt to expand the grounds of appeal beyond their terms and beyond anything advanced in written submissions, the experienced counsel for the Applicant submitted that in taking into account motivation for financial gain, her Honour misunderstood some of the medical evidence that was before her, conflating issues of intellect and impairment.  In that connection, counsel referred the Court to some of the evidence given by Dr Hardy.
26It is unnecessary for the purposes of these reasons to refer to all of that evidence.  I have quoted from Dr Hardy's report.  In oral evidence, Dr Hardy was taken to that portion of Dr Hepner's report wherein she referred to there being no evidence of impairment in the Applicant's level of intellectual function and other matters, and asked whether he disagreed.   Dr Hardy's response was:
Well I can't because you know I commissioned the report on the basis that I didn't know the answers and this is the answer. 
27Asked how he could reconcile his opinion that the Applicant did not understand how right or wrong his drug dealing was with the opinion of Dr Hepner his response in a number of answers was to the effect:
On the basis that when one's frontal lobes are basically removed .... He has no discernment at all about right and wrong, good or bad ... I am presenting to your Honour a - I guess a menu of possibilities that exist within this man from being normal, consenting and fully culpable to having ... no culpability at all.  Now I'm not suggesting to your Honour that he has no culpability in this matter.  However, I am suggesting that his culpability has been attenuated to some degree and I'm unable to express to you exactly to what percentage that is ... 
... There aren't many explanations for continuing to do this other than criminality.  You know criminality with full culpability apart from having diminished frontal lobe.
28Asked how the Applicant's conditions affected his culpability Dr Hardy replied:.... This is a very, very complex area of neurology but the removal of one's frontal lobes in entirety takes away higher judgment and discernment entirely.  Now the issue comes back to degree in this man's case and we can't just simply measure it  ... he's somewhere between normal and none and I can't tell you exactly where it is but it certainly is reduced.  It's clear from my conversations with him. It's clear from the way he has described the events. He's minimally sort of engaged in what had happened and that this goes hand in hand with a loss of emotional engagement in the actual crime itself initially when he was describing it to me when he was still raw in rehab.
29It is apparent from her Honour's questioning of Dr Hardy and in her remarks on sentence that she was conscious and sceptical of his evidence.  In those remarks she adverted to the Applicant's mental condition as bearing on the objective seriousness of the offending and referred to the disorders that had been diagnosed.  Her Honour continued: 
The sixth matter in regard to the objective seriousness is in relation to (the Applicant's) mental condition.  There is material in the form of the psychological and psychiatric material that suggests that at the time of committing the offences he was operating under a mental disorder or illness, including major depression, post traumatic stress disorder, an acquired brain injury and/or a combination of those matters and that there was a causal link between them in that the commission of the offence, in that those matters affected his judgment in the commission of the offence.
While the existence of those problems cannot be denied and in many cases will reduce the objective seriousness of an offence, here there is a limited causal link between the existence of those problems and the commission of the offences.  I base that view on consideration of a combination of the neuropsychologist's report and the factual material in relation to the commission of the offences, and all of the other material in relation to his psychological condition.
30Her Honour went on to record that the Applicant's view was that he suffered no long-term effects of the car accident and it was reasonable to take that opinion into account to a limited extent.  Her Honour referred to the fact he was still working and to the fact that the Applicant commenced using cocaine at about the age of 30.  She continued :- 
His problem with drug addiction in this particular matter does not excuse his involvement in the offence, nor does it diminish the objective seriousness of the matter.
I do accept though that his mental condition did affect his judgment but to a limited extent.   Certainly he had undergone a difficult personal period ... some of this was self-inflicted ... However, large parts of it were the product of a round of difficult events outside his control.  However, despite these matters, I do not accept that his judgment was so affected that it substantially reduced his moral culpability ...
... At least one of his friends gave evidence that he had told [the Applicant] many times prior to his arrest to get help and to stop using drugs ... He chose not to do anything about his drug problems until after his arrest.  
The matters concerning his mental condition though, whilst of limited significance in terms of reducing the objective seriousness of the offence, do merit weight in regard as well to his subjective circumstances.
31The evidence to which I have referred demonstrates that there were substantial bases for her Honour not to accept all of the evidence of Dr Hardy.   Furthermore, her Honour's reasons make it clear that there is no basis for the suggestion that her Honour did not properly understand the evidence before her and conflated issues of intellect and impairment.  
32I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal.

		17 April 2014",2014-04-14 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705200,R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56,"Judgment

1THE COURT: The Director of Public Prosecutions, pursuant to s.5D(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, appeals against an aggregate sentence imposed upon the Respondent on 4 April 2013 by the District Court (her Honour Judge Huggett).

The Offences

9Section 61M(2) provides:

""Any person who assaults another person, and, at the time of, or immediately before or after, the assault, commits an act of indecency on or in the presence of the other person, is liable to imprisonment for 10 years, if the other person is under the age of 16 years.""

10Section 66A(2) Crimes Act 1900 provides:

""Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person who is under the age of 10 years in circumstances of aggravation is guilty of an offence.""

(Maximum penalty: imprisonment for life)

11Section 66A(3) specifies the ""circumstances of aggravation"".

12The circumstance of aggravation pleaded was that specified in s.66A(3)(d), namely:

""The alleged victim is (whether generally or at the time of the commission of the offence) under the authority of the alleged offender.""

13Section 91H(2) Crimes Act 1900 specifies:

""A person who produces, disseminates or possesses child abuse material is guilty of an offence.""

14Section 91H specifies the maximum penalty as imprisonment for 10 years.

Facts of the Offences

15The offences contained in Counts 1 to 4 were committed between December 2011 and April 2012. They all relate to the one victim who was then aged eight years.

16What follows is drawn from the Statement of Facts tendered at the sentencing hearing.

17The Respondent is the former husband of the victim's stepmother. Despite the fact that he was divorced, he was on good terms with his former wife. She had remarried and was living in suburban Sydney with her husband, the victim and the four-year old son of her present marriage.

18The Respondent, then aged 33 years, worked as a civilian computer administrator in the Australian Army, where he had been employed for some seven years. Between 2010 and 2012, he was stationed at Singleton.

19The Respondent would come and stay in Sydney with the victim's family on most weekends. He would often baby sit the victim and her younger brother and stay overnight at their home. Prior to April 2012, the Respondent left his employment with the Australian Army. He commenced to live full time in the victim's family home on 2 April 2012.

20One or two weeks after Christmas 2011, the Respondent was looking after the victim and her brother at their home. The parents were out. The victim was sitting on her bunk bed. The Respondent produced a video on his laptop computer. The video depicted a male and two females engaged in a sexual act.
 
Count 1 - Aggravated Indecent Assault

21In early January 2012, the Respondent was looking after the victim and her brother at their home. He played a video for the victim on his laptop showing two males engaged in a sex act. The victim was sitting on her bunk bed. The Respondent removed her underwear and rubbed his fingers on the outside of the victim's vagina as she watched the video. The victim said that this felt ""weird and funny"". This conduct constituted Count 1.

22On 23 March 2012, the Respondent was looking after the victim prior to her attending a friend's birthday party. Her parents and brother were out at the shops. The Respondent walked into the victim's bedroom and produced a video on his laptop computer. The video depicted two females in a sexual act. The victim's parents returned home and the Respondent turned off the video. 

Count 2 - Aggravated Sexual Intercourse

23During a weekend afternoon in March 2012, the Respondent was looking after the victim whilst her parents were out. The Respondent fixed the victim's iPod and said to her, ""Do you want to watch some rude videos?"". The victim replied, ""Whatever"". The victim was again seated on her bunk bed and the Respondent produced a video on his laptop computer. The video depicted a naked male and female in a sexual act. 

24The Respondent stood at the side of the bed and grabbed the victim's legs and pulled her towards him, so that her legs were hanging off the bed. The Respondent stood between the victim's legs and removed her underwear. The Respondent licked the inside of the victim's vagina with his tongue whilst the video played in the background. He continued licking for a couple of minutes. The victim said that this felt really ""weird"". This incident constituted Count 2. 

Form 1 Offence 1 - Aggravated Indecent Assault

25The Respondent stopped licking the victim's vagina and proceeded to rub her vagina on the outside, using two fingers for a few minutes. The victim's brother called out to the Respondent, at which point he stopped. The victim said, ""Are you finished?"" and the Respondent replied, ""Yes"" and left the room. This constituted the first matter on the Form 1 for Count 2.

26One day in the following weeks, the Respondent was looking after the victim and her brother at the family home. During the morning, the victim was playing pretend sword fighting with her brother. At lunchtime, her parents went out. The victim was in the bedroom sitting at her desk, when the Respondent approached her and said, ""Do you want to watch some videos?"". The victim said, ""OK"". The Respondent produced a video which depicted two naked males in a sexual act. The Respondent was not present in the room whilst the victim watched the video. 

Count 3 - Aggravated Sexual Intercourse; Form 1 Offence 2 - Aggravated Indecent Assault

27In late March 2012, the Respondent was looking after the victim and her brother at the family home. The victim was in her bedroom and the Respondent produced a video on his laptop depicting a male and a female in a sexual act. These persons were naked from the waist down. The victim told the Respondent when the video finished. At this time, the victim was lying on her bed, wearing a t-shirt, shorts and underwear. The Respondent proceeded to rub the victim on her vagina on the outside of her clothes. This constituted the second matter on the Form 1. 

28During the same incident, the Respondent said to the victim, ""I'm gonna do it on the inside"". He then placed his hand inside the victim's underwear and inserted two fingers into her vagina and rubbed for about 10 minutes. The Respondent then stopped and left the room and the victim walked into the lounge room, where her brother was watching television. These actions constituted Count 3. 

Count 4 - Aggravated Sexual Intercourse

29About two months after Christmas 2011, the Respondent took the victim to the shops whilst the other members of the family were at home watching television. The Respondent bought a lolly in the shape of a pen which dispensed a flavoured gel. The Respondent and the victim returned to the family home and went into the victim's bedroom. The Respondent closed the door behind them and took off the victim's clothes. The Respondent opened the lolly and squeezed the gel onto the victim's vagina. He proceeded to lick the gel off the inside of the lips of her vagina. That conduct constituted Count 4.

Form 1 Offence 3 - Aggravated Indecent Assault

30Some time between Christmas 2011 and Easter 2012, the Respondent was again at the family home with the victim. Her parents and brother were out at the shops. The victim was in her room watching television. The Respondent approached the victim and showed her a ""purple rubbery thing that looked like a penis"" (clearly a dildo). He placed the dildo on the victim's vagina whilst it vibrated for a short period of time. The victim said, ""I don't want to do it anymore"" and left the bedroom to watch television. This constituted the third matter on the Form 1.

Form 1 Offence 4 - Incite Act of Indecency (Person Under 10 Years)

31Just before Easter 2012, the Respondent was at the family home with the victim and her brother. Their parents were out. The victim was watching television and the Respondent called her into her room. The Respondent and victim sat on her bed and the Respondent put on a video. The Respondent took off the victim's clothes, leaving her in only a singlet. The Respondent turned on a blue-coloured massager, which vibrated. He handed it to the victim and told her how to use it. He said, ""You can use it now"". The victim placed the massager on her vagina as instructed. The Respondent left the room and returned a short while later and the victim said, ""I'm finished"". The victim left the room to play with her brother. This conduct constituted the fourth matter on the Form 1.

Photographs of the Victim and Other Children

32The victim told police of an occasion when the Respondent took her and her brother to the Royal National Park. The victim stated that they went swimming naked and the Respondent took photographs of them. The victim also referred to an occasion when she was in the bath with her brother and two other male children, aged four and two years. On this occasion, the Respondent was minding the children. The Respondent took photographs of the children whilst they were naked in the bath. 

33When police seized the Respondent's laptop computer, these photographs were located on it.

The Victim Complains

34On 9 April 2012, the victim and her family and the Respondent were at a relative's house for an Easter celebration lunch. The victim told her 11-year old cousin that the Respondent had shown her pornographic videos, and had bought her a gel pen and licked the gel off her vagina. The victim showed her cousin some adult videos which she was able to access and put on her cousin's iPod. 

35Later, the victim told her cousin that the Respondent wished to talk to her in the bathroom. The cousin reluctantly went into the bathroom with the Respondent alone. He seemed very angry and accused the cousin of telling or showing the victim inappropriate things, which the cousin denied doing. The Respondent then said, ""Nobody's gonna believe you anyway"". The cousin was concerned about what she had been told by the victim and she told her mother about it the next day. 

36On 11 April 2012, the cousin's mother told the victim's stepmother about the disclosures which had been made. The stepmother then spoke to the victim alone and the victim told her what the Respondent had been doing to her and showing to her. That same afternoon, the police were informed and the victim was spoken to by police. 

Seizure of Material by Police and Arrest of Respondent

37In the late afternoon of 11 April 2012, police officers attended the family home and seized numerous electronic data storage devices belonging to the Respondent which he was keeping at the victim's home. That same night, police contacted the Respondent and asked him to attend the police station. 

38Later that evening, police were conducting surveillance outside the family home, when they observed the Respondent driving slowly towards the house in a vehicle with the headlights off. Police approached him and served a provisional apprehended violence order on him. Police then searched the Respondent and his vehicle and seized a number of electronic devices believed to contain child abuse material.

39Following investigations undertaken by police, the Respondent was arrested on 12 June 2012 and charged with sexual offences against the victim. 

Count 5 - Possess Child Abuse Material

40The Respondent's Acer laptop was examined and found to contain 41 photographs, five videos and one document which constituted child abuse material. The material included images of children engaged in sexual activity and some material involving animals and a child. 

41Ranked on the Child Exploitation Tracking System (""CETS""), where the least serious child abuse material is ranked at one, and the most serious is ranked at five, the bulk of the material was ranked at one, with four photographs and five videos ranked at four, and one photograph and one document ranked at five. The photographs, videos and document found on the Respondent's Acer laptop constituted the offence in Count 5.

42This laptop also contained numerous photographs of the victim. 

Form 1 Offence 1 - Posses Child Abuse Material

43A hard drive belonging to the Respondent was examined and contained 40,852 photographic images of which 8,173 were reviewed, a random sample taken for the purpose of s.289B Criminal Procedure Act 1989. Of these, 39 were found to constitute child abuse material. The device also contained 2,412 video files of which 988 were reviewed, and of these, five were found to contain child abuse material. 

44Of this material, 36 of the 39 photographs were ranked at Scale 1 on the CETS scale, with two on Scale 2 and one on Scale 4. All five videos were ranked at Scale 5 on the CETS scale. These matters gave rise to the first offence contained in the Form 1 taken into account on sentence for Count 5.

Form 1 Offence 2 - Possess Child Abuse Material

45A further hard drive belonging to the Respondent was analysed and was found to contain 15,452 images of which 5,989 were reviewed. Of these, 97 were found to constitute child abuse material. 

46Of the 97 photographs, 10 were ranked at Scale 1, four at Scale 2, seven at Scale 3, 68 at Scale 4 and eight at Scale 5 on the CETS scale. These matters gave rise to the second offence taken into account on the Form 1 attaching to Count 5.

The Respondent's Subjective Circumstances

47The Respondent had no prior criminal history. 

48A report of Dr Richard Furst, psychiatrist, dated 8 March 2013 was tendered in the defence case together with a report of Ms Caroline Hare, psychologist, dated 13 March 2013. There was evidence that the Respondent was suffering from a major depressive illness, but the sentencing Judge did not accept that there was a causal connection between his mental functioning and his offending (ROS14-15).

49The Respondent entered pleas of guilty to the offences at the earliest opportunity in the Local Court. The sentencing Judge allowed a discount of 25% for his early pleas.

50The sentencing Judge accepted that the Respondent was remorseful for his offending (ROS21).

51Her Honour also found the risk of the Respondent re-offending was low provided he undertook a custody-based sex offender programme as proposed by Dr Furst (ROS21).

Crown Submissions

52The Crown submitted that the sentence imposed by her Honour was too low to adequately reflect the circumstances of the offences, particularly when regard is had to the maximum penalties specified for the offences, and the applicable standard non-parole periods.

53The Crown did not point to any specific error, other than the error which, it was submitted, was manifest in the sentence imposed.

54Reliance was placed upon observations of Gleeson CJ and Hayne J in Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 231 at 325-326 [6], that manifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion, and does not depend upon attribution of identified specific error in the reasoning of the sentencing Judge. Their Honours further observed that manifest inadequacy or excess of sentence frequently does not admit of amplification except by stating the respect in which the sentence is inadequate or excessive.

55The Crown submitted that, in its context, each offence was of itself a very serious crime. That was said to be reflected in the maximum penalty for the individual offences, being 10 years for the s.61M(2) offences, life imprisonment for the s.66A(2) offences, 10 years for the child abuse material offences, and seven years for the s.61O(2) offence contained on the first of the Form 1 documents.

56The Crown emphasised that Counts 1-4 (and three of the four offences taken into account against Count 2) carried significant standard nonparole periods of eight years and 15 years respectively.

57The Crown further observed that, allowing for the discount granted to recognise the pleas of guilty, the starting point for the aggregate sentence was one of 10 years and eight months' imprisonment. The Crown's submission was that the sentence imposed was an entirely inadequate penalty to address the overall criminality involved in the five offences, taking into account the additional six crimes dealt with by way of Form 1 under s.33 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

58In essence, the Crown submitted that the sentence imposed did not adequately reflect the gravity of the offences and did not encompass the need for denunciation and deterrence, particularly general deterrence. A non-parole period of five years and four months, it was submitted, fell far short of achieving those outcomes.

59The Crown emphasised that this was particularly stark in relation to Counts 2, 3 and 4, being the offences involving sexual intercourse (cunnilingus and digital penetration) with the eight-year old victim in circumstances where the Respondent was in a position of authority over her.

60The Crown further emphasised the maximum penalty of life imprisonment and the prescribed standard non-parole period in respect of the offences under s.66A(2) Crimes Act 1900.

61The Crown noted the three indicated sentences in respect of offences under s.66A(2) determined by the sentencing Judge were respectively:

(a) five years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years and eight months;

(b) three years and six months' imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and six months; and

(c) four years and three months' imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years.

62It was submitted that having regard to the maximum penalty for the offences, and the standard non-parole periods, it was difficult to see how sentences as low as these could adequately address the very grave crimes committed by the Respondent, or act as a deterrent to others.

63Finally, the Crown observed that the aggravated form of s.66A is a relatively new offence, having taken effect on 1 January 2009 pursuant to the Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2008. The new s.66A(2), it was observed, not only took a new form but it also carried a new and much heavier maximum penalty, an increase from 25 years' imprisonment to imprisonment for life.

64It was submitted by the Crown that it is the duty of the courts to recognise and reflect the increased penalty, and the intention of the community inherent in the increased maximum penalty to see increased sentences imposed by the courts. 

65Although the Crown properly acknowledged the limitations that apply to a comparison between decided cases, a number of sentencing decisions of this Court were referred to and summarised in the Crown's submissions. These were GN v R [2012] NSWCCA 96; JRM v R [2012] NSWCCA 112; PK v R [2012] NSWCCA 280; RJT v R [2012] NSWCCA 280; Leslie v R [2013] NSWCCA 48; 227 A Crim R 133; Essex v R [2013] NSWCCA 11 and Jolly v R [2013] NSWCCA 76. Reference was made, as well, during the hearing to Kertai v R [2013] NSWCCA 252.

66The Crown contended that, viewed against those cases which involved offences under s.66A(2), the aggregate sentence imposed in the present case must be seen as extraordinarily low. The aggregate sentence was intended to reflect all of the Respondent's crimes and not just one or more of the s.66A(2) offences, and accordingly, the Crown submitted, it must be concluded that the aggregate sentence was so low as to be indicative of error.

67The overall circumstances of the crimes, it was contended, required the imposition of a more substantial sentence, both to punish the Respondent and to deter others from committing similar offences.
 
Respondent's Submissions

68Mr Stratton SC and Ms Healey, for the Respondent, noted that the Crown made no complaint about the sentencing Judge's assessment in her characterisation of the relevant objective and subjective factors.

69It was further submitted that there were a number of features of the present case which took it well away from the more serious end of the scale of objective gravity. Firstly, the acts of sexual penetration were limited to cunnilingus and digital penetration. In particular, there were no acts of penile/vaginal penetration. Secondly, the Respondent remained clothed throughout the incidents, and the Respondent did not ask the victim to touch his penis. It was submitted that these features operated in the Respondent's favour, bearing in mind statements of the High Court in Ibbs v The Queen [1987] HCA 46; 163 CLR 447 at 451-452.

70The Respondent's submissions further observed that the victim was not far from the age of 10 years, when charges for s.66A(2) offences could no longer be laid. During the time when the offences took place, the victim was at least eight-and-a-half years old at all relevant times.

71Thirdly, it was submitted that all the offences took place over a relatively narrow period of time.

72Fourthly, there was no suggestion that the counts charged were representative counts.

73Fifthly, there was no evidence of threats, force or physical coercion being involved in the offences, or of threats afterwards to obtain the victim's silence.

74The written submissions for the Respondent contained an analysis of the cases referred to by the Crown.

75Particular attention was given to the judgment of this Court in JRM v R. It was submitted that comparison between that case and the present case supported a conclusion that the sentence imposed upon the Respondent was not manifestly inadequate.

Determination of Appeal

76By asserting manifest inadequacy, the Crown alleges that the result embodied in the sentencing Judge's orders was unreasonable or plainly unjust. The Crown submitted that it was to be inferred from the result that there was a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the sentencing court: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 538 [58]. The Crown contends that this Court should conclude that the total effective sentence imposed at first instance was ""manifestly too short"": Dinsdale v The Queen at 325 [6]. 

77To make good this ground, this Court must conclude that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how that occurred is not apparent from the remarks on sentence: Hili v The Queen at 539 [59]. The error asserted is that falling within the final category in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505.

78What reveals manifest inadequacy of sentence is consideration of all of the matters that are relevant to fixing the sentence: Hili v The Queen at 539 [60]. 

79We are satisfied that there is a very substantial disconnect between the Respondent's offences, taking into account all relevant factors including his subjective circumstances, and the sentences imposed at first instance. In our view, that substantial disconnect is of such a scale that the total effective sentence imposed at first instance was manifestly too short. 

80A number of features, taken cumulatively, lead to this conclusion. 

A Mixture of Offences, Maximum Penalties and Standard Non-Parole Periods

81The Respondent stood to be sentenced for five serious offences. Counts 2, 3 and 4 (offences of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child under 10 contrary to s.66A(2) Crimes Act 1900) were each punishable by a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 15 years. 

82Count 1 (aggravated indecent assault on a child under 16 years contrary to s.61M(2) Crimes Act 1900) was punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of eight years. 

83Count 5 (possession of child abuse material contrary to s.91H(2) Crimes Act 1900) was punishable by a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment. 

84In addition, the Respondent asked the sentencing court to take into account, by way of the Form 1 procedure, six further offences.

85In sentencing the Respondent on Count 2, the Respondent requested that the sentencing Judge take into account three further offences of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s.61M(2), and an offence of inciting a child under the age of 10 years to an act of indecency contrary to s.61O(2) Crimes Act 1900. In sentencing the Respondent on Count 5, the sentencing Judge was asked to take into account two further offences of possession of child abuse material contrary to s.91H(2). 

86It was necessary that the sentences referable to Counts 2 and 5 reflect the additional offences to be taken into account, in accordance with the principles in Abbas v R [2013] NSWCCA 115.

87The maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods are important legislative guideposts for the purpose of sentence: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at 132 [27]. This is particularly so with respect to the three s.66A(2) offences, each of which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years.

88A further feature is relevant to the s.66A(2) offences. As a result of statutory amendments in 2009, the maximum penalty for this offence was increased from 25 years' imprisonment to life imprisonment. 

89The fixing of a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for an offence under s.66A(2) was done ""in recognition of the heinousness of committing such an aggravated offence against a child under the age of 10 years"" (second reading speech of the Attorney General for the Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Bill 2008, Hansard, Legislative Council, 26 November 2008). In the course of the second reading speech, the Attorney General stated that the sentence increase contained in s.66A(2) was recommended in the 2008 Report of the NSW Sentencing Council entitled ""Penalties Relating to Sexual Assault Offences in New South Wales"".

90It is well established that the increase by the legislature in the maximum penalty for conduct proscribed by s.66A(2) must be reflected in the sentences which trial courts impose: R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 227; R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [52]; Muldrock v The Queen at 133 [31]; Leslie at 144-145 [79]. 

91As Beech-Jones J observed with respect to s.66A(2) in GN v R at [86], ""a maximum term of life imprisonment is the most emphatic statement of the seriousness of the offence that the legislature may make"". McCallum J noted in PK v R at [4] that ""aggravated sexual intercourse with a child under ten is among the most serious of criminal offences in this State"". 

92Similar considerations apply to s.91H(2), where the legislature increased the maximum penalty in 2009 from five to 10 years' imprisonment, in accordance with a further recommendation of the NSW Sentencing Council. In recommending this course, the NSW Sentencing Council observed that an increase in the maximum penalty for possession offences to 10 years' imprisonment would serve to emphasise the need for denunciation and general deterrence noted in the authorities: Report of NSW Sentencing Council, ""Penalties Relating to Sexual Assault Offences in New South Wales"", 2008, Volume 1, paragraph 4.41 (citing R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370; 162 A Crim R 29 at 44 [65]-[66] and other cases). This aspect bears upon sentencing for Count 5 and the two s.91H(2) offences to be taken into account on sentence for that count.

The Respondent's Course of Criminal Conduct

93The Respondent's offences were committed over a not insignificant period of time between about December 2011 and April 2012. 

94Some basic facts should be noted. The Respondent was 33 years of age and the victim was eight years of age. The Respondent was an intelligent man who had held a responsible position employed as a civilian computer administrator in the Australian Army for some seven years. He was on good terms with his former wife and her husband, who permitted him to live in their home. The Respondent was trusted by the victim (who called him ""uncle"") and her four-year old brother.

95Whilst occupying this trusted position, the Respondent committed these offences against the victim. She was ""under the authority"" of the Respondent, the relevant circumstance of aggravation for the purposes of s.66A(2) and (3)(d).

96It is important to keep in mind the calculated and changing conduct of the Respondent towards the young victim. It involved showing pornographic material to her on a laptop computer for the purpose of preparing her for sexual activity, a type of especially perverse cultivation or seduction. This occurred on several occasions. The physical sexual assaults committed against the victim took various forms. The three s.66A(2) offences involved two incidents of cunnilingus and one of digital penetration. A dildo and vibrator were used by the Respondent in the latter part of the offending period. 

97It was appropriate for the sentencing Judge to have regard to the form of sexual intercourse which occurred in this case in considering the s.66A(2) offences. There was no act of penile intercourse on the part of the Respondent. There was digital penetration and cunnilingus (on two occasions). It is erroneous to attempt to rank forms of sexual intercourse in some hierarchy so as to determine their objective seriousness. The objective seriousness of offending is to be determined according to the entirety of the facts and circumstances of the case in question: Doe v R [2013] NSWCCA 248 at [54]; Simpson v R [2014] NSWCCA 23 at [33]-[34]. 

98The entirety of the facts and circumstances of the present case demonstrate a range of acts of sexual intercourse involving different forms of penetration and touching committed against an eight-year old girl by a 33-year old man, whom she trusted as if he was a member of the family. These were offences of significant objective seriousness. 

99The appropriate inference is that the Respondent's course of offending conduct only came to an end as a result of the victim's complaint on 9 April 2012, followed by the intervention by the police on 11 April 2012.

100This was not an isolated incident, nor a course of conduct which came to an end as a result of the Respondent desisting voluntarily from further offences. The fact that the offences persisted for a number of months only is of little assistance to the Respondent. This was not an opportunistic offence committed because of circumstances which suddenly presented themselves to the Respondent: RR v R [2011] NSWCCA 235; 216 A Crim R 489 at 519 [148]; Jones v R [2012] NSWCCA 262 at [96]. There was a process of grooming the victim, with the offending conduct taking on different forms. The gravity of the Respondent's offending conduct entailed the deliberate exploitation of both the trust and vulnerability of an eight-year old child.

101As a result of the Respondent's arrest, police located the child abuse material relevant to the s.91H(2) offence, and the two further matters to be taken into account on sentence for that offence. The child abuse material involved a substantial number of images of child pornography, with some items involving animals. Thus, the Respondent was a consumer of child abuse material who directly abused a child victim himself. 

102In the course of its 2008 Report, the NSW Sentencing Council referred to increasing community concern in relation to the sexualisation of children generally and the availability of child pornography, and the extent to which this material may encourage offenders ""who find the material normalising, to move on to direct abuse of children themselves"" (Report, paragraphs 4.1, 4.9). The Respondent appears to fall into this category.

103Of further concern were other photographs located on the Respondent's computer. There were numerous naked photographs of the victim, her younger brother and two other young children. The Respondent had taken photographs of the children swimming and in the bath.

Harm to the Victim

104The sentencing Judge referred to the victim impact statement, noting that it was ""an eloquent and insightful testimony to the serious psychological consequences that these offences have had upon [the victim]"" (ROS23). Her Honour then stated that, without seeking in any way to trivialise or minimise the effect of the offences upon the victim, ""this is not a matter where the harm is a matter of aggravation"" (ROS23).

105In so concluding, the sentencing Judge was addressing the statutory aggravating factor in s.21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as to whether the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence is substantial. 

106This Court has stated that sentencing Judges are entitled to proceed on the basis that serious sexual assaults can be expected to have adverse psychological consequences and that, as a result, care needs to be taken to avoid double counting with regard to the aggravating feature of substantial emotional harm: Stewart v R [2012] NSWCCA 183 at [61]. 

107In the area of sex offences committed against young children, s.66A(2) provides for a very substantial penalty. It may be taken that a factor which contributes to the setting of this penalty (and the standard non-parole period) is the expectation that substantial harm will result to a young child victim of sex offences. 

108The victim impact statement in this case pointed to many of the adverse psychological consequences affecting an eight-year old girl who had been subjected to a course of sexual abuse by a trusted person over a period of months. 

109The exposure of an eight-year old girl to images and conduct of the type described earlier over a period of months must inevitably have a significant and long-term effect upon her. The victim impact statement made clear that a once ""bubbly, outgoing and fun loving eight-year old girl"" had become confused and apprehensive in home and school settings, with friends and others. By the time the victim impact statement was prepared on 8 March 2013, extensive psychological support had been undertaken, with the victim continuing to manifest anxiety, confusion, mistrust, shame, anger and guilt. 

110This Court has observed that child sex offences have profound and deleterious effects upon victims for many years, if not the whole of their lives: R v CMB [2014] NSWCCA 5 at [92]. Sexual abuse of children will inevitably give rise to psychological damage: SW v R [2013] NSWCCA 255 at [52]. In R v G [2008] UKHL 37; [2009] 1 AC 92, Baroness Hale of Richmond (at [49]) referred to the ""long term and serious harm, both physical and psychological, which premature sexual activity can do"". The absolute prohibition on sexual activity with a child is intended to protect children from the physical and psychological harm taken to be caused by premature sexual activity: Clarkson v R [2011] VSCA 157; 32 VR 361 at 364 [3], 368-372 [26]-[39].

111This factor no doubt contributes to the setting of the heaviest maximum penalty known to the criminal law for s.66A(2) offences, accompanied by a standard non-parole period of 15 years. It is important that sentences for s.66A(2) offences reflect this grave element implicit in the offence itself. 

112This is an important feature in the present case. Young child victims are especially vulnerable. It is important that sentences passed for s.66A(2) offences recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime: s.3A(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

Other Sentencing Decisions

113Reference to other sentencing decisions for offences under s.66A(2) provides limited assistance in this case. 

114Firstly, there are not many cases, as yet, where persons have been sentenced for s.66A(2) offences since the maximum penalty was increased in 2009. We do not think there is a sufficient number of s.66A(2) sentencing cases to allow a ""range"" to be identified: cf R v Li [2010] NSWCCA 125; 202 A Crim R 195 at 204 [40]. 

115One thing that should be clear is that the level of sentences imposed for s.66A(2) offences should increase by comparison with their pre-2009 equivalents, given the increase in maximum penalty.

116Secondly, other cases referred to in submissions to this Court are significantly different from this case. 

117The Respondent's offences involved multi-faceted criminal activity. A factor present in this case, and not present in any other s.66A(2) case, is the repeated displaying of pornographic movies to the eight-year old victim to prepare her for the Respondent's intended sexual offences. Not only does this aspect magnify the Respondent's crimes by demonstrating a level of planning and organisation, it involves the introduction of a further corrupting influence brought to bear against the eight-year old girl as a prequel to the physical acts which followed. This aspect exacerbates the Respondent's offences in a significant respect. Further, as mentioned earlier, the Respondent's offences involved a course of conduct over a period of months directed to the young victim in her own home. 

118We do not consider that other sentencing decisions establish a range of sentences for this offence which may be deployed in any meaningful way to assist the Respondent in this case. This is not a case where the Crown's claim of manifest inadequacy falls to be tested by an examination of sentences imposed in cases most closely comparable to it: Hili v The Queen at 539-540 [62]. That said, to the extent that other sentencing decisions assist at all, and bearing in mind the differences between those cases and the Respondent's offences, other s.66A(2) sentencing decisions provide support for the Crown submission of manifest inadequacy in this case.
 
Manifest Inadequacy is Demonstrated

119The Respondent's offences involved an interrelationship between the use and possession of child abuse material (and other pornographic material displayed to the victim) and the commission of sexual offences against a child.

120The approach of the sentencing Judge in utilising an aggregate sentence focused upon the total sentence to be imposed for all the Respondent's offences. For the reasons explained in this judgment, we are well satisfied that the individual indicated sentences imposed, and the total sentence and non-parole period are manifestly inadequate. 

121In reaching this conclusion, we have had regard to the Respondent's subjective circumstances, including his absence of prior convictions. As the sentencing Judge found, there was no suggestion that the Respondent's mental functioning affected his ability to control his actions or to appreciate that they were wrong. 

122The sentencing Judge found that the likelihood of the Respondent reoffending in the future was low, provided he participated in a sex offender programme identified by Dr Furst, psychiatrist, in the report tendered on sentence. Given the nature, duration and circumstances of the Respondent's offending behaviour, this conclusion was a generous one. A guarded approach to the Respondent's risk of reoffending is warranted. It should be expected that this aspect will be addressed by way of custodial programmes available for child sex offenders.

The Residual Discretion and Resentencing

123If error was demonstrated, affidavits of the Respondent and his solicitor, Vanessa Carmody-Smith, were read on the appeal. The Crown read an affidavit of Jennifer Ramsey sworn 27 November 2013. The affidavits pointed to the Respondent's wish to undertake a custodial sex offender programme and indicated that, although he had been referred for assessment, that had not been undertaken at the time of the hearing in this Court. The Respondent's affidavit addressed, as well, a level of stress resulting from notification to him that the Crown had appealed against sentence in this matter.

124In determining a Crown appeal under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912, this Court has a residual discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient: Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at 465-466 [1]-[2]. This discretion may be exercised for reasons other than double jeopardy: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7 at 24-25 [92], [95], [33], [150].

125The onus lies upon the Respondent to establish that the discretion ought be exercised in his favour: R v Smith [2007] NSWCCA 100 at [60]; R v CMB at [110]. We are not persuaded that there is any discretionary basis established for this Court to decline to intervene and resentence the Respondent. The sentencing process at first instance led to the imposition of sentences which were manifestly too low. 

126The interests of justice require the imposition of appropriate sentences for these serious crimes: R v Dinh [2010] NSWCCA 74; 199 A Crim R 573 at 587 [79]; R v Hinchliffe [2013] NSWCCA 327 at [294]. The Respondent's offences are patently serious and there is a corresponding propriety in imposing a sentence upon him that reflects this: R v CMB at [109]. 

127Like the sentencing Judge, we are content to proceed by way of aggregate sentencing under s.53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It is necessary to identify the non-parole period for the offences which carry a standard non-parole period: s.54B(4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

128The sentencing Judge found that each of the sexual offences represented a serious form of the offence with Counts 1 and 3 falling ""below the middle of the range for such offences"" and Counts 2 and 4 being ""slightly more serious forms of such offences"" (ROS18). Her Honour found that Count 5 fell ""below the middle of the range for such offences"" (ROS20). These findings were not challenged in this Court.

129We have had regard to the objective gravity of the offences, the relevant maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods, the Respondent's subjective circumstances and the need for specific and general deterrence.

130After allowing for the 25% discount for his pleas of guilty (with some rounding), we consider that the following sentences are appropriate:

(a) Count 1 - the s.61M(2) offence - imprisonment for a period of three years, with a non-parole period of two years and three months;

(b) Count 2 - the first s.66A(2) offence (taking into account the relevant Form 1 offences) - imprisonment for a period of 10 years, with a non-parole period of seven years and six months;

(c) Count 3 - the second s.66A(2) offence - imprisonment for a period of eight years, with a non-parole period of six years;

(d) Count 4 - the third s.66A(2) offence - imprisonment for a period of eight years, with a non-parole period of six years;

(e) Count 5 - the s.91H(2) offence (taking into account the relevant Form 1 offences) - imprisonment for a period of four years, with a non-parole period of three years.

131It is necessary to consider issues of concurrency, accumulation and totality, for the purpose of identifying an appropriate aggregate sentence. The total effective sentence should reflect the Respondent's total criminality. The effective non-parole period must reflect the minimum period which the law requires the Respondent to spend in custody, having regard to all the purposes of sentencing: R v MA [2004] NSWCCA 92; 145 A Crim R 434 at 440 [33]. 

132We are satisfied that a measure of accumulation is appropriate in the circumstances of this case. The offences were committed over a period of months and involved different offences committed against the same victim. There is, as well, the child abuse material offence to be factored into an assessment of the Respondent's total criminality. 

133The sentencing Judge made a finding of special circumstances. It was not submitted in this Court that such a finding should not be made by this Court if the Respondent was to be resentenced. The sentences to be imposed will involve the Respondent spending a substantial period in custody. It is in the public interest that there be a significant period of conditional liberty on parole, to assist the Respondent to readjust to life in the community in a manner which, at the same time, serves to protect the public.

134In our view, the aggregate sentence should comprise a head sentence of 14 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of nine years and six months, with both periods to date from 14 March 2013 when the Respondent went into custody.

135We make the following orders:

(a) Crown appeal allowed;

(b) aggregate sentence imposed at the Parramatta District Court on 4 April 2013 is quashed;

(c) in its place, the Respondent is sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of nine years and six months commencing on 14 March 2013 and expiring on 13 September 2022, with a balance of term of four years and six months commencing on 14 September 2022 and expiring on 13 March 2027.

136The earliest date upon which the Respondent will be eligible for release on parole is 13 September 2022.

2705204,R v O'Connor [2014] NSWCCA 53,"Judgment
1R A HULME J:  I agree with Adamson J.
2DAVIES J:  I agree with Adamson J.
3ADAMSON J: This is an appeal brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP) pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against the sentence imposed on the respondent on 29 November 2013 by Haesler DCJ on the single ground of manifest inadequacy.
4Following a trial by jury between 7 and 14 May 2012, the sentencing judge, pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Act), imposed an aggregate sentence of 9 years imprisonment upon the respondent, which commenced on 31 January 2012, and fixed a non-parole period of 3 years and 10 months. The non-parole period is due to expire on 30 November 2015. The overall term expires on 30 January 2021. 
5The sentence was backdated to reflect the period of one year and about nine months that the respondent had spent on remand in pre-trial and pre-sentence custody following his arrest on 19 February 2011 before he was released to bail on 17 December 2012.  He was returned to custody on the day sentence was imposed, 29 November 2013.
6Pursuant to s 53A(2)(b) of the Act, the sentencing judge indicated the sentences that would have been imposed but for the imposition of the aggregate sentence:

7A notice of appeal was signed by the DPP on 23 December 2013 and served personally on the respondent two days later.
The Facts 
8The facts as found by the sentencing judge were as follows. The victim met the respondent in 2010. They formed an intimate relationship.  On the evening of 18 February 2011, they went out together to two local clubs where they drank and socialised. They returned to the victim's flat in the early hours of the morning.  The victim went to bed.  The respondent wanted to engage in sexual intercourse with her but she told him that she was too tired and was feeling unwell.  The respondent straddled her, put his hands around her neck and choked her, causing her to fall off the bed and hit her head on the base of a fan. This conduct was count 1 on the indictment.
9Ultimately, the respondent and the victim went to bed. The respondent fell asleep but the victim, who was upset, remained awake.  She woke the respondent and asked him to leave.  He refused. Eventually, the victim picked up a knife to try to get him to leave and started collecting his possessions to remove them from her flat.  
10At this point, the respondent put his hands around her throat.  He lifted her up from the floor and pushed her to a nearby lounge.  She described the feeling of being choked as ""a thousand times worse than the earlier occasion"".  The respondent said to her, ""I should have fuckin' killed you the first time"".  Eventually the victim lost consciousness from the force applied to her throat. This conduct was the second count on the indictment. 
11When the victim regained consciousness some time later she found herself in her bed. Her mouth was gagged with a bloodstained sock, her hands were tied behind her back with cable ties and she had urinated in her underwear.  The respondent slapped her face and said: ""Wakey, wakey"".  He removed her underpants, dried her with a towel and took off the dress she was wearing by cutting it from her body with scissors, leaving her naked, gagged and bound.  
12The respondent laughed at her and threatened her.  He removed the gag from her mouth. When the victim told the respondent that she was going to be sick he dragged her to the bathroom, where she vomited on the floor.  The respondent put her in the shower to wash her, and then took her back to the bed, wet, naked and still bound.  He continued to threaten her.  Eventually, she was so scared that she stopped struggling.  
13The respondent cut the cable ties that had bound her hands from behind. He then bound her hands to the front with a dressing gown cord.  He rolled her on her side and had penile-vaginal intercourse from behind. He withdrew his penis and ejaculated on her hip. This conduct was the third count on the indictment. The respondent undid the ties and left. 
14The victim was bleeding from the nose and eyes. She went outside and vomited. A neighbour took her to the Campbelltown Police Station.  She was initially too distressed to give a formal statement, although she told police what had happened. 
15She was taken to Campbelltown Hospital where she was examined. Her face and forehead were bruised.  Burst blood vessels, indicative of strangulation, had resulted in bruising around her eyes.  There were marks on her hands and wrists where she had been bound. She had vaginal redness.
Subjective circumstances
16The respondent was 30 at the time of the offending.  He had an extensive criminal history, both in New South Wales from 1995 and in Victoria from 1998, which involved several serious offences, including dishonesty offences, multiple offences of serious personal violence, as well as arson and other property damage offences. 
17At the time of the commission of present offences, the respondent was on bail for serious traffic matters. 
Post-offending events
18The respondent was arrested on 19 February 2011 and was remanded in custody, where he remained throughout his trial. Following conviction he was transferred to Parklea prison pending the sentence hearing. On 23 May 2012, about a week after the jury returned its verdicts, the respondent was assaulted in his cell by another inmate who hit him over the head with a sandwich maker. The respondent sustained a serious traumatic brain injury. 
The proceedings on sentence
19The sentence hearing commenced on 23 November 2012. 
20The Crown tendered the indictment, the Form 1 and a statement of agreed facts for the Form 1 offences as well as the respondent's criminal and custodial history. It also tendered two reports as to the respondent's medical condition following the assault in custody.
21The respondent adduced the following evidence which dealt with the injuries inflicted upon him during the gaol assault, the rehabilitation and therapeutic requirements for his optimal recovery and a proposal for accommodation were he to be granted bail to obtain such treatment:
(1)a psychological report by Dr Robilliard dated 14 November 2012;
(2)medical reports by Dr Gurka dated 26 October 2012 and 12 December 2012 (about the respondent's need for rehabilitation for his brain injury);
(3)a letter from Diane Martin of the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Unit dated 29 November 2012;
(4)an affidavit from Leanne Hall dated 7 December 2012 (as to his residence were he granted bail);
22As a result of this evidence the sentencing judge became concerned that if the respondent remained in custody he would not receive the optimum treatment to promote his recovery from the brain injury. Accordingly, on 17 December 2012, his Honour adjourned the sentence hearing pursuant to s 11 of the Act and granted the respondent bail.  
23The sentencing hearing resumed on 29 November 2013. The sentencing judge received further evidence from both parties before delivering the remarks on sentence and imposing the sentence.
24At the resumed hearing on sentence the Crown tendered two surveillance films. One showed the respondent riding a motorcycle and the other showed him walking up the stairs of a railway station texting and carrying a bag. It also tendered a copy of the respondent's criminal history in Victoria, a pre-sentence report dated 26 November 2013, together with a pre-sentence consultation report.
25The respondent tendered the following further evidence:
(1)Medical reports by Dr Nguyen dated 3 June 2013 (as to gains from therapy provided by the Liverpool Brain Injury Rehabilitation Service) and 15 November 2013 (update report), respectively;
(2)Medical reports of Dr Ette dated 30 October 2013 (as to the treatment that would be available to the respondent for his brain injury while in custody);
(3)Medical reports by Phillip Snoyman from the Statewide Disability Service within Corrective Services, dated 11 October 2013 and 21 November 2013 (as to the hardship the respondent would be likely to encounter in custody); and
(4)A medical information sheet concerning dysphasia.
26By the time of sentence, the respondent had recovered well from his injuries, and was able to engage normally in community life. He had some residual dysphasia which made complex communication difficult and frustrating.
27The Crown referred the sentencing judge to R v MW [2007] NSWCCA 291 (MW) and R v Cutrale [2011] NSWCCA 214 (Cutrale) as comparable sentences imposed for offences under s 37 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The Crown also referred the sentencing judge to Silvano v R [2008] NSWCCA 118 (Silvano) on the need for a causal connection to be established between an assault in gaol and offending behaviour before any such assault could be taken into account on sentence as extra-curial punishment.
The remarks on sentence
28The sentencing judge found that the events of 19 February 2011 were ""terrible"" and that the victim ""was subject to significant violence and terror and justifiably fought for her life"". His Honour considered that each offence required ""a degree of separate punishment"". His Honour noted that the respondent was on bail at the time of the offending which was an aggravating factor. His Honour found each offence to be ""objectively serious"" and found, in respect of count 2, that to choke another person until she lost consciousness involved the risk of death ""and must be regarded as a crime of the utmost gravity"". His Honour described the sexual assault as ""demeaning and brutal"". His Honour said, in respect of the Form 1 and particularly the aggravated break and enter, that the offences ""would have merited some measure of independent punishment upon which the present matters would be accumulated"".
29The sentencing judge found that the respondent's record demonstrated: ""a well entrenched pattern of criminal offending from since he was very young"".  
30The sentencing judge said, with reference to the respondent's record:""Generally such a record requires greater emphasis to be given to retribution, deterrence and community protection.  This background obviously would not merit any leniency nor would it mitigate offences which call for a significant severity.""
31In respect of the two s 37 offences the sentencing judge indicated the same four-year sentence for each count. His Honour nominated an indicative non-parole period of three years for Count 3, in accordance with s 44(2C) of the Act which require a non-parole period to be indicated only in respect of those offences, such as s 61J of the Crimes Act, for which a standard non-parole period is specified. 
32The non-parole period was expressed to expire on 30 November 2015. The length of the non-parole period accommodated the two-year period that the sentencing judge considered would be required for the courses the respondent would undertake in custody. It also served to meet the sentencing judge's concern expressed in the remarks on sentence about ""the additional pressure"" of being in custody during January as creating ""problems both for prisoners and Corrective Services"".   
33Of the 109 paragraphs in the remarks on sentence, [43]- [101] were concerned with, and entitled, ""The events of 23 May 2012"". The only reference to extra-judicial punishment in the remarks on sentence appears in the first paragraph following this heading:""Mr O'Connor was arrested on 19 February 2011. He has been in custody since that date. He was convicted after trial on 14 May 2012. On 23 May 2012 the offender sustained a serious head injury when assaulted at Parklea Gaol. It appears he was hit over the head with a sandwich maker. He spent 17 days in Intensive Care at Westmead Hospital, five weeks at Westmead's Brain Injury Unit and since 20 July 2012 spent considerable time at Long Bay Hospital. He was then discharged from the hospital wing and until December of last year was housed in the Metropolitan Special Program Centre, 'MSPC' Area 10, at Long Bay. There is no evidence other than that brief recapitulation of events to indicate that the crime committed against him involved any form of extra curial punishment: see Silvano v R [2008] NSWCCA 118.""
34The sentencing judge's concern for the respondent as victim was evident from passages such as the following:""This case presented a worrying example of the problems that arise when dealing with unbending bureaucracy, which is incapable of sensitivity to the peculiar and particular needs of prisoners. This occurred when this matter came for sentence on 23 November 2012. The warrant was clearly endorsed 'audio/ visual link (AVL)' but the offender was brought to Campbelltown, at risk to his physical and mental health. He spent considerable time in a closed van and in the cells below court. These things happen but there is a risk that similar things will happen again.""
35His Honour found that the recordings tendered by the Crown showed that the respondent had ""significantly improved physical co-ordination and can engage in normal community life"".
36His Honour referred to the pre-sentence report in the following terms:""It indicated that if he is to engage in sexual offender treatment while in gaol, that a considerable period in custody would be required. It notes that he is still in denial and that he still blames his victim; indicating that he may have some memories of the event or that he has a fixation upon some reconstructed memory. He notes that communication issues are still a day to day challenge but he is otherwise co-operative and open.""
37His Honour also said:""In conclusion, there are still some concerns about the offender. It is also clear he does not comprehend or understand the enormity of the crime he committed.""
38His Honour found that the injuries sustained by the respondent lessened the importance of both general and specific deterrence. His Honour said:""The evidence about his time on bail indicates that he can now lead a law abiding life in the community and he can use his time well. That provides a great distinction from his behaviour prior to and including the commission of this offence and his incarceration.
The sentence must do what it can to promote his rehabilitation. It must be recognised that the longer he spends in custody the greater is the risk to that rehabilitation. It cannot be ignored that these injuries occurred in gaol.""
39His Honour explained the substantial leniency inherent in the sentence about to be imposed in the following terms:Sentencing is not, and should never become, an exercise in simple mathematics.  When I did the calculations in this matter and formulated the sentence I believed 2 years more in custody before parole was possible was required.  I have also allowed the offender to be released prior to Christmas.  It has been my experience that the additional pressure of being in custody for a very short period during January creates problems both for prisoners and Corrective Services.  . . .Often sentences can be used as an indicator of the seriousness with which the court views the crime committed.  Sometimes as here, particular and extraordinary considerations mean such a direct correlation is impossible.  The victim should, as I said, never equate her injury with the punishment actually inflicted.  For these reasons I feel it is appropriate to note that the sentence that I would have imposed had the events of 23 May 2012 not occurred would have been significantly more severe.  The sentence I intend to impose is much shorter and the non-parole period considerably shorter.""
The Crown's submissions on appeal
40The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge attributed such disproportionate weight to the intervening assault on the respondent that his Honour allowed it to become determinative of the sentences imposed. It contended that the sentence was, as a result, manifestly inadequate to reflect the gravity of the offending conduct or the respondent's moral culpability. 
41The Crown contended that the respondent's crimes were in the upper range of criminality.  The respondent, who was on conditional liberty, brutally assaulted his partner because she declined his sexual advances. She suffered loss of consciousness and numerous injuries, including haemorrhaging to and from the eyes, ligature marks and significant bruising. It was an assault carried out over an extended period, in the victim's own home, by a person she should have been able to trust not to harm her. The manner of offending was calculated to humiliate her. The Crown contended that heavy punishment was called for.
Sentences imposed in comparable cases
42The Crown sought to make good its submission that the sentence imposed was substantially at odds with sentences imposed for similar offences by referring to the following cases which document the sentences imposed on offenders for offences which are similar in that they each involve male offenders who have committed violent, sexual offences on females in circumstances which involve, as in the present case, attempted choking, degradation and humiliation of the victim.
43In R v HQ [2003] NSWCCA 336 the applicant had pleaded guilty to two counts of attempt to choke contrary to s 37 of the Crimes Act and one of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act. The victim was his fifteen-year-old stepdaughter. The applicant was the only father she had ever known. The applicant woke the victim in the early hours of the morning and asked to touch her. When she refused, he threatened her with a knife, saying he would kill her, her brother and cousin. The applicant tried to touch his stepdaughter's breasts but she told him to leave her alone. He grasped her throat with both hands and began to choke her. He desisted, and again tried to touch the girl. When she continued to resist, he took hold of her throat again and choked her to the point when, unable to breathe, she lost control of her bladder and lapsed into semi-consciousness. The applicant then had penile-vaginal intercourse to ejaculation with his stepdaughter. She was left with haemorrhages to the eyes, bruising and swelling to various parts of her body, and tenderness and inflammation to her genital area. There were continuing psychological consequences.
44The applicant had a criminal history including matters of violence, although not sexual violence. He suffered from depression and was likely to spend his sentence in protection. 
45After a discount for the pleas of guilty there was an effective sentence of 13 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years and 3 months. The two s 37 offences attracted sentences of a 7-year fixed term, and 11 years with a non-parole period of 8 years and 3 months respectively. These sentences were accumulated by two years. A (wholly subsumed) fixed term of 10 years was imposed for the s 61J offence. The offender's appeal to this Court was dismissed.  
46In McKechnie v R [2006] NSWCCA 13, the appellant was convicted at trial of a s 37 offence and a s 61J offence. He attacked his victim, a stranger, on a beach. He grabbed her around the throat with his hands. He forced her onto the sand and squeezed her throat until she could not breathe and thought she was going to die. The victim resisted by scratching the appellant's face. When she ran away, the appellant chased and caught her. He forced her head into the sand and choked her. He penetrated her vagina with both his fingers and penis, to ejaculation.  The victim, who was extremely distressed, suffered injuries to her throat (bruising, reddening and areas of broken skin and bleeding), bruising and tenderness to other parts of her body, and reddening and abrasions to her genital area.
47The appellant had a lengthy criminal record, which included offences of attempted choking and other violence. He had been at liberty on bail and in breach of bail at the time. The sentencing court imposed concurrent sentences of 15 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years.
48This Court dismissed the appeal against sentence (and also the conviction appeal) on the basis that the offences were of great gravity, and a sentence that reflected the very great seriousness of the crimes was required (per Hall J, with whom Mason P and Barr J agreed, at [86]). 
49In MW, this Court allowed a Crown appeal on the ground of manifest inadequacy. The respondent was sentenced for one count of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act and one count of attempt to choke contrary to s 37. There was a further, related, offence of commit act of indecency which was taken into account in the sentence for the s 37 offence. The sentencing judge imposed a total sentence of eight years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of five years and six months.
50The victim was the respondent's seventeen-year-old stepdaughter. The respondent, who was 38, lured the girl to a reserve where he tried to gag her with a tea towel and tape, which he had brought with him. When the victim struggled, the respondent forced her to the ground and pushed his finger into the girl's vagina. He told her that it was ""payback"" for her mother calling the police during an earlier incident of violence. He threatened to kill her. The respondent was masturbating throughout (the Form 1 offence). The respondent tried to have penile-vaginal intercourse with his victim. When she resisted, he took her throat in both his hands and choked her until she lost consciousness. When she regained consciousness, she found herself semi-naked, lying under a pile of sticks in the reserve.
51The respondent had a long-term history of drug abuse, and was intoxicated when committing the offences. The sentencing judge found that his capacity for reasoning when committing the offences was impaired by his intoxication. He had participated in rehabilitative courses whilst on remand. A 25% discount was awarded for his early pleas of guilty. Special circumstances were found.
52This Court upheld the Crown's appeal noting that, even having regard to the early pleas, the sentence was ""excessively lenient"" (at [42]). Both crimes were held to be objectively very grave. On re-sentence the respondent was ordered to serve a fixed term of 6 years for the s 61J offence. A term of 11 years was imposed for the s 37 offence, made up of an 8 year non-parole period with a further term of 3 years. There was some degree of accumulation, resulting in an overall effective term of 12 years with a non-parole period of 9 years. The Court noted at [45] that the sentence was ""at the bottom of the available range""  because it was a Crown appeal, and would have been significantly greater if imposed at first instance.
53In Munn v R [2009] NSWCCA 218 the brain-injured applicant had been tried and ultimately sentenced for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s 59 of the Crimes Act 1900 and a further offence of attempt to choke contrary to s 37. He was ordered to serve an total term of 10 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months. The individual sentence for the s 37 offence was 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months. The sentence incorporated a 15% discount for assistance given to the authorities.
54The applicant and his victim had been involved in a romantic relationship for some time, although the victim had been seeking to end it. After the victim had again ended the relationship, the applicant tried to see her at her parents' home. She tried to forestall this by driving off, but found the applicant standing in the road blocking her path. The victim allowed the applicant to get into the car, intending to drive him away from her parents' home. During the drive the applicant began to punch the victim in the head. She lost control of the car as a result and, after a collision with another vehicle, the car rolled to a stop on the roadway. The applicant immediately grabbed his victim by the throat and began to choke her. He continued, even when passers by were trying to force their way into the car to stop him. The victim was seen to be frothing blood from the mouth, and her eyes were bulging and bruised. She almost lost consciousness.
55The applicant had a lengthy criminal history with many offences for violence or dishonesty. He was subject to a good behaviour bond at the time of the offences.  He had frequently been dealt with pursuant to the provisions of the Mental Health (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1900 (as it was at the time) due to the cognitive deficits that he suffered after sustaining a severe head injury as a child. He was considered to have frontal lobe damage, with consequent impairment of impulse control and related functioning.
56The applicant's appeal against severity was dismissed. RA Hulme J (Spigelman CJ and McClellan CJ at CL agreeing) said at [43]:There will be varying degrees of criminality in an offence contrary to s 37. In the present case the choking inflicted upon the victim was of such severity that she was rendered unconscious, the respondent believing that she had died. As a consequence of the harm inflicted the victim has suffered significant psychological injury. It must be remembered that the offence itself is defined as an ""attempt to choke."" When that attempt results in the victim becoming unconscious the offence is one of considerable gravity.
57In Cutrale the Crown appealed against a sentence imposed on the respondent after he entered pleas of guilty to one count of attempt to choke (s 37 of the Crimes Act) and one of sexual intercourse without consent (s 61I of the Crimes Act), which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment. The sentence imposed for the former was 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months. The wholly concurrent sentence for the latter was 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years 3 months. A discount of 25% was allowed for the early pleas.
58The 39-year old respondent had accosted a young English woman who was travelling in Australia as she walked from a taxi to her accommodation. He dragged her into a nearby park and, as she lay on her back on the ground, choked her so that she could neither cry out nor breathe. She struggled against the respondent and scratched his face. She eventually lost consciousness. On regaining consciousness, she found that her shoes and lower clothing had been removed and her top had been pulled up, exposing her breasts. Semen was later found in her vagina, indicative of intercourse. The respondent was crouching nearby, saying ""I'm sorry"". 
59The subjective case was limited: the respondent had a prior conviction for indecent assault interstate. No prediction could be made about his prospects of rehabilitation.
60This Court held that an overall term of 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months was ""insufficient to mark the gravity of these offences"" (at [34], per Hidden J, McClellan CJ at CL and Grove AJ agreeing). The sentence was quashed. The Crown's appeal was limited to the concurrency of the original sentence and not its term. This Court adjusted the commencement date of the terms which resulted in a total effective term of 11 years, with a non-parole period of 8 years and 3 months.
61In the present case, the Crown also submitted that the sentence imposed was insufficient to signify the community's intolerance of domestic violence. The Crown referred to what was said in Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38 at [55] (per French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Gageler And Keane JJ):A just sentence must accord due recognition to the human dignity of the victim of domestic violence and the legitimate interest of the general community in the denunciation and punishment of a brutal, alcohol-fuelled destruction of a woman by her partner. A failure on the part of the state to mete out a just punishment of violent offending may be seen as a failure by the state to vindicate the human dignity of the victim; and to impose a lesser punishment by reason of the identity of the victim is to create a group of second-class citizens, a state of affairs entirely at odds with the fundamental idea of equality before the law. 
The Crown's submissions about the individual indicative sentences
62The Crown submitted that his Honour must have failed to have regard to the 25-year maximum penalty for the s 37 offences, in light of his Honour's findings as to their seriousness. The Crown submitted that the end result was that the overall term was inadequate, with a further significant degree of leniency in the structure of the non-parole period, it being only 42 per cent of the total sentence.     
The respondent's submissions on appeal
63Mr Barrie, who appeared on behalf of the respondent, submitted that this Court ought not interfere with the sentence because it was an ""extraordinary"" case where the particular circumstances made the sentence imposed within the range, having regard to the intervening events.
64He also submitted that the respondent was a ""different man"" when ultimately sentenced than he had been when he committed the offences for which he was sentenced and that he had been rehabilitated, thereby obviating the need for a longer sentence.
65Mr Barrie accepted that it had not been submitted, nor did he submit, that the injuries inflicted on the respondent amounted to extra-curial punishment. Accordingly, he accepted that extra-curial punishment was not a relevant factor before the sentencing judge or in this appeal.
Reasons
The relevant principles
66A claim of manifest inadequacy requires the Crown to establish that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust, having regard to the principles that there is no single ""correct"" sentence and that judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with the application of proper principle and consistency of approach: R v Dinsdale (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]; Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 538 [58].  
67Whether a sentence is manifestly inadequate is a conclusion. It is not necessary to identify any particular error in the process; it is the examination of the result that leads to the conclusion. Nonetheless it can be helpful to ascertain why and how the sentence was arrived at since this inquiry may explain the conclusion and expose the reason for any manifest inadequacy.
Analysis of the approach of the sentencing judge
68The respondent's crimes warranted severe punishment and unconditional denunciation. The cases to which the Crown referred, which are summarised above, indicate that the sentence was well outside the range for similar instances of like offences.
69In respect of the two s 37 offences the sentencing judge indicated the same four-year sentence for each count. It is not apparent why the same sentence was indicated when, during the second of the two attempts to choke her, the victim lost consciousness and the sentencing judge described the second as one of the ""utmost gravity"".  His Honour's conclusion is not reflected in the indicated term for that offence. Nor does the sentence imposed appear to have taken account of the statutory maximum penalty for the s 37 offences of 25 years imprisonment.
70As to the third count, it is difficult to see how such a term could adequately reflect the criminality of the principal offence, even without regard to the offences that were before the Court on a Form 1 document.  The sentence imposed is difficult to reconcile with the sentencing judge's comment that the aggravated break and enter offence alone would have required additional punishment if dealt with separately.  However, in any event, the Form 1 contained seven further offences including contravention of an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order made for the protection of the victim. His Honour appears to have disregarded the Form 1 and failed to increase the sentence on the principal count, in derogation of the purpose of the Form 1 procedure: Attorney-General's Application under s 37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at [42]; Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115. 
71In my view, the aggregate non-parole period of 3 years and 10 months involved an inadequate degree of accumulation of the indicated sentences. The period of actual imprisonment for the two attempts to choke offences amounted to only 10 months (over and above the three year non-parole period for the third count).  Although the degree of accumulation is generally discretionary, the 10-month partial accumulation of the sentences for Counts 1 and 2 in this case was, in my view, manifestly inadequate in light of the maximum penalty of 25 years and his Honour's findings as to the objective seriousness of these offences.
72The aggregate non-parole period reflects a further reduction which appears to have been given by the sentencing judge at least partly on the ground that Christmas occurred towards the end of the non-parole period that would otherwise have applied.  I accept the Crown's submission that there is no apparent justification for this ""discount"". There was no evidence to support his Honour's concern about ""the additional pressure"" of being in custody during January as creating ""problems both for prisoners and Corrective Services"".   Although there is some room for mercy in sentencing, there is no room for sentiment. The timing of Christmas cannot, in my view, provide a legitimate basis for a discount on sentence.
73It appears from the remarks on sentence and a reading of the medical evidence that his Honour calculated the sentence so that the non-parole period yet to serve was two years, which corresponded with the period which would be required for the respondent to complete the rehabilitation programmes available to him in custody. This is consistent with the Crown's argument that the sentencing judge's concern for the respondent himself, his injuries and recovery came to dominate the sentencing exercise. 
Whether the sentence was manifestly inadequate
74It is difficult to see how the assault on the respondent could, rationally, have made such difference to the appropriate sentence, particularly in circumstances where the respondent did not contend that the assault constituted extra-curial punishment. The respondent had a lengthy record for serious offences. He had done little to address his criminal lifestyle. There was nothing in his history to suggest his prospects of rehabilitation (as distinct from recovery from his physical injuries) were anything but bleak. Ordinarily, there could have been little leniency extended to him in determining the sentences to be imposed for his terrible crimes. The respondent was assessed on a Static analysis as being in the moderate to high-risk range for recidivism. He had shown neither remorse, nor insight, nor concern for the victim, whom he continued to blame for his actions. 
75The respondent continued to maintain that the sexual intercourse was consensual. He maintained his innocence in his interview for the Pre-Sentence Consultation in late 2013. The pre-sentence report dated 26 November 2013 contained the following assessment of the respondent:""Mr O'Connor was co-operative in making himself available for interviews and providing information for the preparation of this report. He was open in describing his childhood and his behavioural issues. It would appear that he enjoys the benefits of a close family network. Mr O'Connor during interviews denies being responsible for the offences relaying that it was consensual and that the break and enter matter was perpetrated by the victim.""
76These reports showed that the respondent's attitude towards his offending remained constant throughout the trial, after he himself had been the victim of assault and after he had completed his intensive rehabilitation treatment while on bail. The submission made on behalf of the respondent that he was a ""different man"" after the trauma of the assault in custody cannot be accepted in light of the respondent's own statements. There was no evidence to show that his traumatic brain injury prevented him from appreciating the gravity of his offences, although it is possible that it may have affected his memory of them.   
77The sentencing judge was entitled to have regard to the potential difficulties the respondent would face in custody because of the lingering dysphasia that afflicted him. However, the medical evidence and the surveillance film established that the respondent had recovered well from his injuries, and that his physical rehabilitation had been reasonably successful. 
78In my view, the sentencing judge's conclusion that the risk posed by the respondent to the community was significantly reduced by the consequences of the assault upon him was not properly based in the evidence. I do not accept the sentencing judge's view that the yearlong crime-free period on bail indicated that the respondent had been rehabilitated. He had spent the year under close medical and family supervision and had, so far as the evidence disclosed, not been in an intimate relationship. That he would continue to blame the victim for his offending conduct is a powerful indication that he had not been relevantly rehabilitated at all, although he had recovered from his physical injuries.
79The respondent's criminal record meant that specific deterrence was of particular relevance. General deterrence remained of considerable importance: the respondent was not impaired when he committed the crimes. He had recovered well when sentenced for them. 
80I accept the Crown's submission that the sentencing judge appears to have been unduly influenced by the intervening assault on the respondent to impose a sentence that was manifestly inadequate, in terms of the length of individual sentences, the degree of concurrence, the non-parole period and the total term. 
81In the passage from the remarks on sentence set out above the sentencing judge referred to Silvano, which concerned whether extra-judicial punishment had been made out. James J (Hislop and Hoeben JJ agreeing) said in Silvano, at [35]:In my opinion, it is not sufficient to enable injuries suffered by an offender in prison to be taken into account as extra-curial punishment, that the injuries would not have been suffered, if the offender had not been arrested and remanded in custody as a result of having committed the offences. If such a connection between the offences and injuries suffered by a prisoner was sufficient, then injuries suffered by a prisoner could be taken into account as extra-curial punishment, even if they had resulted merely from some mishap occurring in the prison, such as the prisoner accidentally falling.
82However, it is possible that, notwithstanding that the respondent did not contend that the assault amounted to extra-curial punishment and there was no evidence aside from the bare chronology to establish that it was, his Honour nonetheless treated it as such and took it into account as a matter that warranted a significant reduction in the sentence that would otherwise have been appropriate. 
83Extra-curial punishment, if established, is a relevant consideration in sentencing. In R v Daetz; R v Wilson [2003] NSWCCA 216; 139 A Crim R 398, James J (Tobias JA and Hulme J agreeing) undertook a careful analysis of the authorities and said at [62]:I have concluded from this examination of the authorities cited to the Court and especially Allpass, Clampitt-Wotten and Cooney that, while it is the function of the courts to punish persons who have committed crimes, a sentencing court, in determining what sentence it should impose on an offender, can properly take into account that the offender has already suffered some serious loss or detriment as a result of having committed the offence. This is so, even where the detriment the offender has suffered has taken the form of extra-curial punishment by private persons exacting retribution or revenge for the commission of the offence. In sentencing the offender the court takes into account what extra-curial punishment the offender has suffered, because the court is required to take into account all material facts and is required to ensure that the punishment the offender receives is what in all the circumstances is an appropriate punishment and not an excessive punishment. How much weight a sentencing judge should give any extra-curial punishment will, of course, depend on all the circumstances of the case. Indeed, there may well be many cases where extra-judicial punishment attracts little or no significant weight.[Citations omitted]
84In light of Mr Barrie's concession that the assault on the respondent did not amount to extra-curial punishment, it is not necessary for this Court to decide either whether, had the assault on the respondent amounted to extra-curial punishment, the sentence would, nonetheless, have been manifestly inadequate or what sentence would, in that event, have been appropriate as a re-sentence on a Crown appeal. It is sufficient to say that I do not consider that, even had extra-curial punishment been established, the sentence would have been other than manifestly inadequate.
Residual discretion 
85This Court retains a residual discretion in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act to refuse to interfere in a sentence, even if error has been demonstrated and manifest inadequacy established: Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293; Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462.  
86This Court is obliged to consider the exercise of the residual discretion: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37 at [24]; Reeves v The Queen [2013] HCA 57 at [10], [12], [60]-[61].   
87Mr Barrie, on behalf of the respondent, submitted that it was appropriate to exercise the residual discretion in the present case because of the ""extraordinary circumstances"" of the assault on the respondent. I do not accept this submission. 
88Although the principal purpose of the determination of a Crown appeal is to give guidance to sentencing judges, the sentence actually imposed on the respondent is still of considerable importance. The need for specific deterrence in the present case would not be served by an exercise of the residual discretion. 
89Nor indeed would the need for general deterrence be fulfilled were the residual discretion to be exercised. The general deterrence of a sentence is not to be measured solely by reference to its effect on putative offenders. One of the purposes of incorporating an element of general deterrence in a sentence is to ensure that sentences accord with legitimate community expectations and that public confidence in the administration of justice is maintained: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [82] per McHugh J. Another associated purpose is to prevent the community from supposing that justice could ever require the infliction of extra-curial punishment to make up for any perceived inadequacy of a sentence imposed by a court. As Lord Lane CJ said in R v Darby (1986) 8 Cr. App. R (S.) 487 at 490:"". . . one of the objects of punishment and by no means the least important object of punishment, is to prevent, so far as possible, the victims of crime from taking matters into their own hands. It is no great step from private vengeance to vendetta, and there is no knowing where vendetta will stop.""
90Offences by men against women with whom they are in an intimate relationship are not a separate category, although the expression ""domestic violence"" is apt to imply that they are. The present offences were committed in circumstances where the victim refused the respondent's sexual advances. He took advantage of her physical weakness and the privacy that her home afforded him to assault, injure, humiliate and vilify her because she would not obey him or submit to his will. When she sought to remove him from her home, he was so affronted that he degraded her still further and satisfied his sexual desire after rendering her incapable of resisting him, escaping him or obtaining help.
91I do not consider that his Honour regarded the offences as less serious because they occurred in these circumstances. Indeed the remarks on sentence indicated that the sentencing judge regarded the offences as grave. However the sentence imposed was, in my view, such as to create the impression that the punishment of the respondent for his horrendous acts and the protection of the victim and others like her were of little significance when compared with the trauma the respondent had suffered when he was assaulted in gaol. This Court is, in my view, obliged to correct that impression by re-sentencing the respondent.
92In my view, the sentence that ought be imposed is an aggregate sentence of 14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years and 6 months comprised of the following sentences for the three counts:
(1)Count 1 (s 37): 4 years
(2)Count 2 (s 37): 10 years
(3)Count 3 (s 61J) (and Form 1): 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months.
93On re-sentence, the ratio between the total term of the aggregate sentence and the aggregate non-parole period conforms to the statutory ratio of 75% (s 44(2) of the Act) since I do not accept that there was a proper basis for the finding of special circumstances made by the sentencing judge. 
Proposed orders
94The orders I propose are:
(1)Appeal allowed.
(2)Quash the sentence imposed by Haesler DCJ on 29 November 2013 and in lieu thereof:
(a)impose a sentence of fourteen years to commence on 31 January 2012 with a non-parole period of ten years and six months;
(b)note that the earliest time the respondent is eligible to be released is 31 July 2022.

2705210,Health Care Complaints Commission v Black [2014] NSWCATOD 35,"reasons for decision
Introduction
1This is an interlocutory decision relating to the Respondent's application that the Tribunal not proceed to determine some of the matters before it - either by way of a permanent stay or by way of dismissal. The Respondent's argument relies on one or more of the doctrines of issue estoppel, res judicata and autrefois acquit and the concept of abuse of process. The application is limited to Particulars of Complaint that relate to two of the four patients named in the Complaint.

2The Respondent raised delay in bringing the Complaints, resulting in the destruction/loss of exhibits in criminal proceedings as a cause of significant prejudice. 

3Further the Respondent points to prior communication from the HCCC indicating closure of the investigation of matters now subject of Particulars of Complaint relating to one patient as a basis for the Tribunal to grant a permanent stay or dismiss the proceedings.

4The Respondent also submitted that concerns regarding bias of each of the expert witnesses relied upon by the Crown during earlier criminal proceedings was relevant to his application. 

5This Tribunal convened to determine a Complaint made in accordance with s145A of the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (NSW) dated 31 July 2013 by the HCCC to the Osteopathy Tribunal of New South Wales (as it then was) regarding the conduct of the Respondent with respect to four patients. By virtue of the transitional provisions, this matter continues before the Occupational Division of NCAT. 

6The Respondent has been self-represented and first raised these matters during a Directions Hearing. Both parties agreed that this issue could be determined on the papers and a timetable for submissions was set. Submissions both dated 24 January 2014 were received from the Respondent - although one is clearly in response to the HCCC submission dated 14 February 2014 and must therefore post-date that submission. The HCCC submissions annexed a copy of its letter to the Respondent dated 4 April 2000 and an Investigation Report dated 25 March 2000. In any case, the entirety of the submissions made by both parties were provided to the Tribunal on 27 March 2014.

7The Respondent makes no application with respect to the Tribunal proceeding on that part of the Complaint relating to the other two patients. Neither party made submissions regarding costs associated with this application.

What the Tribunal decided
8The Respondent's Application is dismissed. No aspect of the principles of res judicata, issue estoppel or autrefois acquit supports the Respondent's Application. The further issues raised by the Respondent did not provide a basis for the Tribunal to either permanently stay or dismiss the Complaints (or any part of the Complaints). 

Non Publication Order
9The Tribunal makes a non publication order to prohibit the publication of the name, address or any other material identifying any patient to which any facts of the matters subject of the Complaint made by the HCCC dated 31 July 2013 relate.

Background
10The Respondent has faced two criminal trials (one in 1994 and the other in 2011) relating to conduct concerning two of the patients involved in the events giving rise to the Particulars of Complaint before this Tribunal. The Complaint relates to the alleged conduct of the Respondent towards four patients. 

11With respect to the criminal trials, on each occasion there was a verdict of acquittal. On some counts there were directed verdicts. 

12On 4 April 2000 the HCCC advised the Respondent of its decision to terminate (in accordance with s39 (1)(e) of the Health Care Complaints Act 2003) its investigation into the allegations made by one patient against the Respondent. The HCCC advised it would take no further action as 'on the evidence available the complaint cannot be proven'. Section 39(1)(e) provided:
39 What action is taken after an investigation? 

(1) At the end of the investigation of a complaint against a health practitioner, the Commission must do one or more of the following: 
.......

(e) terminate the matter, 

.......


13Some of the Particulars of the Complaint relate to matters that occurred some forty years ago. These matters relate to alleged conduct towards a person who was at that time a minor. Further, certain items of exhibited evidence that were before the criminal courts have now been destroyed or lost.

The Respondent's Application
14The Respondent made application to the Tribunal to permanently stay or dismiss the Complaints in relation to two patients (the Particulars of Complaint relating to these patients forming a significant part of the Complaints) on the following grounds:

(a)By virtue of the doctrines of issue estoppel, res judicata and/or autrefois acquit as he had been acquitted of criminal charges in relation to these two patients, the Tribunal could not proceed to deal with any Particulars of the Complaints that related to these patients,
(b)the HCCC had already dealt with allegations made by one patient when it terminated its investigation in 2000, and
(c)prejudice flowed from the delay in bringing these complaints, in particular the Respondent is denied access to a patient's diary, a video tape and a large vibrator all of which were in evidence during one of the criminal proceedings.


Legal Principles
15The applicable principles are accurately summarised on the submissions of the HCCC dated 14 February 2014. Further principles applied are set out below.

Decision
16The Tribunal accepts the written submission dated 14 February 2014 made on behalf of the HCCC in totality.

17With respect to the impact of the prior criminal proceedings, the relevant principles may be found in the decision of the Court of Appeal in Health Care Complaints Commission v Litchfield [1997] 41 NSWLR 630, where the court distinguished criminal cases from disciplinary proceedings. The Court said at 634-635:

It is clear that the principles established in The Queen v Storey only apply in criminal proceedings between the Crown and an accused, and have no direct application where the double jeopardy relied on arises from disciplinary proceedings heard after an acquittal. ...
It is strongly arguable that there is no identity of parties in this case. The criminal proceedings were conducted by the Director of Public Prosecutions on behalf of the Crown. See Director of Public Prosecutions Act, s 7. These proceedings have been conducted by the Commission, which is a statutory body representing the Crown. (Health Care Complaints Act 1993, s 75 (2).) The Director and the Commission are both servants or agents of the Crown (Wynyard Investments Pty Ltd v Commissioner for Railways [1955] HCA 72; (1955) 93 CLR 376), but it does not follow that there is identity of parties. The Crown Proceedings Act 1988 s 5 (1), which prevents proceedings being brought against the Crown for a claim against a statutory corporation representing the Crown, may make them separate parties for present purposes. Compare Haines v Tempesta (1995) 37 NSWLR 24, Spencer Bower & Ors, ""Res Judicata"", 3rd Ed, 1996, pp 116-7, and Re A Medical Practitioner [1959] NZLR 784 (CA). 
Even if, in this case, the parties in both proceedings are the same there is still no res judicata estoppel. These are civil proceedings in which the civil onus applies as explained in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34; (1938) 60 CLR 336. See Bannister v Walton (1993) 30 NSWLR 699. Even if the factual questions were identical, the difference in the onus of proof prevents the issues being the same. Whether particular conduct has been established beyond reasonable doubt is not the same question as whether that conduct has been established on the balance of probabilities. Thus an acquittal does not bar civil proceedings against the accused arising out of the same facts. See generally Helton v Allen [1940] HCA 20; (1940) 63 CLR 691, Rejfek v McElroy [1965] HCA 46; (1965) 112 CLR 517. ...
The proposition that an acquittal does not inhibit disciplinary proceedings arising out of the same facts is well established in other common law jurisdictions. See Re Stinson (1911) 22 Ont LR 627; Re A Medical Practitioner (1959) NZLR 784 (CA); Bodna v Deller [1981] VicRp 20; [1981] VR 183 at 196-8; Basser v Medical Board [1981] VicRp 88; [1981] VR 953 at 971-2; and Saeed v Inner London Education Authority [1985] ICR 637. It is also sound in principle because both the onus of proof and the purpose and focus of the proceedings are different.

18As noted above, the Respondent faced criminal charges in relation to his conduct towards two of the patients named in the Complaints that are currently before this Tribunal. There were acquittals on both occasions. The alleged facts and circumstances forming the basis of the criminal charges have a high degree of overlap with the alleged facts and circumstances set out in the Complaints currently before this Tribunal, in so far as they relate to the Respondent's conduct towards these two patients. 

19However, it is well settled that the mere fact that proceedings in other courts or tribunals (i.e. other than protective proceedings in this jurisdiction) arose out of the same facts and circumstances does not provide a basis for a permanent stay or a dismissal. 

20Indeed, it may be quite wrong for the Tribunal not to proceed on these aspects of the Complaints where there may be a significant public interest in considering them. In the context of an application for admission to a profession in the matter of Jackson (formerly Subramaniam) v Legal Practitioners Admission Board [2007] NSWCA 289 the Court of Appeal clearly stated that the principles apply equally to disciplinary proceedings. At paragraph 34 Giles JA stated:

34 Because of the different burdens of proof, an acquittal does not bar civil proceedings arising out of the same facts. For the same reason and because of the different ""purpose and focus of the proceedings"", an acquittal does not inhibit disciplinary proceedings arising out of the same facts: Health Care Complaints Commission v Litchfield [1997] NSWSC 297; (1997) 41 NSWLR 630 at 635-6. No res judicata, issue estoppel, doctrine of autrefois acquit or other rule of law prevents examination of the conduct relied on for the crime: Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of New South Wales v Castillo [2001] NSWCA 75 at [32]. The facts can be investigated and determined adversely to the defendant or the person subject to the disciplinary proceedings, and the court or tribunal is not confined to the evidence in the criminal proceedings, let alone to an examination of the ""findings"" - a difficult task in the case of a jury's verdict. 

21The HCCC was not a party to the criminal proceedings involving the Respondent, nor were the criminal charges brought under any legislative scheme put in place with the primary function of protecting the public in a health disciplinary context. The jurisdiction exercised by this Tribunal is a very different 'cause of action' to a criminal court as it is protective in nature exercising powers in accordance with a wider, nation-wide health practitioner regulatory scheme. It is not punitive in nature - that is the role of the criminal courts. It is also not a jurisdiction where the rights of two individuals are being determined by an arbiter. 

22The Respondent submitted that the HCCC was a party to the criminal proceedings on the basis that the HCCC had written to him indicating it was proceeding with an investigation of the matter before the criminal trial had commenced. This does not, in any sense, join the HCCC as a party to the criminal proceedings. 

23The prior criminal matters applied a different standard of proof to that applicable in this jurisdiction (the criminal rather than the civil - Briginshaw - standard). 

24The Respondent also urges the Tribunal to consider the actions of the HCCC in 2000 (being the letter of 4 April 2000) as the basis for not allowing Particulars of Complaint relating to one patient to form part of the current Complaints. The letter from the HCCC to the Respondent dated 4 April 2000 indicates that it had decided to terminate the investigation with respect to the allegations made by that one particular patient. However, it does not, in the view of the Tribunal, operate to prevent the HCCC from putting these matters before the Tribunal at this time. These complaints were not determined or otherwise disposed of at that time. In the context of a protective jurisdiction, it is appropriate for matters to proceed where circumstances change. The HCCC has determined to bring that Complaint in the context of the complaints being made against the Respondent by other patients. 

25Assuming the Tribunal has the power to stay proceedings on the basis of abuse of process (by reason of the lengthy delay and loss of exhibits) such a decision would involve weighing a range of considerations in order to decide if the circumstances result it unfairness that was so oppressive that it ought be characterised as an abuse of process. The various considerations set out in cases such as Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378 and Litchfield were drawn together with great clarity in XG v Medical Board of Australia [2011] VSC 638. In that case Kyrou J listed considerations relevant to the weighing process where a permanent stay is sought at [10]: 

(a) the need to maintain public confidence in the system for the investigation of complaints against medical practitioners; 
(b) the public interest in the proper and impartial investigation of complaints against medical practitioners and in the exposure of malpractice by those licensed by the State to carry out invasive and intimate examinations for medical reasons; 
(c) the protective character of the disciplinary proceeding; 
(d) the importance of protecting the public from incompetence and professional misconduct on the part of medical practitioners; 
(e) the seriousness of the complaint against the medical practitioner;
(f) the requirements of fairness to the medical practitioner; 
(g) the length of any delay in the making of a complaint against the medical practitioner or in its investigation and the reasons for the delay; 
(h) the prejudice to the medical practitioner from a continuation of the disciplinary proceeding, having regard to matters such as the age and lack of detailed particulars of the allegations to be investigated and the medical practitioner's lack of records that may have assisted his or her defence of the allegations; and 
(i) the capacity of the disciplinary tribunal to give directions or to mould its procedures so as to ameliorate any prejudice to the medical practitioner. 


26The Respondent points to the passage of time and claims prejudice arising from the loss of various pieces of exhibited evidence that were before the criminal court arising from the allegations made by the same patient as referred to above. 

27The loss of primary evidence has been held not to necessarily render a trial unfair (see R v Edwards (2009) 83 ALJR 717 at [31]). 

28The HCCC point to the transcript of the extensive cross examination of this patient (the owner of the diary exhibited in the criminal proceedings that is now lost) that was undertaken during the criminal proceedings. This transcript is in the documents filed in the proceedings before this Tribunal. The Tribunal will have this transcript available to it in conjunction with the oral evidence to be called. The Respondent has not demonstrated that the absence of the diary gives rise to unfairness in this case. 

29The loss of various exhibits (the vibrator and a demonstration video) from the criminal proceedings does not prevent a fair hearing before the Tribunal. There will be ample scope at the hearing for a description to be given of the vibrator including the use of any photograph or sketch of it. The use of an item such as that may well be a matter that the professional members of the Tribunal have some knowledge. The absence of these items will not render any hearing unfair. The Respondent expressed concern regarding the knowledge of the professional members of the Tribunal. The Tribunal notes that these members are appointed in accordance with the legislation.

30The Respondent also alleged that there would be significant difficulties for his case if the Tribunal accepted the expert evidence of two people who gave evidence in the criminal proceedings. The Respondent asserts that these difficulties will arise because of a number of alleged circumstances including a conflict arising from having given expert evidence in a matter against one of these experts. The Respondent also contends that these witnesses are biased towards him and/or have been personally or professionally discredited to a degree that would make their evidence unsafe.

31The reports and oral evidence of these witnesses are included in the filed material relating to the criminal proceedings. The Tribunal notes the submission of the HCCC that these materials have been included for context and to assist the Tribunal in reaching an understanding of the outcome of the criminal proceedings. Further, the HCCC confirms in its submission what was said to the Respondent during two lengthy Directions Hearings that it does not rely upon on the evidence of these persons as its own expert witnesses for the purposes of the proceedings before this Tribunal. Rather, the HCCC has engaged other witnesses to fulfil this role before the Tribunal. The HCCC add to this submission that it is a matter for the Tribunal to determine the weight that should be given to any evidence. This submission is correct. It will be for the Tribunal to determine the weight to be given to the evidence in light of the evidence adduced at the hearing. 

32The Respondent also submitted that the HCCC position of not relying on these two earlier 'experts' but rather retaining two experts for the purpose of the Tribunal proceedings as 'wrong, morally and in law'. The Respondent points to the tainting effect the 'biased evidence' given by the two earlier 'experts' on the evidence of the two experts now relied upon by the HCCC. The Respondent also questioned whether there is expertise in the particular modalities of treatment he employs. It is the Tribunal's view that these are all matters that are properly left for the Inquiry. There will be an opportunity for the Respondent to test this evidence and to make submissions as to appropriate weight that can be accorded to it. 

33In his submissions in reply the Respondent alludes to there being some form of bias arising from the HCCC, the Department of Public Prosecutions and the Crown Prosecutor all being 'employed by the NSW Government'. The Respondent's submission is that the HCCC is acting unlawfully by attempting to 'reignite issue's dismissed on points of law by a District Court Judge'. This submission misconceives the distinction between different agencies, and the differences between criminal and disciplinary proceedings addressed in the cases referred to earlier. 

34The Respondent also provided considerable material in his submissions that may be described as attacks on the character and credibility of the two patients involved in the criminal proceedings brought against him. Any challenge to the evidence of these witnesses which is properly available to the Respondent is a matter for the hearing before the full Tribunal. It does not bear on the issues relevant to this interlocutory application. 

35In determining this application regard has been given to the principles concerning abuse of process as stated in Sudath v HCCC [2012] NSWCA 171 at paragraph 68 and following. 

36This is not a matter where the circumstances submitted by the Respondent result in a conclusion that the Tribunal cannot afford him a fair hearing. There will be opportunities for evidence to be tested and for submissions to be made as to what weight to be given to evidence.

37No basis has been demonstrated for the grant of the exceptional remedy of a permanent stay or dismissal of the Complaints in question. 

38As the parties did not make any submissions regarding costs this matter shall be reserved. 

Orders
39The Tribunal Orders:
(2)Respondent's application is dismissed.

(3)The question of costs with respect to this application is reserved.

		16 April 2014",2014-04-15 00:00:00,NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal
2705217,R v Mulvihill [2014] NSWSC 443,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1HER HONOUR:  On 10 March 2014 the offender was convicted after trial of the murder of Rachelle Yeo at her home in North Curl Curl on the evening of 16 July 2012.  She was aged 31.
2Murder carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  It also attracts a standard non-parole period of 20 years.  The maximum penalty of life imprisonment is reserved for a murder where the culpability of the offender is so extreme that the community's legitimate interest in a combination of all, or any, of the indicia in s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), each of which in different ways focuses on the protection of the community, compel the conclusion that the only sentence that can be imposed is imprisonment for life.  The Crown submitted that the murder of Ms Yeo, whilst an offence of very considerable gravity, was not an offence that could properly attract a life sentence.  I accept that submission.
3The standard non-parole period is the period during which a person has no entitlement to be released to parole.  Where it applies (as it does in this case) it represents a hypothetical offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness.  That assessment is confined to an assessment of the objective features of the offending under consideration.  The maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period both operate as legislative guideposts that inform the sentencing discretion (see R v Muldrock [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120).  
4The Crown submitted that the murder of Ms Yeo was well above the mid range of objective seriousness, falling just short of an offence in the worst category.  Whether that submission is accepted depends, in part, upon my findings on an interrelated series of factual issues not resolved by the jury's verdict, and which remained the subject of contest on sentence.  Principal among them was whether the offender was to be sentenced for a premeditated murder, a finding the Crown conceded was not necessarily comprehended by the jury's verdict.  
The events of 16 July 2012
5Ms Yeo lived in a unit on the first floor of a unit block comprising a total of seventeen units with six units on each of three levels (with the exception of the ground floor which had only five units).  Her unit was accessible from an internal staircase via a pathway on the western side of the building which extended from garages at the rear to a bank of letterboxes situated at the front of the building.  There was a dual locking mechanism on the front door of her unit consisting of a deadlock, operated by a key, located above a barrel lock, also requiring a key.  A security peephole was also installed in the front door.  The units on the first floor each had an external balcony located approximately 3.6 metres above a driveway which extended the full length of the property on the eastern side. 
6Ms Yeo left her place of work at Macquarie Park at 6.34pm on 16 July 2012 at the end of her working day.  Her manager, Renee Ward, gave evidence that Ms Yeo was in high spirits, planning to spend the night at home preparing a fancy dress outfit for an event at an upcoming conference.
7On leaving work Ms Yeo drove directly to Freshwater where she attended a yoga class.  En route to her yoga class she spoke by telephone to her father at 6.52pm and then again at 7.10pm.  She also spoke to Michelle O'Flaherty, a close friend, at 6.38pm.  Ms O'Flaherty gave evidence that in the course of that phone call she asked Ms Yeo whether the offender had been in contact with her.  Ms Yeo said that she had not heard from him and continued:
""[It's] waiting for what he will do next that scares me.""
8After her yoga class, and at a time when it would appear she was on her way home, Ms Yeo placed a telephone call to her boyfriend at 9.04pm.  He did not take the call.  He returned her call at 9.34pm.  It was unanswered.  
9Police arrived at Ms Yeo's unit at 9.25pm in response to 000 calls placed at 9.18pm and 9.19pm by her neighbours after they heard her repeated and increasingly strident screams for help, extending over a period of approximately ten minutes.  Ms Faletoese (a resident of the unit above Ms Yeo's unit) was first alerted to a loud scream from a woman some time after 9pm.  At about the same time, another neighbour, Ms Burrows, heard a woman scream, ""Oh My God, Oh My God"".  Ms Faletoese and her partner, Mr Gualtieri, went down the stairs to investigate, passing Ms Yeo's unit en route.  They heard nothing at that time.  When they were outside they heard the woman scream again.  They immediately tracked the screams as coming from Ms Yeo's unit.  They went directly to the door to her unit where Ms Faletoese banged and shouted, demanding for the door to be opened.  They heard Ms Yeo repeatedly scream for help and for the police to be called in what they described as a state of deep and escalating distress.  
10By this time Ms Faletoese and Mr Gualtieri were joined by other residents, including Ms Burrows, on the landing outside Ms Yeo's door where they heard sounds of a struggle that appeared to escalate in seriousness.  Some residents described voices raised in argument.  In response to Ms Faletoese continuing to shout and bang on the door for it to be opened, Ms Yeo was heard to say that she could not get to the door to open it.  One resident heard her say, ""He won't let me"".  The only thing the offender was heard to say (and in what was described as a calm and controlled voice) was, ""Everything is okay, you don't need to call the police"".  It was after that that everything went quiet, which prompted Ms Burrows to urge the 000 operator to have the police attend urgently.  The last sounds from inside the unit were described by another resident as a ""gurgling noise"" or a ""rasping for air"".  He said these sounds lasted for a few minutes and that they sounded as if they were coming from immediately behind the door of the unit. 
11After forcing entry to the unit, police found Ms Yeo unconscious, face down behind the front door in a pool of blood.  She was pronounced deceased by ambulance officers shortly after 9.36pm following unsuccessful attempts to resuscitate her.  
12Penetrating stab wounds to the right side of her chest and the left side of her neck were noted by ambulance officers.  Both wounds were associated with a considerable loss of blood.  Extensive lacerations and abrasions were noted on her face, hands and feet.  
13There was a considerable amount of pooled, expirated and transferred blood in the immediate vicinity of where Ms Yeo was found, in the hallway leading to the front door, and in the kitchen and living room.  Her clothing was heavily blood stained.  She had bare feet.  Her shoes were in the hall near her handbag, both in a state of disarray.  A bag containing her work clothes was in pooled blood in the kitchen.  Her mobile phone was also in pooled blood on the kitchen floor. 
The forensic evidence
14The results of autopsy identified the cause of death as either one or a combination of the two penetrating stab wounds.  The wound to the chest penetrated multiple layers of Ms Yeo's clothing before penetrating her lung and heart.  The wound to her exposed neck severed the jugular vein.  The stab wound to the right chest penetrated to a depth of 18 centimetres.  A superficial stab wound was located proximate to her right underarm.  A constellation of blunt force injuries and sharp force injuries was identified by Dr Van Vuuren (who performed the autopsy) with the greater concentration being on Ms Yeo's head and neck.  Professor Hilton (the pathologist called by the offender at trial) noted that the severe bruising on the bridge and upper septal area of Ms Yeo's nose indicated the application of severe blunt force trauma (consistent with a punch with a fist) and which would be expected to produce copious bleeding.  Both Professor Hilton and Professor Duflou (who was called by the Crown at trial) considered that the multiplicity of injuries and their severity overall indicated that Ms Yeo was engaged in a violent and prolonged struggle with the offender before she died.
15Although the subject of considerable contest at trial, it was conceded on sentence that the combined weight of the evidence of the three forensic pathologists allows for the positive finding that the wound to Ms Yeo's neck was inflicted first, followed by the chest wound, and that she died from cardiac arrest likely as a result of an embolism entering through the severed jugular vein.  That evidence, when coupled with the evidence from the residents of the unit block, also allows me to conclude that Ms Yeo died within a short time of sustaining the neck wound.  
16The order in which the wounds were inflicted and their placement is not only relied upon by the Crown as supporting a finding that they were both inflicted with an intention to kill, a finding of obvious significance to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending, but also as part of the factual complex relied upon by the Crown to prove premeditation.  The Crown submitted that by the infliction of a stab wound to Ms Yeo's chest after the wound to her neck (a wound which on the evidence was likely to have bled obviously and profusely, thus explaining the copious amounts of shed blood in the kitchen), allows for a finding that the offender planned to inflict two stab wounds to ensure that she was dead.  The Crown submitted that I would be satisfied that the offender's footprint on the hood of Ms Yeo's jacket was applied as he stood or knelt over her while she was on the floor at the front door, either as he stabbed her in the chest or after he had done so.  The Crown submitted that this wound was inflicted to satisfy himself that Ms Yeo was dead or dying and to ensure that she would not be able to open the front door, where he knew her neighbours were assembled, and name him as her attacker.
The significance of the white chain
17The offender's footprints, in Ms Yeo's blood, extended from the living room of her unit onto the external balcony.  His palm print was located on the railing of the balcony.  A trail of blood led along the driveway, towards the front of the property from underneath Ms Yeo's balcony.  Although the blood was insufficient for identification purposes, the only available inference is that it was Ms Yeo's blood, and that it was deposited as the offender fled the scene.  The defence did not contend to the contrary at trial.  Police also located a piece of white plastic chain approximately a metre in length and formed with elliptical shaped links, with each link approximately 3.5 centimetres in width, on the driveway in proximity to the trail of blood.  Ms Yeo's blood was identified on one end of the chain.  
18The white chain, and how it came to have Ms Yeo's blood on it, was hotly contested at trial, as were the circumstances in which the offender came to be inside Ms Yeo's unit.  Those matters remained in contest on sentence.
The offender's conduct after the murder
19It was not in contest at trial that a long-bladed knife was the mechanism by which the wounds to Ms Yeo's neck and chest were inflicted.  A kitchen knife of similar size and dimensions to one that belonged to Ms Yeo, which could not be located after her murder, was tendered at trial.  The expert pathologists agreed that the fatal stab wounds could have been sustained by a knife of that kind.  They also agreed that it could have caused the deep lacerations to the palm and outer aspect of Ms Yeo's hands, injuries that were described by Professor Duflou as ""typical defensive injuries"", an opinion shared by Professor Hilton and Dr Van Vuuren.  I am satisfied that the knife that was used by the offender to kill Ms Yeo was, in all likelihood, in her unit and not taken by the offender to the unit.  That does not, taken alone, lead me to have a reasonable doubt on the issue of premeditation.  It is, however, one of the factors that is relevant to the resolution of that question.   
20The offender disposed of the knife, together with his hooded jacket and shoes.  None of those items have been recovered.  He was captured on CCTV footage returning to the hotel where he was staying in Macquarie Park at 9.58pm, barefoot and wearing a T-shirt.  I reject his evidence at trial that he removed his shoes and his outer clothing as he drove back to his hotel because he was hot.  I have no doubt that he removed and disposed of them because they were bloodstained, and in order to conceal the fact that he had killed Ms Yeo.  I am satisfied that he disposed of the knife for the same reason.  
21The telephone call the offender placed to his wife at 10.05pm where he said, amongst other things, ""She's gone"", is also unambiguous evidence of the fact that he knew Ms Yeo was dead when he left the unit.  I reject the offender's evidence at trial that in using those words he was merely reporting to his wife that Ms Yeo would no longer be a factor to be contended with in their marriage because he had so seriously wounded her that she was unlikely to want to see him again.  The fact that he placed the call to his wife within an hour of the murder, implicitly admitting he had killed Ms Yeo, is difficult to explain consistent with the Crown case that the murder was premeditated.
22The offender was arrested by Queensland police on the afternoon of 17 July 2012 at Brisbane airport, after failing to board a flight to Brisbane scheduled to depart Sydney at 7.05am.  He was seen in CCTV footage in the business class lounge at Sydney airport eating breakfast at 6.40am.  At 7.10am he was seen in CCTV footage hiring a car from the airport which he then drove to Newcastle where he booked a flight to Brisbane, under a friend's name.  He also used his friend's credit card after telephoning him en route to Newcastle and falsely claiming that he had lost his wallet.  
23The Crown submitted that the offender's conduct on his return to the hotel at 9.58pm, together with his conduct upon leaving the hotel five minutes later at 10.03pm via the fire door exit, after a change of clothing and whilst covering his face, and then his efforts to leave New South Wales undetected the following day, was part of the evidence upon which I would be satisfied the murder was premeditated.  
24On 18 July 2012, after being returned to New South Wales in custody, the offender was charged with Ms Yeo's murder.
The evidence at trial and the jury's verdict
25The offender gave evidence at trial accounting for the extent and spread of the secondary injuries to Ms Yeo's face and hands consistently with his case that neither of the fatal stab wounds were the result of his actions.  He said the fatal stab wounds and secondary injuries were sustained after Ms Yeo produced the knife when, after she had allowed him into her unit so that they could talk about their relationship, an argument erupted.  
26By their verdict the jury have rejected any reasonable possibility that Ms Yeo was fatally stabbed by accident.  Their verdict also entails a rejection of any reasonable possibility that the fatal stab wounds were inflicted in self-defence.  Despite the offender's evidence that he did not inflict either of the two fatal knife wounds, manslaughter by excessive self-defence was left for the consideration of the jury, at his counsel's request, in accordance with my obligation as the trial judge (see Pemble v R [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107; see also James v R [2014] HCA 6). 
27The deep lacerating knife wounds to both of Ms Yeo's hands, and the severity and spread of injuries to her face and forehead allow me, consistently with the jury's verdict, to sentence the offender on the basis that Ms Yeo was killed in the course of a sustained and violent struggle in her home.  The jury's verdict also allows for a finding that the offender inflicted at least one of the two fatal stab wounds with an intention to kill.  
28Other facts, either deriving from the evidence at trial or the inferences to be drawn from that evidence, including facts which the Crown submitted were comprehended by the jury's verdict, were relied upon by the Crown in support of the submission that I would find that the offender meticulously planned Ms Yeo's murder, including his survey of her unit and the surrounds at 7pm, and carefully making arrangements for a false alibi in the likely event that he would be questioned when her body was found.  
29An additional issue in contest both at trial and on sentence was whether I could be satisfied that the murder was motivated by revenge.  The Crown submitted that the evidence establishes that the offender planned to kill Ms Yeo, both to punish her because she had terminated a relationship with him some months previously and had rejected his persistent and unwanted advances since that time and, in addition, to punish her for what he perceived to be her contribution to the end of his marriage, finally announced by his wife on 12 July 2012, and what he perceived to be Ms Yeo's indifference to his situation.
30The fact and the degree of premeditation or planning is a factor to be taken into account on sentence in assessing the objective seriousness of murder.  The collected authorities to which I have been referred by both counsel make repeated and uncontroversial reference to the fact that an unplanned, impulsive, or even an opportunistic murder, is regarded as less serious than one which entails premeditation or pre-planning.  
31It is equally uncontroversial that in accordance with established sentencing principle, any fact adverse to the offender and not otherwise comprehended by a jury's verdict must be proved beyond reasonable doubt (see R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374; 90 A Crim R 587), while any facts or matters relied upon by the offender in mitigation need only be proved on the balance of probabilities (see R v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270).  Accordingly, it is necessary for me to reconsider the evidence led at trial in so far as it informs the question of premeditation and the offender's moral culpability, and the competing submissions of counsel about that evidence. 
32It was the offender's case on sentence (at least as advanced by his counsel) that in contrast to the premeditated and motivated murder contended for by the Crown, I could not discount the reasonable possibility that Ms Yeo was killed in circumstances where, upon arriving home from work after her yoga class, and after she invited him into her home to discuss the end of their relationship, he was overcome by a sudden and uncontrollable rage when they argued about how their relationship ended and the attribution of fault in its demise, and that on impulse he used a knife that was in the unit and killed her.  Ms Traill submitted that although the evidence allowed for a finding that the offender planned to go to Ms Yeo's home in the evening of 16 July 2012 unannounced (and after contriving a means where he could later deny being there), I would not be satisfied he did so as part of a plan to kill her, but simply to talk to her. 
33Although the offender's explanation as to how he came to be inside Ms Yeo's unit on the night she died was very likely rejected by the jury, it is not necessarily a factual finding embedded in their verdict.  It was, however, and remained a factual finding integral to the Crown case that the murder was premeditated.  It remained in contest on sentence for that reason.  
34If I am satisfied, after reviewing the evidence led at trial and the submissions advanced by counsel in closing addresses (submissions which were in large part repeated on sentence), that there remains a reasonable possibility that Ms Yeo agreed, however reluctantly, to allow the offender into her unit, it does not necessarily follow that I would find that her murder was not premeditated; for example, were I persuaded, to the level of satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt, that his request to speak with her was simply a ruse on his part to get inside the unit and then to kill her.  On the other hand, even if after reviewing the evidence I am able to discount as a reasonable possibility that Ms Yeo would have invited the offender into her unit, it does not necessarily follow that I could be satisfied, to the requisite standard, that her murder was premeditated.  
Ms Yeo's relationship with the offender
35These issues, amongst others, fall to be determined against the background of a relationship between the offender and Ms Yeo that was at one time intimate and loving, but a relationship that devolved to the point where, in the weeks preceding her death, Ms Yeo spoke to family, friends and work colleagues about her gathering concern at the offender's repeated and persistent displays of obsessive behaviour, including his unsolicited advances and repeated attempts to contact her against her express wishes, to the extent where, in the week before she was killed, she sought the advice of a clinical psychologist to address her anxiety and stress.
36It is necessary to refer to that body of evidence, at least in a summary way, to make patent the basis for the conclusion I have reached that there is no reasonable possibility that Ms Yeo would have invited the offender into her unit after dark on 16 July 2012, in particular in circumstances where she knew she would be alone with him and where she was fearful of him. 37The offender and Ms Yeo were both employed by Sanofi Aventis - a pharmaceuticals company.  He was the National Pharmacy Channel Development Manager stationed in Brisbane while Ms Yeo was a Pharmaceutical Sales Representative also stationed in Brisbane until she moved to Sydney in April 2012 where she assumed the position of Product Manager.  
38It was common ground at trial that the offender and Ms Yeo had been in a sexual relationship, which the offender was conducting extramaritally and which Ms Yeo was also conducting whilst in another relationship, and that the relationship extended over a period of 18 months prior to January 2012 when the offender's wife learnt of the relationship after she chanced upon SMS messages on her husband's phone.  The evidence also established that their sexual relationship continued after January 2012, despite the offender's protestations and promises to his wife to the contrary.  Ms Yeo terminated her relationship with her fiancé in February 2012. 
39A schedule of telephone, email and SMS communications passing between the offender and Ms Yeo after January 2012 reflected Ms Yeo's indecision and prevarication as to whether, and on what terms, she might continue in the relationship with the offender.  That evidence also established that the relationship continued after Ms Yeo moved to Sydney in April 2012, when she had told her family and intimated to her friends that the relationship was over.  
40However, that same body of evidence also established that by 16 May 2012 Ms Yeo had made the firm and unilateral decision that the relationship was at an end, and that she took considered and determined steps on and after that date to make that plain to the offender.  There is no evidence that Ms Yeo initiated contact with him after 17 May 2012 and a considerable body of evidence that she actively avoided him, including ensuring, with the cooperation of her employer and her friends, that he did not know, and could not find out, where she lived.  
41By June 2012 Ms Yeo had commenced a new relationship with a man she had known for some years prior to commencing her relationship with the offender.  I accept that, by the time of her death, this was an established relationship incorporating future plans for work and travel as a couple.  It is not clear by what means the offender learnt of Ms Yeo's new relationship although, after an exchange of SMS messages on 4 June 2012 when they were both in Melbourne on company business, and where she repeatedly refused his invitation to meet with him, to the extent that she eventually told him he was making her anxious because of his persistence, he sent her the following text message:
""Not sure what you have to be anxious about. ?? New job, new city, new boyfriend, all your friends around etc..... You just don't get it !!""
42On 14 June 2012 Ms Yeo sought the intervention of the Human Resources Department at Sanofi Aventis when, after the offender's further unwanted advances and approaches were rebuffed by her, he threatened to damage her reputation in the company by publishing the SMS and email communications they had exchanged during their relationship.  On that day a member of the Human Resources Department contacted the offender and instructed him to stop contacting Ms Yeo.  It was after that date, with the assistance of the Human Resources Department and the concurrence of her manager, Renee Ward, that Ms Yeo took further steps to distance and insulate herself from any contact with the offender.  From mid-June she was advised by management that whenever the offender was scheduled to be in the Sydney offices she should work from home and, where possible, that she should leave the Sydney office before he arrived.  On those occasions, including on 4 and 11 July 2012, Ms Yeo was escorted to her car by a colleague. 
43During this same time Ms Yeo's family became increasingly concerned about her safety, including the lack of security at her home in light of there being no security door at the entrance to the unit block.  Ms Yeo's father twice encouraged Ms Yeo to report the offender's behaviour to the police. 
44Motivated by what I am satisfied was the offender's obsessive and vengeful behaviour, on 3 July 2012 he called a female colleague at Sanofi Aventis and, without identifying himself, claimed that Ms Yeo had been having an affair with her husband.  Although the woman could not be sure that the caller was the offender, she reported the matter to Ms Yeo who in turn reported it to the Human Resources Department.  
45On 5 July, whilst attending Dee Why police station to obtain a national criminal history check for scheduled international travel, Ms Yeo expressed concern to a police officer about someone she described as a work colleague who had become obsessive and hostile.  Ms Yeo told the police officer that the man had caused problems for her at work and that he had made threats, including that he would ""take [her] down and ruin [her] life"". 
46On 9 July Ms Yeo expressed concern to Ms Ward about the offender's presence at an upcoming work conference.  Ms Ward made arrangements for Ms Yeo to be accommodated in circumstances where she would not be on her own or in an outlying part of the conference centre. 
47On 12 July Ms Yeo saw a psychologist, Kerry Borthwick (having been referred through the Sanofi Aventis Employee Assistance Scheme), to address the anxiety and fear that she was experiencing as a result of the offender's conduct.  Ms Borthwick administered a Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale test which revealed that Ms Yeo had moderate depression, extremely severe stress and extremely severe anxiety.  Ms Borthwick scheduled another appointment for the following week. 
48The evidence also establishes that within days of Ms Yeo's murder, the offender's wife informed him that the marriage was over.  Mrs Mulvihill gave evidence that their attempts at reconciliation after January 2012, including marriage counselling were, in her assessment, marred by her husband's deceitful conduct and his persistent lies.
49The offender gave evidence that Ms Yeo telephoned him on 9 or 10 July 2012.  He then called his friend, Lynn Paisley, on 13 July 2012 to seek her advice about what he should make of the call and whether she thought it signalled a softening of Ms Yeo's resolve and perhaps a desire to reconcile with him.  Ms Traill relied upon this evidence to support the reasonable possibility that the offender went to Ms Yeo's unit on the evening of 16 July 2012 to talk to her and that she invited him inside so that they could talk.  In circumstances where there is no record of the call in question being placed or received, and where I consider it extremely unlikely that Ms Yeo would have called the offender for any reason, I place no weight on the offender's evidence that he received a call from her.  Although it would be open for me to find that reporting to Ms Paisley that Ms Yeo had called him, and then engaging in a lengthy dialogue with Ms Paisley about it, was part of his elaborate plan to kill Ms Yeo, I am unable to draw that inference adverse to the offender when it is equally consistent with his obsessive ruminations about Ms Yeo, even to the extent of fictionalising to others her continuing interest in him.
50In his evidence at trial the offender accepted that despite what he knew to be Ms Yeo's clear and unambiguous resolve to terminate her relationship with him in May 2012, and despite the fact that he knew that she had taken deliberate steps to ensure he did not know where she lived, he made the decision to go to her home and ""see her face-to-face to have that one last final conversation"", because he needed ""closure"".  He claimed, however, that despite coming to Sydney early in the afternoon on 16 July for the express purpose of confronting her, he only came to learn of her address when, somewhat serendipitously, after he arrived in Sydney he looked through the tinted windows of her car parked at Sanofi Aventis and saw an envelope addressed to her lying on the seat.  
51At trial he denied that his multiple internet searches from late May 2012 up to and including 3 July 2012 (including specific searches on real estate sites, Google maps and White Pages) were directed to finding where she lived.  Instead, he claimed, amongst other equally transparent justifications, an interest in Sydney real estate.  While there is no evidence in the Crown case as to when and how the offender discovered Ms Yeo's address, I discount entirely that he found it in the circumstances he claimed in his evidence as I do his evidence concerning the internet searches.
52I am also satisfied that on the evening of 16 July 2012 the offender went to Ms Yeo's home twice, on each occasion unannounced, wearing a dark jacket with a hood, and that he did so after taking considered and careful steps to conceal the fact that he had left the hotel where he was staying, including steps designed to permit him to leave from and return to the hotel without notice by chocking open the external fire stairs.  The Crown submitted that this conduct, graphically exposed by the hotel's security CCTV cameras, could have been for no other purpose than to construct a false alibi as part of his plan to kill Ms Yeo, well knowing that he would be the primary suspect once her body was discovered.  The Crown submitted that the offender's explanation, namely that he wanted to be in a position to deny going to Ms Yeo's unit in the event that she reported him to the Human Resources Department for going to her home to talk to her, was untenable.  I accept that submission.  In my view, this aspect of the offender's evidence (from which he does not resile on sentence) was a transparent attempt to deal with the incontrovertible force and damaging impact of the CCTV footage.  
53That conduct does not, however, compel a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was premeditated.  It is also consistent with a plan to force himself upon Ms Yeo at her home and then to deny being there.  However, because I have discounted the reasonable possibility that Ms Yeo invited the offender into her unit for the reasons I have discussed, it must therefore follow that he gained entry against her wishes, that being the only available inference for his being inside her unit at all.  I regard it as inconceivable that he would force entry or gain entry to Ms Yeo's unit by stealth simply to talk to her, or that once she found him inside her unit, or he forced her inside as she opened the door, she would be willing to talk to him.  If I am satisfied that it was in the course of Ms Yeo defending herself against an attack, or threatened attack, that he used her knife intending to kill her, then even if I am unable to find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was premeditated, to plan to attack a woman in her own home, and to use a knife with that intention, is a murder of very considerable gravity, properly positioned above the middle of the range of objective seriousness.
54Resolution of the dispute about the white chain is relevant to the question of premeditation, equally as it informs the objective seriousness of a murder committed without pre-planning since, on any view, the white chain was capable of being used as a weapon.  
55While it was no part of the Crown case at trial that the chain was used to inflict any of the injuries that were revealed on autopsy, the jury were invited to find that the offender took the chain with him as part of his plan to attack and kill Ms Yeo (perhaps to use it as a ligature or a restraint), and that once inside the unit, he determined instead to use a knife to kill her, but that the chain was accidentally dropped as he jumped from the balcony.  Again, although it is likely that the jury found that the white chain was taken to the unit by the offender (perhaps as a consequence of, or in the process of, rejecting his evidence as either untruthful or unreliable), a finding on this question is not necessarily embedded in the jury's verdict. 
56The Crown submitted that I would reject the offender's evidence that the white chain was not his and accept the evidence of the Mrs Mulvihill that she saw the chain (and a receipt for the purchase of the black hooded jacket the offender was wearing on the night of the murder) in his travel bag before he travelled from Brisbane to Sydney on the day of the murder.  The Crown submitted that to accept the evidence of Mrs Mulvihill as truthful and reliable leads inexorably to the conclusion that the offender took the chain into Ms Yeo's unit on the night that he killed her for use as a weapon, thereby explaining the presence of her blood on the chain when it was found.  The Crown submitted that finding would entail my rejecting any reasonable possibility that the chain happened to be incidentally lying on the driveway having been dropped or left by someone else, and that Ms Yeo's blood was accidentally transferred from the offender's shoe to the chain as he fled the scene in a state of panic, that being the case he advanced at trial.  
57I accept that submission as I do the evidence of Mrs Mulvihill.  Ms Traill's attack on Mrs Mulvihill's credit, no doubt on instructions from the offender, to the effect that she had fabricated evidence to falsely implicate her husband in Ms Yeo's murder to secure a property settlement in Family Court proceedings in her favour, was another attempt by the offender to neutralise what he knew was a most incriminating piece of evidence.  
58Ms Traill submitted that even were I to find that the offender took the white chain with him, I could not exclude the reasonable possibility that he did so to use it in some way to inflict violence on himself, or to feign doing so.  That submission was based upon something the offender said to Mrs Mulvihill when, in advance of the trial, they discussed the fact that she had found the white chain in his luggage and whether she would tell the police.  Not only was that conversation denied by the offender (containing as it did an admission that the chain was his), I am satisfied that telling his wife he only took it to use on himself was to conceal his real purpose from her, and perhaps to elicit her sympathy in an attempt to dissuade her from telling the police what she had found.
Was the murder premeditated?
59There is very considerable force in the Crown's submission that after resolving the disputed facts left undetermined by the jury's verdict adverse to the offender and considering the facts that are consistent with it, that I would be satisfied that the murder of Ms Yeo was premeditated and that the offender should be sentenced on that basis.  I am not, however, able to draw that conclusion beyond reasonable doubt.  I am, however, able to exclude any reasonable possibility that the formation of his intention to kill her was impulsive or spontaneous in the way those concepts are frequently applied in an unplanned murder or in the way contended for by his counsel.  Rather, I am satisfied, and beyond reasonable doubt, that the offender gained entry to the unit, armed with the white chain, either with the intention of harming Ms Yeo or threatening her with it, and, in the rapidly unfolding events as Ms Yeo sought to defend herself against his attack, he took her knife and repeatedly stabbed at her and in her direction, intending to kill her.  Furthermore, I am satisfied, having regard to the placement of the wounds that they were both inflicted with that intention and that the chest wound was inflicted to ensure that she would not survive the attack to identify him.  
60I am also satisfied that Ms Yeo sustained the secondary injuries, in particular the defensive injuries to both her hands, in the process of defending herself against the offender's attack and that, during the course of that attack, she was screaming and calling for help while the offender was actively preventing her from accessing assistance from her neighbours, either by restraining her or otherwise preventing her from opening the door to her unit.
The offender's moral culpability
61The offender's moral culpability for Ms Yeo's murder, which I treat as a separate issue from objective seriousness (see McLaren v R [2012] NSWCCA 284), does not require me to apply some hermetic seal separating what was done to Ms Yeo from why it was done, neither does it require any amelioration of sentence if the offender's motive is unclear or not able to be divined.  Were it otherwise, what might, in another case, appear as a random killing would be regarded as less morally culpable than a motivated killing.  For the reasons discussed, I am unable to find to the level of satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Yeo's murder was premeditated.  However, the offender's conduct in going to her home with all the pre-planning that entailed, and with what I am satisfied was an intention to intimidate, menace and attack her in retaliation at nothing more than her wish to terminate a relationship against his wishes, renders his moral culpability for her death of a very high order. 
62After taking into account all of the objective features of the offending, but absent premeditation, I am unable to describe it as a murder just short of the worst case as urged upon me by the Crown.  That should not be taken to diminish my assessment of its gravity or in any way to diminish the offender's moral culpability.  In assessing objective seriousness I have taken into account not only the fact that Ms Yeo was killed with a knife, and in her own home, as aggravating factors under s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act but also what must have been her extreme terror at being subjected to a vicious and sustained attack, and her indescribable torment when she knew there were people trying to help her on the other side of the door. 
Additional evidence led on sentence
63Prior to the convening of the proceedings on sentence the Crown notified its intention to rely upon evidence relating the offender's conduct towards his first wife, Celine Carroll, after their separation and divorce in 1991.  Acts of violence and threatened violence were detailed by her in a statement obtained by police in August 2012 when, after the offender's arrest, and with the encouragement of her sister, Kilmeny Molloy, she contacted police.  A statement from Ms Molloy was also obtained at the same time.  I am satisfied that the information they provided could not be said to have been influenced by the details of the offender's conduct towards Ms Yeo prior to her death as they were revealed in the evidence at trial.  Although their statements were served as part of the brief of evidence with an accompanying tendency notice under s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), the evidence was not relied upon by the Crown at trial as tendency evidence.  
64Reliance upon the evidence on sentence for any tendency purpose (or, for that matter, as suggesting any coincidence under s 98 of the Evidence Act between the offender's past conduct in forcing or obtaining entry to his former wife's home and forcing or obtaining entry to Ms Yeo's unit) was expressly disavowed by the Crown.  The evidence was relied upon for two reasons: first, to meet what was anticipated would be a submission put on the offender's behalf (as in fact proved to be the case) that he is not a violent person, has never been a violent person and has never threatened anyone with violence.  This submission was then relied upon by Ms Traill to support the further submission that the violence inflicted upon Ms Yeo in the course of which she was killed was out of character and that the offender should be sentenced as a person of good character.  The second ground relied upon by the Crown for the admission of the evidence was to assist me in making an informed enquiry into the offender's prospects of rehabilitation and risk of further offending.
65Given the controversy raised by the Crown's intention to rely on the evidence it was necessary for me to direct, in accordance with s 4(3) of the Evidence Act, that the laws of evidence would apply in determining the admissibility of the evidence and that a notional voir dire hearing would be convened in order to determine that question.  
66The proceedings on sentence were adjourned for six days to permit the evidence to be tested under cross-examination and to allow the offender the opportunity to consider his position and to call any evidence he wished to rely upon to both deal with the admissibility of the evidence, and, in the event that the evidence was admitted in whole or in part, to consider any evidence he might call or give to meet the potential of the evidence to inform the sentencing process in the ways articulated by the Crown. 
67The Crown called Ms Carroll and Ms Molloy.  They were both cross-examined.
68Ms Carroll married the offender in January 1989.  Their marriage was brief.  They were divorced in May 1991 after separating in about August 1990.  Towards the end of 1991 Ms Carroll detailed an incident where the offender appeared at the house where she was living in Holland Park with a friend of the offender, unexpected and uninvited, and in possession of a rifle.  The house was formerly their marital home and had not at that time been sold as part of the divorce settlement.  It was sold in August 1992.  
69Various other people were present at the house.  Ms Carroll gave evidence that the offender waved the rifle around (not necessarily directing it at anyone) and demanded to know what was going on.  When Ms Carroll attempted to leave, the offender grabbed her arm and took her car keys from her.  She said other people present were trying to calm him down.  She said she was only able to leave when one of the other people at the house, Brett Zegenhagen, threw her his car keys.  Ms Carroll took his car, drove to her parents' house and parked in a side street.  Shortly after that she received a call from the offender saying that he knew where she was.  
70Ms Molloy gave evidence that she was at her parents' home when her sister arrived in what she described as ""a state of terror"", reporting that the offender had appeared at her house with a rifle.  In cross-examination it was put to Ms Carroll that she was lying when she said the offender came to where she was living with a gun.  It was put to her that she had falsely claimed a memory of the incident.  Ms Carroll did not resile from her evidence.
71Mr Zegenhagen was called by the offender on the voir dire. He gave evidence that he could not recall the incident described by Ms Carroll in her evidence.  He said that were it to have occurred and despite the passage of time he would have expected he would recall it.  He did, however, in the course of his evidence volunteer that he was asked by the offender's mother to take a rifle that was in the offender's bedroom to the police because she did not want it in the house, and that he complied with that request without raising it or discussing it with the offender out of embarrassment.  
72Ms Carroll also gave evidence that from the end of 1991 and over the ensuing 12 months her car had at least four flat tyres which she noticed after leaving it unattended.  On the first occasion, the offender drove by and offered to help her change the tyre.  She also said she received a number of unsolicited letters from the offender attempting to persuade her to return to the relationship, including a card which said, ""Goodbye and good luck"", signed with the offender's name, and left outside her home.  She said that there was a bullet with the card.  She said in cross-examination she did not know whether the bullet was an implied threat to harm her or because the offender was suggesting he might harm himself.  Ms Molloy gave evidence that she was present when Ms Carroll discovered the card with the bullet, however, she recalled it being discovered in the bathroom cabinet. 
73In late 1992, after moving from Holland Park and whilst living with her sister, Ms Carroll arrived home one night with a male friend to find the offender hiding under her bed.  She described the layout of the house from which she concluded, as do I, that he had forced entry through a window.  Ms Carroll gave evidence that the offender said, ""What are you doing here? I am going to kill you"".  She screamed for him to get out and he fled down the stairs via an external balcony.  She agreed in cross-examination that she could not be certain whether the threats were directed at her or her male friend.  Ms Molloy gave evidence that Ms Carroll recounted that event to her at the time.  The culmination of these events caused Ms Carroll to obtain a Domestic Violence Protection Order.  She also agreed that there is no record of the offender threatening to kill anyone in her application for the order that was made after the incident.  The application was not in evidence.  
74After that incident Ms Carroll relocated to a unit in a secure complex.  Some time in 1993 she encountered the offender on the ground floor of the building.  He approached her, grabbed her around the throat from behind, and said, ""We need to talk"".  Ms Carroll screamed for help.  When another resident appeared, the offender released her and ran out the front door of the building. Ms Carroll reported the incident to the police who attended the premises an hour later.  From the upstairs window of her unit Ms Carroll identified the offender's car as it drove past the building.  She said police did not pursue the matter because they told her the person who witnessed the incident was not able to identify the offender because he had no prior knowledge of him.  In cross-examination it was put to her that the attack was a fabrication and that she was lying when she said police attended and that she pointed out the offender's car to them.
75The offender gave evidence denying most of what was alleged against him by Ms Carroll.  He said that he had an air rifle when he was a teenager but denied ever being in possession of a rifle capable of discharging a projectile.  He denied sending Ms Carroll a bullet or attacking her in the foyer of her unit.  He admitted breaking into where Ms Carroll was living in 1992, and hiding under her bed, but denied making any threats of the kind attributed to him when he confronted her and her friend. 
76Objection was taken to the admission of the evidence called by the Crown on a number of bases.  First, it was contended that the evidence should be excluded because it necessarily involved taking into account for the purposes of punishment uncharged acts which the offender has either denied or declined to admit.  This, it was submitted, was contrary to principle (see R v JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209; 112 A Crim R 466).  Given the limited purposes for which the Crown sought the tender of the evidence, eschewing any reliance on it as a circumstance of aggravation or as inflating the objective seriousness of the offence for which he is to be sentenced, I do not regard the evidence as inadmissible as a matter of law.  
77Reliance was also placed, by analogy, with the approach taken by McCallum J in R v Gittany (No 5) [2014] NSWSC 49 when the Crown sought to tender evidence on sentence bearing upon the question of premeditation which it had sought to lead at trial but which her Honour excluded because the Crown had closed its case.  When the Crown sought to tender the same evidence on sentence her Honour excluded it in the exercise of discretion under s 137 of the Evidence Act (see [35]-[37]).  The discretionary considerations which in her Honour's assessment weighed against the admission of the evidence are quite different from the matters I am asked to consider.  
78The exercise of the discretion provided for in s 137 requires, in every case where it is invoked, careful consideration of the probative value of the evidence in the context of considerations of fairness particular to the proceedings in which the evidence is sought to be tendered.  The evidence should only be excluded where the danger of unfair prejudice is outweighed by its probative value.  While McCallum J was persuaded that the admission of the evidence on sentence would have undermined Gittany's entitlement to a fair trial on the issue of premeditation, her Honour also expressed reservations as to whether the evidence sought to be adduced could be admitted for a non-hearsay purpose.  Neither of those considerations have any bearing at all on the evidence under challenge in these proceedings.  
79I am satisfied that any risk of unfairness to the offender occasioned by having to meet Ms Carroll's evidence many years after the events she described is countered by the need for me to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct relied upon by the Crown in fact occurred. 
80In the result, although the index of my suspicion remains very high, I am left with a reasonable doubt as to whether the offender came to the house at Holland Park with a rifle.  I am, however, satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he presented himself unannounced and uninvited on that occasion and that he inspired sufficient fear in Ms Carroll, and concern in the other people that were present, that she left in the circumstances that she described.  In addition, again although the index of suspicion is high, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender left a bullet at Ms Carroll's house or that he was responsible for letting the air out of her tyres.  In any event, even if I were satisfied that he left a bullet with the card, I could not be satisfied that it was intended to threaten Ms Carroll as distinct from it being a display of histrionics on his part.
81I am however satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the offender assaulted Ms Carroll in the foyer of her unit block in 1993.  The fact that there was no official record tendered by the Crown of Ms Carroll's complaint to police and her request that they attend her unit does not diminish what I regard as her truthful and reliable account of what happened to her.  I simply do not accept that in 2012 when, with the encouragement of her sister, she informed police of what she had suffered at the offender's hands at the demise of her relationship with him, that Ms Carroll (or her sister) had any reason to give false evidence.  Ms Carroll's demeanour (and that of her sister) in the witness box was measured and free of exaggeration.  They both made concessions where they could not with certainty attribute specific words or conduct to the offender.  The fact that there is no police record of the incident in 1993 (if that be the fact), may be explained for any number of reasons, inclusive of the failure of police to respond appropriately, even assuming that there might have been a concern about the identification of the offender.  I also reject the offender's evidence that when he came out from under Ms Carroll's bed in 1992, as he admitted he did, he did not threaten to harm anyone.  I accept Ms Carroll's evidence that he said the words she attributed to him, but accept her concession that she could not be sure that the threats were directed at her.  The fact that the offender was only prepared to concede that his admitted behaviour towards Ms Carroll on that occasion was ""offensive"", is not only consistent with his attempts to minimise or deflect any acceptance of responsibility for the effects of his behaviour on others but is, in my view, a telling insight into his prospects of rehabilitation. 
The evidence relied upon by the offender on sentence
82The offender's sisters, Donna Parker and Kelly Osborne, gave evidence for the offender on sentence.  Ms Parker was present throughout the trial.  I have no doubt that Ms Parker and Ms Osborne will continue to support their brother as he serves his sentence as they have, in different ways, supported him throughout the trial and the sentence proceedings. 
83Dr Furst, a forensic psychiatrist who prepared a report dated 2 April 2014 after conferring with the offender the previous day, also gave evidence.  The offender's subjective circumstances, and what Dr Furst described in his report as his demographic details, are generally supported by the evidence given by his two sisters.  
84The offender is currently 46 years of age.  He has no relevant criminal record.  He married his current wife in 1996.  They have three adolescent daughters who live with his wife in Queensland.  The dissolution of their marriage is the subject of contested proceedings in the Family Court.  Prior to his arrest the offender was living in Surfers Paradise in the matrimonial home, albeit separated from his wife.  I accept that he has provided well for his family and is a devoted father. 
85The offender was initially trained as a teacher completing a degree at Griffith University in 1989.  He taught in a private school in the United States between 1996 and 1997.  He played competitive football as a schoolboy and professional football in both Queensland and New South Wales until the mid 1990s.  He has worked in a management position for Sanofi Aventis since January 2007 after working in the pharmaceutical industry in Australia and the United States over the preceding decade.  His employment with Sanofi Aventis was terminated upon his arrest.  
86Although he reported to Dr Furst that on his own assessment he was well regarded by his colleagues, with his work recognised by the presentation of awards by the company, this was not independently verified.  No positive evidence of his good character from professional or sporting colleagues was called on his behalf.  I do accept, however, that his sisters attest to him being a person of good character and that they were shocked that he was charged with murder.  They both gave evidence that they have never known him to be a violent person.  While their evidence is entitled to some weight in mitigation of sentence, it is diminished in part by the matters I have found proved in Ms Carroll's evidence.  That said, I also note that there was no repetition of conduct of that kind in the interregnum between 1993 and 2012.
87The offender disclosed the breakdown of his marriage consequent upon the disclosure of his affair with Ms Yeo to Ms Parker in January 2012.  Ms Parker described the offender as being very distressed and out of her concern for him she maintained more frequent contact with him after that date, principally by telephone.  Ms Parker observed the offender becoming what she described as ""more and more depressed"" throughout March and April 2012.  Ms Osborne also gave evidence that the offender was devastated at the breakdown of his marriage.  Ms Parker gave evidence that when she met with the offender in May 2012 his physical appearance had deteriorated to such a point that she did not recognise him.  Ms Osborne also gave evidence of the offender's dramatic weight loss.  Ms Parker expressed her concern about her brother's physical and mental health and encouraged him to see a doctor.  During this time the offender repeatedly expressed to Ms Parker that he had ""nothing to live for"". 
88The offender's mental state examination on 2 April 2014 was reported by Dr Furst as evidencing intact cognition without any indication of suicidal ideation.  Dr Furst did note, however, that in some of the materials he was asked to consider, including medical records from a general practitioner in Southport with whom the offender was consulting between 6 June 2012 and 13 July 2012 (the Friday before the murder), the offender was reported to be suffering the effects of stress and mood changes because of the problems in his marriage and the separation from his wife and children as a consequence of having been required to leave the family home.  This attracted a diagnosis of depression by his treating doctor on 1 June 2012 which was treated thereafter with antidepressant medication.  Although the offender reported suicidal thoughts to his doctor in June 2012, and had apparently threatened suicide from time to time in various dealings with his wife, the notes also record that he denied suicidal ideation when he last attended upon his doctor on 13 July 2012.  
89I am unable to form any opinion as to whether the offender's threats of suicide were genuine at any time or, for that matter, whether the ""suicide note"" he emailed to his wife on the morning of 17 July 2012, before driving to Newcastle with a view to arriving in Brisbane unobserved, was genuine, or written and sent for some ulterior purpose consistent with his attempts to conceal his responsibility for Ms Yeo's death.  In short, although threats of suicide are a repeated theme, there is no evidence of any suicide attempt or any prevailing risk of self-harm.
90In Dr Furst's opinion, the persistence of symptoms of depression, diagnosed by the offender's general practitioner and treated with antidepressant medication, supported a diagnosis of a major depressive disorder, likely triggered by the breakdown in the offender's marriage and what he perceived as the loss of his relationship with Ms Yeo.  Dr Furst noted there is no indication that the offender had suffered from depression in the past or from any other psychiatric illness.  He went on to report that the offender received a psychiatric assessment on entering custody, where his medication was maintained on a decreased dosage, and noted that throughout his remand the offender's mood gradually improved despite the ongoing stress occasioned by the separation from his children.  The offender reported to Dr Furst that he consulted a forensic psychologist on three occasions in 2013 whilst on bail and attended at various medical centres for repeat prescriptions of his antidepressant medication.  No reports or clinical records associated with these attendances were tendered.
91Ms Traill did not rely upon Dr Furst's evidence to ground the submission that the offender's depression prior to 16 July 2012, or instability in his functioning in some environments in the months preceding that date operate to reduce his moral culpability for the murder, or to reduce the need for the sentence to reflect denunciation and punishment in accordance with established sentencing principles (see Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194 at [34]-[36]).  Neither was it submitted that his depression impacted adversely, or at all, on his capacity to make what I am satisfied was a series of calculated decisions on 16 July 2012 (and in the days before that date) such as might diminish the need for the sentence to reflect either general or specific deterrence.  I am satisfied in any event that the evidence led at trial is to the contrary.  According to Mrs Mulvihill and to Darryn Cass, a friend and work colleague who was in the offender's company for some hours on the morning of 16 July 2012, he was in good mental and physical health.  In addition, there was nothing in his presentation at the Brisbane office of Sanofi Aventis prior to when he left to fly to Sydney or his presentation following his arrival in Sydney to suggest any functional instability. 
92I do accept, however, that it is likely that the offender will have an ongoing need for medication to address his depression, and that he is at risk of an exacerbation of his symptomatology in a custodial setting where he will be separated from his children and where he will experience the full impact of the loss of family and career occasioned by his conviction and sentence.  I have every expectation however that Dr Furst's recommendation that he continue to take his antidepressant medication will be reviewed and monitored by Justice Health, as it was on his admission to custody.    
93The offender told Dr Furst that what he described as his problem with ""infidelity"" and ""the end of his relationships"" was, on his self-assessment, the reason he is being sentenced for murder.  He also said his many infidelities were as a result of his father's and his uncle's infidelities and the negative influence of older men he met playing football.  He told Dr Furst that he learnt from their example that infidelity was ""the done thing"".  It forms no part of this sentencing exercise for me to pass comment upon the offender's attitude to his marriage vows or whether, and to what extent, he has sought multiple sexual partners throughout his adult life.  The issue only arises because the offender detailed his past relationships to Dr Furst claiming that it was ""relationship issues"", reflected in part by his lack of fidelity, that is the explanation for his offending.  
94To the extent that what he claims as newfound insight into his attitude to relationships and how they end is relevant to sentence, and I am not persuaded it is, the constant theme in his account to Dr Furst and in his evidence on sentence was to deny personal responsibility for his actions and their effect on others.  At all events, his ""insights"" have no mitigating effect when he continues to deny that his attitude to relationships has resulted in the infliction of violence.
95Dr Furst's opinion that the offender had good prospects of rehabilitation, and that the risk of him reoffending appeared to be generally low, was based largely on the fact that the offender presented with few of the risk factors regarded as predictive of future violence, such as a history of serious violence, substance abuse, severe mental illness or personality disorder.  What remained controversial was whether and to what extent Dr Furst's opinion should be moderated by the view I have taken of the offender's past conduct.  Dr Furst agreed in cross-examination that his views as to the offender's future prospects hinge, in a very large measure, on whether the offender has any real insight into what he reported to Dr Furst as ""his problems in ending relationships"" and what he described as his feelings of insecurity and loneliness that surface at that time.  I do not consider that the offender has demonstrated any insight of the kind that Dr Furst saw as critical to his rehabilitation.  Not only did the offender maintain the position that he has at no time inflicted violence or threatened violence, and despite what he asks me to accept as his newly acquired and profound insight into the ""issues"" he has at the end of relationships and the importance of accepting when they are at an end, he remained unable to appreciate that lying in wait for Ms Carroll (conduct he admits) was anything other than ""offensive"" or, when pressed by me, ""very offensive"".  In so far as he has accepted responsibility for Ms Yeo's death, it was in such guarded terms that it does not evidence remorse as provided for in s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  He told me he accepted that his actions caused Ms Yeo's death, not because he attacked her with a knife, but because he should not have struggled with her over the knife when she produced it and that he ""should have handled the situation better"".  He also described his conduct on 16 July 2012 in going to Ms Yeo's home unit as ""inappropriate"" and ""wrong""; that it was ""inappropriate"" that he stayed in the unit after she had invited him in and they argued and that it was ""inappropriate"" for him to leave over the balcony.  
96In light of what I consider to be the offender's continuing lack of insight into or acceptance of responsibility for the extreme and ultimately fatal violence he perpetrated upon Ms Yeo, it is very difficult to make any reasoned assessment into his prospects of rehabilitation, but I am quite unable to accept that they are ""good"".  In my view, they are, at best, described as guarded.  That said, I accept he is not an unintelligent man.  It may be that in time a more realistic and sensible self-appraisal may surface.  I accept that he has made some attempts in prison-based courses to confront the reality of his situation.  I note Dr Furst's recommendation that the offender avail himself of the group and individual counselling offered by the Violent Offender's Treatment Program in prison.  I would expect, however, that acceptance into the program would require, as a bare minimum, the offender to acknowledge that he is a violent offender who requires treatment.  
97Given the length of the non-parole period that I will impose as part of the sentencing order, I cannot meaningfully predict the risk of his reoffending on his release (see Bugmy v R [1990] HCA 18; 169 CLR 525).
The victim impact statements
98I have received victim impact statements from Ms Yeo's mother, father and brother.  They each read their statements in open court.  Their statements were articulate and thoughtful.  They each gave evidence at trial with courage and dignity.  
99I accept without reservation that the circumstances in which their daughter and sister died has left a permanent scar on them as individuals and as a family, the ongoing effects of which they experience, and will continue to experience, in different ways.  I also accept that her death and the circumstances in which she died have impacted upon them physically, psychologically and emotionally.  I can only hope that at the culmination of these proceedings they are able, in time, to resume their lives as individuals and surviving members of a most loving family and with an untarnished memory of Ms Yeo as a loved daughter and sister.  I sincerely hope that the circumstances in which she died will recede from their memory although, I accept, they will never be erased entirely.  No sentence of imprisonment, whatever its length, can compensate for the loss of a loved one or even begin to address the grief and sadness that accompanies the loss of life and the anger that the death of a young woman should occur at the hands of another.  I do, however, take the statements of Ms Yeo's family into account in the way permitted by law (see MAH v R [2006] NSWCCA 226).  On behalf of the Court and on my own personal behalf, I extend my deepest sympathies to her family and others who knew her and loved her.  
Comparative sentences
100Both counsel provided separate schedules of sentences imposed for murder in this Court at first instance and considered by this Court on appeal.  I have considered that material in accordance with the approach most recently stated by the High Court in Barbaro v R; Zirilli v R [2014] HCA 2 at [38]-[40], where the Court endorsed the correctness of the approach in Hili v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520. 
101It was not suggested be either counsel that any particular case or combination of cases to which I was referred mark the outer bounds of my sentencing discretion.  To the extent that the cases evidence a range of sentences for murder committed in comparable circumstances to those with which I am concerned by offenders with similar subjective circumstances to this offender (a range which I have not been able to discern with any precision), I do not regard myself as obliged, by reference to the caselaw, to impose a sentence of any particular length or structure.
102I am not persuaded that special circumstances have been demonstrated to justify disturbing the statutory ratio provided for in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  The non-parole period I impose must be sufficient to reflect my finding as to objective seriousness, moderated to a modest degree by the matters relied upon in mitigation.  I am satisfied that the length of the parole period I will propose is sufficient to provide for the offender's adjustment to the community upon his release to conditional liberty.
Sentence
103Taking into account the purposes for which sentence is imposed, as reflected in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and utilising the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period as legislative guideposts, I impose the following sentence:
Paul Darren Mulvihill, on the charge of murder I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 29 years, comprised of a non-parole period of 22 years commencing on 16 February 2013 (to account for your pre-sentence custody) and expiring on 15 February 2035, with a balance of term of 7 years expiring on 15 February 2042.  You will be first eligible for release to parole on 15 February 2035.

		17 April 2014",2014-04-15 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705219,R v Olson [2014] NSWDC 163,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: I am going to begin these remarks by considering the position of Mr Olson the offender, not because I have overlooked the objective gravity of his offence, but because his offending needs to be put in context.

2Mr Olson was released from custody having served a sentence for robbery in company on 26 June 2010. He tried to get a job. He tried to get many jobs but was unsuccessful. He has no computer skills and indeed has no real skills which would make him an attractive proposition to an employer, having spent a considerable part of his life in custody. When he applies for jobs he tells people of his criminal history. When he applies for jobs employers, he says, respond by considering that they can get the work done by someone considerably younger at a considerably cheaper price. So Mr Olson's ability to get a job, which is an essential part of his rehabilitation, has been hindered by his lengthy criminal history. Of course he only has himself to blame for that and he himself does not blame employers for turning him down over and over again.

3Part of Mr Olson's problems and indeed perhaps the main reason that he continues to commit criminal offences concerns his long time problem with drugs and alcohol. On 30 July last year he was using drugs and drinking and committed an offence which he can no longer remember. He went to an adult store in Dee Why near where he lived. There was a shop attendant there. He had previously looked around in the shop and when he returned 20 minutes later he walked up to the side of the sales counter and the attendant noticed he was holding a steel claw hammer. The offender said, ""This is a robbery where is the money"". The attendant briefly grabbed on to Mr Olson's wrist before backing away. The offender came around to the attendant's side of the counter and began searching for money. The attendant told the offender that he was a trainee, that he had not sold anything and did not know where the cash was kept. One can only imagine the apprehension felt by the attendant who genuinely did not know where extra cash was, but who found himself in the position where the offender just did not believe him and he kept saying, ""You do know' and was searching through the drawers. 

4Eventually the offender turned his attention to the cash register and tried to open it but could not. He tried to force it open with the hammer but was unsuccessful. Eventually he picked up the cash register and pulled it out of the wall and ran out of the shop with it. A short time later police went to the offender's home. They executed a search warrant and they discovered the cash register, a claw hammer and clothing which had been worn by the offender on the day he committed the robbery. He was interviewed by police. At first he made no admissions but then once that first interview was completed he told police that he wanted to come clean. A second interview was held in which the offender admitted that he committed the offence in order to fund his drug addiction, being addicted to pills, benzodiazepine, Valium, Xanax and what he said was ""stuff like that"".

5The offender explained to police why he had changed his mind and admitted the offence to police. He said, ""I'm sick of the lifestyle, I'm just sick of my own cheating and bullshit and so I just decided to tell the truth"". Consistent with that attitude the offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. The sentence I impose upon him will thus be 25% less than it would otherwise have been.

6I should also refer to something else that happened in between Mr Olsen's stints in custody. In August 2012 he took an overdose of Rivotril. He passed out and was found by his ex-wife some days later. He was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital where he was treated for a significant period of time. He spent two weeks in intensive care. On discharge from hospital he had a number of ongoing complaints including damage to his cognitive function. He remains less than a 100% fit and that together with his age, now 48 years old, will mean that he does his time in custody much harder than he use to do it as a younger man. As he said in a letter addressed to me, prison is not a place for men of his age. 

7Another factor to be taken into account in determining the effect of the sentence of imprisonment which I must impose upon Mr Olson concerns the fact that he has been and is likely to serve his sentence on protection. Mr Olsen explained the differences between serving a sentence on protection and serving a sentence in the mainstream prison population. I have taken those differences into account in determining the length of the sentence to impose upon him. 

8Also in the letter written to me Mr Olsen makes repeated assertions that he needs rehabilitation rather than further time in prison. A number of things need to be said about that. Firstly even on protection Mr Olsen has access to rehabilitation services that he can avail himself of whilst in custody. Secondly on his release from custody he can be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service, and thirdly rehabilitation will only work once he decides to stop abusing drugs. As Mr Kozanecki acknowledge this offence falls and the offender falls squarely within the R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR346; (1999) 106 A Crim R guideline with the exception of course that the offender is not a young man with little or no criminal history. I have taken the Henry guideline into account in formulating the appropriate sentence to impose upon Mr Olson.

9Mr Kozanecki asked me to find special circumstances. The Crown did not speak in opposition to that finding. Clearly, as I began these remarks on sentence, it is difficult for someone like Mr Olson to re-enter the law abiding community in circumstances where it is difficult in the extreme for him to get gainful employment. He clearly, perhaps somewhat belatedly, acknowledges how much he has missed out through spending so much time in gaol. It will be not only in Mr Olsen's interests but also in the community's interests for substantial efforts to be made towards Mr Olson's rehabilitation. 

10Although perhaps general deterrence has slightly less of a role to play because of the cognitive deficits recently acquired by Mr Olson, it remains the case that personal deterrence has a very important part to play in hopefully persuading Mr Olson to avoid future misconduct of this kind. 

11I impose a sentence of imprisonment which consists of a non-parole period of three years to date from 1 August 2013 and a head sentence of six years. The non-parole period will expire on 31 July 2016 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

		13 October 2014",2014-04-16 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705224,R v Bevan Charles DOOLAN [2014] NSWDC 170,"Judgment

1HER HONOUR: The accused is before the Court in a special hearing pursuant to s 19 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, 1990 after having been found unfit to plead. 

2He faces two charges in an indictment dated 14 April 2014. The first is a charge contrary to s 98 of the Crimes Act, 1900 that on 13 December 2012 being armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife, he assaulted Michael Ryman with the intent to rob him and at the time of the assault he wounded that complainant. The second count, brought as an alternative, is that on 13 December 2012 he recklessly wounded Michael Ryman. No election has been made for a jury, and this special hearing is being conducted as a judge alone special hearing pursuant to s 21A of that same Act.

3Pursuant to s 19(2) of the Act, the purpose of this hearing is to ensure that a person who is unfit to plead is acquitted unless it can be proved beyond reasonable doubt, on the limited evidence available, that the person committed the offence or alternative offence as charged.

4When this hearing commenced the Crown tendered a folder of statements of witnesses whose evidence was not in dispute, and indicated that there were other witnesses who would give oral evidence. Amongst the statements tendered without objection were those of Constable Barry and Senior Constable Beltman. These were two officers rostered to perform police duties in the Redfern area on 13 December 2012. Constable Barry was working in a marked police vehicle from Redfern Local Area Command, rostered to work between 8am and 6pm and Senior Constable Beltman was working as part of a plain-clothes bike crew, also from the Redfern LAC.

5Their statements were tendered without objection initially. Constable Barry had been called to attend the scene of the accused's arrest by Constable Beltman at about 10.45am on 13 December 2012 at 6/6 Redfern Street Redfern. When Constable Beltman was on duty in Redfern that morning, and at about 10.30am, he had received an image on his personal mobile phone which was one taken from closed circuit television inside the lift at 55 Moorehead Street Redfern earlier that day, being the premises at which the offences, the subject of these charges, were committed.

6Senior Constable Beltman was told that the person depicted in that image was wanted in connection with a stabbing that had occurred there earlier in the day and that he may be living at 55 Walker Street Redfern. He patrolled the area near 55 Walker Street at about 10.45am. I accept that he did not necessarily expect to see the person depicted in the photograph there, but that this photograph was one of a number he had been given that day to have with him during his shift with the intention that, should he recognise any of the persons depicted in those photographs, he would take some action.

7He saw the accused in the vicinity 55 Walker Street and formed the view, I accept from the version of the statement tendered on the voir dire, and in any event from the evidence given by Constable Beltman on the voir dire, that the person whose photo he had been given from the CCTV footage was the accused, who he could then see in the vicinity of 55 Walker Street. He saw the accused walk to the rear yard of 6 Redfern Street and he followed him, approached him and asked his name. I accept that at the time he in fact believed that it was the same person he had seen in the photo from the CCTV footage, and was firmed in that view because of a distinctive tattoo he saw in that photograph and on the person he could see at 55 Walker Street.

8Constable Beltman immediately arrested the accused, told him he was under arrest for a stabbing and cautioned him. He had already recognised that the person was a person of Aboriginal appearance. He asked him to take a seat whilst he waited for a caged truck, and that brought Constable Barry to the scene as well in a Redfern vehicle, with handcuffs. After arresting him, and whilst waiting for the handcuffs and the caged truck, Senior Constable Beltman saw that the accused had blood on his hands and fingernails which appeared fresh, and again cautioned him.

9It is the question and answer, at this stage that is the subject matter of the first challenge. He said to him, 

""Were you involved in a row today morning at number 55 Moorehead Street?"" 

and the answer he was given by the accused was, 

""Yeah, I had a fight there this morning."" 

He then took a photograph of his hands with his mobile phone. 

10After Constable Barry arrived she gave handcuffs to Senior Constable Beltman and he then placed them on the accused. He had already arrested the accused, I accept from the context of his evidence and statement, and in fact from exhibit B on the voir dire, that is that version of his statement on the voir dire, I accept that Senior Constable Beltman knew that the person was in fact Bevan Doolan, this accused, and that was the reason why he arrested him immediately on confronting him at 6/6 Redfern Street. 

11At that stage Senior Constable Beltman's obligation was either to take the arrested person immediately to a police station to be charged, or to arrange for that to occur. He did the latter by calling for a caged truck. Senior Constable Beltman was on a bicycle and so therefore could not do that himself. The accused was not putting up any resistance and was sitting on the ground waiting. It was whilst he was waiting for the caged truck that Beltman noticed the blood on his hands and took a photo of them and the conversation occurred which is the subject matter of part of this challenge. Taking the photograph it seems to me would appear to have been an appropriate thing to do in the circumstances and came in any event after issuing another caution. 

12However he went further and asked questions specifically directed to investigating the accused's involvement in the offence namely, 

""Were you involved in a row today morning at number 55 Moorehead Road?""

which produced the response. 

13That conversation was not tape-recorded. I accept on the evidence that Senior Constable Beltman did not have a tape recorder with him and, whilst he had a personal mobile phone which he used to take a photograph of the accused's hands, I accept that there is an instruction by the police management given to officers not to use their personal mobile phones on duty to record conversation at the scene of arrest or with offenders. I accept from the evidence given that this is to avoid the problem of personal mobile phones being subpoenaed on subsequent occasions. That is an operational decision taken by the Police Service, just as it is an operational decision that officers on general duties such as Constables Beltman and Barry are not provided with tape recording devices to use during the course of these general duties. 

14There are no doubt operational reasons for this decision, just as there are operational reasons for the fact that similar devices are in fact provided to all highway patrol vehicles so that the initial interaction between any highway patrol officer and a member of the public is always video and sound recorded. What those operational reasons are, for not issuing tape recorders to officers on general duties, is not before me in evidence, nor does it seem to me to be relevant. The fact is that neither Constable Beltman nor Barry had a tape recorder.

15After Constable Barry arrived and gave Beltman the handcuffs he placed them on the accused and according to the statement of Constable Barry then repeated the arrest procedure. Just why that was necessary is far from clear because he had already arrested the accused. But in any event he arrested him again telling him that it was for an incident that had occurred at 55 Moorehead Street that morning and again cautioned him. 

16He then went on to question him further asking him where he had come from and where he had been before that after receiving the response that he had come from his mother's place. The conversation that then follows is recorded in the statement of Constable Barry on pp 2 and 3 and is the subject matter of the second part of this challenge to admissibility. None of this conversation was tape recorded either by any of the officers at the scene. 

17During this conversation the accused said that he had had an argument with the person he described as ""matey"", that that person had head butted him and that he had stabbed him. Officer Barry made notes of the conversation in her notebook and showed it to other officers at the scene who read them and one of them signed the top of those notes. No one asked the accused apparently to either read or sign the notebook entry. 

18The caged truck then took the accused to Redfern Police Station. I accept that at Redfern Police Station the accused was entered into custody-by-custody Sergeant Howle who notified the Aboriginal Legal Service and informed the accused of his rights under Part 9 of LEPRA. His hands were bagged for later forensic examination. The copy of the Part 9 LEPRA rights is exhibit 2 on this voir dire, not signed by the accused because his hands were bagged, but nonetheless I accept having been provided to him by Custody Sergeant Howle. She also organised for a disability support worker to attend that being the person identified in the record as Mitch Fraser who now is known as Mitch Mulqueen and who has given evidence on this voir dire.

19I infer from the fact that the custody sergeant notified both the Aboriginal Legal Service and Ms Mulqueen that she was able to identify that the accused was both an Aboriginal person and also a person with an intellectual disability. As such under the provisions of LEPRA there are certain additional rights afforded to an accused person in custody in those positions. 

20The accused was in the dock at Redfern Police Station following his initial interaction with the custody sergeant. The officer-in-charge of this investigation, Detective Sergeant Walker, initially spoke to the custody sergeant and was informed that the ALS had spoken to the accused and then spoke to the accused in the dock. He was carrying a hand held voice recorder at the time. He had some conversation with the accused, which is the subject of some other objections and will be the subject of later determinations by me. 

21Of relevance to his initial part of the voir dire however is that he did not during the conversation he had with the accused and which is recorded by him and tendered on this voir dire, ask him to adopt the admission made at the scene of the arrest to Senior Constable Beltman and Constable Barry. It may be, on the evidence, that he did not know the specifics of those admissions but I accept from Detective Sergeant Walker's statement that he had at the very least been informed that the accused had made admissions at the time of his arrest. I also accept that at the very least he knew that the accused was Aboriginal and possibly ought to have known that he had an intellectual disability given that the custody sergeant had already apparently arranged for a disability support worker to attend. 

22There is objection on behalf of the accused to the admissibility of the answers given by the accused to the police at the scene of the actual arrest by Constable Beltman alone and then the re-arrest and interaction of Beltman and Barry shortly afterwards. 

23The Crown seeks to rely on what is recorded of those conversations as admissions. The objection is taken to their admission because they were not tape-recorded and as argued there is no reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording could not be made. Thus it is an objection contrary to s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1986, which requires that in such circumstances any statements alleged to be admissions must be presented to the Court by way of a tape recording unless the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording could not be made. In this case there is no doubt that what was said to Constable Barry and Senior Constable Beltman was not tape-recorded. The issue to determine therefore is whether or not there was any reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording could not be made.

24The Crown seeks to rely on what was said to Beltman at the time he noticed the blood on the hands of the accused and what was later said to Beltman in the presence of Barry and others as admissions of the accused's presence at the scene of the offence and of having been involved in an altercation with the victim during which he stabbed him. Initially there was no objection to this evidence being admitted because it appeared to raise an issue of self defence in circumstances where counsel for the accused felt obliged to pursue this on behalf of the accused, again in circumstances where she is not permitted to obtain instructions. This would appear to have been a decision made on the basis of what was expected to be given as evidence by the complainant.

25However, when the complainant was called to give evidence as the first oral witness, during the course of his cross-examination, his evidence was that the person who had come up in the lift with him that morning, not long before the offence was committed, was not in fact the accused sitting in the dock, but in any event that the person who had been in the lift with him did not follow him to his door and that he did not see where the person had come from who had attacked him.

26The Crown was given leave pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act, 1995 to cross-examine the complainant in the light of this evidence, but his evidence became even more unfavourable to the Crown because during the course of that cross-examination he went further and said that the person who had come up in the lift with him and who, on the closed circuit television recording could be seen getting out of the lift immediately behind him and apparently walking in the same direction, did not in fact follow him to his door but stopped outside the adjacent lift, there being two lifts immediately beside each other.

27That evidence of course in the trial in due course must be assessed as to its weight and viewed in the light of the fact that the complainant is a person who suffers from schizophrenia requiring medication, that he made a statement initially that the person in the lift was the person who attacked him and that the blood found on the hands of the accused matched the DNA of the complainant.

28Nonetheless once that evidence was given by the complainant, counsel for the accused sought that the admissions previously tendered without objection through the statements of Constables Barry and Beltman be withdrawn from me as the tribunal of fact and be ruled inadmissible pursuant to s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1986. This course would normally not be expected to occur in any trial because instructions could be and ought to have been obtained from an accused person and acted on, but in this case it is not possible and counsel is in a difficult position attempting to test the evidence on behalf of the accused without the benefit of instructions.

29So then I come to the subject matter of the first part of this voir dire, namely an objection to the admission of the conversations had with the accused by Constables Beltman and Barry. They are admissions as defined in the Evidence Act, 1995 and they are sought to be relied on by the Crown. There is no tape-recording of them. Thus, as a first point, they are not admissible pursuant to the provisions of s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1986. They may become admissible if there was a reasonable excuse for not tape recording them.

30Section 281 (4) defines reasonable excuse as including a mechanical failure or a refusal to have questions electronically recorded. Neither of those applies here. It also includes the lack of availability of recording equipment within a period in which it would be reasonable to detain the person being questioned. I do not understand that to have been argued in this case.

31It is somewhat difficult to determine exactly the basis on which the Crown, if at all, seeks to establish reasonable excuse here, but on whatever basis that might be I do not accept that a reasonable excuse for not tape recording these conversations has been established. The fact that the second conversation in the presence of Constable Barry was recorded in a police notebook does not overcome the provisions of s 281.

32The fact is, that for operational reasons, officers on general duties are not provided with hand held tape recorders. That means that they should not be investigating the circumstances of an offence beyond satisfying themselves of the identity of an individual and forming sufficient grounds for arresting a person for an offence, because it means that they will never be able to comply with s 281 using approved equipment, or at all if they follow instructions not to use personal equipment.

33By extension, that means further, that their obligation is therefore to arrest and then take the arrested person immediately to a police station without further questioning so that the provisions of LEPRA can be properly put in place. That is particularly so if an arrested person falls into one of the special categories referred to in part 9 of LEPRA which includes juveniles, Aboriginal people and people with various disabilities. There are good policy reasons for this and good reasons why compliance with s 281 is mandatory and does not involve the exercise of discretion.

34In fact, anywhere in Redfern and Waterloo is no more than about 2 kilometres from Redfern Police Station. There is a significant police presence in that area, as the facts of this case attest. It is not difficult to convey an arrested person to Redfern Police Station quickly and commence the investigation there after complying with the provisions of LEPRA. No reasonable excuse has been demonstrated in this case for failing to tape record the conversations. 

35What should have occurred is that, after Senior Constable Beltman arrested the accused initially, for him to call for handcuffs and a caged truck, which he did. He had already told the accused that he was under arrest. He noticed that there was blood on the fingers and it was appropriate to take the photograph immediately because that is something that can be recorded and tested.

36All of the officers who were then involved should have simply taken the accused back to the police station. There was no need for further questioning unless there was a tape recorder to record that questioning. There was no doubt about his identity so far as Senior Constable Beltman was concerned and no doubt in his mind that he was connected with a serious offence that had occurred that morning. He also knew that he was Aboriginal and that there were special provisions, which needed to be followed according to LEPRA, for Aboriginal people.

37As an officer in the Redfern area, that is something that no doubt all officers know, or ought to know, and again there are extremely good policy reasons why these provisions should be strictly complied with.

38There is no discretion in the Court to admit the evidence if it does not otherwise comply with the provisions of s 281. For those reasons I reject the evidence of the conversations sought to be relied on by the Crown as admissions in the statements of Officers Barry and Beltman.

39As a result I also reject that portion of para 11 of Detective Sergeant Walker's statement in which he puts to the accused that he has been informed that the accused made admissions to police at the scene earlier. 

40Further on this voir dire, I am to determine the remaining objection, namely what the Crown seeks to rely on as admissions arising from the conversation Detective Sergeant Walker had with the accused in the dock at the police station, which was recorded on a handheld recorder. 

41The objection to the admissibility of these statements is brought on a different ground. It is brought on the basis of s 85 of the Evidence Act, 1995. Pursuant to S85 (2) of that section, evidence of an admission is not admissible unless the circumstances in which the admission was made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admission was adversely affected. I accept from the evidence overall that the accused is in fact a person with a significant intellectual disability. Ms Mulqueen, who was known as Ms Fraser at the time of the accused's arrest, is a qualified disability support worker whose expertise has not been challenged. She was familiar with the accused before 13 December 2013 and with his intellectual disability. I accept from her evidence that he was in fact at the time and remains, a person with a significant intellectual disability with an IQ of less than 70.

42She was summoned to the police station by the custody sergeant as the support person to be present with him and as such, conducted an assessment of him and in particular, as to whether or not he did understand the proceedings that were then occurring and specifically whether he understood the caution that he was given and the rights that he had. By the time she arrived at the police station, the accused had already been questioned by Detective Sergeant Walker and the conversations had occurred which are the subject matter of this additional challenge. The subject matter of the challenge is found in exhibit A on that voir dire and specifically the portion on page 5 as identified by counsel for the accused.

43As summarised earlier, I accept that Detective Sergeant Walker saw the accused in the dock at Redfern police station, some time not long after 10.45. He introduced himself, he knew that he had spoken to the Aboriginal Legal Service and he asked the accused what they had told him. The accused, I accept, repeated what he had been told by the ALS namely, not to interview, which he explained meant 

""Don't make interview if I don't want to"". 

44At page 3 of the transcript of this recording it is clear that Detective Sergeant Walker then went on to say these words 

""Mate you don't have to at all and I just want to make sure that you understand that.""

45That would appear to be in accordance with the obligation he agreed he had to ensure that the accused understood the nature of the caution he had been given. However he did not wait for a reply. He then immediately launched into further questions, which amounted to, in my view, an investigation of the offence. He went on to inform the accused that he was going to give him the chance to be interviewed and then started to investigate the offence, initially by telling him that he understood that the accused had told the police something about the stabbing when he spoke to them earlier that day. He did not, as I have said already, put the specifics of that to the accused so that they could be adopted. He also told the accused that there would be a forensic procedure and asked whether he consented. The accused said he did not want to. I infer that this was a further indication by the accused that he was intending to accept the advice he said he had been given by the ALS, not to engage in an interview. 

46Detective Sergeant Walker then continued to ask him questions about the offence, again said that he intended to interview him, to ask him questions and to record them. By that stage I accept it ought to have been clear to Detective Sergeant Walker in the circumstances, that the accused was indicating to him that he did not want to engage in an interview. He then went on and said

""Are you happy to come and give me your side of the story"". 

47After that, the accused I accept, either verbally or non-verbally indicated that he was not. The accused then immediately gave a version of events which appears on page 5 of the transcript and which is the subject of this objection. The Crown seeks to rely on that version of events as an admission. It is that which is objected to pursuant to s 85 of the Evidence Act, 1995.

48The question for consideration is whether the admission was made in circumstances, which would make it unlikely that the truth of the admissions was adversely affected. I have concluded that that has not been established. In other words, I am not satisfied that the circumstances in which the admissions were made were such as to make it unlikely that the truth of the admissions were adversely affected and I will be rejecting those submissions.

49The reasons for that finding are as follows:

(1)When the accused made the admissions, he was in fact a person with a significant intellectual disability. Whether or not that was known or ought to have been known to Detective Sergeant Walker, it seems to me is not relevant. Objectively he was in fact a person with a significant intellectual disability with an IQ of less than 70.

(2)Shortly after this conversation, within two hours or so, the accused was seen by Ms Mulqueen, who made an assessment of him and his understanding of the caution and determined that he did not understand the caution and, significantly, did not understand properly that he had the right to say nothing. I accept her opinion as given in evidence in that regard.

(3)I accept that in general terms the accused had already indicated to Detective Sergeant Walker when repeating to him what he had been told by the ALS and indicating that he did not consent to the forensic procedure, that in fact he did not want to engage in an interview.

(4)The circumstance that in fact he continued to answer questions ultimately providing the answers which are objected to, which was not strictly in answer to a question, nonetheless are provided in the context of ongoing questioning about the offence after the accused had, on my finding, indicated that he did not want to engage in a record of interview.

(5)The fact that the content of what he said to Detective Sergeant Walker when compared to what had been said to Constables Rottnam and Barry are different. There is some commonality and specifically, namely, that there is an admission of presence, but there are significant differences about the surrounding circumstances. One version includes an allegation of sexual advances made by the complainant. A version alleges that the first physical contact was made by the complainant. A version alleges that they had been smoking cannabis together before physical interaction between them and another version alleges simply that there was a fight. These versions were all given by the accused within the space, as I understand the evidence, of about an hour, but given by an accused as a person with an intellectual disability and an IQ of less than 70. These differences are also relevant in determining whether the circumstances in which the admissions were made affect the likelihood that the truth of those admissions was adversely affected. 

(6)The fact that the accused continued to answer questions, coupled with his significant intellectual disability, seems to me of itself is a factor to take into account, indicating that he did not understand the nature of the caution, and particularly did not understand that he could refuse to say anything. It takes a certain firmness of mind to refuse to answer questions put by persons in authority to those in custody. This accused did not at the time, because of his intellectual disability, have anything approaching that requisite firmness of mind.

50I am entitled to take certain matters into account to determine whether or not the truth of any admission is likely to have been adversely affected by the circumstances in which the admissions were made. There are some specifics referred to in s 85(3) of the Evidence Act. I should indicate that there is no suggestion that the questioning was done in a threatening way, or that there was any promise or inducement made to the accused. I do accept for those reasons that I have set out however that the circumstances in which the admissions were made are likely to have adversely affected the truth of those admissions. 

51It would appear that there is no room for the exercise of discretion in the application of s 85 of the Evidence Act, 1995. That section is also part of the general legislative provisions affecting the questioning of individuals in custody and is there for good policy reasons. It is not a question of balancing the value of admissions as against the circumstances of an offence. It is also particularly important in my view that these provisions be very strictly complied with in proceedings of this type, namely, a special hearing involving an accused who is not fit to plead, who has a significant intellectual disability and who, because of the legislation otherwise, is not permitted to and not capable of giving any instructions. It is important that the Court apply the legislative provisions strictly to ensure that the rights of an individual in such a position are properly respected. 

52For the reasons that I have set out, I will reject that portion of Detective Sergeant Walker's evidence, and the transcript and recording of it, which appears on p 5 of his statement, which the Crown sought to rely on as admissions.

		22 October 2014",2014-04-16 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705227,Cheng v Geussens [2014] NSWCA 113,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  This matter involves an extremely simple point of principle which, according to counsel, is not the subject of existing authority. 
2The facts which give rise to the problem fall within a brief compass.  Shortly before 7am on 15 July 2010 the plaintiff, Yingen Cheng, was riding his bicycle on the footpath on the northern side of Coogee Bay Road in an easterly direction (towards the beach where he intended to fish).  He came to the intersection with Carrington Road.  Mr Joachim Geussens, the defendant, was driving his car in a northerly direction down Carrington Road at the intersection with Coogee Bay Road.  The vehicle had proceeded across the intersection when it collided with the plaintiff on his bicycle.  Each of the plaintiff and the defendant asserted at trial that he was proceeding with a green light in his favour: this was not possible.  Each failed to see the other until (in the case of the driver) very shortly before the impact.  This evidence, which was accepted by the trial judge, bespoke negligence on the part of each.
3In considering the plaintiff's claim, the preferable view (the language used in the judgment will be referred to below) is that the trial judge was unable to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the plaintiff had a green light.  However, he found that the defendant was liable for failing to keep an adequate lookout.  He turned to the question of contributory negligence.  He assessed contributory negligence at 80%, apparently being satisfied that the driver had a green light.  However, if that were so, it would involve approaching the question of contributory negligence on a different basis from that on which liability was assessed.  That is, liability was assessed on the basis that the trial judge was unable to be satisfied as to which of the two had a green light; subject to a question relating to the onus of proof, contributory negligence should not have been decided on a different factual basis.  
4The possibility that liability could be decided on a different factual basis from contributory negligence may arise from the fact that, with respect to liability, the plaintiff bears the onus of proof, whereas with respect to contributory negligence, the onus is borne by the defendant: Purcell v Watson (1979) 26 ALR 235 at 244 (Mason J); Boyd v Leftwich (1982) 43 ALR 280 at 281 (Gibbs CJ, Murphy, Wilson and Brennan JJ agreeing); Stove v Hall [2008] ACTCA 21 at [25] (Higgins CJ, Penfold and Besanko JJ).  The earliest Australian authority adhering to this principle after the abolition of the defence appears to be Hercules Textile Mills Pty Ltd v K & H Textile Engineers Pty Ltd [1955] VLR 310, 316 (Scholl J), applied by this Court in Folpp v Waring (1998) 28 MVR 544 at 547 (Mason P, Sheller JA and Fitzgerald AJA agreeing).  No statement in these cases explains to what the onus applies, but it may be assumed to be the facts said to demonstrate breach of duty by the plaintiff, rather than the exercise of apportionment.
5If the trial judge were unable to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities by either party that he had a green light in his favour, the only available course was to assess contributory negligence on the basis that neither party had a green light in his favour. 
Reasoning of trial judge6This analysis requires an understanding of the basis on which the trial judge reached his findings.  The judge set out the conflicting accounts of the plaintiff and the defendant and stated that ""there was no basis derived from their demeanour upon which I could reject their respective versions.""  He continued (judgment, p 5):
""I am therefore left in a position of not being able to say that the plaintiff has proved on a balance of probabilities that his version of the accident is to be preferred to that of the defendant.  I can find no reason why I would accept the plaintiff's evidence that the traffic lights were in his favour, in preference to the defendant's evidence that the lights were in the latter's favour.  Accordingly, I must reject the plaintiff's evidence that he had the green light.""
7After referring to a case involving similar facts, Turkmani v Visvalingam [2009] NSWCA 211; 53 MVR 176, the trial judge reasoned as follows (p 6):
""No two cases are alike but it seems to me that on the defendant's version, the plaintiff by entering into the intersection against a red pedestrian traffic signal, and without looking to see if there was any traffic coming from his right, was guilty of contributory negligence to the extent of eighty per cent.""
8Pausing at that point in the reasoning, there was no positive finding that the defendant's account was to be preferred: the matter had been left on the basis that neither could be preferred.  It did not follow from the fact that the plaintiff had not established his case on the balance of probabilities that the contrary case was to be accepted.  Although in the first passage set out above the trial judge said that he ""must reject"" the plaintiff's evidence, read in context it is reasonably clear that he meant that the plaintiff's account was not proven on a balance of probabilities.  That is, the plaintiff had failed to satisfy the onus of proof.
9The explanation for adopting the defendant's account was to be found in the following passage in the reasons:
""A matter that has concerned me in relation to contributory negligence is whether I should have assessed it on the basis of the plaintiff's version rather than the defendant's.  Had I accepted the plaintiff's version I would have found contributory negligence on the plaintiff's part in entering the intersection without looking to see if there was oncoming traffic.  I would have assessed contributory negligence of twenty per cent.  It seems to me that not having accepted the plaintiff's version it could not be open to me to assess contributory negligence upon that version.""
10Pausing again, no error is revealed in that statement.  The judge continued:
""It would also be inappropriate to decline to assess contributory negligence at all, on the basis that I had in effect not accepted either party's evidence.  Such an outcome would in my view be against public policy.  More specifically as stated by Justice Kirby ... in Wheeler v French (1990) 11 MVR 354, the result would be one in which, 'the legal process has certainly failed to provide justice to one of the parties.' ""
11The comment from Wheeler v French was made in somewhat different circumstances, the trial judge having been unable to determine which of the plaintiff and defendant was the driver of the crashed car, in circumstances where it was clear that one of them was.  The statement quoted does not assist in determining the correct approach in this case.
12With great respect to the judge who delivered a careful ex tempore judgment and undoubtedly asked himself the right question, the alternative answers proposed did not exhaust the field of possibilities.  The first proposition assumed that rejecting the plaintiff's version meant accepting the defendant's.  In fact, liability had been accepted on the basis of a failure to keep a proper lookout, without regard to which party had a green light.  The second proposition, namely declining to assess contributory negligence at all, was correctly rejected as unavailable.  There was, however, a third option, namely to assess contributory negligence on the basis of the facts established (or not established) by the defendant.  On the approach that neither party had established his version as to the state of the lights on the balance of probabilities, the driver could not rely upon the fact that he had a green light to establish contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff.  Rather, both liability and contributory negligence could have been approach on the basis that the respective parties bearing the onus of proof each failed to establish that his version was correct.
13It is possible that reliance on the differing burdens of proof could result in negligence and contributory negligence being assessed on different factual premises.  This might well be undesirable, but it is not this case.  The result in this case is that both are assessed on the same basis, namely that the state of the lights was unknown.  In my view, that was the correct approach.  
14The final passage in the judge's reasoning must also be addressed.  Immediately following the last passage set out above, he continued:
""On this basis I think it appropriate that at the very minimum I assess contributory negligence on the basis of the defendant's version.  I would add that if the plaintiff's memory problems are factored in, then the balance is probably tipped in the defendant's favour in any event.""
15This passage does not detract from the conclusion reached above.  It is not entirely clear what was meant by ""at the very minimum"" (perhaps indicating that was the least that could be done where contributory negligence had to be assessed), but, for the reasons already given, it was not necessary to assume that the defendant's version was correct.  Indeed, that version should not have been adopted unless the judge was affirmatively satisfied that it should be accepted.  Secondly, the reference to the plaintiff's ""memory problems"" was an aside.  In considering whether the plaintiff's version should be accepted or rejected, the judge had concluded that it was not appropriate to take ""his brain damage or evidence of forgetfulness"" into account, there being no medical evidence that his memory of the events immediately prior to the accident had been affected: judgment, p 4.
Application for leave to appeal16Counsel for the applicant submitted that he was entitled to appeal as of right.  However, that proposition was untenable.  An appeal lies from the District Court only by leave ""from an interlocutory judgment or order"": District Court Act 1973 (NSW), s 127(2)(a).  The orders made by the trial judge were as follows:
""(a) Judgment for the plaintiff on liability.(b) The plaintiff's damages are to be reduced by eighty per cent on account of his contributory negligence.(c) The matter is stood over for the assessment of damages.""
17The plaintiff could not possibly contend that these were final orders: apart from anything else, a judgment without a sum of money was of no value.  The process was self-evidently incomplete.  Leave was required.
18Assessment of damages had been postponed, appropriately, pending the delivery of judgment by the High Court in Daly v Thiering [2013] HCA 45; 88 ALJR 67.  That case determined that, as a participant in the Lifetime Care and Support Scheme, the plaintiff would not be entitled to damages for gratuitous domestic care.  As he was long since retired, he had no claim for economic loss.  His damages were, in the event, limited non-economic loss.  Given the dramatic consequence of a reduction of 80% for contributory negligence, assuming that assessment was arguably wide of the mark, and given the seriousness of his injuries, the amount in issue on the appeal might reach (or at least approach) the monetary floor of $100,000 necessary to permit an appeal as of right from a final judgment: s 127(2)(c).  This factor favours a grant of leave to appeal, as does the finality of the determination as to contributory negligence, being a significant element in the case.  Combined with the basis for challenge to the reasoning of the trial judge set out above, the case warrants a grant of leave to appeal.
Grounds of appeal19The appellant relied upon four grounds of appeal, as articulated in a document handed up during the hearing.  The first two grounds alleged that the respondent's claim that he did not see the applicant as he approached Carrington Road was ""manifestly incredible"" and should have been rejected.  (The grounds, in terms, did not allege that the trial judge should have found that the plaintiff commenced to cross on a green light, although the submissions appeared to support such an approach.)
20The trial judge analysed such evidence as he had, with care.  There were no independent witnesses who could speak to the state of the lights or the conduct of the parties immediately prior to the accident.  There was no objective evidence as to those matters.  It may seem implausible that, in the circumstances surrounding the accident, neither party saw the other.  Nevertheless, the fact that neither took evasive action suggests that that was true.  These grounds were without substance and must be dismissed.
21The third ground was based on the assumption that, having referred to the decision of this Court in Turkmani, in which contributory negligence of a pedestrian was assessed at 80%, and having made a similar assessment in this case, the trial judge had ""applied"" Turkmani, when it should have been distinguished.
22This ground was also without substance.  First, it was clear that the trial judge did not consider himself bound to ""apply"" an assessment of facts made in a different case.  In that he was entirely correct.  Further, it is clear that he made his own assessment of proportionate responsibility on the facts before him, in the passages set out above.  
23The fourth ground asserted error on the part of the trial judge in relying on the version of the respondent in determining contributory negligence.  It was not articulated in precisely the manner set out above, which was developed in the course of oral submissions.  However, on the basis of the reasoning set out above, the appeal should be allowed.  That means contributory negligence must be reassessed, a function which this court is able to undertake, given that the accounts of neither party can be accepted.
Reassessment of contributory negligence24Contributory negligence is to be assessed, in a case involving a motor vehicle on a public road, pursuant to s 138 of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW).  That provision requires that damages be reduced in such proportion as the court considers ""just and equitable in the circumstances of the case"": s 138(3).  That assessment must be made by reference to ""the common law"" and statute: s 138(1).  Relevantly, s 5R of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) applies: see s 3B(2)(a).  Section 5R requires that the principles applicable in determining whether a person has been negligent apply in determining contributory negligence.  That calls into play the general principles set out in ss 5B and 5C and the general law.  The standard of care required of the plaintiff is that of a reasonable person in the position of the plaintiff: s 5R(2)(a).  
25Once the state of the lights is taken out of the assessment, it is clear that both parties were negligent in that neither kept a proper lookout.  Had they done so, both should have observed the other.  On the other hand, the point at which the driver should have seen the plaintiff was, presumably, at or about the time he entered the intersection.  At that point the plaintiff was on the footpath.  The evidence would not permit an inference that, at that point in time, the driver would have had any indication that the plaintiff was about to cross the road.  However, given the speed at which the car was travelling, the plaintiff would have had a clear indication that the driver would cross the intersection.
26There are two further factual elements which must be considered.  The first is the configuration of Carrington Road.  On the south side of the intersection (from whence the driver came) there were two marked lanes heading north.  One contained parked cars.  The driver entered Carrington Road from a laneway approximately 50 metres south of the intersection with Coogee Bay Road.  He immediately went into the outside lane because there was a car parked on the inside lane between him and Coogee Bay Road.
27The second feature is that north of Coogee Bay Road (at the point of the collision) there were no marked lanes on Carrington Road northbound.  Photographs in evidence suggested that there may often be cars parked along Carrington Road north of the intersection which would encourage through traffic to remain close to the median dividing line.  Nevertheless, the defendant, on crossing the intersection, veered into the kerbside part of Carrington Road, in effect changing lanes, although none were marked at the point of the collision.
28Thirdly, there was the point of impact.  It was just within what might have been the kerbside lane (if marked) on Carrington Road.  The car struck the front wheel of the bicycle with its nearside front bumper bar.  Although the trial judge accepted that the plaintiff was travelling slowly, it is apparent that he must have commenced to cross at about the time that the driver entered the intersection.
29Had the plaintiff looked to his right, he should have seen the car in time to stop his progress.  Had the driver seen the plaintiff start forward, he should have been able to avoid the collision, by remaining closer to the centre of the road, although arguably he could not have stopped.  (There was no finding by the trial judge that the driver was travelling too fast in the circumstances.)
30On these facts, there might be something to be said for an equal apportionment of responsibility.  However, one factor favours the driver, namely that at the point at which each should have seen the other, the plaintiff was on the footpath and could have been expected not to commence to cross in front of a travelling vehicle, whereas the vehicle was travelling at a speed which would have indicated that it was not about to stop.  This places a higher level of responsibility on the plaintiff.  A just and equitable apportionment of responsibility would attribute two-thirds (67%) to the plaintiff and one-third (33%) to the driver.  
Conclusion31Although no final orders have been made, the effect of the judgment below was to decide two separate questions, namely the liability of the defendant and the contributory negligence of the plaintiff.  Order (b) should be set aside and in place thereof there should be a reduction on account of contributory negligence of 67%.
32The Court should make the following orders:
(1) Grant the applicant leave to appeal.
(2) Allow the appeal.
(3) Set aside order (b) made in the District Court on 6 February 2013 and in place thereof direct that the plaintiff's damages be reduced by 67% on account of his contributory negligence.
(4) The respondent is to pay the costs of the applicant/appellant in this Court.
33BARRETT JA:  The issues before the Court are explained in the judgment of Basten JA which I have had the advantage of reading in draft.  I agree with his Honour in relation to the first three grounds of appeal.  I also agree with the approach he takes to the fourth ground and the question of contributory negligence, a matter which, in this case, raises novel issues warranting a grant of leave to appeal.  
34As Basten JA explains (at [5]), the inability of the judge to decide which of the parties had the benefit of a green light meant that the issue of contributory negligence fell to be assessed on the basis that neither had a green light (or, for that matter, a red one).  The hypothesis of absence of lights is, of necessity, accompanied by a hypothesis that there was no marked pedestrian crossing or other indicator of rights of way as between pedestrians and vehicular traffic.
35On that footing, the situation was one in which a motor vehicle being driven at reasonable speed was approaching a point at which a pedestrian holding a bicycle was standing on the edge of the footpath in an attitude making it clear that he was waiting to cross and no signal or marking regulated the progress of either vehicle or pedestrian.  In situations of that kind, the starting point in considering departures from standards of reasonable care is that pedestrians should wait until the road is clear before they cross and motorists are entitled to expect that pedestrians will behave accordingly.  The respective positions of motorist and pedestrian in such a situation are similar to those they would occupy if the motorist had a green light and the pedestrian had a red light - being the factual basis on which the primary judge proceeded by reason of his acceptance of the respondent's evidence rather than the applicant's in assessing contributory negligence (a course which, as Basten JA explains, was erroneous). 
36As Basten JA points out (at [30]), the applicant could have been expected not to commence to cross in front of a vehicle that was moving at a speed indicating that it could not have been expected to stop.  Subject to what is said in the next paragraph, the diversion of the vehicle to the left as it crossed the intersection (described by Basten JA at [27]) was unexceptionable, given that it was proceeding from the section of Carrington Road that contained two marked lanes into the section beyond the intersection that consisted of a single but wider lane; and there was no reason why the respondent should have chosen the far right of the single lane instead of the centre of it.  Also, there was no reason why the pedestrian should have expected that the vehicle would keep to the far right of the single lane.
37A qualification to what has just been said comes from the fact that, as Basten JA explains at [28], the applicant must have stepped off the kerb a moment before impact and have still been on the footpath when the respondent entered the intersection. The evidence does not permit any inference that, immediately before the applicant stepped on to the roadway, the respondent would or should have had any expectation that he was about to do so (Basten JA at [25]). However, the inference that the respondent, in exercising due care, should have seen the applicant after he stepped on to the roadway and kept further to the right than he did should be drawn. This applies even though the applicant must have stepped almost into the path of the oncoming vehicle. The inference warrants the conclusion that the respondent was negligent. 
38Because of that conclusion and the clear contributory negligence of the appellant, responsibility must be apportioned according to the degree of departure by each party from the standard of care of the reasonable man and the relative importance of the parties' respective acts in causing the loss sustained by the applicant - in other words, the degree of culpability and causative force to be attributed to each of them: Podrebersek v Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 34; 59 ALJR 492 at 494.  
39In my opinion, the applicant's departure from the standard of care of the reasonable man (by leaving the pavement when an approaching vehicle that could be expected not to stop had already entered the intersection) was significantly greater in degree than that of the respondent (by diverting slightly to the left and heading towards the centre of the single lane beyond the intersection rather than the right hand side of it, even when a pedestrian was obviously waiting to cross); and the applicant's act of stepping on to the roadway when the approaching vehicle was close to him was significantly more important in causing the loss than was the act of the respondent in driving through the intersection in the way he did.  A comparison of the conduct of each negligent party in relation to the whole of the circumstances (particularly in light of the matters in [35] above) shows a significantly greater degree of culpability on the part of the applicant and a significantly stronger causative force in the applicant's conduct. 
40For that reason, I am of the opinion that the applicant's contributory negligence should be assessed at a level of the order of 70% and accept as appropriate the apportionment 67%/33% that Basten JA proposes.  The orders set out at [32] of his Honour's reasons should be made.
41WARD JA:  I agree with Basten JA.  As to the apportionment of responsibility, I would not have agreed that an equal apportionment of responsibility was just and equitable.  Once the state of the lights is taken out of the assessment, the circumstances to which his Honour has referred indicate squarely that greater responsibility lay on the appellant who commenced to cross the road without looking to his right and who could not reasonably have been expected by the respondent to do so.  The apportionment proposed by Basten JA fairly reflects the respective responsibilities of the parties for the accident and is the just and equitable outcome in my opinion.

2705237,Elliott v Tomkins (No. 2) [2014] NSWDC 56,"Judgment

1These proceedings demonstrate case management issues common to defamation actions. The complexities of defamation law require the parties to plead and particularise their case with precision. However, not all aspects of defamation law are complex. Particulars of how an unnamed plaintiff was identified (and by whom), or of the circumstances in which a publication on the Internet was downloaded, are simple issues of fact.

2The continued difficulties the plaintiff has had in providing this essential information are particularly difficult to understand, for two reasons. First, the plaintiff has foreshadowed a claim for special damages arising from lost transactions with customers who read the matter complained of (and who presumably identified him). Second, the plaintiff's complaints about the defence filed in these proceedings are such that an application was brought to strike out the defence and have the proceedings listed for assessment of damages.

3As is set out in my judgment of 28 February 2014, the defendant, a litigant in person who resides and works in remote parts of Western Australia, appeared by telephone link to defend this application. He had filed a defence pleading a s 25 defence of truth, but it contained a great deal of discursive and irrelevant material. He sought an adjournment to obtain legal advice and file an amended defence. The plaintiff's application for summary judgment was stood over for hearing to 28 February 2014.

4On 28 February 2014 Mr Goldsmith appeared for the defendant. He stated that it was not possible to file a defence to the statement of claim in its current form, and handed up a copy of his letter of 25 February 2014, in which he had pointed out the plaintiff's failure to comply with r 15.19 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR""). No particulars had been provided of publication (a particular concern since the six matters complained of are published on the Internet) and identification (in that the plaintiff is named in only one of the six publications). In addition, there appeared to be no reason for commencing these proceedings in New South Wales, as the plaintiff appeared to reside in Queensland while the defendant resided in Western Australia.

5UCPR rule 15.19 provides:

""15.19 Particulars in relation to statements of claim for defamation 

(1) The particulars required by rule 15.1 in relation to a statement of claim seeking relief in relation to the publication of defamatory matter must include the following:

(a) particulars of any publication on which the plaintiff relies to establish the cause of action, sufficient to enable the publication to be identified,

(b) particulars of any publication, circulation or distribution of the matter complained of or copy of the matter complained of on which the plaintiff relies on the question of damages, sufficient to enable the publication, circulation or distribution to be identified,

(c) if the plaintiff alleges that the matter complained of had a defamatory meaning other than its ordinary meaning-particulars of the facts and matters on which the plaintiff relies to establish that defamatory meaning, including:

(i) full and complete particulars of the facts and matters relied on to establish a true innuendo, and

(ii) by reference to name or class, the identity of those to whom those facts and matters were known,

(d) if the plaintiff is not named in the matter complained of-particulars of identification of the plaintiff together with the identity, by reference to names and addresses or class of persons, of those to whom any such particulars were known, and

(e) particulars of the part or parts of the matter complained of relied on by the plaintiff in support of each pleaded imputation.

(2) Such of the following as is applicable must be filed and served with a statement of claim seeking relief in relation to the publication of defamatory matter (or any amended statement of claim) and be referred to in the statement of claim or amended statement of claim:

(a) a legible photocopy of the original publication or, in the case of an internet, e-mail or other computer displayed publication, a printed copy,

(b) a typescript, with numbered lines, of:

(i) if the original publication is in English-the text of the original publication, or

(ii) otherwise-a translation of the text of the original publication.

(3) Subrule (2) (b) must be complied with in respect of radio and television publications.""

6In my judgment of 28 February 2014, I set out the deficiencies of the pleading requiring an amended statement of claim, as well as the reasons why I propose to dismiss the plaintiff's application to strike out the defence. I reserved the issue of costs, over Mr Goldsmith's protestations, for the reasons set out in paragraph 16 of the judgment.

7When the matter came before me on 28 March 2014, an amended pleading was provided which corrected only one of the complaints raised by Mr Goldsmith, namely establishing a connection with New South Wales. However, the other issues identified in Mrs Goldsmith's correspondence (notably publication and identification issues), were not attended to. This was despite Mr Goldsmith setting out, at length, in his second letter, dated 26 March 2014, objections to the amended pleading as well as the reasons for each of them. The concluding paragraph of that letter stated:

""In the circumstances, would you please not that we have been instructed to apply, this Friday, to strike out the amended statement of claim, for judgment for the defendant and for costs (and, if thought fit, upon the indemnity basis).""

8On 28 March 2014, Ms Nguyen appeared on behalf of the plaintiff. She argued her client's position very ably, making concessions where appropriate and, as a further amendment to the statement of claim was accordingly to be filed, I considered there was no utility in dealing with Mr Goldsmith's application to strike out the statement of claim. I made the following orders:

(1)Strike out the amended statement of claim with leave to amend, such further amended statement of claim to be served, and provided to the court, by 4:00pm Monday 7 April 2014.

(2)Matter stood over for mention to Wednesday 9 April 2014 at 9:30am before Gibson DCJ.

(3)Costs reserved.

9When the matter came before me this morning, no amended pleading had been filed or served, nor was one likely to be served at any time in the near future. Mr Zada, who appeared for the plaintiff, sought an adjournment of at least three weeks in order to obtain the necessary particulars of publication and identification, which he told me he did not have, but which he hoped his client would be able to obtain over a time frame of this kind. 

10That application was opposed by Mr Goldsmith, who renewed his application for summary dismissal of the statement of claim. Mr Zada opposed that application, principally on the basis that Mr Goldsmith's objections to the statement of claim in its current form were unacceptable.

11Mr Zada's submissions, partly oral and partly in writing (Exhibit A), may be summarised as follows:

(a)Pleadings should never be struck out where there remains dispute as to the material fact of the case (Bank of Queensland Limited v Industrial Court of New South Wales (No 2) [2008] FCA 1435 at [20]). There are real questions of fact to be tried (General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) (1964) 112 CLR 125), and in those circumstances the matter should go to trial. To strike out the plaintiff's statement of claim summarily would amount to a lack of procedural fairness and natural justice.

(b)The history of the matter showed that the defendant had already been granted a considerable indulgence, in that he had filed two hopeless defences, the first of which was struck out and the second of which the defendant had agreed to withdraw. The defendant's failure to file that defence by reason of asserted defects in the identification and publication particulars in the statement of claim should not be accepted because Mr Goldsmith's submissions as to the law were wrong.

(c)Any question of identification and/or extent of publication is not a matter for pleading (or able to be struck out if pleaded inadequately), but a matter for the trial (John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd v Farley (Federal Court of Australia, Gallop, Burchett and Gummow JJ, 2 May 1994)). 

(d)Alternatively, the pleading in its current form satisfied the tests both for publication on the Internet (for which no special pleading is needed) and for identification, the test for which is as follows:

""[209] Similarly, a publication can be defamatory of a person even if it does not name him or her. Where a plaintiff is not named in a publication the common law test is to ask whether publication was made in circumstances in which it could reasonably lead persons acquainted with the plaintiff to believe that he or she was the person referred to (David Syme & Co v Canavan (1918) 25 CLR 234 at 238 per Isaacs J; Knupffer v London Express Newspaper Ltd [1944] AC 116 at 122 per Lord Atkin, 124 per Lord Porter; Consolidated Trust Co Ltd v Browne (1949) 49 SR (NSW) 86)."" 

(Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing & Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) (2007) 162 FCR 466 at [209])

(e)It was not necessary for the plaintiff to prove publication, as the defendant had made admissions that he had published the matters complained of. While the plaintiff conceded that it was not sufficient for the purposes of proving publication merely to state that material was posted on the Internet (Creative Resins International Ltd v Glassam Europe Ltd [2006] All ER (D) 178), it was not necessary to set out particulars of when each of the matters complained of was downloaded from the web server, or how the persons who downloaded it identified the plaintiff. Alternatively, if the plaintiff were obliged to set out the persons who identified him, he did not need to do more than describe these persons as a class.

(f)It is unnecessary, in Internet publication cases, to identify when or where the material is downloaded, or to provide particulars of identification or the names and addresses of one or more persons to whom those particulars of identification were known and who were thus able to identify the plaintiff. It is sufficient that there is a ""class of persons"" acquainted with the plaintiff, and the plaintiff may then rely upon the contents of the publication as containing material (which it is not necessary to specify) which would lead those persons to believe that the plaintiff was the person referred to in the published material (Knupffer v London Express Newspaper Ltd [1944] AC 116). That ""group"" would, for example, include any person who has transacted or interacted with the plaintiff on his Ebay site, or who sent the plaintiff any emails through Ebay, as these provide details of his identification (although it is conceded that his full name is omitted and his Ebay username is contained in many of these transactions). It is sufficient to state there is a class of such persons without individually identifying them.

12Mr Zada's submissions about identification conflate group libel actions with the requirement of an unnamed individual plaintiff to set out the basis upon which he or she (and not some other person) is identified. Precise particulars of identification are necessary not only in order to found the claim for defamation, but to the defences available (in particular, qualified privilege and unlikelihood of harm) and damages. In Lazarus v Deutsche Lufthansa AG (1985) 1 NSWLR 188, Hunt J (at 191-192) stated:

""The plaintiff should also have given in his Statement of Claim particulars of the identity of the persons to whom the publication is alleged to have been made. The identity of those persons (either general or precise) is of vital importance to a defendant in almost every defamation action, whether the publication was oral or in writing. In both cases, the defence of qualified privilege will depend upon the defendant being able to establish that those persons to whom he is alleged to have published the matter complained of had a legitimate interest in the matter so published. The difference between substantial or trivial damages (Fullam v Newcastle Chronicle & Journal Ltd (supra), at 659), and the application of the defence of unlikelihood of harm afforded by s 13 of the Defamation Act (Chappell v Mirror Newspapers Ltd (Court of Appeal, 14.6.1984, unreported), at 13), will depend in both cases upon the identity (general or precise) of those to whom the matter complained of was published.""

13Additionally, it should be pointed out that if any of the persons identifying the plaintiff have downloaded one or more of the matters complained of in a jurisdiction outside Australia, such as the United States, the defences to apply will be the defences in the jurisdiction where the publication is downloaded: Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnick (2002) 210 CLR 575. 

14The requirement for identification evidence is not restricted to limited publications of the kind occurring in Lazarus v Deutsche Lufthansa AG, supra. It may also be sought in newspaper cases where appropriate (Lazarus v Deutsche Lufthansa AG, supra, at 193) as well as in cases where the publication is made on the Internet: Jenman v McIntyre [2013] NSWSC 1100 at [3]. This includes information about when and how the plaintiff was identified, as this may be relevant to limitation issues; Hunt J illustrates the dangers of not having such particulars by reference to Emmerton v University of Sydney (1970) 2 NSWR 633. It is for all these reasons that Hunt J warned (at 194) that the plaintiff must ""name those persons, or suffer the loss of his action"".

15That is not to say that the plaintiff cannot bring proceedings if he or she does not know who those relevant identifying persons, as Hunt J goes on to note. In Williams v Ramsdale (1887) 3 WR 125, where slanders were uttered in a public room in front of persons whose identity was unknown to the plaintiff, he was ordered to ""state all the names that he could - ""that is to say, the best particulars that he can"""". This is what in fact occurred in Lazarus v Deutsche Lufthansa AG, supra. It was, however, a sufficiently unusual set of circumstances for Hunt J to direct that the plaintiff verify those assertions, and his lack of knowledge of the identity of those persons, on oath (at 195).The circumstances in which a plaintiff can identify a class of persons are thus the exception rather than the rule. This exception could not apply to facts such as the present. 

16Mr Zada's reliance upon Knupffer v London Express Newspaper Ltd, supra, and John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd v Farley, supra, confuses the entitlement of one of a group of individually unnamed plaintiffs to bring a claim for group libel (where it should be added, the plaintiff is required to provide similar particulars in any event) and the court's reluctance to use summary judgment procedures to determine disputed issues of fact as to whether those particulars will survive. 

17The plaintiff's reluctance to provide these particulars is difficult to understand, since it has been foreshadowed that he proposes to bring a claim for special damage by reason of loss of business arising from the publications. The identity of those persons who have refused to deal with him should be known to the plaintiff. I do not propose to repeat the matters set out in my judgment of 28 February 2014 concerning the obligations of parties to plead and particularise Internet publications with care: Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnick, supra, at [25]-[28] and [44]; Jenman v McIntyre, supra, at [3].

18However, it is an extreme step to take to strike out a statement of claim simply by reason of failure to comply with pleadings rules. The preferable course is to grant leave to amend. Mr Goldsmith submitted that this caused considerably hardship on his client, this being the third time he had appeared in court on this application, and that the date for today had been chosen with two purposes in mind, one being that it was the only date available for the court to finalise this notice of motion and the other being that it had been his anticipation that after today the matter could be returned to the Defamation List for case management. In addition, Mr Goldsmith put before me that he had done everything he could to assist the solicitors for the plaintiff and indeed his letters of 25 February 2014 and 26 March 2014 (Exhibit 1) could not have set out more fully the nature and extent of his concerns about the inadequacies of the pleadings. The unsatisfactory result was that this interlocutory application would have to be listed in May 2014, and he would have to appear for a fourth time, in circumstances where the plaintiff had failed to comply with orders for the court or to answer his correspondence other than in a dismissive fashion. 

19I consider Mr Goldsmith's complaints can be cured by an appropriate costs order. Taking all of the above into account, I propose to grant the plaintiff a further extension but it must be the last one. Accordingly, I have made a peremptory order for provision of the Further Amended Statement of Claim by Wednesday 14 May 2014 and stood the proceedings over to Monday 26 May 2014 at 9:30am. However, an order for costs should follow as the plaintiff's solicitor's explanation for the failure to file an amended statement of claim is unsatisfactory. If there were difficulties in obtaining this information, or Mr Zada has had personal difficulties due to his son's illness, these are matters he should have raised with Mr Goldsmith before this morning.

Costs

20Mr Goldsmith sought an order for indemnity costs payable forthwith. This is an extreme order, made only in extreme circumstances. Mr Goldsmith referred me to Dank v Whittaker (No 3) [2013] NSWSC 1822 and submitted that, as was the case with the solicitor for the defendant in those proceedings, he had provided long and carefully drafted correspondence setting out all of these problems and that the objections he had taken were taken ""clearly and fairly"" Dank v Whittaker (No 3), supra, at [5]. The plaintiff in those proceedings had in fact acknowledged the concessions and in fact conceded that the statement of claim needed to be amended, whereas the plaintiff in these proceedings had, Mr Goldsmith submitted, refused to comply with long accepted principles of law in relation to the requirements to plead publication and identification with precision, particularly in relation to Internet publications, and had at the same time brought an application for summary judgment against a litigant in person in relation to a defence which, while flawed, was nevertheless reasonably pleaded in relation to the pleading and particulars of the justification defence.

21In Dank v Whittaker (No 3), supra, McCallum J noted at [9]:

""[9] The difficulty is that when one gives close consideration to the points taken in the correspondence and the plain lack of attention given on behalf of the plaintiff to those points the matter, in my view, does rise outside or above the ordinary category. The points taken are simply ones which ought not to have been required to be taken, if proper attention had been given to the pleading in the first instance.""

22McCallum J was satisfied that the experience the defendant had faced in relation to the plaintiff's litigation had been ""unhappy"" as a result of this process of unreasonable conduct and ""plain lack of attention"" and made an order for indemnity costs payable forthwith.

23It is my view that I should take the same course. The circumstances in which an application was brought to strike out the defence and have damages assessed (which I apprehend would include a special damages claim) in circumstances where the plaintiff's own pleading were so deficient are extraordinary. Unmeritorious applications of this kind, which appear to be increasingly common in defamation proceedings, as I noted in my previous judgment, are to be discouraged. 

Orders

(1)Extend the time for the filing of a Further Amended Statement of Claim to Wednesday 14 May 2014 conditional upon the plaintiff paying the defendant's costs of and incidental to 28 February 2014, 28 March 2014 and today on an indemnity basis, assessable forthwith.

(2)Order (1) is self-executing in nature.

(3)The notice of motion stood over part heard to Monday 26 May 2014 at 9:30am before Gibson DCJ.

		26 May 2014",2014-04-08 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705240,Peters v R [2014] NSWCCA 49,"Judgment

1BASTEN JA: The applicant was sentenced at Port Macquarie by McLoughlin DCJ SC for two offences, namely causing grievous bodily harm (contrary to s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) and reckless wounding (contrary to s 35(4) of the Crimes Act). He had been convicted of each offence following a jury trial. The applicant appears to have significant psychiatric problems and went to trial on the question of the identity of the offender, he having no recollection of the offending.

2The trial judge noted that, despite his dysfunctional family background, drug addiction and impairments, ""only a lengthy sentence of imprisonment will satisfy the requirements for general and specific deterrence."" For the offence of reckless wounding, he sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of two years; and, for the offence of causing grievous bodily harm, to a period of 10 years, with a non-parole period of six years six months. The longer sentence was accumulated by a period of 12 months on the lesser sentence. There is no challenge to the individual sentences: the sole challenge is to the element of accumulation.

3The offending took place at a shack on a 50 acre rural property used as a market garden. The victim worked and lived at the property. The applicant attacked the victim when he knew he was alone by striking him with an object which was probably a pipe, crash tackling him from behind and then, while struggling on the ground, striking the victim a number of times to the face and right eye with a similar object. The victim was finally struck a heavy blow to the top of the head, rendering him semi-conscious and causing him to let go of the applicant. He was then rolled over and the applicant said, ""I'm going to cut your throat"", and then ""I won't cut your throat, I will cut your fingers off."" He then gave the victim an opportunity to choose which fingers would be cut off and used a knife to saw off a part of the victim's left index and little fingers.

4The applicant submitted that the prosecution had ""conceded"" that ""any accumulation, if in fact any were necessary, should be minor."" In fact the prosecutor said that ""there may be cause for some partial accumulation, but it would be of a minor nature."" If that were all that had been said, it would provide no basis for restricting the discretion of the sentencing judge in accumulating one sentence upon the other. As counsel for the Director noted in this Court, the applicant's lawyer also accepted that ""it's got to be partially accumulative because of the different violence."" It was troubling that this statement was not referred to by the applicant in seeking totally concurrent sentences in this Court.

5The applicant also submitted that full concurrency was warranted because there was one course of offending, all elements of which could have been brought by the Director as a single offence under s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act. The laying of two sets of offences was said to follow from the belief of the prosecution that there may have been circumstances of aggravation attending the reckless wounding, namely that it was committed in company with other persons. The charge of reckless wounding in circumstances of aggravation was rejected by the jury, the conviction being for reckless wounding simpliciter.

6There is no substance in this submission. While it is true that the offending could be described as a single course of conduct, it is also true that it occurred in stages and that the offender could have desisted at any point. While there might have been a significant risk of double punishment had the sentences been fully accumulated, with a further risk that the totality of the sentences would not have properly reflected the total criminality, that step was not taken. There is no suggestion of double counting in the present case, which suggests that, had there been a single offence under s 33, the sentence for that offence would have exceeded that given on count 1. 

7A further argument, developed by counsel in oral submissions, was that the injuries were not so catastrophic as to demonstrate a mid-range offence, so that the finding that the offending was in the mid-range was based primarily on the apparent planning and intention of the offender. That may be so, but the finding was open to the trial judge and the basis for the finding (which is not challenged) does not itself affect the appropriate degree of accumulation.

8The applicant further submitted that this case should be distinguished from cases such as Iskov v R [2011] NSWCCA 241, which involved two offences of violence against a single victim, but separate in time by a period of some three hours.

9That submission is misconceived. The Court does not follow or distinguish other judgments on different facts. There is no suggestion that the trial judge did not properly identify and apply the relevant principles. Nor can it be said that the degree of accumulation was outside an appropriate range, given the particular circumstances of the offending.

10Leave to appeal against sentence should be refused.

11FULLERTON J: I agree with Basten JA.

12DAVIES J: I agree with Basten JA.

3ADAMSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences set out below for offences under s 25(1) and s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (DMTA) which were imposed by Syme DCJ following his plea of guilty:

The sentence hearing before Syme DCJ
4The agreed facts were tendered and established the following.
5The applicant was a heroin user and seller. Between 7 and 14 March 2012 he sold the following amounts of heroin to undercover police officers after telephone calls initiated by the officers to arrange the transactions and the meeting places:
No.DateTimeAmountSale price17 March 201212.12 pm0.08g$10027 March 201212.28 pm0.07g $10038 March 20120.11g (49% pure)$100414 March 20120.09 g$100

6After the last supply, police followed the applicant from Eddy Avenue, Sydney to Marrickville where they saw him throw a package out of his car that contained 18 foils of heroin with a total weight of 1 g. This charge under s 25(1) of the DMTA was the first item on the Form 1.
7One of the undercover police officers organised by telephone to purchase more heroin from the applicant on 22 March 2012. When the applicant arrived at Kings Cross, which was the pre-appointed place for the transaction, he was arrested. He was found to be in possession of 22 foils of heroin weighing 1.19g contrary to s 25(2) of the DMTA. This was the second offence for which he was sentenced. He was also in possession of $630 cash and a Nokia mobile phone. This charge of goods in custody under S 527C(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) was the second item on the Form 1.
8Upon arrest the applicant admitted to supplying heroin on an ongoing basis. He said he would buy 1.7g at a time and use 1g himself. He pleaded guilty in the Local Court.
9At the sentence hearing the Crown tendered a record of the applicant's previous convictions and the custodial records. These documents showed that the applicant had a lengthy criminal record. He had had three substantial periods in custody: from 31 May 2001 to 25 October 2005; from 1 November 2008 and 29 October 2010 and from 23 February 2011 to 22 August 2011.
10The applicant gave evidence at the sentence hearing that he was 32 years old and was born in Vietnam. The applicant's father was in gaol for several years during his childhood. He started taking drugs while still at school and was expelled before Year 12. When he was eighteen he started smoking heroin. He has a fourteen-year old son whom he had not seen recently because of his poor relationship with his ex-partner. He is a qualified baker.11The applicant gave evidence that he was released from custody in August 2011 and began using heroin again. He had debts from his drug use and also gambling debts. He has not undertaken a drug rehabilitation programme. He was on a bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) to be of good behaviour at the time of the offending. 
12The following exchange occurred in the course of the applicant's evidence in chief:
Q.  Would you tell the court how you feel being back in custody now?A.  At first relief, but stupid.
Q.  What do you mean you felt relief?A.  Sort of put all that behind me you know the drugs, the debts, stuff like that.  
13No pre-sentence report was tendered on behalf of the applicant at the sentence hearing.
14At the conclusion of the applicant's counsel's submissions on sentence, which were both oral and in writing, the sentencing judge asked her about accumulation. The applicant's counsel conceded that some accumulation would be appropriate. Her Honour noted that accumulation itself would provide a ground for special circumstances. At the conclusion of the Crown's submissions, her Honour proposed listing the matter for the passing of sentence on Monday 3 December 2012, the hearing having taken place on Friday 30 November 2012. 
15After the date was fixed and Syme DCJ indicated that it was not necessary for counsel to be there since no further submissions would be required, the following exchange occurred:
HER HONOUR:  It will simply be a matter of giving reasons for decision and letting Mr Dang know how much longer he's going to be in custody.  He's been in custody about eight months.  I would think taking into account these two matters that another couple of years on the bottom is something that he can expect.  Does anyone want to argue with that?
SCHATTIGER [Crown]:  No your Honour.
HER HONOUR:  Not too much.
WILLIAMS [the applicant]:  Your Honour I've handed up that schedule of comparative cases.  I would submit that something in the range of eighteen months on the bottom would be within range for the reasons I've listed in that schedule.
HER HONOUR:  It depends what the special circumstances is.  I think he's going to have a little more than that in custody.  Therefore, the actual time, if it waits until Monday but Mr Dang that's what you're looking at, you're looking at a considerable more time in custody.  I'll consider the submissions of counsel in relation to other matters and I'll deal with the actual sentence and the reasons for decision on Monday.  Okay.  Thank you sir.  Issue a s 77 order for Monday.
The remarks on sentence
16The sentencing judge assessed the objective seriousness of the offence of ongoing supply by reference to the circumstance of the offence and the applicant's acts, including the stock held and the sophistication of the enterprise. Her Honour said:
""The offender was certainly a user of the drug heroin himself but I find this operation was more organised than an ad hoc supply of a street addict and was more like a one man retail business. The offender took phone calls on a telephone, he attended personally for the arranging of supply . . .As supply in each case this is a slightly higher level than a street level dealer although I note that the deals were conducted physically at street level this is a slightly more organised and sophisticated process. Therefore when considering the level of objective seriousness this is a serious offence certainly not nowhere near the mid-level range of seriousness if I was making a finding for the purpose of the standard non-parole period but a long way from a bottom range offence.""
17The sentencing judge referred to the commission of the offences while the applicant was on a s 9 bond as an aggravating factor. His criminal record was referred to.
18Her Honour addressed the question of institutionalisation in the following terms:The offender's counsel in submissions to me told me that he was in danger of becoming institutionalised because of the long periods of time that he has spent in custody.  The offender in his evidence in Court agreed that in the last ten years or so he has spent nearly as much time in custody as he has spent out of custody and he has been in custody for a considerable of period of time now.  Therefore, if there is there is any danger of institutionalisation I am afraid it has already occurred.
19Her Honour found that she could not make the finding that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend and suggested that it might be beneficial for him to enter a restricted rehabilitation facility on his release in order to address his long-standing difficulties with drugs.
20The sentencing judge also noted the importance of general and specific deterrence, as well as rehabilitation when sentencing for offences of this nature. Her Honour allowed a discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of the plea.
21Her Honour addressed the question of special circumstances in the following terms:I propose to find special circumstances largely because I propose to accumulate these sentences when I pass them.  The total sentences should reflect the approximate statutory ratio with some small amount of extra assistance given by way of a slightly longer parole period to reflect the need for rehabilitation and the need hopefully for the offender to use some of his parole time in residential rehabilitation.
Application for leave to appeal
22The applicant sought leave to appeal on five grounds which will be considered in turn.
Ground 1: Her Honour erred in finding that the offending conduct was slightly higher than a street level dealer and in her assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence
23Mr Barrow, who appeared on behalf of the applicant, sought to characterise the applicant's offending conduct as that of a drug user who was engaged in low-level supply for the purposes of funding his own use. Mr Barrow pointed to the lack of paraphernalia usually associated with organised drug supply, such as scales, ledgers or associations with a drug network. He contended that, although her Honour had noted that the applicant was a drug user, she had failed to accord significance to that fact when assessing the objective seriousness of the offending conduct.
24The applicant relied on the principle that, although the need to fund a drug habit was not a mitigating circumstance, the fact that the offence is motivated by such need may be relevant to objective seriousness in so far as it is germane to the level of planning of the offence, the existence or otherwise of another reason which might explain the offending conduct and the effect of drug withdrawal on the offender's capacity to exercise judgment: R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [273] per Wood CJ at CL.
25The Crown sought to support her Honour's finding by reference to the organised nature of the supply, which involved telephone calls to arrange a meeting place for the purposes of supply. The Crown also relied on the reliability of the applicant's fulfilment of such orders and his timely appearance at the meeting point to deliver the drugs in accordance with the arrangements he had made himself.
26I am not persuaded that there was any error in her Honour's finding. It is not the function of this Court to substitute its own view as to objective seriousness for that of the sentencing judge (Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37] per Spigelman CJ and at [46] per Simpson J). Although this Court may, if it finds that the characterisation made by the sentencing judge was not open, form a different view as to where, in the objective scale of offending, the offender's conduct stood, this Court is bound by the sentencing judge's findings of facts, to the extent to which they are not challenged: Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13 at [24]. 
27Her Honour's finding that the applicant's role was slightly higher than that of a street dealer was, in my view, open on the evidence and a matter that was pre-eminently a matter for her Honour. Such a classification is a matter of nuance and impression. However, the agreed facts as to what occurred showed a level of organisation that was, in my view, consistent with her Honour's finding. This ground is not made out.
Ground 2: her Honour erred in not taking into account the risk of institutionalisation on the basis that it had already occurred
28The evidence before her Honour established that the applicant had spent over eight and a half years in custody during the previous eleven and a half years, comprising three sentences and the period on remand since his arrest. He was 32 years of age.
29Mr Barrow contended on behalf of the applicant that her Honour erred in regarding the applicant's evidence that he felt relief when he was returned to custody as being an indication that he was already institutionalised. Mr Barrow relied on the following passage in the exchange between the applicant's counsel and the sentencing judge to make good the submission:
WILLIAMS:  .....The other basis on which I would submit that your Honour could make a finding of special circumstances would be the risk of institutionalisation for someone, who as your Honour has pointed out, has spent the best part of his twenties in and out of custody and your Honour heard evidence that when he was arrested on this occasion he felt a certain amount of relief because --
HER HONOUR:  Which would indicate that he's probably already institutionalised. How does that help?
WILLIAMS:  The reason it helps is in my submission that he needs a longer period of supervision in the community so that the things that he benefits from in custody like structure and supervision can be carried on in the community and continued for a longer period of time with consequences if he's unable to comply.
30Mr Barrow contended that, although there was a basis in the evidence for the applicant's submission before the sentencing judge that there was a risk of institutionalisation, there was no proper basis in the evidence for a finding that it had already occurred. He submitted that such a finding would require expert opinion from a psychologist or psychiatrist and that no such evidence was available to the sentencing judge.
31I do not accept the applicant's submissions. The remarks on sentence show that her Honour was concerned about the amount of time the applicant had spent in custody and the prospect that institutionalisation had already occurred. The risk of institutionalisation was put forward by the applicant as a reason for a finding of special circumstances. Her Honour adjusted the statutory ratio consistent with a finding of special circumstances. The following statement in the remarks on sentence appears to me to be no more than a realistic appraisal made on the basis of the documents tendered and the sentencing judge's assessment of the applicant:""Therefore, if there is any danger of institutionalisation I am afraid it has already occurred.""
32A substantial part of Mr Barrow's submissions in support of this ground relied on his reading of the transcript of the sentence hearing and her Honour's responses to propositions put in oral argument. The practice of alleging error based on such exchanges is to be discouraged. It is an important part of procedural fairness that a judge will, at times, express views in the course of oral argument. However, judgment is necessarily suspended until all evidence has been adduced and all submissions made. Only then can all matters be considered, a decision made and reasons for decision given in the remarks on sentence. The remarks comprise the reasons. The reasons are not to be discerned from the exchanges in the course of the hearing, since the latter may constitute no more than the articulating of a proposition propounded for the purposes of argument and, at best, the expression of a preliminary view.
33Ground 2 is not made out.
Ground 3: the sentencing judge erred in partially accumulating the sentences or by accumulating them by a period of 5 months
34Mr Barrow submitted that the second offence of supply was so closely associated with the ongoing supply offence that the sentences ought to have been wholly concurrent. He contended that the concession made by the applicant's counsel at the sentence hearing ought not to have been made, in circumstances where there was a continuing course of conduct. He also submitted that the count under s 25(1) could have been charged as part of the conduct under s 25A and that, accordingly, any degree of accumulation was erroneous. He also contended, in the alternative, that if there was to be accumulation it ought to have been for a lesser period than five months.
35The Crown submitted that any sentence for the offending in the principal count (s 25A) had to take into account the offences on the Form 1, one of which was a deemed supply of 1 g. However, it contended that because the secondary count (s 25(1)) concerned the separate offence of deemed supply, it could not be included in the principal count of ongoing supply. The Crown argued that because of the separate criminality it was open to the sentencing judge to accumulate the sentences for both offences to some degree and that five months was an appropriate degree of accumulation.
36There is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought be dealt with concurrently or consecutively, this determination being a matter pre-eminently within the discretion of the sentencing judge, subject to the principle of totality which is an overriding principle by reference to which sentences are to be measured: Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 308 (McHugh J). 
37The framing of charges is a matter that concerns prosecutorial discretion. The need to prove, for a count under s 25A(1) of the DMTA, the additional element that the supply was ""for financial or material reward"" may have provided a reason for distinguishing between the actual supplies, that were covered by the principal count, and the deemed supply of heroin (arising from the quantity) that was the subject of the secondary count under s 25(1) of the DMTA.
38Whether the deemed supply was included in the principal count (and therefore made the offending conduct on that count more serious), or charged as a separate count is, however, immaterial to the overall criminality of the offending conduct which is necessarily constant, however the charges are framed. Accordingly, this issue need not be considered further.
39It would have been open to the sentencing judge in the present case to make the sentences wholly concurrent having regard to the close relationship between the criminality of the principal and the secondary count. However, it was also open to her Honour to accumulate the sentences for the two offences, as the applicant's counsel at the sentence hearing, in my view, properly conceded. 
40In Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 (Zreika), at [83] Johnson J (McClellan CJ at CL agreeing) referred to:""the primacy of the rule that appeal grounds should relate to arguments put, and decisions made, at first instance.""
41Although there are occasions where matters not raised or conceded on behalf of an applicant at the sentence hearing will nonetheless give rise to errors which can be corrected by this Court, it is generally undesirable for leave to appeal to be sought on grounds which are contrary to concessions made before the primary judge, unless there are exceptional circumstances: Zreika at [81] per Johnson J. It was not suggested, nor could it have been suggested, that there were exceptional circumstances in the present case.
42I am unable to detect any error in the exercise of her Honour's discretion. Accordingly, the third ground has not been made out.
Ground 4: the sentencing judge erred in departing from her stated intention of imposing ""a couple of more years"" on the applicant without notice to the parties
43The applicant submitted that because her Honour had indicated an intention of adding two more years to the time in custody, there was a denial of natural justice when her Honour fixed a non-parole period in excess of that indication and that the sentence was therefore erroneous in law. Mr Barrow relied on Weir v R [2011] NSWCCA 123 (Weir) at [64]-[67] and Button v R [2010] NSWCCA 264 (Button) at [14]-[18].
44The Crown contended that questions of procedural fairness are to be considered as a matter of substance and that there was, in the circumstances of the instant case, no denial of natural justice since the submissions of both parties had concluded and there was nothing more that could be said when her Honour gave the indication.
45The question whether a party has been denied an opportunity to be heard, being a matter of substance, must be determined by reference to the circumstances during the proceedings. The real question is whether there has been actual unfairness, not whether there has been a disappointment because an expectation engendered by the decision-maker has not been fulfilled: Re Minister for Immigration & Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6; 214 CLR 1 (Lam) at [34] per Gleeson CJ. Commonly, unfairness will arise where someone has been deprived of the opportunity to make submissions or has failed to make submissions by reason of an indication, which ultimately proves to have been false, from the decision-maker. 
46A denial of procedural fairness was found to have occurred in Weir where, following the sentencing judge's indication that he was ""highly likely"" to impose a sentence of the order foreshadowed, the offender's representative did not make any further submissions on sentence. When the sentencing judge delivered a sentence that was significantly longer, the sentence was set aside on the basis of denial of procedural fairness. In Button, the sentencing judge commented in the course of the hearing that, given the applicant's status as a first-time offender and his strong prospects of rehabilitation, ""release after one year in jail and perhaps 18 months or two years on parole"" would be appropriate. The judge later imposed a significantly longer sentence. This Court found that there had been a denial of procedural fairness.
47In the present case, the indication from the Bench came after both parties had had an opportunity to address her Honour on all matters and had availed themselves of that opportunity. The present case is to be distinguished from cases such as Weir and Button or cases, where a judge has given an early indication that a custodial sentence will not be imposed and has subsequently imposed a custodial sentence. In those circumstances, the offender has a legitimate grievance that he or she has, by the judge's indication, been denied the opportunity of addressing the Court on why a custodial sentence ought not be imposed.
48In the present case, there was no denial of procedural fairness. Ground 4 has not been made out.
Ground 5: the sentences imposed are both individually and in total manifestly excessive
49Mr Barrow submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive since the applicant was engaged in systematic, low-level drug dealing at street level. The applicant had not been previously convicted of supplying prohibited drugs but had a lengthy criminal record and a long history of drug addiction. Mr Barrow pointed out that when one takes account of the 25% discount for the plea, the starting point for the principal count (s 25A of the DMTA) was six years and the starting point for the secondary count (s 25(1) of the DMTA) was three years and four months.
50In support of ground 5, Mr Barrow referred this Court to two decisions of this Court and also a sentence imposed by Wells DCJ in respect of an offender whom he contended was similar to the applicant. 
51Mr Barrow relied on Koklas v R [2003] NSWCCA 302 (Koklas) in which this Court dismissed an offender's appeal against sentence. The offender had not previously been in custody. He was described as a ""runner"" and ""street dealer"" and was subjected to threats of violence if he was not efficient in the supply operations. He became involved to feed his own drug habit. There were favourable subjective circumstances in that the offender grew up in a supportive family environment, had regular work and was leading a productive life until his addiction to hard drugs.
52Mr Barrow also relied on Tran v R [2007] NSWCCA 140 in which this Court dismissed an appeal against sentence by Tran. He was found to have been operating a commercial business above that of a street level dealer. Like the applicant, he was sentenced for an offence under s 25A of the DTMA (supplying four lots of 5 g of heroin and then a further amount of 56 g of heroin) and an offence under s 25 of the DTMA (being in possession of a further 75 g of heroin when he was arrested). Tran's total effective sentence was four years and six months, with an effective non-parole period of three years.
53Mr Barrow relied on a decision of Wells DCJ in which her Honour sentenced Bakker, who had been arrested on the same day as the applicant by an officer who was connected with the same strike force. There were some similarities in the conduct. Bakker was sentenced to a term of two years' imprisonment with a one-year non-parole period. Mr Barrow did not submit that the principles of parity applied.
54Like manifest excess, manifest inadequacy is a conclusion that does not require identification of a specific error: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6] (Gleeson CJ and Hayne J). The determination of the fifth ground requires the conclusion to be examined.
55Care must be taken in drawing direct comparisons between sentences passed, those to be passed and those which are, or have been, the subject of appeal: see generally, Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2005] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [53]- [56] per French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ. Sentencing requires the exercise of discretion. The factors that are germane to the exercise of the discretion include deterrence, both general and specific, rehabilitation and punishment. The exercise of the discretion requires consideration of objective circumstances (the seriousness of the offending conduct) as well as subjective circumstances pertinent to the offender. The number of factors to be taken into account as either mitigating or aggravating under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides an indication of the complexity of the exercise and the concomitant difficulty of identifying ""comparable cases"". Although it is orthodox for such cases to be identified for the benefit of the sentencing judge, they can be no more than a guide.
56I do not consider the sentence imposed to be outside the range within which the sentencing judge's discretion could properly be exercised. The result does not indicate that the discretion miscarried.
Proposed orders
57The orders I propose are:
(1)Leave to appeal granted.
(2)Appeal dismissed.

2705249,BR v R [2014] NSWCCA 46,"JUDGMENT

1EMMETT JA: On 28 September 2012, the appellant, BR, was convicted on four charges under the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the Crimes Act) after he was found guilty on all four charges by a majority verdict of a jury of eleven. Two of the charges were under s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act, one was under s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act, and one was under s 66A of the Crimes Act. A total effective sentence of five years and nine months, with a non-parole period of three years and six months, was imposed on the appellant. By notice filed on 15 October 2013, the appellant seeks to appeal from the convictions on the ground that the trial judge erred in directing the jury as to returning majority verdicts in respect of the four charges. 

2Section 55F of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) (the Jury Act) provides for majority verdicts in certain circumstances. Relevantly, s 55F applies in respect of a verdict in criminal proceedings where the jury consists of not less than eleven persons. In such a case, the jury may return a majority verdict if two prerequisites are satisfied. The first is that a unanimous verdict has not been reached after the jurors have deliberated for a period of time that the Court considers reasonable, having regard to the nature and complexity of the proceedings. That period of time must not be less than eight hours. The second prerequisite is that the Court is satisfied, after examination on oath of one or more of the jurors, that it is unlikely that the jurors will reach a unanimous verdict after further deliberation. For the purposes of s 55F, ""unanimous verdict"" means a verdict agreed to by all members of the jury. A ""majority verdict"" means, where the jury consists of eleven persons at the time the verdict is returned, a verdict agreed to by ten jurors.

3The trial of the appellant on indictment in respect of the four charges took place over five days on 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28 September 2012. The jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict on any of the charges. It is necessary to consider with some precision the steps taken towards reaching a majority verdict. 



The Jury's Deliberations

4At about 9.45am on 26 September 2012, the Sheriff informed the trial judge that one of the jurors was ill. When the trial judge called the matter on for hearing, her Honour informed counsel of that fact and senior counsel for the appellant requested that the juror be discharged and the trial continue. The Crown supported that position. Accordingly, the trial judge directed that the trial continue with a jury consisting of eleven persons. 

5At 3.11pm on 26 September 2012, after a summing up by the trial judge, the jury retired to consider its verdict. The jurors returned to the courtroom at 4.05pm. Thus, on that day, the jury was absent from the courtroom for 54 minutes. 

6On 27 September 2012, according to a record that was accepted as accurate by the trial judge (the Jury Record), the jurors recommenced their deliberations at 9.35am and returned to Court for questions at 10.26am. They retired for further deliberations at 10.38am. The Jury Record states that the jury took lunch at 1pm, and finished lunch and continued deliberations, at 2pm. At 2pm, the trial judge received a note from the jury in the following terms:

Indictment 1 - unable to reach unanimous decision.

Indictment 2 - unable to reach unanimous decision.

Indictment 3 - unable to reach unanimous decision.

Indictment 4 - unable to reach unanimous decision.

Alternative Indictment - unable to reach unanimous decision. 

7In the course of discussing the note with counsel, the trial judge enquired of the Crown how long the jury had been deliberating, indicating that her Honour did not wish to have the period for lunch included in the deliberations. The Crown asserted to her Honour that, as at 2pm, the jury had been deliberating for four hours and ten minutes. 

8The jury returned to Court at 2.13pm and was given a direction by the trial judge. Her Honour informed the jury that she had the power to discharge them from giving a verdict but should only do so if satisfied that there was no likelihood of genuine agreement being reached after further deliberation. Her Honour told the jury that experience has shown that juries can often agree if given more time to consider and discuss the issues. Her Honour said that, if after calmly considering the evidence and listening to the opinions of the other jurors, a member of the jury could not honestly agree with the conclusions of the other jurors, that juror should give effect to his or her own view of the evidence. The jury was reminded that their verdict in relation to each count, whether guilty or not guilty, must be a unanimous one. Her Honour repeated that experience has shown that often juries are able to agree in the end if they are given more time to discuss the evidence and, for that reason, judges usually request juries to re-examine the matters on which they are in disagreement and to make a further attempt to reach a verdict (see Black v The Queen [1993] HCA 71; 179 CLR 44). 

9The jury was then asked to retire and see whether they could reach a verdict in the light of what the trial judge had said. At 2.17pm, the jury retired to deliberate further. However, at 3.11pm, the jury sent a further note to the trial judge saying, relevantly, as follows:

We can see no possible resolution that would enable us to reach a unanimous decision. 

10Senior counsel appearing for the appellant then made an application to the trial judge to discharge the jury. The Crown opposed the application. The trial judge then heard submissions from senior counsel for the appellant and from the Crown concerning the discharge of a jury before the expiration of eight hours of deliberation. Her Honour indicated that she would not decide the question of discharge that afternoon. 

11The jury returned to Court at 3.34pm, when the trial judge indicated that their note had been received. Her Honour directed the jury to go home and to return the following morning to continue with their deliberations. Her Honour directed the jury to disperse quickly and not to discuss the case with anyone. The jury left the courtroom at 3.35pm. 

12According to the Jury Record, the jury deliberated for 283 minutes on 27 September 2012, apart from twelve minutes when the jury was in the courtroom for questions during the morning, and four minutes devoted to the Black v The Queen direction in the afternoon, and apart from the period between 1pm and 2pm while the jury had lunch. At the end of that day, the Crown informed the trial judge that the total period of deliberation at that stage was five hours and 27 minutes. The trial judge suggested that the time should be treated as five hours and 20 minutes ""for more caution"". Senior counsel for the appellant and the Crown both agreed that eight hours of deliberations would conclude at 12.10pm on the following day, assuming that the jury began deliberating at 9.30am. 

13On the morning of 28 September 2012, the trial judge gave her reasons for declining to discharge the jury on 27 September 2012. In her reasons, her Honour observed that, as at the time when the jury was sent home on that day, deliberations had continued for five hours and 40 minutes, although it would be treated as five hours and 20 minutes ""to err on the conservative side in respect of times"". 

14According to the Jury Record, the jury recommenced deliberations on 28 September 2012 at 9.35am. Later that morning, the trial judge received a further note from the jury that was marked as having been signed at 11.10am and as having been received by the judge at 11:20am. The note was in the following terms:

The jury can not reach a unanimous decision. This will not change with time. After exhaustive discussion and analysis, we have arrived at this conclusion. 

At some time after 11.20am, the trial judge informed counsel that she had received that note. 

15At approximately 12.15pm, after a brief exchange, senior counsel for the appellant said to the trial judge ""we are at the eight hours now"". Senior counsel submitted that, having regard to the various deductions made by the trial judge, the Court was ""on the safe side of eight hours"" so that, if the trial judge were to proceed to bring the jury in to examine the foreman for the purposes of s 55F of the Jury Act, ""your Honour will be safe"". Senior counsel said that no one on either side could criticise that course. The trial judge enquired of counsel as to whether they were agreed that ""a reasonable time"" had elapsed in the circumstances of the case and both counsel agreed that it had. 

16The trial judge then observed that both parties had indicated that eight hours had expired in the case and that both parties were of the view that that was a reasonable time in all the circumstances of the case. Her Honour then indicated that she would apply the provisions of s 55F of the Jury Act. 

17The jury returned to the courtroom at 12.16pm. At 12.18pm, the foreman of the jury was examined by the trial judge and confirmed that it was unlikely that a unanimous verdict would be reached. Her Honour then announced that, having heard the evidence of the foreman, she was satisfied that the jury would be unable to reach a verdict in respect of any count after further deliberations. Her Honour said that, while she had power to discharge the jury from giving a verdict, she should only do so if satisfied that there was no likelihood of genuine agreement being reached after further deliberation. Her Honour said that the circumstances had arisen under which she may take a majority verdict and directed that, should the jury continue to be unable to reach a unanimous verdict, they may return, and she must accept, a verdict of ten as the verdict of the jury in the case. Her Honour directed the jury that they must consider all the counts separately and determine whether they can reach a unanimous verdict or a majority verdict of ten out of eleven in respect of each of the counts separately. At 12.25pm, the jury retired to consider its verdicts further. The jury returned at 12.40pm with a majority verdict of guilty to all four charges. The jury was discharged at 12.44pm. 

The Grounds of Appeal

18The appellant contends that, in the circumstances just described, the jury had not deliberated for eight hours before the majority verdict was taken. More specifically, he contends that, had the trial judge turned her mind to the question, her Honour could not have been satisfied that the jury was, in fact, deliberating for the period of one hour and five minutes that elapsed between 11.10am on 28 September 2012, when the jury sent a note to her Honour, and 12.15pm, when the jury returned to the courtroom. He relies on the fact that the jury was given no direction by the trial judge as to how they were to proceed in the jury room from the time when her Honour received the note at 11:20am until the jury was recalled. He says that that failure by the trial judge to adhere strictly to the statutory prerequisites of s 55F breached the appellant's fundamental common law right to a unanimous verdict (see Cheatle v The Queen [1993] HCA 44; 177 CLR 541 at 552-3).

Relevant Legal Principles

19One of the principal difficulties in construing s 55F(2) is the absence of a definition of ""deliberation"". Notwithstanding the limitations inherent in the guidance provided by dictionary definitions in statutory construction (see Blacktown Workers' Club Ltd v O'Shannessy [2011] NSWCA 265 at [37]), the Court was provided with a definition from the Macquarie Concise Dictionary, being ""careful consideration before decision ... formal consultation or discussion"". Similarly, in R v Young [1995] QB 324, the English Court of Appeal (at 331-2) considered the Oxford English Dictionary definitions, which included ""weighing ... in the mind"", ""discussion of ... reasons for and against"" and ""debate"". It is not to be doubted, however, that the provisions of the Jury Act should be construed in a practical way, having regard to the context in which Parliament intended them to operate (see R v Rodriguez [1998] 2 VR 167 at 186).

20The application of the term ""deliberation"" to the facts of individual cases may be usefully guided by two considerations. The first is whether the jury is sequestered in the same location (such as the jury room). The second is whether the jury is able to conduct discussions about the case at hand.

21Thus, discrete and substantial breaks from the performance of the jury's task, such as retirement overnight and adjournment for lunch, where lunch is not taken in the jury room, should be excluded from the eight hour period mentioned in s 55F. The members of a jury cannot be said to be engaged in deliberation while they are away from the courtroom for a prolonged period of time in the charge of strangers. Therefore, it is necessary to exclude from the calculation of the eight hour period any period during which the jurors are permitted to return to their homes or to repair to temporary accommodation.

22The period during which a jury is in court, such as for the purpose of listening to a direction from the judge or asking a question, has been held to be included in the calculation of the eight hour period (see R v Adams [1969] 1 WLR 106; R v Rodriguez [1998] 2 VR 167 at 186). However, although the jury is together while listening to a direction, there is no capacity for them to consider and discuss the case collectively. Thus, it is difficult to see how they could reasonably be said to be ""deliberating"". If it be accepted that a jury could be said to be deliberating ""during even a prolonged redirection"" (R v Rodriguez at 186), it would follow that a jury is deliberating during at least part of a summing up. However, one would not ordinarily regard that period as falling within the definition of ""deliberation"" for the purposes of s 55F(2).

23It must be doubted whether the time spent by a jury travelling between the jury room and the court room should properly be counted (as it was in R v Rodriguez; in R v Bateson [1969] 3 All ER 1372, the court refrained from expressing a view). Having regard to the two considerations described above, I would be disposed to conclude that such ""travel time"" should not be included in the eight hour period. Although the jury is together, there would not normally be any real opportunity for the members of the jury to consider and discuss the case as an entity. That question, however, does not arise in the present case.

24Having regard to the language of s 55F, and the nature of the right that it modifies, it would be prudent not to invite a majority verdict at the moment that eight hours have elapsed. The court has a discretion to exercise and, if there is a miscalculation of the time that the jury has been deliberating, an issue may arise not only as to non-compliance with s 55F, but also, if the miscalculation is substantial, as to whether that discretion miscarried on account of a mistake of fact. Accordingly, a court should be slow to make an assumption that, for the purposes of the calculation of the period of deliberation, time spent dining is necessarily a time spent in deliberation. It is not possible to enquire as to what actually occurs in the privacy of the jury room, such as while the jury takes lunch in the jury room. It would therefore be prudent for a trial judge, when determining the period of deliberation by a jury, to avoid the risk of miscarriage by refraining from acting immediately after the expiration of eight hours if there is any ambiguity about any component of the minimum period (AGW v R [2008] NSWCCA 81 at [24]-[25]). 

Resolution of the Appeal

25In the present case, there was no engagement by the trial judge with the jury for the purposes of s 55F until after 12.15pm on 28 September 2012. There has been no suggestion that the trial judge gave the jury any direction following receipt of the note bearing the time ""11.10am"". In particular, there has been no suggestion that the jury was directed not to deliberate further. Thus, the present case can be distinguished from a case in which the judge directs the jury to cease deliberations. 

26There can be no enquiry as to what occurred in the privacy of the jury room from 11.10am until 12.15pm, when the jury was brought back to the courtroom. Further, there is no basis for drawing an inference that, because the jury sent the note at 11.10am, the jury had ceased deliberating at that point. There had been no mention of the possibility of a majority verdict in the Black v The Queen direction given by the trial judge to the jury on the previous afternoon. That direction did not raise any question as to whether the jury should cease to undertake further deliberations. There was no suggestion in that direction, after the jury had sent its first note, that the jury should cease deliberations. 

27There is no reason to draw any inference that the jury was not together in the jury room between 11.10am and 12.15pm on 28 September 2012. That being so, there was no reason to draw an inference that they did not continue to deliberate during that period. The jury had twice before sent a note indicating that they could not agree on a unanimous verdict. In particular, the second note had stated that the jury could see ""no possible resolution"" that would enable them to reach a unanimous decision. That note is quite adamant. 

28Nevertheless, the jury was told to continue deliberating. There is, therefore, no basis for concluding that the third note was an indication by the jury that it had ceased deliberating on the question of the guilt of the appellant. The onus is on the appellant to establish that the trial miscarried because the jurors were not actually deliberating, notwithstanding that they were together during that period in the jury room. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, an inference should be drawn that, while the jurors were confined together in the jury room, they were continuing to deliberate. It follows that the prerequisite of deliberation for an eight hour period was satisfied. 

29The Crown contends, in the alternative, that, if an inference should be drawn that the jury had ceased deliberating when they sent the note at 11.10am on 28 September 2012, the period of one hour for lunch on 27 September 2012 should not be excluded from the calculation of the eight-hour period. That question is more difficult. In ordinary circumstances, there would be no reason to conclude that, simply because the jury was eating lunch in the jury room, it was not deliberating. However, the Jury Record is not without ambiguity. It states that at 1pm ""jury takes lunch"" and that at 2pm ""jury finishes lunch and continues deliberation - note sent to Court"". Those entries are capable of being construed as meaning that the jury ceased deliberation at 1pm and resumed deliberation at 2pm, although that is not entirely clear. It may simply reflect a working assumption on the part of the compiler of the Jury Record - an assumption that is almost certainly not entirely realistic - that the jury does not deliberate during its lunch period.

30The appellant points to three observations made by the trial judge as giving rise to an inference that the jury would expect that it was not required to deliberate during a lunch break. First, during the trial on 25 September 2012, the trial judge thanked the jury and asked them to take their luncheon break. Secondly, in the course of the summing up on 26 September 2012, the trial judge observed that it was an appropriate time to have the luncheon break and directed the jury to come back at 2pm. Later, on the same day, at the end of the summing up, her Honour observed that, in any trial when a jury commences deliberations, she never anticipates the length of the time the jury can take and that it is totally up to the jury. Her Honour said, however, that in any trial, she does not take a verdict between 1pm and 2pm, because it is the lunch break. The trial judge also observed that, at about 4pm, she almost invariably makes an enquiry as to whether the jury wants to sit on for a bit longer or come back with fresh minds on the following morning. 

31The appellant contends that, in the light of those observations, an inference should be drawn that the jury would have understood that they were not expected to continue deliberations during the lunch break. I do not consider that such an inference should be drawn from those observations. In circumstances where the jury was provided with lunch and continued together in the jury room, there is insufficient evidence to justify an inference that they ceased to deliberate during that period. 

32If the period between 1pm and 2pm on 27 September 2012 were to be included, there could be no doubt that the prerequisite for eight hours of deliberation was satisfied in the present case. I would be disposed to conclude that that is the position if I had drawn the inference that the jury ceased deliberating at 11.10am on 28 September 2012. However, it is not necessary to form a final view on that question. 

33Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) relevantly provides that, on any appeal against conviction, the Court may, notwithstanding that it is of the opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. The appellant contends that the proceedings had so far departed as to have ceased to be a trial according to law, such that it was not open to conclude that there had been no substantial miscarriage of justice for the purposes of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. 

34Having regard to the stance taken by senior counsel for the appellant at the trial, to the effect that the eight hour period of deliberation had expired, and the adamant terms of the second note sent to the trial judge by the jury, I am not persuaded that the eight hour requirement in s 55F was not satisfied. It is thus not necessary to decide whether, if the question of eight hours' deliberation might have been decided in favour of the appellant, a substantial miscarriage of justice would be said to have occurred in any event.

35The appellant has not established that there is a basis for concluding that the jury did not deliberate for at least eight hours before returning their majority verdicts. Under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act, an appeal on a question of mixed law and fact lies to this Court only with the leave of the Court. The question of whether the jury deliberated for at least eight hours may be one of mixed law and fact, although that is not entirely without doubt. In the circumstances, to the extent that leave is necessary, if at all, I would grant leave to appeal, but would dismiss the appeal. 

36HALL J: I agree with the reasons of Emmett JA and the orders he has proposed. I have read Hulme AJ's judgment in draft. Save for his Honour's observation upon whether a jury's time spent listening to redirections and the like should be counted, I agree with his Honour's reasons.

37HULME AJ: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Emmett JA. His Honour has set out the facts relevant to the determination of the question posed for this Court and I need not repeat them. 

38The statutory provision relevant is s 55F of the Jury Act 1977 and in particular ss (2):

A majority verdict may be returned by a jury in criminal proceedings if: 
(a) a unanimous verdict has not been reached after the jurors have deliberated for a period of time (being not less than 8 hours) that the court considers reasonable having regard to the nature and complexity of the criminal proceedings, and

(b) the court is satisfied, after examination on oath of one or more of the jurors, that it is unlikely that the jurors will reach a unanimous verdict after further deliberation.

39This provision was enacted in 2006 against the well-known long-standing rule that a court will not enquire into a jury's deliberations and what occurs in the jury room. (There is an exception to that last statement - see Smith v Western Australia [2014] HCA 3; (2014) 88 ALJR 384 - but the exception is of no present relevance.) 

40In these circumstances ""the jurors have deliberated"" must be given a practical common-sense operation. It was never intended that the Court should be concerned with whether the jurors have, minute by minute, been discussing the case rather than e.g. talking about the latest cricket scores or anything else of topical interest. 

41On the other hand, if the Court knows that at certain times a jury has not been deliberating, that time must be excluded from the eight hours referred to in s 55F(2)(a) of the Jury Act 1977. Thus, I agree with Emmett JA that the calculation of eight hours must exclude any time when a jury has been sent to overnight jury accommodation or a hotel for sleeping or eating purposes. Although there may well be some discussions between some jurors during such times, the jury as an entity would not be deliberating. This view is supported by R v Young [1995] QB 324; [1995] Cr App Rep 379 and R v Rodriguez [1998] 2 VR 167; (1997) 93 A Crim R 535 at [554].

42Most commonly, at least in New South Wales, a jury is provided with lunch in the jury room. In that situation it is impossible to believe that a jury will immediately cease their deliberations at the commencement of the usual lunch hour (or on the delivery of the lunch) and resume them at the end of that time. It is highly likely that in fact some deliberations will occur within that period. This inability to decide how much of lunchtime is spent in deliberations means that the whole of that time or none of it should be included in the eight-hour calculation. 

43It may be assumed that Parliament was aware of the way in which the jury system operated when the relevant provision of the Jury Act was passed. Given that, it is impossible to believe that, although the jury is sequestrated during such lunch periods, Parliament intended that that period should be excluded and accordingly all of it should be included in the calculation of the 8 hours. This view is supported by R v Doherty [1999] VSCA 165; (1999) 3 VR 435 and R v VST [2003] VSCA 35; (2003) 6 VR 569 at [13], [14]. 

44On the other hand any time the jury spend listening to redirections and the like should not be counted. I appreciate that that approach is contrary to what was said in R v Adams [1969] 1 WLR 106; (1968) 52 Cr App R 588 - I doubt if the different terms of the Criminal Justice Act 1967, viz. that ""the jury have had not less than two hours for deliberation"", provides ground for distinction. It is also contrary to R v Rodriguez [1998] 2 VR 167; (1997) 93 A Crim R 535 at [555] where Callaway JA, whose judgment was concurred in by Hayne and Charles JJA, remarked that, ""I should think that a jury deliberate during even a prolonged redirection"". If that is so, logically they are likely to be deliberating during at least part of a summing up but, even independently of the operation of s 55F(2), one would not logically apply the concept of deliberation to that time.

45There will of course be situations not quite as clear. Commonly the time a jury enters or leaves the courtroom are recorded but the court system does not operate on the basis that the jurors are ""clocked"" in and out of the jury room except for their arrival and departure times of the day. Even those times are often not formally recorded, the sheriff officers simply informing the judge in chambers when the jury have arrived or left. When a jury leaves or returns to a courtroom, some time is inevitably occupied in its movement doing so. That time may be short where a jury room is immediately adjacent to a courtroom or somewhat longer when there is a longer distance between the two rooms. It is virtually certain that in the course of such a movement the jury as a group will not be deliberating but it is impossible to believe that when Parliament fixed the period of eight hours it intended that in a decision as to whether that time had passed, there should be an inquiry into how long it took for a jury to move between the court and jury room (and whether in a particular case there was any delay because, e.g. one of the members of the jury had dropped some papers). Again, practical considerations lead me to the view that it was intended that such movement time should be included in the 8 hours calculation.

46There are also other occasional interruptions. From time to time, one or more members of a jury are permitted to leave a jury room for the purposes of having a cigarette. It has not been the practice to record these times but it is at least reasonably arguable that the jury, as a group, is not deliberating during those periods.

47The above consideration leads to the view that more attention and recording than has been the practice during the past needs to be made as to the times when the full complement of jurors arrive and when any members of it leave a jury room to the intent that one can say with confidence when the jury as a body is present and able to deliberate. It also reinforces the need for a judge to be careful, in circumstances where there is scope for doubt, such as in my cigarette example, to ensure that at least eight hours of deliberations have passed.

48Turning then to the facts of this case, I accept the possibility that given the terms of the jury notes to which Emmett J has referred, the jury may have stopped their deliberations after the sending of those notes. However, one can never be certain for no further enquiry could be made. Be that as it may, the jury remained sequestered for the purposes of deliberation during that time and that time should be counted in the calculation required under s 55F(2).

49Accordingly, in my view, within the meaning of s 55F(2) the jury deliberated for not less than 8 hours being:-

54 minutes on 26 September

51 minutes being 9.35am - 10.25am on 27 September

3 hours 35 minutes being 10.38am - 2.13pm on 27 September 

1 hour 17 minutes being 2.17am - 3.34pm on 27 September

2 hours 41 minutes being 9.35am - 12.16pm on 28 September

50These periods total 9 hours 18 minutes.

51There is one further matter to which I should advert. I take the view that compliance with the eight hour period prescribed in s 55F(2) is mandatory if a majority verdict is to stand and that non-compliance means that a substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred in the sense that the Appellant has not received a trial according to law. In those circumstances s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 cannot be used to save the verdict. See RJS v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 241; (2007) 173 A Crim R 100 at [19]; AGW v R [2008] NSWCCA 81 at [23]; Hunt v R [2011] NSWCCA 152; (2011) 81 NSWLR 181 at [189].

52I agree that the Court should grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

2705257,R v McLean [2014] NSWDC 104,"SEntENCE

 

 

1HIS HONOUR: Before I move to the sentencing remarks that the law requires me to make in relation to this matter, there are some remarks I wish to make which are particularly directed to the prisoner and the victim and their families and the people that support them in this Court. It is to be remembered of course that sentencing in courts is a complex exercise and it is not primarily or principally directed at extracting revenge or retribution for wrongdoing.

 

2Most importantly, I make the point that when sentencing offenders where they cause the death or serious injury to other people either in the control of motor vehicles or in manslaughter matters the sentence ultimately imposed is not to be regarded as the measure of the value of the life lost or the injury done by the prisoner to a particular victim. It is also to be remembered of course that the criminal law recognises a wide range of levels of culpability.

 

3The prisoner here is to be sentenced in the context that the prosecution has charged him with an offence that does not require it to prove that he had the intention to cause grievous bodily harm, that is really serious bodily harm as undoubtedly occurred in this case to the victim. Courts do not determine what charges people should face, the range of conduct that warrants the sanction of the criminal law can vary from the extreme levels such as those shown in the conduct of Ivan Milat over a period of time, viciously torturing and then murdering his victims, to cases involving people controlling motor vehicles being momentarily distracted by a mobile phone or a child in the backseat and then losing control of their motor vehicle and causing grievous bodily harm or death.

 

4Of course, the Director of Public Prosecutions has the responsibility of exercising the discretion to determine what charge or charges should be brought against and accused person. This is a discretion exercised by the prosecution quite separately from the Courts and of course the Courts are reluctant to interfere with and rarely interfere with the learned Director's discretion. Courts never determine the terms of a particular charge.

 

5I am not suggesting for a moment that the charge in this matter was inappropriate. But members of the public, prisoners, victims and those otherwise interested in the case of course should understand that they come here to view only this particular individual case, however the Court itself sees the wide variety of human misconduct on a daily basis and is left to rely upon its experience to assess where particular moral culpability lies in the range of offences of the type with which a particular offender is charged.

 

6The High Court of Australia in Wong v The Queen, (2001) 207 CLR 344, dealing with guideline judgments in Commonwealth sentencing matters in 2001, noted that the ""core"" of the difficulty in the sentencing task is its complexity. This has not been helped of course by legislative amendments and changes over a period of time. Sentencing judges are required to take into account a wide variety of matters which concern the seriousness of the offence for which the offender stands to be sentenced and the personal history and circumstances of the offender.

 

7Very often, the High Court said, there are ""competing and contradictory considerations"". What might mitigate seriousness of the offence on one hand may aggravate the seriousness of the offence on the other. Yet, from these matters the Judge is left with the responsibility of distilling an answer which reflects human behaviour in time or monetary units of punishment.

 

8Mr McLean, my practice is to tell people in advance what sentence is to be imposed. In your case I propose to impose a sentence of three years imprisonment with a nonparole period of eighteen months which will commence from today. I have to give my reasons in relation to that.

 

9The prisoner appears today for sentence in relation to the offence of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm upon Adam Ford in the early hours of 24 March 2013 at Orange. The offence to which the prisoner has pleaded guilty carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment with a standard nonparole period of four years imprisonment. The prisoner pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity and was committed for sentence to this Court. Thus, in accordance with the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309 where the Court of Criminal Appeal laid down a guideline for discounts to be given to reflect the utilitarian benefit of pleas of guilty, the prisoner is entitled to a discount of twentyfive per cent on the otherwise appropriate sentence.

 

10The prisoner, as I understand it, is now twentyfour years of age. According to the statement of facts the victim of the assault Mr Ford is now twentynine years of age. As can be divined from the material that has been presented to the Court, I understand the two men were strangers to each other at the time of the grievous bodily harm being suffered by Mr Ford. There was some reference in the facts to the prisoner being in Orange to play in a rugby league trial representing a team from Queanbeyan and I understand Mr Ford was actively involved in rugby league in Orange. Whether they played against each other that day, or whether they had contact that day, I am not informed.

 

11The prisoner after his trial match, that is the day before the incident giving rise to the charge, went out with his team mates drinking together, not an uncommon experience for country teams travelling away for games. But often leading to very unfortunate consequences. The victim had been at the Royal Hotel and he left there at about 2.30am on 24 March. He walked out of the doorway that affronts Lords Place and passed a group of people who had been refused entry by the security officers to the Royal Hotel. This group included the prisoner.

 

12Before the two men passed each other, and in fact before the victim left the hotel, the facts state that a ""brief verbal altercation"" had occurred between the prisoner and a security officer. Following upon this the victim left the hotel. He passed the prisoner and a team mate, as the person is described in the facts, and some words were said to the victim by either the prisoner or the team mate.

 

13The victim turned around, walked a few steps back towards the prisoner and a further ""short exchange of words"" took place before the victim turned and walked towards the roadway which I take to be Lords Place, not Summer Street, which is nearby. I am denied the detail of what was said, but the facts state that the prisoner then followed the victim and punched him once to the left side of the head. Whether the victim was facing towards the prisoner or had his back completely to the prisoner the facts do not state. Certainly he had turned away from where the prisoner had been standing. The punch caused the victim to fall. But the real damage was done, as is often the case in such matters when someone is hit with a punch that is surprising and knocks them off balance, with the victim's head hitting the footpath and gutter heavily.

 

14One only needs to read the facts of the leading High Court judgment on 'unlawful and dangerous act' manslaughter (Wilson v The Queen) to see very close parallels with this incident, and understand from many cases that come before the courts, that such unfortunate consequences happen too often in such circumstances. Even if it can be said where death is caused or serious grievous bodily harm has been caused, there was not an intention to cause the grievous bodily harm that arose. Distressingly, for the community, victims and the Courts, similar events, some with far more catastrophic consequences, have been chronicled in recent months in the media and elsewhere.

 

15Mr Ford lost consciousness, as one would expect. He was tended by a friend and a trainee nurse who contacted emergency services. The facts state that the prisoner stepped back after the blow, placed his hands in his pockets and walked away from the area in an easterly direction towards Summer Street.

 

16The prisoner has given evidence that in fact he went across the road, as I understand it to the other side of the Summer Street, and waited with some friends to find out what was happening. Apparently he sent a friend or friends back to the scene where obviously a crowd of people had gathered including police, to see if the victim was all right. Police attended and took information from various people designed to identify the attacker. There were team mates of the prisoner in the vicinity and one of them supplied the name of the prisoner to the police. Whether that was the person who the prisoner had sent back or not I do not know.

 

17The victim was conveyed firstly by ambulance to the Orange Hospital, at the Bloomfield Campus, and was later airlifted to Westmead Hospital in a critical condition due to the severity of his head injury and what is described as a ""brain bleed"". He suffered an extra-dural haematoma, in other words a brain haemorrhage on the outer lining of the brain, and an underlying temporal bone fracture. He underwent a craniotomy and brain bruising was drained. He was at that point neurologically intact.

 

18To the prisoner's credit, to a limited degree, whilst he did not provide positive assistance to the victim, he surrendered himself to police at 6.20am on 24 March 2013 accompanied by his football coach. As it transpires, as I understand the facts, he would not have been much help at the scene although he could have remained at the scene, as is self evident. He was electronically interviewed but took legal advice not to answer questions and not surprisingly followed that advice.

 

19 A victim impact statement has been tendered and been read by the victim and I take that into account in accordance with the terms of the provisions in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 herein after referred to as ""the Act"". There is nothing particularly controversial about what the victim said, even though it was not given on oath as is not required by the law and not subject to the test of crossexamination. I was impressed with the victim's delivery of it. It must have been very difficult for him. Its contents and its delivery were without rancour, but it confirms, as is available from the other evidence, the profound impact upon the victim of the prisoner's conduct.

 

20This is demonstrated by two reports from the ""MidWestern Brain Injury Rehabilitation Program"" under the hand of a rehabilitation physician Dr Lahz. She gives the history of the treatment which shows that preoperatively the victim was able to improve from 4/15 to 14/15 on the Glasgow Coma Scale or the GCS. Postoperatively he was not subject to any complications and was extubated the day after the operation. He was discharged home on 18 April 2013. Of course, that is over three weeks after the relevant events. Quoting from the report ""(he) improved sufficiently well to resume working as a selfemployed plasterer approximately three months later, he also resumed driving uneventfully"".

 

21At the time of the first report prepared in early December 2013, he was not reporting any significant cognitive difficulties and was going about his life relatively normally although he had heightened fatigue, his relationship with his wife was not back to normal, he had avoided drinking, as advised, for six months, but apparently had resumed some heavy drinking, including what was described as ""binge drinking"". He had been cautioned about his alcohol intake. He was very anxious to resume playing football to ""prove"" that he could still play the game.

 

22I note in his victim impact statement when he talked about the many effects upon his life by the conduct of the prisoner, one particular matter that he referred to was the impact upon him of not playing a game of sport that he loved obviously and from which he was financially rewarded. This had had a big impact upon him and, particularly as I would expect, to his selfesteem.

 

23The doctor said in the first report that she would not advise him playing rugby league again because although there was a lack of physical problems, there was still the risk of a second head injury and he accepted that advice. She said at that time that the victim had ""recovered very well postbrain injury (but had to) undergo neuro-physiological assessment to particularise the injury"". She wanted to know the extent of cognitive deficits, she said that she was sure they would find several impediments although these were likely mild given that he had returned almost to normal preinjury life.

 

24In the second report there is a summary of the neuropsychological assessment which shows significant problems with ""speed information processing as well as difficulties with sustained and complex attention"". The neuropsychologist, Dr Casey, ""highlighted the adverse contribution made by the traumatic brain injury (TBI) such as related fatigue and depression"". The victim was showing a number of symptoms of irritability and low mood and he was advised to reduced his antidepressant medication Effexor which he had been apparently taking on and off since he was sixteen, initially for the treatment of anxiety. Removal from medication made him less ""numb"" but more susceptible to feeling emotions more strongly after his TBI. He continued to have fatigue and headaches. He had various concerns that are reflected in the report on 13 February about long term effects but at this stage it is impossible for the experts to make predictions as to other long term deterioration and what connection if any it would have to the TBI.

 

25Dr Lahz, said:

 

""Notwithstanding the previous psychological issues (which were managed well on medication preinjury according to his wife) I have no doubt that the severe TBI he suffered in the incident has served to destabilise him emotionally and behaviourally. These problems also have been exacerbated by the struggles he faces due to the traumatic brain injury inducing cognitive deficits, specifically those affecting speed information processing and complex/sustained attention and as well substantial TBI related fatigue"".

 

26Thus, it can be seen that putting aside the obvious very serious immediate trauma which was life threatening and the substantial postoperative impact upon the victim over three weeks of hospitalisation and a further three months of recovery without being able to work, that there are substantial permanent effects on the victim. Although it must be said, in the range of such matters, short of what might be called a worst case scenario.

 

27 Mr Ford, when he came to read his statement, appeared on observation of the Court, fit and strong. However the damage to him that continues may not be physical in the long term, but there may be a long term psychological and emotional injury. I will come back to the assessment of the objective facts in this matter when I deal with other relevant evidence.

 

28The prisoner has no prior criminal convictions for violence. He has two findings of guilt in relation to being an unlicensed driver in New South Wales in 2010 as well as some other driving matters in the ACT in September 2011. But they are of little moment. He has been in a partnership with a lady for approximately six years and apparently has been running for some years a successful sheet metal business in either the ACT or Queanbeyan. The ACT Corrective Services have prepared a report which sets out some history of the prisoner which is uncontroversial.

 

29He was born in Sydney, moved to the township of Young in south-west New South Wales with his mother and two siblings and then had limited contact with his father. He moved to Canberra in the ACT to complete an apprenticeship as a boilermaker. He also had talents in rugby league and sought to further his career in that regard. He now has two young children. When he completed his apprenticeship as a boilermaker he went to Sydney for a period of time and then returned to set up his business. According to the report he is a dedicated worker in his business and I have a reference from an employee referring to his industry working six days per week.

 

30He told the Corrective Services officer that he was intoxicated at the time of the offence and he was unable to recall how much, or what type of, alcohol he had consumed. This is no excuse of course for his conduct. That he was intoxicated is selfevident from the time at which this occurred, one would not expect people coming and going from the Royal Hotel at 2.30am in the morning to be anything but, unless they are teetotallers. That intoxication contributed to his behaviour is, with respect, neither here nor there. It certainly, as I said a moment ago, is not a mitigating factor.

 

31There has been considerable publicity in the last twelve months of the dangers within the community that intoxicated people in public create, on many occasions creating danger to other people either intoxicated or not. Some people are in no condition to defend themselves. As is well reported, the community is sick and tired of having to bear the burden of dealing with the consequences of drunken thuggish behaviour even if it is uncharacteristic of the offender.

 

32I accept in the context of his criminal and personal history that this act of violence was uncharacteristic of him. But the problem is in this matter, as with similar matters, the extent to which the prisoner when intoxicated is prone to act out violently must remain a continuing concern. Of course there is no evidence he has previously done something such as this. But the point is that the consumption of alcohol has removed his inhibitions on this occasion and caused him to act violently towards his victim.

 

33Apparently from the history given to the Corrective Services officer in Canberra, his alcohol consumption before this event was not problematic although occasionally he would participate in binge drinking, as he obviously did on this particular night. He has had no difficulties, or issues, with illicit substances and no mental health issues before the offence, although he did suffer some reactive symptoms to his current circumstances some months after the event. He told the Corrective Services officer that he did not believe that this behaviour is an acceptable form of behaviour.

 

34In the evidence he gave in this Court he produced what could be described as a Facebook post, apparently made two days after the event, in which he expressed his regret for what occurred. Although in expressing his regret the wording is somewhat curious in that he did not express any specific regard for the victim. He expressed regrets for ""things"" he would ""take back ... if he had the chance"" and said that ""from the bottom of my heart I'm sorry to the people I have hurt"".

 

35He was not questioned about the terms of the 'Facebook' post and I obviously made no criticism of the skilful way the Crown and defence conducted their case. I assume that the was reflecting upon the victim and his family, but then again it must be fairly said the prisoner is not Shakespeare and in fairness to him it may have been simply his manner of expression.

 

36He gave evidence of his regret and remorse in this Court and offered his apology to the victim. Whilst that expression from what I could judge, I believe was genuine, whether the victim accepts it or not is not a matter about which this Court can comment. He is under no obligation to do so and ultimately it is not a matter of any significance in the sentencing process. It is commonplace in cases of domestic violence for victims to forgive the perpetrator which courts ultimately must ignore as a general rule, otherwise it would just provide a charter for people to go back and do the same thing again.

 

37In relation to this issue of regret and remorse and apology, the Crown made a submission about the delay in offering an apology directly to the victim. I understand the point the Crown made, however, our criminal justice system does not in any formal way permit genuine expressions of apology or remorse or regret to be conveyed by a perpetrator to a victim who is a stranger for a range of reasons, including concern for the safety of the victim should the perpetrator be in contact with that person, not that I am suggesting for a moment this prisoner presents a threat to the victim now. Then again, of course, as happens as a result of motor vehicle accidents, regret can be conveyed in other ways by a modest gift of flowers or a card or some recognition to the victim's difficult road to recovery and the damage done without compromising the integrity of the victim.

 

38The criminal justice system could be served by a more formal or organised method of communication on such matters with out compromising a victim's safety, amongst other reasons, to give the Court which sees this material in a short period of time in rather formal circumstances some opportunity to better judge whether expressions of remorse and contrition and the like are truly genuine or merely reactive to circumstances. Of course, contrition is a matter of degree. Contrition and regret expressed immediately after a relevant event with positive assistance to a victim, as often happens in motor vehicle accidents, is one thing. Regret and contrition may be expressed not only immediately but continually over a period of time up until the matter comes to court and verified by a range of sources. Clearly, that type of contrition must be given greater weight than contrition offered, even if genuine, long after the event.

 

39The Corrective Services report notes the prisoner acknowledged his actions were wrong and accepted responsibility for the offence although he hinted at the fact that whilst his actions were not acceptable he did not believe his actions were ""unprovoked"". He has given no evidence, nor has there been any claim on his part for the purposes of sentencing proceedings, that there was any provocation for his action and it would be difficult to make that out given the bare facts. He acknowledged the impact upon the victim and expressed his willingness in his evidence, and to the Community Corrections officer, to pay compensation which no doubt inevitably he will be required to pay.

 

40He is assessed at a low risk of reoffending, he has no physical health concerns, he no longer has concern about his own mental health. He is the sole financial provider for the household. It is a very sad and ironic fact that in many ways the circumstances of this prisoner very much mirror those of his victim. The victim's capacity to work, support his wife and meaningfully contribute to his family has been severely impacted by the prisoner's actions for a period of time - I have already pointed out the fact that the victim was incapacitated in terms of work for a period of almost four months. Likewise, the prisoner's business which he has built up and justifiably has great pride in, will come to a halt or will be severely disrupted and his ability to support his family will be denied to him because of the consequences of his actions.

 

41The assessment of the ACT Corrective Services officer recognises the prisoner's insight as to the effect of his actions and the inquiries of the service in Canberra reveal that the prisoner leads a conventional family life with a prosocial lifestyle. His life would appear to be committed to his work and his family and his sport, he has continued to play rugby league. He would need some assistance obviously in the future in relation to alcohol counselling and safe drinking strategies, that is selfevident and certainly no doubt he is going to need considerable assistance to get back on his feet financially. He is thought to be capable of benefiting from a period of supervision by the NSW Community Corrections equivalent. Clearly, he needs help in relation to anger management as well.

 

42As earlier indicated, the prisoner gave evidence largely concentrating upon his apology to the victim and his expression of regret I have already commented upon. He produced a number of character references. His partner of six years confirmed that he is the sole provider for the family, he is a very hard worker and he had worked very hard to build up his business. He is usually a ""happy, funny, loving person"". He had expressed to her considerable remorse for what he had done and his act of violence was out of character from her experience.

 

43The wife is at her wits end as to what they will do if he is unable to support them. But no doubt the victim's wife was in that same circumstance. He will inevitably miss his daughter's christening later this year which obviously will be a significant event within his family and she asks that her partner be given a second chance. Of course, it might be fairly pointed out that but for medical intervention, the victim may have missed his next birthday completely.

 

44I have referred to the reference of the employee who was given employment by the prisoner when he had difficulty finding employment. He had worked for the prisoner for three years and described him as ""a hundred per cent"" committed to his family and his business. He spoke of the prisoner being affected by his conduct and the consequences of his conduct and that the prisoner was very disappointed in himself for acting so uncharacteristically. Of course, it must be fairly said about regret and remorse that it may be in part, perhaps wholly in some instances, simply a recognition of not the effect upon the victim in reality but the consequences for the perpetrator of his conduct.

 

45This reference and that of the wife of the prisoner highlight the damage done by the prisoner's act of mindless stupidity. When a young man travels to a sporting event with a group of mates to have a good time but drinks too much and is quick to anger, whether slighted or not, and then acts in an impetuous mindless manner, it highlights the adage of ""act in haste regret at your leisure"". When I refer to acting mindlessly, of course there are various categories of such conduct as we see in the courts all the time. There is mindless vicious prolonged acts of violence against others in domestic circumstances or where people are kidnapped and tortured and the like. I am not talking about that type of mindless conduct, I am talking about conduct that is mindless simply because there was this prisoner, with his family, with his business, with everything to live for, and yet, for no good reason, he went and struck a person who is effectively a complete stranger and now has to bear the consequences of it. Obviously when he acted he was not thinking at that moment about what the potential consequences should be.

 

46I have other references from a current football coach who reflects upon his football ability and his potential, demonstrated in the under 20 training squads of the Canberra Raiders and the Canterbury Bulldogs. The football coach talks about him devoting himself to his family and his business and his expressions of regret, the acknowledgement of his inappropriateness of his behaviour and the prisoner had shown a number of positive qualities within his football club, showing leadership for other players and making some contribution to the wider community.

 

47Another person who coached him earlier in his career and who has a construction business in the ACT, and is a Director of that company, spoke at the prisoner's distress and regret and the affect upon him the way he was marginalised by his former club by his conduct given the disgrace that he brought upon himself and the team. He reflected upon the prisoner's success in his business and said that his act of violence was uncharacteristic.

 

48I have had regard to the various submissions that were made by both the learned counsel for the accused and learned counsel for the Crown. Counsel for the prisoner pointed to the prisoner's prior good character, the effect upon him of his conduct. In the context of my consideration of the standard nonparole period which I will turn to shortly, he submitted that the offence was below the middle range of objective seriousness. He noted that the assault was not sustained, that the act was an impulsive act without planning. This clearly is correct. He accepted that the harm was very serious although not the most serious contemplated by the provision. Whilst there were permanent consequences, he submitted there was considerable recovery. I have already summarised the available evidence in relation to that.

 

49He submitted that the assault could not be categorised as a ""vicious"" act or series of acts. On one view of it that may be so, however to the objective bystander minding their own business on the corner of Summer Street and Lords Place at 2.30 in the morning, if they were sober looking on to what was happening, the unprovoked striking of a blow to someone's head without regard to the consequences, in one sense, could be so categorised as vicious.

 

50Whilst there was no evidence of provocation it was submitted that this was a case where there had been an exchange between the offender and the victim and it was not in the same category of offences where the victim was randomly chosen without any prior contact with the perpetrator. It was submitted that apart from not being premeditated there was no intention on the part of the prisoner to cause the harm that was occasioned and this much is true from the pleadings in the charge brought by the Crown. Having an intention to cause the consequences that ultimately happened is not an element to be proven by the prosecution.

 

51He noted that the prisoner did walk away, although he did not run away. It was submitted that I should take into account the fact that he voluntarily went to the police which I do. He submitted the prisoner had expressed remorse and taken responsibility for his conduct. This I accept, but again it is a matter of degree as I have already explained. Even allowing for his relatively contemporaneous posting in his Facebook page, the weight to be given to this aspect of the matter is not as great as would be given to an immediate expression of contrition or some such matter.

 

52It is submitted that the prisoner had a number of very favourable subjective circumstances. This is correct. He is a relatively young man, he has an absence of relevant criminal convictions. He had overcome adversity to complete his apprenticeship and to build up his business. His family life was settled and his family were dependent upon him. He had a prosocial lifestyle as its described in one of the reports and he had an involvement in community activities through his sport and the like. All these matters are correct.

 

53It was also submitted that apart from a mitigating factor that his conduct was uncharacteristic and he had no prior criminal history of significance, which I accept, he had excellent prospects of rehabilitation and he was unlikely to reoffend. I do not have a crystal ball for the future regrettably, although I am expected to have such an implement to assist me in making judgment on various matters, but I am prepared to accept those submissions. It was submitted that his absence from his family by his imprisonment creates for his family, who are entirely innocent in this affair, a burden. But it was conceded the hardship to them was not ""exceptional"" as it has been discussed by many authorities from Courts of superior jurisdiction.

 

54The Crown's submissions were that the offence was certainly within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Whilst it was conceded it was not a sustained attack, there was substantial injury to the victim, potentially fatal consequences alleviated by immediate medical attention with ongoing psychological issues, if not physical issues which I have already summarised.

 

55The Crown said properly that he was entitled to the discount that the superior courts have laid down for the plea of guilty. The Crown did not submit that there were any specific aggravating factors under s 21A(2) of the Act, which I explained to people in the public gallery at the time. The Crown submitted that the remorse expressed by the prisoner was not of the highest level, with which I agree, and reflected upon the fact that the prisoner's offending was serious and the mitigating matters were of diminished weight in this matter. The Crown conceded that a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Act could be made but said that there was no alternative other than fulltime imprisonment, in the context of the requirements of s 5 of the Act, which is obviously correct.

 

56With regard to s 21A(3) mitigating factors, it follows from what I have summarised from the evidence that mitigating factors that arise specifically under that provision. are that the offence was not part of planned or organised criminal activity, the prisoner did not have any significant record of previous convictions or any relevant record for that matter.

 

57I am prepared to accept the prisoner was a person of good character. I accept that he is unlikely to reoffend. I accept that he has good prospects of rehabilitation given what is the overwhelming evidence of his industry and his prosocial lifestyle apart form his conduct on this football trip. I accept that he has shown remorse for the offence by providing evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and acknowledged the injury that he has caused, again I have dealt with that matter. I accept the plea of guilty as a mitigating factor, but for that receives a discreet discount.

 

58With regard to the standard nonparole period, I am required to apply the provisions of Part 4 Division 1A of the Act. That Division was amended late last year to reflect matters that arose for consideration in the High Court judgment of Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120. The new provisions are particularly at s 54A(2) which provides that for the purposes of sentencing an offender to which a standard nonparole period applies, the standard nonparole period represents the nonparole period for an offence in the Table to the Division, taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of the offence in the middle of the range of seriousness. I pause for a moment to point out that in the Court of Criminal decision of Way from 2004, the Chief Justice said in passing that this was not ""necessarily a narrow band"". The extent to which that observation still applies I am not entirely sure.

 

59 Section 54B(2) provides that:

 

""The standard nonparole period for an offence is a matter to be taken into account by a court in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender"".

 

60What the provision means is that whilst the standard nonparole period provides that point of reference, it is not the sole determinant factor, as was held in Muldrock. There may be a number of matters that will effect the fixing of the nonparole period to reduce the appropriate nonparole period including findings of special circumstances and relevant mitigating factors, such as those found under s 21A(3).

 

61I just want to deal with one submission that was put to me by learned counsel for the prisoner. He sought to quote [22] in the judgment of Muldrock in relation to the issue of the assessment of the objective circumstances. What he read from was not the holding of the High Court, it was in fact a summary of what had been earlier found in the decision of R v Way, which in part was set aside by the decision then being handed down. In Way the Court had held that the objective seriousness was not to be narrowly confined, it was to take into account the physical acts of the offender and their consequences together with the circumstances personal to the offender that were causally connected to the commission of the offence.

 

62In one sense even if that it not now the law, given the terms of the legislation and the decision in Muldrock, there is not in this case present any matter personal to the offender such as a mental illness or a mental disability that is causally connected to the commission of the offence. The matter that is causally connected to the commission of the offence in this case as part of the objective facts, is the intoxication of the prisoner which is not a mitigating factor. Be that as it may, in Muldrock, the Court held (at [27]) that to take into account the full range of factors in determining the appropriate sentence, the Court is to be mindful of two legislative guideposts the maximum sentence and the standard nonparole period. The latter requires that content to be given to its specification as:

 

63""The nonparole period for an offence in the middle range of objective seriousness. Meaningful content cannot be given to the concept by taking into account characteristics of the offender. The objective serious of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or a class of offenders. It is to be determined solely by reference to the nature of the offender"".

 

64The legislative changes make that clear.  But in the context of general sentencing principle, once the objective seriousness of an offence is determined, a court must work to assess the effect that matters in mitigation has upon that. It can be fairly said that even though Way was set aside by the High Court in Muldrock, what the Chief Justice said in Way about there being, on the view of that Court, no intention by the legislature by inserting standard nonparole periods to ""convert sentencing to a precise mathematical exercise"", s still correct. The Chief Justice in Way said that the provision that reflected the continuation of a ""wide area of discretion, without resort to some rigid mechanistic or arithmetic approach of the kind which would be totally unsuited to the difficult task of sentencing"".

 

65We do not have a code of Hammurabi in New South Wales. The code of Hammurabi would require if someone chopped off someone's arm that they or their son would have his arm chopped off. Such a brutal means of inflicting punishment of course may not reflect the extent to which the culpability of the offender was reflected in the facts relevant to the relevant incident.

 

66In this particular matter I have concluded by reference to the objective facts that the offence is within the middle range of objective seriousness. I do not believe I am required to comment upon the extent of the band or where within that band the offence arises. In summary, it was an unprovoked single blow which caused initially life threatening injuries that have left long term psychological injury existing up until the present time with intervening substantial hospitalisation, treatment and recovery no doubt causing great pain to the victim and with the resultant loss of income and obvious substantial disruption to the victim's life. It is not to be fairly said, in the worse category of offence, obviously having regard to the matters I have identified and were identified in submissions.

 

67That having been said, I determine that there are mitigating factors personal to the prisoner and they have been identified. I also determine that there are special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Act. The 'special circumstances' require an adjustment of the relationship of the nonparole period to the balance of sentence. The prisoner is going to need professional assistance to adjust to community living. He is going to need, I believe, some professional guidance in relation to his control of alcohol when he does, if it be true on the rare occasions, binge drink. He is certainly going to need a lot of assistance not just by the Probation and Parole officer but by others to get himself back on his feet financially.

 

68I am mindful of the fact that in sending someone to gaol, which is not a step quickly taken nor should it be, the fact of the imprisonment itself whatever its length, will impose that element of punishment on this prisoner that might not otherwise be inflicted on other prisoners without employment, without businesses, without families to support or showing no responsibility for their community. It cannot be said that the prisoner has generally shown no responsibility for his community.

 

69Yes, thank you Mr McLean, could you stand up please sir? In relation to the offence for which you have been found guilty by your plea, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of nonparole period of one year and six months which will date from today.

 

70There are no other presentence custody periods are there Madam Crown?

 

71HENNESSY: No your Honour.

 

72HIS HONOUR: One year, six months from today, today being 3 April. That will mean the nonparole period will expire on 2 October 2015. I direct that you be released to parole at the expiry of your nonparole period. The balance of sentence will be eighteen months imprisonment. The balance of sentence will expire on 2 April 2017. Just take a seat thanks very much. Take a seat thank you.

 

73I do not propose to fix any conditions for parole. The Parole Authority will have access to my remarks on sentence and I will leave that to the Parole Authority to make the appropriate decisions on assessment of the situation in eighteen months time.

 

74Madam Crown are there any other technical matters from you?

 

75HENNESSY: No your Honour.

 

76HIS HONOUR: Right thank you. Any other matters from you sir, I know you're in a difficult position because you are the agent.

 

77BONCARDO: Thank you your Honour, nothing further.

 

78HIS HONOUR: Right thank you. Yes thank you Mr McLean you can go, the officers will take you. Thank you.

		15 October 2015",2014-04-02 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705282,Newton v R [2014] NSWCCA 41,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Adamson J.

2ADAMSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence passed by Judge Arnott in the District Court on 16 May 2013 of 3 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months following his plea of guilty to break and enter a dwelling house and commit a serious indictable offence (stealing) in contravention of s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). A 25% discount was allowed for the plea of guilty. The offence carried a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.

Facts

3The agreed facts were summarised on the remarks on sentence.

4On 7 am on Thursday 25 October 2012, the applicant went to a home in Narellan which was occupied by an acquaintance. He opened a glass sliding door to a granny flat at the rear of the home. He stole an iPod, mobile phone and $50 cash. He also stole an unregistered trail bike which he rode from the premises. Later that morning, the victim discovered that the property was missing from the granny flat and confronted the applicant. The applicant denied stealing the property. The victim made enquiries with his mobile phone carrier and ascertained that the applicant had used the victim's phone to call his mother. When the victim phoned the applicant, the applicant told him where the stolen property was. The stolen property, apart from the mobile phone, was recovered.

5Fingerprints, subsequently found to be the applicant's, were located at the victim's residence. The applicant was arrested four days later and interviewed. He denied the offence. He sought to explain the presence of his fingerprints by saying that the victim had showed him motorbikes on 24 October 2012.

Sentences passed for prior and related offending 

Prior offending

6On 24 October 2012, the day before the commission of the subject offence, the applicant came before the Campbelltown Local Court for nine separate offences, including:

(1)Drive whilst disqualified (2 counts);

(2)Goods in custody suspected of being stolen (2 counts);

(3)Custody of knife in a public place;

(4)Police pursuit- not stop- drive at speed;

(5)Take and drive conveyance without consent of the owner;

(6)Obtain property by deception.

7The Magistrate made Intensive Correction Orders (ICOs) in respect of the applicant for a total period of 15 months commencing on 24 October 2012 and concluding on 23 January 2014 and added a further two years to the then current period of disqualification from driving. 

8On 5 December 2012, the ICOs were revoked and custodial sentences imposed in their place for the nine separate offences (the ICO offences). The sentences were expressed to commence on 29 October 2012.

Related offending

9In addition to the subject offence, the applicant committed two other offences on 25 October 2012, for which he was sentenced on different occasions. He committed the offence of driving the trail bike while disqualified (the DWD offence) for which he was sentenced on 18 February 2013 by the Local Court to a term of imprisonment of one year, commencing on 25 October 2012, with a non-parole period of 9 months. He also committed the offence of illegal use of conveyance (bike) which was the trail bike he stole from the premises. He was sentenced in the Local Court on 21 May 2013 to a term of imprisonment of nine months that commenced on 21 May 2013 and was wholly concurrent with other custodial sentences. This offence is mentioned for completeness but need not be referred to again since the sentence was imposed five days after the sentence the subject of this application was imposed.

The sentence hearing

10At the sentence hearing for the subject offence the Crown tendered, without objection, a bundle of documents that included committal documents, a statement of facts, the applicant's criminal history and reports of his time in custody.

11The applicant tendered a psychological assessment report from Daniel Hopkins, a clinical psychologist.

12The applicant gave evidence at the sentence hearing. He verified the history he had given to Ms Hopkins in which he had sought to justify his offending by saying that the victim had propositioned a woman with whom the applicant had previously enjoyed a casual intimacy. According to the applicant, the woman asked him to steal the victim's motorbike in order to fund her supply of drugs. Ms Hopkins recorded:
""Mr Newton noted that he made an impulsive decision to comply with her request, as motivated by his anger and annoyance at this individual's behaviour towards his casual partner.""

The remarks on sentence

13The sentencing judge found the seriousness of the offence to be at the lower end of the spectrum of offences of this type. Few items of limited value were stolen. There was no damage to property. There was negligible planning. All the property, but for the mobile phone, was recovered, with some assistance from the applicant, who was unable to recover the mobile phone.

14His Honour noted that the applicant was nearly 42 years old and had been in custody for most of the past 23 years. His criminal record dated back to the Children's Court in 1985. Most of the offences involved breaking and entering.

15The sentencing judge recorded that the applicant is an only child, who has never known his biological father. His mother had a problem with alcohol which led to him being brought up by his grandmother. He truanted from school and left school altogether in Year 9. Since he was about 11, he has had longstanding difficulties with drugs. 

16His Honour, in his remarks on sentence, referred to Ms Hopkins' opinion in the following terms:
She also points out that it is clear that he has difficulty, not only with regulating his emotions but with chronic substance abuse and community adjustment problems. He needs intervention to assist him with these aspects. She also considers that the present offence suggests a level of impulsivity and a disregard for returning to the custodial environment. She notes, and he said in evidence quite frankly, that he finds custody provides a regulated life for him in which he is well maintained and responds to the boundaries and routine, which is not to be found in the community. Ms Hopkins expresses concern that if he is released and not adequately supported that his recidivism will increase.

17The sentencing judge considered the applicant to be remorseful. His Honour considered the applicant to have poor prospects of rehabilitation. 

18In the remarks on sentence, his Honour referred to the sentence imposed for the ICO offences and noted the parole review date of 12 June 2013. His Honour also noted that the applicant could not be released from custody in any event until 24 July 2013, the expiry date of the non-parole period for the DWD offence. Because of its significance to the application, I propose to set out the following extract from the remarks:
Mr Townsend [counsel for the applicant at the sentence hearing] suggested that the sentence for the present offence could be commenced from that day [24 July 2013] and, if that will occur, it would incorporate a punishment period from 5 December 2012 to 24 July 2013 in respect of those nine separate offences which were the subject of the ICOs. I am attracted by that submission, having regard to a number of factors. Firstly, the period of time he has spent in custody continuously, that I have already referred to, for the past many years and recognising that the severity of the sentence increases as the sentence is lengthened at a greater rate than the overall length of the sentence (Clinch v R (1994) 72 A Crim R 301 at 306 per Malcolm CJ). Secondly, the appropriate sentence that would have been imposed had I been sentencing him for the nine separate offences and the present offences at the same time, in other words, the principle of totality. 

It was submitted by Mr Townsend, referring to the well known judgment of King CJ in the Queen v Osenkowski (1982) 30 SASR 212 at 212-213, that despite the seriousness of the offence and his past record of offending, that this was an occasion for the extension of mercy. I, quite frankly, think that in view of the fact that his offence occurred the day after the imposition of the intensive correction orders means that he really had that sort of chance for mercy at that time and he has foregone that opportunity.

The application for leave to appeal

19The applicant seeks leave on the following grounds:

(1)The sentencing judge erred in failing to have proper regard to the totality principle in his accumulation of sentences.

(2)The sentence is manifestly excessive.

Ground 1: accumulation of sentences

Parties' submissions

20Mr Smith, on behalf of the applicant, submitted that the sentencing judge misapprehended the submission put on his behalf as to the appropriate commencement date of the sentence and that his Honour failed to appreciate that the DWD offence was part of the same overall criminality. He contended that, on those two bases, the sentencing judge erred in wholly accumulating the sentences for the two offences when some degree of concurrence was called for.

21In support of his contention that the sentencing judge had, in wholly accumulating the sentence for the DWD offence with the subject offence, Mr Smith relied on the following passage which is taken from the extract from the remarks on sentence reproduced above:
Mr Townsend suggested that the sentence for the present offence could be commenced from that day [24 July 2013] and, if that will occur, it would incorporate a punishment period from 5 December 2012 to 24 July 2013 in respect of those nine separate offences which were the subject of the ICOs. I am attracted by that submission, having regard to a number of factors. 

22He submitted that this part of the remarks revealed the following three errors:

(1)The period of punishment for the sentence imposed for the ICO offences commenced on 29 October 2012, and not 5 December 2012, which was the date on which sentence was passed.

(2)The failure to mention that the vehicle on which the applicant drove while disqualified was in fact the vehicle he had stolen as part of the present offences showed that his Honour did not appreciate the connection between the offences.

(3)The applicant did not in fact submit that the sentence for the present offences should commence on 24 July 2013.

23The applicant submitted, in respect of (3), that his Honour intended to accept the applicant's counsel's submission, but in fact accepted a submission which the applicant's counsel had not actually made and was therefore in error. Mr Smith emphasised the following sentence from the remarks, which immediately followed the one extracted above:
I am attracted by that submission, having regard to a number of factors. 

24The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge was aware of the connection between the DWD and the subject offence, as shown by his Honour's narrative of facts. The Crown contended that it was an appropriate exercise of the sentencing discretion for the sentence for the subject offence to begin following the expiry of the non-parole period for the DWD offence. The Crown submitted that the criminality of each was distinct, separate punishment was warranted and that it was open to the sentencing judge to accumulate the respective sentences.

25The Crown submitted that the reasons of the sentencing judge which were delivered orally on the same day as the hearing, ought not be parsed and analysed as if the judgment had been reserved.

Reasons 

26The relevant principles are well established. There is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought be dealt with concurrently or consecutively. The principle of totality is an overriding principle by reference to which sentences are to be measured. It requires the sentencing judge to consider the total criminality involved not only in the offences for which the offender is being sentenced but also in any offences for which the offender has already been sentenced: Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 308 (McHugh J).

27Where a sentencing judge imposes a sentence on an offender who has already been sentenced by another judge, the second judge must regard the first sentence as an appropriate exercise of the first judge's discretion and not seek to reduce or increase it by the sentences the second judge imposes: R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159 at [99] (Spigelman CJ, Whealy and Howie JJ).

28The effect of these principles is that the substantial question for this Court is whether the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive to reflect the respondent's criminal conduct, in light of the other offences for which he was sentenced by the Local Court and the sentences imposed for that offending.

29However, because the applicant has sought leave to appeal on two grounds, the first of which raises additional issues, the question whether the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive will be dealt with separately when the second ground is addressed.

30In order to assess the first ground it is important to have regard to the totality of sentences imposed and the totality of offending. These are set out in the following table:




31The documents tendered by the Crown at the sentence hearing showed that the applicant was released from Parklea prison on 24 October 2012. On 29 October 2012 he was arrested for the subject offence, the DWD offence and an additional offence of take and use conveyance, all of which were committed on 25 October 2012. He was admitted to Metropolitan Remand A on 1 November 2012. On 5 December 2012 the sentence imposed by the Local Court for the ICO offences was expressed to commence on 29 October 2012. 

32If, as contended by the applicant in (1) above, his Honour made an error in the passage set out above as to the commencement date of the ICO sentence, it amounted to a period in the order of six weeks. However, as the table set out above shows, the applicant would have been in custody anyway for that period of the sentence passed for the DWD offence, since the sentences for the ICO and DWD offences were, except for four days, wholly concurrent. Therefore any error does not appear to have had any material effect on the length of the applicant's custody. 

33As to the error contended for in (2) above, I am not persuaded that his Honour failed to appreciate that the bike the subject of the DWD offence was one of the items stolen from the premises that were broken into. Although when referring to the sentence imposed for the DWD offence, his Honour did not specifically mention that this had occurred with the trail bike that had just been stolen, his Honour had already noted, in the summary of facts narrated at the commencement of the remarks on sentence:
""He also stole an unregistered trail bike which he rode from the premises.""

34There was no particular reason for his Honour to repeat that observation when considering whether there ought be any accumulation between the DWD offence and the subject offence and, if so, whether it ought be partial or total. 

35I accept the Crown's submission that the criminality is separate. Had the applicant been licensed to ride the trail bike, then, whether it was stolen or not, he would not have committed the DWD offence. If he had not stolen the trail bike, but driven it while unlicensed, he would have committed the DWD but not the subject offence in respect of it. In these circumstance it cannot be inferred from the accumulation of the two offences that there was any misapprehension by the sentencing judge as to the connection between them.

36Whether the error contended for in (3) above amounts to an error is to be determined by reference to his Honour's reasons in light of the transcript of the sentence hearing. I do not accept the applicant's submission that his Honour mistakenly attributed the substance of the whole of this sentence to Mr Townsend:
Mr Townsend suggested that the sentence for the present offence could be commenced from that day [24 July 2013] and, if that will occur, it would incorporate a punishment period from 5 December 2012 to 24 July 2013 in respect of those nine separate offences which were the subject of the ICOs. 


37Mr Townsend's primary submission, as the remarks on sentence show, was that there should be a, to use his words in oral submission, ""generous backdate"" on the basis that the applicant was ""at the crossroads"". His Honour rejected the submission and found that the applicant had, by committing the subject offence the date after the imposition of the ICOs, foregone any opportunity for mercy.

38The submission to which his Honour was attracted was made in the course of an exchange between bench and bar about the effect of the parole review date of 12 June 2013 on the sentences for the ICO offences, which expired on 23 January 2014. This exchange occurred in the Crown's submissions after Mr Townsend had concluded his submissions. Mr Townsend's submission at that point was:

TOWNSEND: I'm not suggesting that's what your Honour would [do] not but I'm just saying that would be an effect of it and one of the things I could invite your Honour to consider is that the - the sentence imposed by the Local Court on 18 February 2013 for the driving whilst disqualified of the motorbike that was stolen in these matters, that sentence expires or the non parole period expires on 24 July 2013. Your Honour could consider - could consider that as a date upon which your Honour could commence these sentences or a date before then, I would respectfully submit. But that could be a key date and not really worry too much about 23 January 2014 because ultimately whatever your Honour does, the parole authority could release him on that date or before depending on what happens at their parole review on 12 June and no doubt if they refuse to, they might set a non parole period then or they might not, they might put another review date in you know, in another three months or something, I don't know.

39In my view, a fair, and correct, reading of the passage from the remarks on sentence in light of what occurred at the hearing is that Mr Townsend submitted that a starting point for the commencement of the sentence for the subject offence could (but not that it should) be 24 July 2013. Only the first part of the sentence that precedes the word ""and"" relates to Mr Townsend's submission. The second part of the sentence records the sentencing judge's calculation of the effect of commencing the sentence on that date. This date, 24 July 2013, was the latest date on which the sentence for the subject offence could have been commenced so as to avoid a potential gap in incarceration in the event that the applicant were released to parole either for the ICO offences or the DWD offence. A commencement date of 24 July 2013 effectively shortened the sentences for the ICO and DWD offences because of the concurrence after that date. A commencement date of 24 July 2013 was more advantageous for the offender than 24 January 2014, which was the date on which the sentences for the ICO offences expired.

40In my view, his Honour meant, by the use of the word ""attracted"", that he considered it to be appropriate to commence the sentence for the subject offence before the expiry of the ICO and DWD offences, although not before the expiry of the non-parole period for the DWD offence or the parole review date for the ICO offences. In other words, his Honour was persuaded by Mr Townsend that the commencement date ought be 24 July 2013 and not 24 January 2014. His Honour did not, in my view, mean that he accepted Mr Townsend's primary submission, or that he understood it to be such, rather than an acceptance by Mr Townsend of what was open in terms of sentencing options as the passage from the transcript set out above shows. 

41As any judge who is required to give oral judgments immediately, or shortly, after a substantive hearing knows, it is not easy when delivering reasons orally to select the most apposite words or to construct sentences which not only reveal one's reasoning in a lucid way but which also withstand rigorous syntactic analysis. In such circumstances, one has neither the luxury of time for contemplation nor the chance to improve a draft by changing a word, revising the structure of a sentence or re-ordering sentences or paragraphs. Yet the timely administration of justice in New South Wales depends on judges delivering oral judgments on the same day as hearing evidence and submissions, as the sentencing judge did here. Although the parties are entitled to reasons for decision, they are not entitled to have those reasons judged by standards of expression that could not reasonably be attained by any but the exceptionally eloquent. The principle of interpretation that applies to legislation, contracts, wills and other documents, that they should be read as a whole, also applies to judgments, including remarks on sentence.

42In my view, the remarks of the sentencing judge, fairly read as a whole, were sufficient to demonstrate that the criticisms made of them were, with the exception of the 6-week period ((1) above), not soundly based.

43For completeness I add that, had it not been for the sentence imposed for the ICO offences, it may be that the sentencing judge would not have accumulated the DWD and the subject offence, in the way that his Honour did or that Mr Townsend would not have referred to 24 July 2013 as a possible commencement date. However, in my view, the remarks on sentence show that his Honour appreciated the importance of not derogating from the sentences that had already been imposed for the ICO offences and, to a lesser extent, the DWD offence (since it was at least related to the subject offence). 

44In my view, the first ground has not been made out.

Ground 2: manifest excess

Parties' submissions

45Mr Smith submitted that the subject offence was relatively minor and did not, on any proper view, warrant a sentence of four years, which was the notional sentence before the discount of 25% for the plea of guilty was applied. He referred to the lack of damage to property, the relatively inconsequential value of the items taken and the circumstance that all but the mobile phone had been restored to the victim. He also relied on the assistance given by the applicant in the recovery of the items.

46The Crown submitted that the seriousness of the offence of break enter and steal was to be adjudged by reference to the maximum penalty of 14 years. The sentencing judge's assessment that the subject offence was at the lower end of the range was consistent with the starting point of four years. The Crown also contended that the finding of special circumstances and the concomitant adjustment of the ratio of the non-parole period to the total sentence were beneficial for the applicant since his custodial term was accordingly reduced.

Reasons

47Questions of accumulation, concurrence and totality have been considered above. They are also relevant, and ought be read as applicable, to the second ground.

48No challenge was made to the sentencing judge's assessment that the subject offence fell within the lower end of the range. However, that finding does not mean that the subject offence was itself trivial or undeserving of the sentence imposed. The maximum penalty is a relevant consideration and indicates the seriousness with which Parliament views such offences: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27].

49The seriousness of the offence of break enter and steal was explained by this Court in R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740 at 742 per Street CJ (Lee and Hunt JJ agreeing) in the following terms:
Householders cannot leave their homes in confidence that the contents will be safe. The trauma of re-entering a home that has been ransacked is in itself no light matter. This can cause a continuing uneasiness and disquiet at the knowledge that an
unknown person has invaded the sanctity of the home. Added to this is the emotional distress at the loss of property, including treasured items that frequently have a sentimental value far in excess of their intrinsic worth. Even those who are not immediate victims of burglary nevertheless feel its effect in the escalating premiums charged by the insurance industry for insuring against the risk of its occurrence.
The invasion of people's homes and the plundering of their property is a social evil from which the community looks for protection to the law enforcement agencies and the criminal courts.

50In the present case, a mobile phone was also taken from the granny flat and not recovered. Such devices commonly contain personal information and contact details of family, friends and associates. Their theft involves an invasion of privacy. The personal value and importance of such items to their owners is almost invariably substantially greater than their resale value.

51The subject offence was committed when the applicant was on conditional liberty. His almost instantaneous recidivism, following the grant of the ICOs less than 24 hours before the commission of the subject offence, disclosed a disregard for the law which might be explained, but not excused, by his difficulties with drugs. He had a very lengthy criminal record of similar offences. These matters, as the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides, are aggravating factors: s 21A(2) (d) (record of convictions for similar offences); and s 21A(2)(j) (subject offence committed while applicant was on conditional liberty).

52Furthermore, the sentencing judge adjusted the ratio of the non-parole period to the total sentence from the statutory ratio of 75% (s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) to 50%, thereby reducing the time in custody and increasing the time subject to supervision in the community on parole.

53The starting point for the sentence, four years, might be regarded as at the higher end of the range appropriate for an offence such as the subject one. However, in the circumstances, the sentence was not excessive. 

54The length of the sentence passed for the subject offence and the way in which it was structured does not, in my view, reveal any error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion, either in the process or in the result. Rather, it shows, in my view, that the sentencing judge was appropriately concerned to make provision for a relatively lengthy period of post-release supervision on parole to give the applicant some, and perhaps the best, prospect of overcoming the problems with drug addiction that have, throughout his adult life, given rise to his apparently intractable recidivism.

55Accordingly, in my view, ground two has not been made out.

Proposed orders

56I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal dismissed.

57BELLEW J: I agree with the orders proposed by Adamson J, for the reasons which her Honour has given.

		03 April 2014",2014-04-01 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705284,State of New South Wales v Wilde [2014] NSWSC 305,"Judgment

Overview

1The State of New South Wales (""the State"") applies for a ""High Risk Sex Offender Extended Supervision Order"" (""ESO"") in respect of the defendant pursuant to the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (""the Act"").

2Proceedings were instituted pursuant to a summons filed by the plaintiff on 13 December 2013. The State's application proceeds upon the basis that the defendant is a high risk sex offender.

3The order sought in the summons seeks:

(i) An Extended Supervision Order for a term of five years.

(ii) That the order incorporate 65 conditions as set out in the document marked MFI 1.

4The defendant opposes the relief sought by the State. He contends:

(i) That no Extended Supervision Order should be made.

(ii) Alternatively that none of the conditions sought by the State should be imposed as they are unjustifiably onerous on the defendant's liberty.

The Statutory Jurisdiction 

5In the submissions on behalf of the defendant it was accepted that there is no jurisdictional issue in relation to the application brought by the State. In that respect it was properly conceded that the defendant is a ""supervised sex offender"" as defined in s 51(2) of the Act.

6The making of an ESO requires the resolution of two conflicting interests or considerations. There is on the one hand, the issue of the safety of the community, which is a primary object of the Act: s 3(1). On the other, there is the liberty of an offender following the period of his sentence. In particular, in this respect, the limitations upon the liberty of a defendant resulting from the operation of an ESO and the conditions which such an order imposes is a significant consideration. Plainly, in determining how these often conflicting interests are to be resolved, there is a need for the determination by the Court as to whether an application under s 5H of the Act for an ESO is supported by cogent evidence on the matters required to be considered by the provisions of the Act.

7The determination by the Court as to whether an ESO ought be made in a particular case involves an assessment by the Court on the evidence of a future possibility, namely, of a risk of a particular kind or kinds of offending and a determination as to whether such risk is ""unacceptable"" within the meaning of s 5B(2) of the Act. An application under the Act requires consideration of the factual matters set out in s 9(3) in addition to ""any other matter it considers relevant"": s 9(3).

8Section 5B of the Act provides: 

5B High Risk Sex Offender

(1) An offender can be made the subject of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order or a high risk sex offender continuing detention order as provided for by this Act if and only if the offender is a high risk sex offender.

(2) An offender is a high risk sex offender if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

(3) The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence. (my emphasis)

9The Act requires that an application must be supported by relevant documentation: s 6(3)(a) and (b). Those provisions are in the following terms:

""(3) An application must be supported by documentation:

(a) that addresses each of the matters referred to in section 9 (3), and

(b) that includes a report (prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner) that assesses the likelihood of the offender committing:

(i) a further serious sex offence (in the case of an application for a high risk sex offender extended supervision order), or

(ii) a further serious violence offence (in the case of an application for a high risk violent offender extended supervision order).

(4) An application may indicate the kinds of conditions that are considered to be appropriate for inclusion under section 11 in the event that an extended supervision order is made.

10Section 11 provides that an ESO may direct an offender to comply with conditions ""as the Supreme Court considers appropriate, including, (but not limited to) requiring the offender to:

(a) to permit any corrective services officer to visit the offender at the offender's residential address at any time and, for that purpose, to enter the premises at that address, or

(a1) to permit any corrective services officer to access any computer or related equipment that is at the offender's residential address or in the possession of the offender, or

(b) to make periodic reports to a corrective services officer, or

(c) to notify a corrective services officer of any change in his or her address, or

(d) to participate in treatment and rehabilitation programs, or

(e) to wear electronic monitoring equipment, or

(ea) to reside at an address approved by the Commissioner of Corrective Services, or

(f) not to reside in or resort to specified locations or classes of locations, or

(g) not to associate or make contact with specified persons or classes of persons, or

(h) not to engage in specified conduct or classes of conduct, or

(i) not to engage in specified employment or classes of employment, or

(j) not to change his or her name.""

11Given the significance of the matters that may be the subject of conditions imposed under s 11 of the Act, it is, as submitted on behalf of the defendant, necessary for a Court determining an application to give effect to the phrase ""considers appropriate"" in s 11 in considering the ""directions"" to be made pursuant to the conditions of the ESO. I acknowledge the validity of the submission made on behalf of the defendant in these proceedings that although the discretion of the Court acting under s 11 is a broad one, it must be exercised in conformity with the legislative purpose of the Act: Defendant's Written Submissions at [12].

12It was there noted that in State of New South Wales v Green (Final) [2013] NSWSC 1003, RA Hulme J at [36]-[38] accepted the following propositions concerning the imposition of conditions:

(i) Any conditions attaching to an order ought to specifically address issues relevant to currently identified risk factors in relation to future offending;

(ii) Conditions should be limited to addressing conduct regarding the risk of future serious sex offences as opposed to criminal offences generally; and

(iii) Given the dual objectives of the Act, the conditions ought not to be unjustifiably onerous or simply punitive.

13In addition, attention was drawn in the written submissions for the defendant to the observations made in State of New South Wales v Fisk [2013] NSWSC 364 at [96]-[99] by his Honour Beech-Jones J in relation to the exercise of the discretion under s 11 in the following terms:

""96 In determining whether it is appropriate to include a particular condition, it is necessary to bear in mind that the effect of their inclusion is to expose the offender to criminal sanctions if they are breached. Thus, a proper basis needs to be demonstrated for including the condition in the first place (see State of New South Wales v Ali [2010] NSWSC 1045 at [88] per Johnson J) ...

...

99 The imposition of ""appropriate"" conditions under s 11 is governed by the overriding purpose of mitigating the identified risk of the high-risk sex offender committing either serious sex offences, or at least offences of a sexual nature. Although it has already been adverted to, this requires consideration to be given to the relevant offences that Mr Fisk may be at risk of committing""

14I accept the following submission made on behalf of the defendant:

""Accordingly, the Court must be satisfied as to the appropriateness of any given condition in the context of mitigating the defendant's demonstrated risk of committing future serious sex offences, as opposed to simply being punitive.""

Background 

(a) Offending and custodial history

15The defendant has been convicted of sexual offences occurring in 1981, 1983 and 1991. These offences have all involved the defendant forcing women to submit to sexual intercourse at knifepoint. 

16The defendant was arrested and charged on 26 March 1981 in relation to the first of what is a series of sexual offences, and that offence occurred on 23 March 1980. At the time of arrest the defendant was 19 years old and subject to a four-year good behaviour bond for break, enter and steal.

17In respect of that first offence, the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of rape and one count of common assault. He was sentenced by Nagle J on 18 November 1981 to five years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years. 

18As a result of escaping from custody whilst in prison, the defendant was not released on parole until 22 June 1983. 

19In the months following his release the defendant was acquitted of a charge relating to indecent assault and breaking, entering and stealing. The defendant was, however, found guilty of an offence relating to larceny of a motor vehicle. 

20On 2 October 1983, that is, only four months after his release, the defendant was charged in relation to incidents relating to two different females alleged to have occurred in September 1983. The defendant was found guilty of the charges relating to the second female, which included threatening to inflict actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse. 

21In relation to this offence and an additional charge of motor vehicle theft, Mathews DCJ (as her Honour then was) sentenced the defendant to a period of 10 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 6 years. 

22Mathews DCJ referred to the circumstances of the offence as being ""appalling to say the least"", and considered the treatment of the victim to be ""with the greatest of degradation and depravity"". 

23The defendant unsuccessfully appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal.

24He was released on parole on 24 October 1991. 

25On 7 November 1991 the defendant was charged with offences relating to break and enter, aggravated indecent assault, and malicious wounding. 

26Ducker DCJ found the offences to be ""premeditated, and utterly despicable"", and considered that the defendant ""took advantage of a lone woman in what should have been the safety of her own home to inflict upon her the most degrading humiliating physically painful and distressing non-consensual acts"". His Honour also remarked upon the defendant not showing the slightest sign of remorse or contrition, and of his attitude throughout being one of ""truculent self-concern"" and ""total indifference to the suffering of his victim"". 

27In addition, Ducker DCJ remarked that the defendant ""exudes a sense of latent, only barely concealed violence, which does not bode well for his future, nor that of the community when he is released"", and further, that:

""the present offences were premeditated, cold blooded, humiliating, and terrifying to the victim. And the prisoner emerged, by his commission of these acts, as a dangerous sexual predator who, so long as he was at large within the community, represented a considerable threat to women"" 

28Ducker DCJ further observed:

""The use of knives to intimidate; the apparent need to degrade and humiliate the victims; the choice of victims of lone women in their own homes; the tying up of their hands; the subjecting of his victims to bizarre behaviour (one woman being required to 'bark like a dog' and another being required 'to groan and pretend that she enjoyed it'); the cuts inflicted on the victims; and the resort to bizarre attempts to excuse his conduct by using a similar story, in order to try, perhaps to persuade the victim not to complain, or to otherwise assuage the indignation and desire for retribution of the victim"".

29The defendant was found guilty of these offences, and was sentenced by Ducker DCJ on 11 June 1993 to a period of 16 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 12 years. During sentencing, Ducker DCJ commented that, ""there would need to be an extraordinary change...before he would represent other than a considerable risk if released into the community"".

30The defendant was released from custody on 12 September 2008. 

31Since this time the defendant has not been charged with any offences. The defendant has, however, since then been subject to various detention and supervision orders, which are detailed below. 

32The defendant is presently 52 years of age. Since the age of 19, the defendant has effectively been in the community for a period of only three years. 

(b) Detention and supervision orders

33Following the defendant's release on 12 September 2008 a number of applications were made by the State for continuing detention under the Act. A number of interim orders were made on 1 November 2007, 30 November 2007, 20 December 2007, and 17 January 2008. 

34These culminated in a Continuing Detention Order for a period of eight months being made by this Court (Price J) on 24 January 2008: Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Wilde [2008] NSWSC 14. In his sentencing remarks, his Honour stated that he was satisfied to a high degree of probability that the defendant would be likely to commit a further serious sex offence if not kept under supervision, and further, that adequate supervision could not be provided under an extended supervision order.

35On 16 September 2008, this Court (McClellan CJ at CL) ordered that the defendant be further detained on an interim basis for a period of 28 days from 22 September 2008: State of New South Wales v Wilde [2008] NSWSC 1148.

36On 12 December 2008, Kirby J ordered that the defendant be subject to an ESO for a period of three years. The specific conditions attached to this ESO are included as a schedule to his Honour's judgment: State of NSW v Wilde [2008] NSWSC 1211. 

37This ESO was due to expire on 11 December 2011, however due to a series of breaches of the conditions by the defendant (to be outlined below), the ESO effectively expired on 10 January 2014.

38On 8 January 2008 her Honour Fullerton J ordered an interim supervision order, commencing on 10 January 2014. 

39This order was subsequently renewed by her Honour on 4 February 2014, and subsequently renewed by Hidden J on 3 March 2014.

40The present interim supervision order is due to expire at midnight on 2 April 2014. 

(c) Compliance with detention and supervision orders

41Mr Patrick Sheehan, in a Risk Assessment Report prepared for Corrective Services on 14 November 2013, details extensively the extent to which the defendant has complied with and/or breached various conditions of the ESO. I do not propose to address all of these in this judgment, particularly having regard to constraints as to time for the making of orders in the present application and for delivery of this judgment. 

42However I note, in particular, the following breaches:

(1)On 18 March 2009 the defendant was allegedly in possession of a knife while residing at the Nunyara Community Offender Support Program (""COSP"") inside Long Bay Complex. The defendant argued that he was in possession of the knife in order to cut fruit and meat. 

(2)On 16 October 2009 the defendant verbally abused and used threatening language to staff at the COSP, in breach of a condition of the ESO. The defendant was subsequently sentenced to a period of six months imprisonment. 

(3)On 1 May 2010 the defendant was convicted of failing to comply with a condition of the ESO by attempting to contact a WIRES staff member via Facebook, and sentenced to a period of nine months imprisonment. 

(4)On 15 November 2011 the defendant attended the private residence of a female and allegedly requested to be allowed into the house. This was considered to be a deviation from his weekly schedule, and the defendant was subsequently arrested. The defendant entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced to a period of imprisonment for a period of 12 months with a non-parole period of nine months. 

43In the defendant's written submissions a number of explanatory or mitigating factors were relied upon as follows:

(1)There is no suggestion the defendant has been violent on any occasion since being placed on an ESO.

(2)Many of the breaches were ""technical"" in nature.

(3)When examined in their proper context the breaches do not necessarily point towards a risk of the defendant committing serious sex offences. 

(4)In respect of the first breach, there is no suggestion it was anything more than mere possession of a knife.

(5)In respect of the second breach, it is open to infer that such threats were manifestations of angry bluster.

(6)In respect of the third breach, there is nothing in the facts to suggest the Facebook friend request was attended by threats or harassment. 

(7)In respect of the fourth breach, the defendant submits this was a technical breach, and that it appears the Magistrate accepted it was not attended by any sinister intent and did not possess a criminal quality. 

Psychiatric Examinations

44On 8 January 2014 her Honour Fullerton J ordered that Professor David Greenberg and Dr Anthony Samuels be appointed to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the defendant and furnish reports on the results of those examinations, pursuant to s 7(4) of the Act. Her Honour also ordered that the defendant attend the said psychiatric appointments. 

45The Court must have regard to these reports, and the offender's level of participation in any such examination, in determining whether or not to make an ESO: s 9(3)(b).

(a) Report of Professor David Greenberg

46Professor Greenberg provided a report dated 2 March 2014, which has been marked as Exhibit ""B"" in the proceedings. 

47This report follows Professor Greenberg's examinations of the defendant on 5 and 14 February 2014, in which Professor Greenberg observed the defendant to be ""cooperative and polite"". However, it was also noted that:

""With regard to his second and third convictions, he maintained that he was innocent and refused to discuss aspects of these offences. He also refused to participate in any discussion into his insights into his sexual offending behaviour. He refused to discuss aspects of his family, sexual and some details of his personal history"": Ex B at pp 14-15.

48Professor Greenberg expressed the opinion that the defendant does not have any evidence of any major psychiatric illness such as a psychotic disorder, major mood disorder, or anxiety disorder. Further, that he was unable to diagnose the defendant with sexually deviant (paraphilic) disorder due to the defendant's unwillingness to discuss his prior convictions: Ex B at p 15.

49Professor Greenberg, however, was able to reach a primary diagnosis of ""severe entrenched Chronic Personality Disorder with antisocial and narcissistic features"" at the ""upper range of severity"". This disorder, he said, is ""chronic, stable and difficult to change"": Ex B at p 25. Persons with such a disorder, Professor Greenberg observes, have:

""...inflexible patterns of behaviour and have difficulty acknowledging their problems arise within their own personality. They often view the world and everything external to themselves as the cause of their problems rather than owning that the root of their problems lies within themselves"": Ex B at p 15.

50With regard to whether the defendant poses a risk of committing further serious sex offences, Professor Greenberg noted that the defendant scored an ""8"" on the STATIC 99-R assessment scale, which falls within the ""high risk category"": Ex B at p 18. Professor Greenberg also noted that only 1.5% of all sex offenders would have the same or higher score than the defendant on this scale. Accordingly, he said:

""Mr Wilde's risk of ""high risk category risk"" category is relative to other sex offenders. However his risk of sexual reoffence relative to the general male population without sexual charges or convictions should be regarded as 'higher'"": Ex B at p 19.

51Professor Greenberg also assessed the defendant on the Sexual Violence Risk-20 instrument. As a result of this assessment Professor Greenberg considered the defendant's ""dynamic risk factors"" and concluded that the ultimate issue of whether the defendant will re-offend cannot be stated with any scientific degree of certainty. However, Professor Greenberg noted at page 23 of his report:

(1)The defendant's significant static and dynamic risk factors heighten his risk of sexually re-offending. 

(2)The defendant's current risk for likelihood of committing a further sexual offence would be in the ""high risk"" category range over the long term. 

(3)This risk of sexual re-offending is in the high end of risk category relative to other sex offenders.

(4)Relative to the general male population, the defendant's risk must be considered much higher in view of the fact that he already has a pattern of convictions for serious sexual offences.

52In respect of the conditions proposed by the State, Professor Greenberg considered these to be ""clearly markedly onerous"". Further, that:

""There have been some minor gains which should be regarded as significant for Mr Wilde with regard to living arrangements, pro-social activities and engagement with psychological services. His Risk Management Plan which is reviewed on a six-monthly basis must provide Mr Wilde with incremental incentives to adopt pro-social behaviour and shift external controls to him adopting more internal controls on his antisocial attitudes, thoughts and behaviours. In my opinion, these conditions are more likely than not to assist a non-recidivistic reintegration into the community"": Ex B at p 25 (emphasis in original).

53Accordingly, Professor Greenberg reached the conclusion that the ""ESO conditions should allow flexibility for staff professional judgment and for Mr Wilde to be rewarded for adopting positive pro-social goals"". Further, that ""a period of several years would be justified and in keeping with this diagnosis"": Ex B at p 25.

(b) Report of Dr Anthony Samuels

54Dr Samuels provided a report dated 21 February 2014, which has been marked as Exhibit ""A"" in the proceedings.

55It should be noted that when the defendant attended on Dr Samuels on 31 January 2014 he presented as ""hostile"" and ""his manner was intimidating and threatening"": Ex A at p 19.

56During this appointment the defendant ""flatly refused to sign a consent form to participate in the assessment process"". Dr Samuels therefore was limited to a ""very brief encounter"", and was unable to conduct a full interview or examination of the defendant. Accordingly, his report is based on his limited observations and the materials that were provided to him. 

57Following a review of the material, Dr Samuels expressed the opinion on page 19 of his report that:

(1)There is no evidence the defendant suffers from an affective or psychiatric illness or that he is intellectually disabled;

(2)There is evidence of sexual sadism and the significance or purpose of the dildos in his possession is unclear;

(3)The presence of a paraphilic disorder cannot be confidently diagnosed or excluded without the opportunity of discussing his sexual offending behaviour;

(4)He clearly has antisocial and possibly narcissistic personality features and is likely to score in the range that suggests features of psychopathy.

58Dr Samuels found that ""there is a likelihood that he could commit a further serious sex offence"", based upon static risk factors and dynamic risk factors, and that this risk is ""moderate to high"": Ex A at pp 19-20. In respect of this, Dr Samuels observed: 

""Of greatest concern to me is the fact that even whilst on supervision orders he has continually challenged authority, attempted to evade monitoring, has been caught with a knife and dildos, changed his name, has used aliases to set up computer accounts, and has attempted to enter the home of a female. He has also never fully participated in sex offender treatment and refuses anti-libidinal medication"": Ex A at p 20.

59Dr Samuels also expressed the opinion that the defendant's personality factors underpin a lot of his physically aggressive and sexualised behaviours, and was of the view that these behaviours are entrenched, and that ""these drives are persistent"": Ex A at p 20.

60Accordingly, Dr Samuels concluded that: 

""I think it is likely that he will pose a risk of both physical and sexual aggression towards others for the foreseeable future unless physical illness, acquired disability, age related factors or other events and circumstances alter his risk profile"": Ex A at p 20.

61Dr Samuels agreed with the State that a ""5 year order would seem appropriate at this time"": Ex A at p 21.

62However, in respect of the conditions sought, Dr Samuels noted these ""would appear to be appropriate but his history, recent behaviours, attitude and demeanour suggest that ensuring his compliance will be challenging"". 

Additional Reports

63Other reports have also been prepared and were tendered in these proceedings. I do not propose to reproduce in detail the content of these lengthy reports, other than to record their primary observations and conclusions. 

(a) Risk Assessment Report

64On 14 November 2013, Mr Patrick Sheehan (Senior Forensic Psychologist) and Ms Danielle Maestro (Director, Sex and Violent Offender Program) prepared a Risk Assessment Report. 

65This report noted that:

""Mr Wilde has proven a difficult person to manage throughout his ESO. He has for the best part remained resistant and hostile to the supervision process, with little insight into his effect on other people or why supervisors might be concerned by his behaviour"": p 13.

66The report did state, however, that ""there may be sufficient scope to suggest that supervision has been impactful in reducing Mr Wilde's risk"", having regard to the fact that the defendant has not sexually re-offended whilst the present supervision order has been in force. The report also highlighted the various programs the defendant participated in whilst in custody.

67Having regard to the defendant's static and dynamic risk factors, the report concluded the defendant's overall risk as falling within the high risk category with regard to actuarial factors. 

68In particular, the report stated:
""Like most offenders, Mr Wilde's history does not suggest that he would sexually act out on every opportunity. Were he unequivocally committed to undertaking another sexual offence, he could have done so during his current supervision order. There are likely to be instances where Mr Wilde shows better judgement, does not experience sufficient sexual arousal, or his offence cycle is interrupted by some external factor. The future risk is chronic in nature in that over time as he was exposed to these risk factors without intervention or interruption, there would be less impediments to a sexual offence"": p 29 (emphasis added).

69The report additionally recorded Mr Sheehan's opinion:

""In my opinion, the overall totality of evidence suggests that Mr Wilde remains in the high risk category of sexual offending relative to other adult male sexual offenders. There has been no identifiable resolution of the factors associate with previous episodes of offending. He is at most escalated risk of engaging in offences related to threatening adult women in their own homes and threatening them with knives, which might meet the technical threshold of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006"": p 29.

70The determination of relative risk was decided as a result of the defendant having more elements of risk and less protective factors than other male sexual offenders: p 30.

71In respect of the likely consequences of a further supervision order not being made, the report observed:

""It may be that Mr Wilde could independently remain offence free, however, the available evidence suggests to me that his social judgment and decision making continues to be impaired, and in combination with violent/angry thoughts, Mr Wilde remains vulnerable to placing himself in high risk situations"": p 30.

(b) Risk Management Report

72A Risk Management Report was prepared in December 2013 by Kylie Smith (Community Corrections Officer, Extended Supervision Team, Campbelltown Community Corrections), Julie Bates (Unit Leader, Extended Supervision Team, Campbelltown Community Corrections) and Ziggy Abedine (Manager, Extended Supervision Team). 

73The report detailed the defendant's criminal history, response to supervision, and his breaches of the extended supervision order. The report also observed that the defendant has been resistant to the conditions of his current supervision order, has limited social skills, and has ""required intense supervision and a great deal of patience and one to one intervention"": p 10. 

74The report noted the conclusions in the Risk Assessment Report that the defendant falls within the high risk category for sexual re-offending. The report formulates a risk management plan which focuses on removing opportunities for further offending through intensive monitoring of the defendant and situations that may lead to offending behaviour, so as to practicably manage the defendant in the community.

75This plan suggested:

(1)Reporting obligations;

(2)Unannounced and random visits, in addition to regular weekly home visits;

(3)Electronic monitoring in conjunction with the provision of a schedule of movements;

(4)Residing only at accommodation approved by the defendant's nominated departmental supervising officer;

(5)Imposition of a curfew;

(6)Monitoring of all interactions with the community; 

(7)Abstinence from illicit substances and alcohol;

(8)Restriction on defendant's access to weapons;

(9)Participation in monthly one-on-one counselling sessions with the therapeutic manager of Forensic Pathology Services.

76The report observed that electronic monitoring and the implementation of a curfew ""are considered vital tools in the management of Mr Wilde as he would be required to account for movements which would assist in providing him with a structured lifestyle"": p 9.

77The report also proposed that these conditions be reviewed every six months to determine the necessary degree of supervision and monitoring.

78In summary, the report concluded that:

""Given Mr Wilde's history of violent sexual re-offending against adult females, his likelihood of re-offending has been assessed to be in the high risk category. Mr Wilde presents with a history of non compliance and resistance in regard to community supervision and treatment which, when coupled with only a short period of independent living within the community since August 2013 raises serious concerns as to his ability to lead a law abiding lifestyle were he to remain in the community unsupervised"": p 9.

(c) Report of Jenny Howell

79Jenny Howell, registered psychologist, prepared a report on 29 June 2012. This report was originally requested by the defendant's solicitors in relation to the defendant's suitability and willingness to engage in counselling to address his risk of sexual recidivism should he be released into the community. 

80In this report Ms Howell observed:

(1)Restrictions placed on the defendant pursuant to the extended supervision order have significantly isolated him from society outside of departmental staff. 

(2)The defendant has great difficulty forming working relationships with staff employed by the Department of Corrective Services. 

(3)The defendant has experienced feelings of extreme frustration with the Department of Corrective Services in their management of his extended supervision order. 

(4)The defendant has attended 59 counselling sessions while under the extended supervision order. 

(5)The defendant has engaged in counselling in a way that is consistent with his beliefs regarding the value of counselling. 

(6)The defendant has been respectful and engaged in difficult discussions of offending issues. 

(7)The defendant continues to deny responsibility for the second and third offences, and maintains they were consensual. 

(8)The defendant has not attracted new allegations, charges or convictions for sexual assault offences while under the extended supervision order. 

(d) Notes of Katherine Sahm

81The defendant commenced seeing Ms Katherine Sahm, therapeutic manager of Forensic Psychology Services on 23 January 2013, and he agreed to attend monthly sessions with Ms Sahm on the condition that his support people are present. 

82Ms Sahm's notes indicate that the defendant initially presented as agitated, and stated ""I am here under duress"".

83However, the clinical notes indicate that each subsequent time the defendant attended with his support persons and presented as inflexible and resistant, but polite and engaged throughout the sessions. 

84It was recorded on 24 July 2013 that:

""Attendance is good and despite levels of resistance (offender) engages well. The challenge remains that the offender has significant ambivalence to change and experiences this as a vulnerability (causing angry outbursts), failing himself and giving in to the authority of others. This process can impact on the offender's ability to engage in specific treatment goal discussions.""

85Ms Sahm noted on 24 September 2013 that:

""Overall, John has been progressing with regard to managing his mood and general self-management behaviour. He presents continued agitation toward authority figures and this will be seen by those representing the 'authority role' in his supervision and the rules regarding this, especially when he thinks they are unfair.""

Parties' Submissions

(a) Plaintiff's submissions

86The State submitted that the Court should make a further extended supervision order for a period of five years, subject to the proposed conditions it annexed to its written submissions. 

87It submitted that without supervision the defendant presents a significant risk to the community. Further, that when considering all aspects of his conduct and presentation, including his past sexual offending and his actions over the past five years whilst subject to the present supervision order, the Court would determine that his risk of committing a further serious sex offence remains high should he not be kept under supervision. 

88In support, the State referred to the psychological reports as well as the defendant's offending history and prior breaches of the extended supervision order. 

89Despite acknowledging the defendant's recent positive changes, it is argued that these appear to rely heavily upon the support of two particular members of the Christian Motorcycle Club, namely, Ms Bonser and Mr Pearson. The State submitted that the capacity for this relationship to endure in the long term is ""tenuous"", and that there is a disconnect between the abovementioned Club and the defendant by reason of his pagan and witchcraft beliefs.

90In addition, the State noted that whilst some of the defendant's risk factors may have been resolved, there has been no identifiable resolution of the factors associated with previous episodes of offending. Further, it submitted that the defendant is at a ""most escalated risk of engaging in offences related to threatening adult women in their own homes and threatening them with knives"". In this respect, the State relies upon the Risk Assessment Report at page 29.

91In respect of the defendant's recent lack of offending, it was the State's submission that this ""is a result of the intensive supervision he has been subject to"", and whilst there may be potential in the future to reduce aspects of supervision, the defendant's improvements at this stage ""are too little and too late to allow a Court to be satisfied that his risk has sufficiently ameliorated to remove supervision"". 

(b) Defendant's submissions

92The defendant opposed the making of a further extended supervision order. In the alternative, he opposed the imposition of the conditions sought by the State, which he contended amount to an unjustifiably onerous imposition on his liberty. 

93With the exception of the four breaches of the defendant's extended supervision order that were previously discussed, Mr Pararajasingham of counsel who appeared on the application on the defendant's behalf, in his helpful written submissions, noted that the fact that the defendant complied with the conditions attached to the extended supervision order imposed by Price J (apart from the four abovementioned breaches):

""...demonstrates a marked change in attitude towards his obligations which militates against any identifiable risk. Separately, it also undermines the need for the imposition of any conditions above and beyond those that the defendant is currently subject to"": Defendant's written submissions at p 6.

94Mr Pararajasingham relied upon what was referred to as the defendant's ""recent pro-social advancement"", including his relationship with volunteer supports persons Ms Anne Bonser and Mr Barry Pearson, who he met in mid-2012. Since this time, Ms Bonser and Mr Pearson have been:

""...actively involved in reintegrating the defendant into society through general socialising attending appointments with the defendant, introducing the defendant to a weekly bible study group, inviting the defendant to take part in community motorbike rides and teaching the defendant various life skills, most recently about mechanics and electronics"": Defendant's written submissions at p 7.

95It was submitted that this relationship with Ms Bonser and Mr Pearson is not tenuous. In support of this submission, reliance was placed upon Ms Bonser's affidavit sworn 24 March 2014.

96It was also noted that the defendant was invited to spend Christmas in 2013 with a family he had come to know through his time in custody. 

97These relationships, the defendant submitted, ""demonstrate that the defendant is on the path towards normalised integration into the community and point away from the likelihood of the defendant committing further serious sex offences"". 

98Alternatively, it was submitted that should the Court impose an extended supervision order, the defendant's development ""ought to be encouraged and supported through the imposition of the least onerous conditions which would enable the defendant to pursue his various avenues of social congress with minimal interference and disruption"". 

99In addition, Mr Pararajasingham submitted that the defendant has reduced some of his dynamic risk factors, and that ""it is open on the material to infer that the defendant has improved his ability to self-monitor and inhibit anti-social thoughts"". In support of this, the defendant cited the recent pro-social advances, as well as the sessions with Ms Jenny Howell, a private therapist. 

100In respect of the conditions proposed by the State, the defendant submitted that many of these appear to be directed to the prior breaches of conditions. The defendant argued that:

""This not only distracts from the purpose behind the imposition of conditions which must be directed towards mitigating an identified high risk of serious sex offending but amounts to a necessarily onerous incursion into the defendant's liberty"": Defendant's written submissions at p 14.

101Further, it was submitted that whilst the defendant's prior conduct are matters that ""may well be at their highest manifestations of an anti-social trait or a personality order"", these:

""...do not alone, or in combination with any other matters, warrant the making of an ESO which is directed towards a very specific and high level risk of sexual reoffending, and ought not to be utilised as a means of simply 'keeping tabs' of a belligerent and overbearing person"": Defendant's written submissions at p 15.

102Accordingly, it was submitted that if this Court does make an extended supervision order, that ""only those conditions deemed appropriate in light of the legislative purpose behind the Act ought to be imposed"". 

Extended Supervision Orders

(a) The requirement that the offender must be a ""high risk sex offender""

103As previously noted, this Court may, on application by the State, make an order for the supervision of an offender if the offender is a ""high risk sex offender"". This requires the Court to be satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender ""poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision"": s 5B. 

104In reaching this conclusion, the Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sexual offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sexual offence: s 5B(3). 

105The defendant's prior convictions evidence that he is a ""sex offender"", and Price J has previous found that the each of the offences committed by the defendant was a ""serious sex offence"": Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Wilde [2007] NSWSC 1490. 

106Factors to be taken into account when assessing whether the defendant is a high risk sex offender include the likelihood of the person offending, the type of sexual offence which the person is likely to commit (if that can be predicted) and the consequences of making a finding that an unacceptable risk exists: Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v Williams [2007] WASC 206; (2007) 176 A Crim R 110 at [63]. This involves a balancing exercise between the likelihood of a serious sex offence being committed in the future, and on the other hand, the serious consequences for the offender: State of New South Wales v Richardson (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 276; (2011) A Crim R 220 at [90].

107I note that in Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v Williams, supra, this Court (Davies J) concluded that although the defendant posed a low risk of committing a serious sex offence, the risk remained unacceptable. 

108It has already been observed that the offences committed by the defendant were serious sex offences that involved the use of a knife, and were somewhat similar in their nature. 

109The defendant has only spent approximately three years out of prison and in the community since he was 19 years old. 

110Since 2008, he has been subject to continuous detention orders and extended supervision orders. His breaches of the conditions of these orders has resulted in him serving further time in prison. 

111In considering whether an offender meets the requirements of s 5B, regard may be had to the relevant factors listed in s 9: State of New South Wales v Fisk [2013] NSWSC 364 at [84].

112Although the defendant has provided an affidavit of Ann Bonser sworn 24 March 2014, which details the various pro-social activities the defendant has engaged in since his release as well as his support network, it is necessary as earlier discussed, that I have regard to the reports ordered pursuant to s 7(4). In their reports, both Professor Greenberg and Dr Samuels agree that there is a high risk the defendant will re-offend, and that the defendant should be subject to some form of an extended supervision order. 

113I accept the opinions expressed by both Professor Greenberg and Dr Samuels, which are consistent with Mr Sheehan's stated conclusions.

114Having regard to the relevant reports and the defendant's offending history (including the relevant breaches of conditions imposed upon him), I am satisfied that the defendant is a high risk sex offender, and poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision.

(b) Determination of the State's application for an extended supervision order

115In determining whether to make an extended supervision order, the Court is required to have regard to the relevant factors enumerated in s 9 of the Act in addition to any other matter it considers relevant. These include, but are not limited to:

(1)The safety of the community;

(2)Psychological reports pursuant to s 7(4) or any other psychiatric, psychological or medical reports, and the offender's level of participation in any such examinations or assessment;

(3)Any reports prepared by Corrective Services;

(4)Any treatment or rehabilitation programs the defendant has participated in;

(5)The level of the defendant's compliance with obligations to which he is, or has been, subject;

(6)The offender's criminal history;

(7)The views of the sentencing court at the time the sentence of imprisonment was imposed on the offender;

(8)Any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in the future commit offences of a sexual nature.

116Whilst I accept that the defendant has made progress in recent years since his release from prison, and in particular, has not committed any further sexual offences in this time, I cannot accept that this does has not occurred by virtue of the defendant having been subject to an extended supervision order during this time. 

117In this respect, I note in particular the conclusion reached in the Risk Assessment Report: ""The future risk is chronic in nature in that over time as he was exposed to these risk factors without intervention or interruption, there would be less impediments to a sexual offence"": p 29.

118I have had regard to each of the matters referred to in s 9(3)(a), (b), (c), (d), (d1), (f), (h) and (h1) and to the other material tendered in evidence to which I have referred above. 

119The evidence establishes that the defendant has a high risk of re-offending, and I am satisfied that an extended supervision order should be made. The duration and conditions of this order will be addressed below. 

(c) Duration of the extended supervision order

120This Court may make an extended supervision order for a period not exceeding five years. 

121It was the State's submission that due to the entrenched aspects of the defendant's personality disorder and the slow progress made by him in achieving a pro-social lifestyle, a period of five years is appropriate. 

122In oral submissions, Mr Pararajasingham argued that his instructions were to oppose the making of any order. In his alternative submission, if an order were to be made it should be for a period not exceeding three years. 

123Having regard to the relevant factors in this case, I propose to make an extended supervision order for a period of three years, commencing on 2 April 2014.

124Since his release from prison, the defendant has engaged in pro-social activities and has not sexually re-offended and has demonstrated a degree of appropriate social interaction which, on the evidence, he should be encouraged to further develop in the future. I consider that these factors go towards not imposing the maximum term for the extended supervision order. 

125The Act leaves open to the State the opportunity of making a further application if it considers appropriate. At this stage I consider a three-year term to be an appropriate period in properly resolving the conflicting interests and considerations to which I have referred in paragraph [6] above and given, on the evidence, the possibility that exists that the defendant may be able to achieve further progress towards rehabilitation.

Conditions of the Extended Supervision Order

126The Court may direct an offender to comply with such conditions the Court ""considers appropriate"". This accords with the primary object of the Act, which is to ""ensure the safety of the community"": s 3(1). 

127Section 11 of the Act provides a non-exhaustive list of the types of conditions that may be imposed on high risk sex offenders. These include:

(1)To permit any corrective services officer to visit the offender at the offender's residential address at any time and to, for that purpose, to enter the premises at that address.

(2)To permit any correct services officer to access any computer or related equipment that is at the offender's residential address or in the possession of the offender. 

(3)To make periodic reports to a corrective services officer. 

(4)To notify a corrective services officer of any change to his or her residential address.

(5)To wear electronic monitoring equipment.

(6)To reside at an address approved by the Commissioner of Corrective Services. 

(7)Not to reside in or resort to specified locations or classes of locations. 

(8)Not to associate or make contact with specified persons or classes of persons. 

(9)Not to engage in specified conduct or classes of conduct. 

(10)Not to engage in specified employment or classes of employed. 

(11)Not to change his or her name. 


128It was the defendant's submission that the Court must be satisfied as to the appropriateness of any given condition in the context of mitigating the defendant's demonstrated risk of committing future serious sex offences. 

129The State annexed to their written submissions a list of the conditions sought. 

130In its written submissions on pages 27 to 29 the State highlights certain conditions it proposes and the reasons for them, including the perceived need for electronic monitoring due to the defendant's history of deviating from schedules. 

131Mr Pararajasingham drew particular attention to the following proposed conditions:

(1)Conditions C(3) and E(4), which relate to a prohibition on associating with outlaw motorcycle gangs, organised criminal networks and criminal organisations;

(2)Condition G(1), which relates to access to pornographic, violent and classified material;

(3)Conditions I(1)-(3), which relates to the possession or consumption of illicit drugs and alcohol;

(4)Condition K(5), which relates to the rights of the Departmental Supervising Officer or any other authorised person to access, inspect, and remove the defendant's computer or other devices.

132I will address the defendant's submission on these proposed conditions, as well as my findings in relation to them below.

133In summary, I have concluded that the conditions referred to below are appropriate to ensure the ""supervision"" of the defendant during the term of the extended supervision order I will impose. The fact that the conditions may be of a kind appropriate for a range of offenders does not carry the conclusion that they are not appropriate in the defendant's case.

Proposed Conditions C(3) and E(4)

134In response to concerns raised regarding the wording of conditions C(3) and E(4), the State amended these conditions to now read as follows:

C(3): The defendant must not attend any premises that [are frequented by members and/or associates] he knows to be frequented by any person he knows to be a member and/or associate of any Outlaw Motorcycle Gang, Organised Criminal Network, or Criminal Organisation (as declared under the Crimes (Criminal Organisations Control) Act 2012)

E(4): The defendant must not associate with any [member and/or associates] person he knows to be a member and/or associate of any Outlaw Motorcycle Gang, Organised Criminal Network, or Criminal Organisation (as declared under the Crimes (Criminal Organisations Control) Act 2012), without the prior approval of the Departmental supervising officer).

135In its written submissions, the State observed that the defendant has stated a desire to engage with such persons and clubs as identified in proposed conditions C(3) and E(4) and accordingly, that such conditions are essential, noting the anti-social behaviours that prevail in those organisations: State's written submissions at p 29.

136In its reply to the amended condition set out above, the defendant maintained his submission that this condition has no proper basis, on the grounds that ""no rational link has been established between the existence of outlaw motorcycle gangs, organised criminal networks and criminal organisations and the incidence of serious sex offences"".

137I would accept this condition in its amended form addresses relevant risk factors associated with anti-social behaviours that limits the prospect for rehabilitation and re-integration of the defendant into the community. 

138The Act specifically foreshadows the making of conditions to prohibit a serious sex offender from associating with specified persons or classes of persons, and I would consider that proposed conditions C(3) and E(4) in their amended form assists in upholding the objects of the Act.

Proposed Condition G(1)

139Proposed condition G(1) states: 

""The defendant must not purchase, possess, access, obtain, view, participate in or listen to material classified or material that would be classified as Refused Classification and X18+, or any other material as directed by the Departmental Supervising Officer.""

140Having regard to the serious violent sexual offences that have been previously committed by the defendant, I am satisfied this proposed condition directly addresses the future risk of violent sexual re-offending materialising from viewing classified material that has violent content, and accordingly, is not unjustifiably onerous or punitive. 

Proposed Conditions I(1)-(3)

141The defendant submitted that the proposed conditions under Part K do not directly address the future risk of sexual re-offending, and instead, are directed at the defendant's personality disorder. 

142Proposed conditions I(1)-(3) read as follows:

1. The defendant must not possess or consume any illicit drugs.

2. The defendant must not possess or consume any alcohol (including any alcohol-based products such as methylated spirits), without prior approval of the Departmental supervising officer.

3. The defendant must submit to drug and alcohol testing as directed by the Departmental supervising officer or any officer of Corrective Services NSW who from time to time supervises the defendant.

143There is no evidence suggesting that the defendant's prior offences were committed under the influence of illicit drugs or alcohol. 

144However, an extended supervision order may properly restrict consumption of alcohol and prohibit non-prescription drugs as a means of controlling possible risk factors to sexual re-offending behaviour.

145I consider this order to be appropriate, and would not consider it to be unjustifiably onerous or punitive, having regard to the fact that under proposed condition I(2), the defendant is able to seek approval to possess or consumer alcohol. 

Proposed Condition K(5)

146Proposed condition K(5) provides:

5. If and as directed by the Departmental Supervising Officer, the defendant must:

a. permit the Departmental Supervising Officer or any other person, to access, inspect and remove any computer or other device (including mobile phone or tablet computer) used by or owned by the defendant, including the temporary removal of the computer or other device from the defendant's place of residence or his or her person for the purpose of inspection or the imaging of the contents of the computer;

b. take all available steps to permit the Departmental Supervising Officer or any other person to have access to and inspect any computer or other device (including mobile phone or tablet computer) used by or owned by the defendant;

c. provide the Departmental Supervising Officer or any other person with any requested assistance to enable either or both of them to access and inspect any computer or other device (including mobile phone or tablet computer) used by or owned by the defendant, including providing them with any required passwords;

d. permit the Departmental Supervising Officer or any other person to make copies of any files or materials on any computer or other device (including mobile phone or tablet computer) used by or owned by the defendant that the Departmental Supervising Officer reasonably believes may be relevant to the management of the defendant's risk of re-offending.

147Having regard to the supervisory nature of the order and for the reasons I have stated in respect of proposed condition G(1), and having regard to the defendant's prior breach of conditions in contacting a person over Facebook, I do not consider that the condition is unjustifiably onerous or punitive.

148For the same reasons, I would also find the proposed conditions under Part F, which relate to internet access and social network use, to be appropriate. 

Conditions Imposed on the Defendant

149I would accordingly order all of the conditions sought by the State in their written submissions, with conditions C(3) and E(4) being in their amended form. 

150The conditions as ordered will be initialled by me and placed with the Court file. Copies of these conditions will be handed to the parties and they also appear as Schedule ""A"" to this judgment. 

Orders

151I make an order pursuant to s 9(1)(a) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 for an extended supervision order in respect of the defendant, John Alan Wilde, for a term of three years from 2 April 2014.

152I make an order pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 that, for the period of the extended supervision order, the defendant comply with conditions 1-65 as set out in Schedule ""A"" to this judgment.

2705287,R v Iusi Afele [2014] NSWSC 366,"Judgment
1Iusi Afele (""the accused"") has pleaded not guilty to an indictment alleging that on 5 March 2013 at Bathurst in the state of New South Wales he murdered Steven Chesworth (""the deceased"").
2On 28 February 2014 counsel for the accused filed a notice of motion seeking a trial before a judge alone pursuant to provisions of s. 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  The Crown consented to that application and I made orders accordingly.  
3The accused's trial took place before me on 31 March 2014.  The Crown tendered, by consent, two volumes of documentary material which were marked exhibits ""A"" and ""B"".  That material included medical evidence which raised a defence of mental illness.  
4In addition to the documentary material tendered by the Crown, I also heard oral evidence from two Forensic Psychiatrists, Dr Stephen Allnutt and Dr Richard Furst.
5I record my thanks to both counsel for the sensible and practical manner in which the trial has been conducted.  
THE CROWN CASE6The Crown case may be shortly stated.  
7The deceased and the accused resided in an apartment block in Bathurst.  All of the residents within the block were tenants of the Department of Housing.  The accused and the deceased were friendly with one another, to the point that in the latter part of February 2013 the deceased had assisted the accused painting his premises.
8Several of the residents of the apartment complex were in the habit of meeting in unit 8, occupied by Robert Foster, on most mornings of the week.  Mr Foster's premises were located on the ground floor of the complex.  He resided with another man by the name of Steven Porter.
9On the morning of 5 March 2013 several people gathered in Mr Foster's premises.  They included the deceased who was sitting in a lounge chair near the front door.  The accused entered the premises shortly after 8:00 am.  He did not engage with the neighbours when they greeted him as he walked in, a circumstance which those neighbours regarded as unusual.  The accused took a few steps towards the chair where the deceased was sitting and stood behind it.  Those present were not able to ascertain that the accused was holding a large knife secreted in the sleeve of his top at the time.
10The accused then commenced to strike the deceased in the chest and abdomen with the knife.  To those present, it initially appeared as though the accused was punching the deceased but they soon realised that he was in fact stabbing him.  The deceased suffered a number of serious wounds as a result of the blows delivered by the accused.  One of the neighbours present described the accused as having a ""strange"" look on his face as he walked from the unit, still holding the knife that he had used to stab the deceased.
11Those present tried to render first aid to the deceased, whose condition rapidly deteriorated.  He lost consciousness within a short period of time and died at the scene, ambulance personnel not being able to revive him following their arrival.  A post mortem examination confirmed that the deceased died as a result of the wounds inflicted by the accused.
12Police quickly ascertained that the accused was responsible for stabbing the deceased.  They attended his premises and spoke with him, before placing him under arrest.  The accused made some admissions at the scene.  In particular, he told police that the knife that he had used to stab the deceased was in the kitchen sink.  He also acknowledged that he had attempted to wash the blood from the knife.  
13The accused then accompanied police back to the police station where he was given the benefit of access to legal advice.  He was interviewed on that occasion, and was then charged.  
14Several days later the accused made contact with police, following which a further interview was arranged.  In the course of that interview the accused made extensive admissions to the killing of the deceased which are detailed further below.
THE EVIDENCE15The large body of material tendered in evidence supports the summary of the Crown case that I have outlined.  Whilst I do not propose to summarise that evidence in its entirety there are four particular areas to which I should refer, namely:  
(i)the accused's interviews with police;
(ii)the post mortem examination of the deceased; 
(iii)the accused's history of mental illness; and 
(iv)the expert medical evidence as to the accused's mental state at the time of the deceased's murder.
The accused's interviews16When arrested on the morning of 5 March 2013 police asked the accused what he could tell them about the death of the deceased.  The accused replied:
""Um, just everything got to me"".
17The accused subsequently directed the police to the presence of a knife in the kitchen sink, telling them that he had ""used it"" and that he had ""put it under (his) sleeve"".  He subsequently admitted to using the knife to stab the deceased.  In the course of speaking with the police, the accused disclosed that he suffered from schizophrenia.  
18Upon arrival at the police station, a formal interview commenced in which the accused indicated that he did not wish to answer questions.  However, at Q and A 63 the accused did say to police:
""I understand what I've done wrong. I, I just, you know, everything is just.""
19When asked (at Q 109) whether he wished to say anything further about the matter, the accused responded:
""All I am going to say is this, I, I pay for my crimes.""
20The accused then said:
""I am just sorry for what, to Steve's family'.
21The accused was charged with the deceased's murder and was refused bail.  
22Some days later, the accused asked to speak with the police again, following which a formal interview was conducted on 13 March 2013.  When asked (at Q 48) why it was that he wanted to speak to the police the accused responded:
""I just wanted to, ah, confess, just, just to get it out, out of the way so I can get what, do my time.""
23In the course of the interview the accused made reference to his medical history and told police (at Q 167-168) that he had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia for which he was prescribed medication.
24When asked about the death of the deceased, the accused told police (commencing at Q 311) that the deceased had assisted him in painting his premises several days before the incident and that in the course of doing so, he and the deceased had smoked a form of synthetic cannabis which had ""made (him) paranoid"".  He told police (commencing at Q and A 386) that between that time and the time of the deceased's death, he had been unable to sleep and had attempted suicide by hanging on 3 March 2013.  He explained to police (at Q and A 388):
""Yeah, 'cause I was, I was paranoid as and I was hearing voices saying that they're gonna kill me that they're all gonna kill me.""
25The accused was asked (commencing at Q 402):
""Q 402: Was that as a result of, did you get to that point because of your smoking Marijuana?A: Yeah, 'cause I, I was, I didn't want to, I didn't want to hurt anybody because I was getting to the result where I was, I was gonna hurt somebody.
Q 403: Why, why was that?A: Because the voices were telling me because the voices were telling me ""they're, they're gonna; if you don't kill them they'll kill you first"".
Q 404: Yeah, is it, is that all because it started back on the Thursday when you smoked that fake Pot?A: Yeah.
Q 405: Is that where it all started?A: Yeah.
Q 406: You were just angry were you...Steven getting the fake Pot?A: I was just, yeah.""
26The accused told the police (commencing at Q and A 420) that at the time of killing the deceased he was:
""...Just hearing things saying 'you gonna, if you don't kill them, they're gonna kill you' and was talking, speaking in my own lingo - - - and I was, and then I was just, and then, I don't know if I end up talking...to it or I hear, I was hearing things, but, um, I end up just grabbing the knife and walked, walked over to, um, walked over to the ...to ... place - - - ""

27The accused explained to police that he had kept a knife under his bed.  When asked (at Q 430) what he did at the deceased's premises the accused responded:
""I just, 'cause I, I, I was just hearing things and they, they were saying things, they were saying Steve and ...and them and Rollie and, and Kingie were all, were in it, all, all in on it and that they, they wanted to get rid of me and I, and I was, and I was, and I was thinking I'm gonna kill all of them...So I, but I just, I just stabbed Steve instead.""
28The accused explained to police that he had secreted the knife under the sleeve of a long sleeved top when he was walking to the deceased's premises and explained (in answer to Q 443) that he walked in and started stabbing the deceased.  He then said (at Q and A 444):
""I just, I think I got him in the throat, or in the, in the shoulder, and then, then he freaked out and then, and then I took the knife and I started stabbing him in the stomach and he said, and the last words I heard from him was 'I, I saved, I saved you a Bud.' I said to him 'its not about the Bud' that's all, and that's the last words I said to him and then I walked out and Irene was telling me, or calling me, take, asking me to give her, give her the knife and I didn't trust her either...'cause I thought they were all in on it and I, and I, my whole intention was to go stab everybody in there but I just got Steve and, and it snapped me out of it when he, when he got up and, and he said 'oh I save you a Bud' and I just looked at him and I said 'its not about the Bud' and he, and he looked at me funny. He said, and he started freaking, he started freaking, and I just walked out and I wiped the blade on the newspaper that was outside.""
29The accused (at Q and A 658, 694-696 and 724) expressed his remorse for killing the deceased.  In answer to Q 688 he described his mental state at the time that he killed the deceased:
""Um, I was just, I wasn't, I was over the anger, but it, it was just, just the voice in my head telling me that he's gonna kill me, and, um, I remember when I was, before my, just after my daughter was born there was a, I was staying down Manly in this, um, little granny flat, and there was a photo, there was a poster of Snoop Dog and it said ""Murder was the cause"" and I, and it ate away at me for years and I'm thinking that they're gonna try and murder or something.  'Cause, um, some lady before that, when my kids were born, some white lady said that Samoans are gonna rule the world one day and I, and I, and I didn't understand what she meant by that and, um, and it ate at me and I thought it was a conspiracy.  And I, and I, 'cause I was Samoan I thought that, you know, they, they're gonna try and get rid of me so; I don't know why"".
The deceased's post mortem examination30The deceased's post mortem examination was conducted on 8 March 2013 by Dr Allan Cala, a senior staff specialist in Forensic Pathology at the Newcastle Department of Forensic Medicine.  Dr Cala found (inter alia) the following injuries:
(i)stab wounds to the right side of the chest, the left upper arm and left thigh, the most significant of which were those in the right side of the upper chest where separate stab wounds caused serious penetrating injury; 
(ii)an interior stab wound which entered the upper lobe of the right lung and created a haemorrhagic stab wound track which was approximately 120mm in depth and which passed into and through the lung, penetrating the pericardial cavity surrounding the heart and creating a stab wound defect on the outer surface of the left atrium;
(iii)a stab wound which cut through the right sixth rib;
(iv)a stab wound which penetrated the right pleural cavity and entered the lower lobe of the right lung; 
(v)a large quantity of blood in the right pleural cavity;
(vi)a smaller amount of blood in the pericardial cavity;
(vii)two ""through and through"" stab wounds on the left arm between the elbow and shoulder which had entered laterally and exited medially, creating stab wound defects behind the humerus;
(viii)two superficial stab wounds on the left thigh;
(ix)superficial incised wound to the back of the lower neck; and
(x)several superficial incised wounds on the hands which may have represented ""defence injuries"" but which could be alternatively explained by the finger tips having come into contact with the cutting edge of the murder weapon.
31Dr Cala concluded that the stab wounds were the cause of the deceased's death.
The accused's history of mental illness32Contained within Exhibits A and B is a large volume of documentary material setting out the accused's history of mental illness.  That material has been referred to by both Dr Allnutt and Dr Furst in their respective reports.  In these circumstances, I do not propose to summarise all of it.  However, the following matters are of particular relevance.  
33On 4 April 2000 the accused presented to Manly Hospital in the presence of his mother, in what was described as a ""psychotic"" state.  A past history of schizophrenia was noted.  The accused was discharged on 15 May 2000 into the care of the Parkes Community Mental Health Service.  The discharge summary noted the following:
""Client arrived in a thought disordered state, laughing and giggling and responding to auditory hallucinations. Has lived an itinerant lifestyle for the past 5/52.  Client had experience insulting auditory hallucinations for past year, with paranoia and ideas of reference...
Client initiated on Risperidone suffering continuous degrotory (sic) auditory hallucinations. Client displaying at times agitated thought disordered behaviour, with persecutory delusions and ideas of reference. Risperidone induced Akathisia and dose modified. Auditory hallucinations improving, 03/05/00 Olanzapine initiated in addition to Risperidone. 05/05/00 Olanzapine ceased due to extreme fatigue experienced by client.""34On 12 January 2005 the accused was admitted to Bloomfield Hospital in Orange where he remained until 26 January 2005. The discharge summary prepared at the time noted a diagnosis of ""psychotic relapse, schizo affective disorder"".  The summary recorded that the accused had been referred by the Parkes Community Mental Health Team because of the relapse of a psychotic illness compounded by marijuana use and a failure to adhere to his medication regime.  It was noted that the accused was reporting increased auditory hallucinations, delusions and an elevated mood but that the persecutory delusions and auditory hallucinations had resolved upon the resumption of his medication. 
35The accused was admitted to Bloomfield Hospital again on 24 May 2007 due to concerns about recent mood elevation which were accompanied by disinhibited and hostile behaviour.  In particular, he had been sunbaking naked in a park and had become threatening when asked to cover up by a passer by.  He had then locked himself out of his house and had walked down the street wrapped in his towel, threatening again when no one would help him.  A history of schizophrenia was again noted.  
36The summary prepared at the time of his discharge from Bloomfield Hospital on 13 June 2007 noted that although the accused had settled, he ""admitted to being bothered by voices"" and he remained a little paranoid, negatively misinterpreting comments from some people.  An increase in his medication was prescribed which exhibited a further improvement in his mental state and he was released to continue further treatment in the community.
37Eight days later, on 21 June 2007, the accused was again admitted to Bloomfield Hospital after he had attacked the front counter of a ""McDonald's"" restaurant with an axe. He told police (at Q and A 231 of his interview on 13 March 2013) that on this occasion he was hearing things and had become delusional, thinking that the character ""Ronald McDonald"" was a paedophile.  At the time of his admission on that occasion, it was noted that the accused:  ""...reported continuing psychotic symptoms after discharge from Bloomfield Hospital on 13.06.2007 - these included receiving ""indirect comments"" from members of the community, as well as auditory hallucinations.  Some of the ""indirect comments"" were critical of him  - for example, when a female in a bread shop in Parkes had commented that ""the butter was fresh"", he knew that she was talking critical about him. ... (His) psychotic symptoms after discharge had been compounded by ethanol and drug use.  He also felt isolated in Parkes, because he had not been able to see his children.""
38The accused was discharged from Bloomfield Hospital on 27 July 2007.  At that time it was noted that he had displayed ongoing positive symptoms of chronic schizophrenia exacerbated by recent cannabis use and isolation from his family.  The discharge summary stated (inter alia):  
""Iusi settled very quickly while at Bloomfield Hospital and his psychotic symptoms had completely resolved within two weeks. Iusi felt very remorseful about his actions at McDonalds in Parkes, and this was compounded by his guilt around the consequences of his actions, for his children.
Iusi was seen by the social worker who assisted in organising a discharge plan for Iusi and in liaising with Iusi's ex-wife and family.""
39There is also evidence that in 2007 and 2008 the accused was a resident of ""Kallara"", a mental health facility in Bathurst, during which time he was made the subject of a Community Treatment Order. On 25 March 2008 Dr Lumley, a Psychiatrist and Senior Specialist, recorded that the accused had a ""chronic paranoid schizophrenic illness"".  
40There is also evidence that in 2008 the accused spent a period in a men's refuge in Bathurst known as Solo House.  An incident with one of the staff at that facility led to the accused being charged with offences of using a carriage service to threaten a person, for which he was placed on a bond.
41On 10 March 2010 the accused was admitted to the Panorama Clinic in Bathurst, where he remained for 12 days.  It was noted that he was psychotic at that time and that he engaged in polysubstance abuse.
42On 13 March 2012 Dr Lumley wrote to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.  Having noted that the accused's previous Community Treatment Order had lapsed, he said:  
""Today he told me at a regular consultation that he had not been taking his oral medication for some years and instead he has been taking some illegal medication which was not prescribed. I feel strongly that Iusi ought to be under control of a CTO in order that we may provide adequate care and enforce the need for him to take medication not only for his mental illness (he suffers from chronic Schizophrenia) but also for his medical illness including diabetes. Therefore I would ask that he be given an order by the Tribunal.""
43On the same day Dr Lumley wrote to the accused's general practitioner Dr Jamison enclosing a copy of his letter and stating:
""It might be helpful for you to know that he Iusi has taken no oral medication for some years and that of course includes his diabetic treatment. Today he told me his back pain troubles him considerably and he is now buying Oxycotin (sic) illegally.""

44On 2 October 2012 Dr Natalie Johnston, the Psychiatric Registrar at Bloomfield Hospital wrote to the members of the Mental Health Review Tribunal.  Having noted the accused's history of chronic schizophrenia, Dr Johnston said:
""Mr Afele has displayed very poor compliance with his oral medications. He is no longer on any oral psychotropic due to his poor compliance. He continues to abuse substances, including cannabis, intravenous opiates, and more recently heavy use of alcohol. When abusing substances, Mr Afele's mental state often deteriorates, resulting in re-emergence of psychotic symptoms, particularly if he is not adequately medicated. His past history is notable for periods of threatening and violent thoughts and behaviour met when mentally unwell. He displays no insight into his illness and indicates that he would not be compliant with medication if not a CTO. For this reason, and in order to reduce  the risk to himself and others, Mr Afele requires an extension of his CTO to enable staff to continue to provide treatment, supervision and case management in the least restrictive environment.""

THE SPECIALIST MEDICAL EVIDENCEThe evidence of Dr Richard Furst45On 12 July 2013 Dr Richard Furst, a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist undertook an assessment of the accused at the request of his solicitors.  Dr Furst noted the accused's history of mental illness as follows:
There was a lengthy history of mental illness, with his first psychiatric admissions to 'East Wing', at Manly Hospital, in April 2000 and at Bloomfield Hospital in Orange in 2001 for around two or three months. Mr Afele recalls feeling very paranoid and hearing voices on those occasions. The use of 'Ecstasy' (MDMA) and cannabis may well have precipitated his illness. His initial treatment was with the antipsychotic medication Risperidone. He was later treated with Olanzapine and Clopixol.
Mr Afele had about 5-6 admissions his psychiatric units over the last 13 years, one occasion being in 2006 when he ""smashed up McDonalds with an axe."" He was admitted to Bloomfield Hospital, progressing to the rehabilitation colleges known as 'SHIPS' for a period of around 12-months of psychiatric rehabilitation. Mr Afele was managed with the antipsychotic medication Clopixol Decanoate and a Community Treatment Order, being discharged to Bathurst in 2008.
He has been under the care of the Bathurst Community Mental Health Team over recent years, where his treating psychiatrist is Dr Lumley and his case manager is Margi Tottenham. His CTO was renewed by the Mental Health Review Tribunal every 6-12 months. He ""was still taking Clopixol at a relatively large dose of 300 mg intramuscular injection weekly throughout 2012 and at the time of the events in question before the Court.
There were persistent psychotic symptoms at the time, including the belief that music from the radio and the television was reading his mind and telling him what to do. He believed that the birds were talking to him and was quite superstitious, stating ""It was like if a crow turns up, it means something bad will happen.""
He believed people saying ""See ya"" meant ""See ya when I wanna be you,"" and that ""Catch ya later"" meant he would be ""caught out."" 
He misinterpreted ""Hi"" as meaning ""Hi-5,"" which meant the person wanted him to change, ""because five means change."" Mr Afele also read special in meaning whether people were holding things in their left-hand or right-hand, believing that right-hand was ""pure"" and the left-hand was ""trouble."" His description of such interpretations was highly suggestive of delusions of reference and paranoid thinking at the time, which appears to have been of a chronic and treatment resistant nature. 
He also endorsed hearing a number of 'voices', apparent auditory hallucinations, including, ""We are going to kill you"" and ""You're dead."" The voices were familiar, sounding like his former partner Sonia Jackson's voice.
46In terms of the accused's account of his offending, Dr Furst reported as follows:
He said he heard the voice of the deceased, Steven Chesworth, saying ""You're dead. I'm going to kill you.""
Mr Afele stopped smoking cannabis for around two months at the start of 2013, commencing martial arts training and feeling better in himself. His next-door neighbour painted his lounge room. Mr Afele said, ""I felt weird from the paint. It was a strange feeling."" He then smoked 'Galaxy', which is some form of synthetic cannabis, on the Thursday prior to the events in question (5 days prior).
In relation to the offence in question before the court, Mr Afele said, ""I heard Steve's voice say 'Kill yourself.' I tried to hang myself on the Sunday [two days prior] by wrapping a curtain around the beam near my laundry. I sat down and panicked. I was very paranoid. I thought there was a conspiracy to kill me by people who lived in the flats because I was Samoan. I thought Steve was trying to get rid of me. I heard his voice. He was saying 'Die', 'I'm gonna to kill you' and 'You are dead'.""
Mr Afele was due for his injection of the Clopixol with the Bathurst Mental Health Team on the morning of 05/03/13. He apparently heard Samoan voices on the morning in question telling him, ""You've got to kill him,"" ""He's getting smart,"" and ""You won't see your children unless you kill him,"" which were consistent with Mr Afele experiencing command auditory hallucinations on the day in question. The 'voice' also said 'Kill him or he'll kill you.""
Mr Afele was very paranoid, believing that there was a conspiracy. He had not slept over the previous 4-5 days. He believed that he was going to be killed.
Mr Afele said, ""I just stabbed him... I thought they were going to murder me. I thought I was doing the right thing.""
It would appear that he was compliant with his medication and Community Treatment Order at the time of the events, but his medication was ineffective in controlling his acute psychotic symptoms.""

47Dr Furst noted that at the time of his assessment the accused's treatment team at Long Bay Hospital were in ""the process of the work-up for clozapine, which is a novel atypical antipsychotic, generally reserved for treatment resistant schizophrenia ...""   
48In terms of the accused's mental state at the time of examination, Dr Furst described him as ""noticeably blunted in affect, consistent with a chronic mental illness such as schizophrenia"".  He said that although the accused's psychotic symptoms had diminished, he remained somewhat paranoid.  He said that he was not particularly thought disordered, that he could follow all of the questions put to him, and that he was neither suicidal nor threatening.  Dr Furst also expressed the view that the accused had some insight into his mental illness, and the need for ongoing treatment.
49Having reviewed a number of the statements of witnesses, Dr Furst noted the accused's actions were unprovoked.  He said that that this was consistent with the accused having been paranoid about the victim at the time.  Dr Furst concluded that the accused met the criteria for the following mental and medical conditions:
(i)chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenia; 
(ii)cannabis abuse;
(iii)non-insulin dependent diabetes; and 
(iv)intervertebral disc herniation in the lower back.
50Dr Furst explained that his diagnosis of treatment-resistant schizophrenia had been made on the basis of the history provided, the accused's presentation and a review of medical notes.  He also noted the evidence that the accused had continued to suffer from symptoms of paranoia, auditory hallucinations and mood disturbance over a number of years despite active treatment with anti-psychotic medication and assertive community follow-up.  Dr Furst then said:
""He has been managed as a mentally ill person in custody over recent months, including a work-up for treatment for a psychotic Illness with the antipsychotic medication Clozapine, which is generally reserved for people with treatment resistant illness.
Schizophrenia is a chronic psychotic illness often characterised by delusional beliefs, auditory hallucinations, disorder of thought form, difficulty processing information, mood instability, and bizarre behaviour as a consequence of the illness. There is often a prodromal period in which individuals with the illness feel lethargic, depressed and unable to cope, resulting in disruption to family relationships and poor social functioning. Frequent symptoms include paranoid beliefs, self-referential thinking, grandiose delusions and thought disorder.
Schizophrenia is thought to be biologically driven because of abnormalities in dopamine transmission, differences seen in brain volume and genetic transmission. It usually runs a chronic course requiring hospitalisation during acute episodes and the need for longer-term treatment with antipsychotic medication (tablets or injections). Non-compliance with medication and co-morbid substance abuse are frequent problems when managing this condition. Longer-term psychiatric admissions and rehabilitation are often indicated for treatment resistant schizophrenia, with Clozapine offering a favourable response for a number of people with that condition."" 51Dr Furst concluded that by reference to the criteria set out in R v Presser [1958] VR 45 and R v Kesavarajah (1994) 74 A Crim R 100 the accused was fit to be tried.  In terms of the availability of a defence of mental illness, Dr Furst stated the following:
""Mr Afele presents as a 40-year-old male who has a lengthy history of severe and treatment resistant paranoid schizophrenia. He was suffering from a relapse of his psychotic illness at the time in question before the Court, with evidence of paranoid delusions about ""murders,"" a belief that his own life was in danger, and command auditory hallucinations idling him to kill the victim. It would appear that he believed the victim, Steven Chesworth, was involved in some kind of conspiracy to have him killed, feeling morally justified about his actions at the time of the killing on 05/03/13.
I note that he told police shortly after the offence: ""...just everything got to me... people talking about murder and shit.. .neighbours."" He also cited the need to ""protect myself."" His responses to police were consistent with him being psychotic at the time and were consistent with the history provided by Mr Afele to myself at the time of recent assessment on 12/07/13.
In my opinion, Mr Afele was labouring under a defect of reason in the form of paranoid delusions that involved the victim and was also experiencing command auditory hallucinations. He suffers from severe treatment resistant schizophrenia, which has been recognized at law as a disease of the mind. He was probably aware of his actions but believed that he was doing the right thing when killing the victim and that this was necessary for his own protection, in response to voices he was hearing and paranoid. He has the mental illness defence available to him.""
52Dr Furst also concluded:
""Mr Afele has a serious mental illness and was unaware of the wrongfulness of his actions. He was probably also unable to control himself at the time in question"". 
53Dr Furst recommended that the accused undergo further treatment in the psychiatric hospital at Long Bay.  He concluded by expressing the view that in the event that the accused was found not guilty on the grounds of mental illness, the forensic hospital at Malabar would be the logical progression for him with regular reviews by the Mental Health Review Tribunal and the possible placement (when his condition sufficiently improved) at the Forensic Unit at Bloomfield Hospital.
The evidence of Dr Stephen Allnutt54At the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions Dr Stephen Allnutt, a Forensic Psychiatrist, assessed the accused on 30 September 2013  and provided a report of 13 October 2013.  Dr Allnutt noted that the accused had been previously diagnosed with schizophrenia and recorded the following account of the offending:
""On the Thursday prior to the alleged offence he and the victim painted his house. The victim had brought along with him some synthetic cannabis called Galaxy. The Defendant had smoked about four to five cones. He had got this from the victim.
He stated that having smoked it he started to feel paranoid. He also started to hear voices saying, ""They're going to kill me"". While painting the house with the victim he began to think that the victim wanted to get rid of him. He started to feel panicky.
Over the next few days he was unable to sleep. He had continual paranoia and was hearing voices. He was hearing the voice of the victim saying that he was going to kill the Defendant, that he was a dead man. He heard the voice on a daily basis. He also thought that someone was coming through his house because the carpet had been moved.
On the Sunday before the alleged offence he heard the victim's voice saying kill yourself. The Defendant stated that he grabbed a curtain and put it around his neck. He tried to kill himself he said because he did not want to hurt anyone.
When he watched TV he was experiencing indirect comments from the TV and also from the radio which added to his paranoia. When a song came on the radio he would hear the song say, ""This would be the day that I die"". This made him think that he wanted to die. He thought the victim wanted to kill him so he could get new neighbours. He thought that the victim had been conspiring with everybody in the unit to get rid of him. He thought that people were putting words in his mouth. They were making him say things that he never said and that they wanted to hear. He stated he could read the victim's body language and his body language was negative. At the time he had body language that said he was not ""mutual"".
On the day of the alleged offence he continued to hear the victim's voice saying he was going to kill him. The Defendant stated that he started speaking Samoan. He stated that he himself did not know Samoan so it was somebody putting words in his mouth. At the time he was in his flat, he thought that the victim was going to kill him. He grabbed a knife impulsively. His intention was to hurt the victim because the victim wanted to kill him. He thought killing the victim was going to stop all the voices. He went next door and walked into the house where he was sitting and stabbed him. At the time he was thinking of stabbing everybody else in the house except the woman because he thought they were conspiring against him to get rid of him with the victim. He never trusted anyone.
He then went back to his place. He wiped the blood off the knife. Afterwards he felt bad but he said at the time he thought he was doing the right thing because he thought they wanted to kill him.
Prior to the alleged offence he stated that neighbours were coming to the house and they were speaking about murders all the time and this also added to his idea that he thought they wanted to murder him. He heard Brolly and Kingys' voice also saying they wanted to kill him"".

55Dr Allnutt then turned to the accused's psychiatric history.  He noted (inter alia) that there was a family history of schizophrenia, that the accused had been diagnosed a diabetic, and that he was a regular user of cannabis.56In terms of the accused's mental state at the time of his examination, Dr Allnutt reported:
""He presented as cooperative, well groomed. His speech was clear and coherent. He was mildly over weight. He maintained good eye contact. He did not manifest behaviours suggestive of side effect to psychiatric medication or neurological illness. His affect was somewhat restricted. There was no significant evidence of mood disorder but he did endorse ongoing psychotic symptoms involving perceptual disturbances, ideas of reference and persecutory beliefs. Cognitively he appeared to be intact. His capacity for insight and judgment appeared to be impaired and he appeared to be mildly confused at the time. There was no evidence of suicidal or aggressive ideation, plan or intent.""
57Dr Allnutt expressed the view that the accused manifested symptoms which were consistent with chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenia.  He said that the accused was biologically predisposed to the development of schizophrenia given his family history and concluded that his functioning was mildly to moderately impaired, secondary to ongoing symptoms of psychosis that had diminished to some degree but which nevertheless persisted at time of his assessment.
58In relation to the accused's mental state at the time of the offending, Dr Allnutt reported as follows:
""In my opinion, the Defendant was experiencing ""a disease of the mind"" at the material time of the alleged offence characterised by persecutory beliefs (believing that the victim and others that lived in his environment in his units were conspiring to kill him and that they belonged to a cult), auditory hallucinations (hearing the voice of the victim and others saying that they were going to kill him), referential ideas (believing that the TV and the radio were in some way communicating with him and hearing things like this is the day you are going to die over the radio), probable thought insertion (feeling as if he was being made to speak Samoan by the victim).
There was an exacerbation of psychotic symptoms that had been triggered by the consumption of synthetic cannabis five to six days prior to the alleged offence provided to him by the victim at a time that he and the victim were painting his apartment. While a Drug Induced Psychosis may have formed part of the differential diagnosis, in my view, he has an underlying Schizophrenia, which is a mental illness aggravated by drugs which gave rise to his disease of the mind at the time of the offending.Having regard to the nature of the symptoms he was experiencing ""a defect of reason"" in that his delusional beliefs and perceptual disturbances where causing him to make irrational interpretations about his relationship with the victim and events that were occurring in this environment. His decision making with regard to his actions towards the victim was disturbed by irrational belief system derived from his ""disease of the mind"".
It is unlikely that his disease of the mind was of a nature or severity that it caused him to lose capacity to know the nature and consequence of his actions.
Significant evidence is his account in interview with the police in which he stated that his sole intention was to kill them all because he thought they were going to kill him, due to a conspiracy and they were all in a cult. He maintained position despite repeated attempts by the interviewers to suggest another underlying reason - Steve insulted him or they disrespected him- on each occasion he provided an alternative reason, that due to his voices, and persecutory beliefs at the time he believed that that unless he acted by killing the victim (and others) he was going to be killed.
Based on all evidence, he was significantly compromised in his capacity to know the wrongfulness of his actions from a moral perspective or to reason about the wrongfulness of his actions with a moderate degree of sense of composure. He stated at the time of the alleged offence he thought he was doing the right thing because they were planning to kill him. In this sense within his delusional world he saw his behaviour irrationally as an act of self-defence and thus felt morally justified in doing it at the material time that it happened. On this basis, I would regard him as having a defence of mental illness.""
THE RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS59Part 4 (ss. 37-39) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (""the Act"") makes provision for a defence of mental illness.  Section 37 is in the following terms:
37 Explanation to jury 
If, on the trial of a person charged with an offence, a question is raised as to whether the person was, at the time of commission of the offence, mentally ill as referred to in section 38, the Court must explain to the jury the findings which may be made on the trial and the legal and practical consequences of those findings and must include in its explanation: 
(a) a reference to the existence and composition of the Tribunal, and 
(b) a reference to the relevant functions of the Tribunal with respect to forensic patients, including a reference to the requirements of this Act that the Tribunal may make an order for the release of a person detained in accordance with section 39 only if the Tribunal is satisfied, on the evidence available to it, that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person's release. 
60Section 38 is in the following terms:
38 Special verdict 
(1) If, in an indictment or information, an act or omission is charged against a person as an offence and it is given in evidence on the trial of the person for the offence that the person was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his or her action at the time when the act was done or omission made, then, if it appears to the jury before which the person is tried that the person did the act or made the omission charged, but was mentally ill at the time when the person did or made the same, the jury must return a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness. 
(2) If a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness is returned at the trial of a person for an offence, the Court may remand the person in custody until the making of an order under section 39 in respect of the person. 
61In the event that a special verdict is returned pursuant to s. 38, the provisions of s. 39 then apply:
39 Effect of finding and declaration of mental illness 
(1) If, on the trial of a person charged with an offence, the jury returns a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness, the Court may order that the person be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law or may make such other order (including an order releasing the person from custody, either unconditionally or subject to conditions) as the Court considers appropriate. 
(2) The Court is not to make an order under this section for the release of a person from custody unless it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person's release. 
(3) As soon as practicable after the making of an order under this section, the Registrar of the Court is to notify the Minister for Health and the Tribunal of the terms of the order.
62These various provisions, and their effect, were summarised by Hall J in R v Coleman [2010] NSWSC 177 at [69] and following (and were adopted by me in R v McDonald [2012] NSWSC 875 commencing at [5]):
""The legal and practical consequences of a finding that the accused is not guilty on the ground of mental illness may be shortly stated. 
The statute which governs cases like this, namely, s 39(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, requires me to consider making an order that the accused be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law. In practice, this means not only that the accused remains in custody until a decision is made to release him, but also that he becomes what is known as a forensic patient, and falls under the supervision of a body called the Mental Health Review Tribunal.
The Mental Health Review Tribunal consists of a president and his or her deputy, who must be a lawyer. It also consists of two other persons, one of whom must be a psychiatrist, and the third member is a person who has suitable qualifications or experience for the task.
The tribunal is required to review the accused's case as soon as practicable after an order is made for his detention in strict custody. The tribunal may make orders as to his continued detention, care or treatment, or as to his release.
The tribunal cannot make an order for the release of the accused unless it is satisfied that the safety of that person, or any member of the public, would not be seriously endangered by his release.
The Minister for Health and the Attorney-General may appear before the tribunal, or make submissions to the tribunal, in relation to the possible release of the accused.
Where an order for release is not made, the tribunal orders result in continued detention, care and treatment in a place and in a manner specified by the tribunal.
After the initial review, the tribunal must, at least once every six months, again review the case and make orders as to the accused's continued detention, care or treatment in a hospital, prison, or other place, or as to his release.
If release is ordered, then it may be on conditions or it may be unconditional. If any condition is breached, or where the mental condition of the accused has deteriorated, so that he may be a serious danger to others, a further order may be made by the tribunal for his apprehension, care and detention.
The conditions which could be prescribed include matters such as living in a particular place, taking particular medication, appointments with health care professionals, enrolment in education and therapeutic programs to ensure that the accused is properly cared for.
Other than pursuant to any such release, the accused would remain, as I have said previously, in strict custody within one of the psychiatric institutions caring for forensic patients.
Security conditions (as necessary) are in place while the accused is detained in hospital, prison or other place, or if he is allowed to be temporarily absent from the place of detention.
The accused may be released from these restrictions if given an unconditional release, or where released on conditions and those conditions have expired over time.
However, as I have previously explained, the accused will only ever be released when the Mental Health Review Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence available to it that his safety and the safety of any member of the public will not thereby be seriously endangered.""
THE DEFENCE OF MENTAL ILLNESS - GENERAL PRINCIPLES 63In order to establish a defence on the grounds of mental illness, it must be established that at the time of committing the act causing the deceased's death the accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from a disease of the mind, as to not know the quality and the nature of the act that he was doing or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong (see R v McNaghton (1843) 8 ER 718; R v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182; R v S [1979] 2 NSWLR 1).   
64The test was stated by Dixon J in Porter (supra) at 189-190 in the following terms:
""The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know, in this sense, whether his act was wrong if, through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind, he could not think rationally of the reasons which, to ordinary people make, that act right or wrong? 
If, through the disordered condition of the mind, he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure, it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by wrong? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the every day standards of reasonable people.""
65A disease of the mind is any disease which is capable of affecting the mind, irrespective of whether it has a mental or physical origin and irrespective of whether or not the defect of reason caused is temporary or permanent; see R v Kemp [1957] 1 QB 399.  However, it does not include the transitory effects of some application of an external factor such as violence or drugs or a psychological trauma to an otherwise healthy mind: see R v Falconer (1990) 171 CLR 30.
66A person does not know the nature and quality of his act if he does not know the physical nature of what he is doing or the implications of it (see Porter (supra) at 188).  A person does not know what he was doing was wrong when he does not know that it is wrong according to ordinary standards of right and wrong adopted by reasonable persons: see Stapleton v R (1952) 86 CLR 358 at 367.
67The onus of proving the defence is on the accused, who must prove it on the balance of probabilities: see Mizzi v R (1960) 105 CLR 659.  This is so, regardless of whether it is the Crown, the accused or the court that raises the defence: R v Ayoub [1984] 2 NSWLR 511.
68If the medical evidence relating to the issue of mental illness is unanimous, that evidence cannot be rejected by the tribunal of fact in the absence of other material which casts some doubt on it: see R v Jenkins [1964] NSWR 721; (1963) 64 SR (NSW) 20; 81 WN (Pt 2) (NSW) 44 at 51; Taylor v R (1978) 45 FLR 343; 22 ALR 599; R v Michaux [1984] 2 Qd R 159; 13 A Crim R 173; Tumanako v R (1992) 64 A Crim R 149.69Where there is evidence which raises the defence, the court must firstly consider the elements of the offence with which the accused is charged.  If satisfied that the elements are made out, the court must then proceed to consider the question of whether, having regard to the evidence of mental illness, the accused should be regarded as being criminally responsible for his actions.  
THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES70Senior Counsel for the accused submitted that I would be satisfied on all of the evidence that the accused had committed the crime of murder.  He further submitted that I would be satisfied that the accused had raised the issue of mental illness on and from the time at which he had been taken into custody.  
71Senior counsel submitted that I would be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at the time of killing the deceased, the accused had a relevant disease of the mind, namely schizophrenia, which was not transient, and which was productive of a defect of reason, such that the accused was not able to think rationally at the time.  He also pointed to the fact that the accused had a history of psychosis associated with cannabis use and that such use had been seen to exacerbate his schizophrenic symptoms.  In this regard, he pointed, in particular, to the evidence that the accused had used synthetic cannabis in the days leading up to the offence.  
72Senior counsel further submitted that based upon the entirety of the evidence, I would be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that whilst the accused may have known the nature and quality of his act, he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.  In these circumstances, it was submitted that I would be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the defence of mental illness had been made out.  
73The Crown made no submissions to the contrary of those made on behalf of the accused.  
CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSION74In circumstances where the accused's trial has proceeded before me without a jury, I record the fact that I have had regard to the provisions of s. 37 of the Act.  I have also had regard to the provisions of s. 133 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, and particularly the provisions of s. 133(3) as to the necessity to have regard to any warning which would be required to be given to a jury.    
75I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence of Dr Cala that the deceased died on 5 March 2013 at Bathurst.  
76As I have already noted, the accused made a number of admissions to the police regarding the circumstances in which the deceased was killed.  Having regard to those admissions, and also having regard to the statements of those persons who witnessed the incident, I am satisfied that the accused repeatedly stabbed the deceased.  Having regard to the evidence of Dr Cala, I am satisfied that such stabbing was the cause of the deceased's death.  
77In light of the accused's admissions, and the eyewitness accounts of the incident, I am satisfied that the accused's act of repeatedly stabbing the deceased was voluntary, and was accompanied by an intention to kill the deceased.    
78Having reached those conclusions, I turn to consider the defence of mental illness.  
79The defence of mental illness is clearly raised on the evidence before me.  In circumstances where there is unanimity of opinion as between Dr Allnutt and Dr Furst, and given that there is no evidence to the contrary, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at the time of killing the deceased the accused was suffering from treatment resistant schizophrenia, and that his condition was marked by paranoid delusions and auditory hallucinations.    
80I am further satisfied, having regard to the opinions of Dr Allnutt and Dr Furst, that although the accused knew the nature and quality of his act in killing the deceased, he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.  True it is that in answer to Q. 63 in the interview of 5 March 2013 the accused told police that he understood what he had done wrong.  However, that statement was drawn to the specific attention of Dr Allnutt when giving evidence (at T9 L 4 and following) as well as Dr Furst (at T 17 L10).  Dr Allnutt explained that it was necessary to look at the whole of the evidence and expressed the view that in circumstances where the accused's statement was made after he had been taken into custody, it was clear that he knew that his act was legally wrong.  However, Dr Allnutt confirmed his opinion that on the whole of the evidence the accused did not know that killing the deceased was morally wrong.  Dr Furst (at T17 L15-20) expressed a similar view.  Both Dr Allnutt and Dr Furst expressly stated that the accused's statement to the police did not alter their respective views.  
81Accordingly, for these reasons, I am satisfied that the accused has made out the defence of mental illness on the balance of probabilities. 
82In making the orders that I am about to make, I extend my sympathy to the deceased's family.  The events surrounding the deceased's death have no doubt been troubling and stressful for them, as indeed they would have been for the family of the accused.  
ORDERS83For the foregoing reasons, I make the following orders:
(1)I find the accused, Iusi Afele, not guilty of the murder of Steven Chesworth, on the grounds of mental illness.
(2)I order that the accused be detained, pursuant to s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, in an appropriate correctional centre, or in such facility as the Mental Health Review Tribunal may determine, until he is released by due process of law.
(3)I direct the Registrar to notify the Minister for Health and the Mental Health Review Tribunal of the orders I have made.

2705304,Workcover v Max Tse [2014] NSWDC 229,"Judgment



1The defendant is charged with an offence under s 19 of the Work Health and Safety Act. Under the Act a person conducting a business or undertaking must ensure so far as reasonably practical the health and safety of workers engaged by the person and workers in his activities in carrying out work are influenced and or directed by the person while the workers are at work in the business of undertaking. 

2On 29 February 2012 the defendant, Mr Tse, was carrying out work at private premises at Magnolia Avenue, Epping. By origin he comes from China and he advertised on the web seeking Chinese workers. The workers he was seeking seemed to be students. The injured man was a student at Macquarie University. He is a Chinese national who has returned to China. At the time he was studying to become an interpreter and translator, I would assume from Chinese into English. He appears to have graduated in his course and returned to China. 

3Part of the work Mr Tse was carrying out was general cleaning up of a garden area. Part of the work involved cutting out the stumps of trees. He hired from a hiring company a machine known as an SG350 stump grinder. I have seen photographs and diagrams of this machine. It is operated with a petrol driven motor and has a large blade which cuts out stumps. It looks not unlike a motor lawn mower although somewhat larger and obviously much different sort of blade. The blade itself extends in front of the machine and it obviously is a very dangerous object when the machine is operating. Common sense alone would suggest that no person should go anywhere near the front of the machine when that blade is operating because of the obvious danger of the engine. This man had not done the work with this stump grinder before this day. 

4The defendant has given evidence. I largely accept everything he says in evidence. He himself did the stump grinding. He did not ask the injured man to grind the stump. He required him to assist in pushing the grinder across the terrain and indeed needed assistance from another two men initially to get this grinder up some stairs and into this backyard area. The grinder itself is obviously quite heavy. He himself, that is the defendant, is quite a small slightly built man. He said that the injured man was even smaller. At the time the injury occurred the defendant was attempting to cut a stump which was close to a concrete wall. It was on a slope. The operating instructions for the machine which the defendant says he had downloaded onto his own computer make it plain this machine should be used only on level ground not on slopes. The reason is obvious - because it could run away. 

5 It would be very hard to control a heavy machine like this when the front of it was facing down some sort of slope. 

6His way of dealing with this difficulty, which he knew about, which made this machine not really a suitable machine in the circumstances was to get the injured man, well before he was injured, to put bricks under the wheels. There is a dispute as to what the man was doing at the time he was injured. The injured man claims he was moving in front of the machine to put bricks under the wheels and that is when his trouser leg got caught in the machine and he became injured. The defendant has given evidence that in fact when the machine was not operating at all he had asked the injured man, Mr Luan, again before this injury occurred, to put bricks under the wheels and all that required Mr Yuan to do was to move to his right, put a brick under one wheel and then put a brick under the other wheel just stretching in front of him. At no point would he have been in front of the blade when he did that. There is a dispute between the two of them. Mr Yuan's evidence is by way of statement as he now lives in China. The defendant has given evidence before me today. It is important to resolve the dispute. 

7I cannot be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr Yuan is more correct than the defendant, so I will give the defendant the benefit of the doubt and accept that at a time before the machine was actually operating, he asked Mr Yuan to put bricks under the wheels and he had done that. He then started to operate the machine. He said Mr Yuan at this point was not helping him. He was the one operating the machine. He was aware of how to start it and to stop it. There was a handle on the top of it close to what can be called the frame of the machine. To stop the engine moving the handle is dropped and then the machine is switched off to turn the petrol motor off. Evidence satisfies me as well as the defendant's evidence that if both those steps are taken the blade will rotate for a period that has been estimated by an inspector who checked it in the presence of the hiring company the motor would rotate for some 15 to 16 seconds. So even if the machine is turned off instantly that blade is still moving around and could cut someone. That is the nature of this type of rotary engine, it just happens that way. 

8He was aware of the steps that could be taken to turn the engine off. He did not specifically warn Mr Yuan not to walk in front of him. He did not warn him that he should not be wearing loose clothing. Indeed he had supplied him out of the goodness of his heart I take it with some wet weather gear that included some loose plastic style trousers that covered his ordinary clothes. The defendant said that what happened was without warning and to his surprise Mr Yuan went out into the front of the machine, walking quite close to it and got caught by the machine with the sad result that his leg was dragged into the machine and despite him turning off the machine obviously it was mangled. His leg was badly damaged and that required hospitalisation. Section 32 of the Work Health and Safety Act says a person who commits a category 2 offence he has a health and safety duty and he fails to comply with that duty and the failure exposes an individual to a risk of death or serious injury or illness. Clearly enough this man was exposed to such a risk, it materialised and he suffered serious injury. I accept that the defendant did not foresee this. I am not using the test that would be applied in a court of law if someone were suing, but as a matter of the way he looked at things, he did not think, did not foresee that Mr Yuan would walk around in front of him into the path of the blades. He himself was the only person operating the machine. Mr Yuan did assist him to push it, he did assist him in certain other ways of using the machine but they are not material to the way in which he was injured. Mr Yuan was not working the machine at the time he was injured and on the evidence of the defendant he was not doing anything at his request at the time he was injured rather without warning he walked out in front of the machine and then into the path of the blade. I am prepared to accept the evidence of the defendant in this instance in preference to that of Mr Yuan because there is a conflict between them and I think, having seen him give evidence, that his evidence seems to be believable and I accept it. 

9However the fact that he did not believe anybody would be so silly as to walk out in front of a moving machine and into the path of a blade does not absolve him from liability under this Act. His duty was to ensure this man was not put at risk while this work was being carried out. What that meant him doing in real terms was very simple. He had a duty to explain to him the dangers of the machine even if they appeared to be perfectly obvious to him what they were. He then had a duty to tell him that when he the defendant was operating the machine Mr Yuan should not walk forward of him at all. He should stay no further than directly beside his side, he should not walk forward while that machine was operating. It might seem like giving advice to a child saying something that is so obvious. Nevertheless, it should have been done. Not every person engaging in practical work thinks in a practical manner and he was in charge of this job and had a duty to make sure this worker was told about the dangers of the machine even if he thought it was obvious that they were and he had a duty to tell the worker by way of simple instructions that he must not walk forward of him. Had he done that, had he taken those simple steps, explaining the dangers of the machine and told him not to walk forward then this accident could not have happened. Whilst I can understand how he is very puzzled by the actions of the worker and thinks that he acted in a rather silly fashion that was his duty and he did not carry it out therefore I find the offence proved.

HIS HONOUR: Now is there anything known of the--

SCOTT: Nothing known.

HIS HONOUR: All right now what I have done is I have found that this offence has been proved. You can now speak to me about what penalty you say should or should not be imposed. The maximum penalty, because you are an individual, I think is 150,000.



SCOTT: No it is 300 he was engaged in a business activity.



HIS HONOUR: I see, you are quite right. The maximum penalty is $300,000. That does not mean I would impose a penalty of $300,000. It would be the most extreme case that would cause me to impose a penalty of $300,000. I need to know something about you.



HIS HONOUR: How old are you?



DEFENDANT: Forty three.



HIS HONOUR: Are you still conducting this business?



DEFENDANT: Yes.



HIS HONOUR: Have you any other source of income?



(No verbal reply)



HIS HONOUR: Have you anyone who is dependant on you, a wife, children or anybody else, parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, anyone?



DEFENDANT: My two sons.



HIS HONOUR: Two sons and how old are they?



DEFENDANT: Seven years old and five.



HIS HONOUR: Have you a wife or not?



DEFENDANT: Divorced.



HIS HONOUR: What sort of income do you have?



DEFENDANT: I just come back for work, I got an injury 25 December, Christmas day. My right hand is punctured by a sting ray and then stay at a hospital until January and then I just come back for work.



HIS HONOUR: So you were injured while you were swimming somewhere?

DEFENDANT: Yeah.



HIS HONOUR: Terrible injury. I know a man got killed a few years ago by a sting ray. So you were off work for sometime because of that injury?



DEFENDANT: Yes.



HIS HONOUR: Do you own a house?



DEFENDANT: No.



HIS HONOUR: Pay rent?



DEFENDANT: At the moment my friend tell me doesn't need to pay rent.



HIS HONOUR: Pardon?



DEFENDANT: I have a friend to help me doesn't need to pay the rent at the moment.



HIS HONOUR: Is there anything else you want to put to me about the size of any penalty?

(No verbal reply)



HIS HONOUR: Just sit down for a minute. Mr Prosecutor what do you want to say? Is there anything you want to put forward, any material, other cases or anything else?



SCOTT: The fact is that section 6 of the Fines Act would apply with the circumstances of the defendant. The fine must obviously meet the circumstances of the defendant. We wouldn't press for anything that would be onerous in that regard.



HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Tse there is an act called the Fines Act and what it says is that no gaol sentence should be imposed because all I can do is impose a fine. There are no gaol sentences, there are no other sentences. Although 300,000 is the maximum figure as I said that would only be applied in very unusual circumstances for a very serious offender. Section 6 of the Fines Act says that I have to have regard to the means of the accused. So I have to have regard to whatever I have which show your capacity to pay a fine. So I cannot just go and give you a huge fine because I feel like it, I have to have regard to whether you can pay a fine. You have not been working for some months now I take it.



DEFENDANT: Yes.



HIS HONOUR: You are dependant on a friend for helping you out.



DEFENDANT: Yes.



HIS HONOUR: You have got two sons to support.



DEFENDANT: Yes.



HIS HONOUR: In the circumstances in my opinion this calls for a conviction and a fine of $500 and that is what I impose.

SCOTT: We would ask for costs.

HIS HONOUR: Do you know what they are likely to be?

SCOTT: Sorry.

HIS HONOUR: Have you any idea what they are likely to be?

SCOTT: A couple of thousand dollars I'm instructed with time to pay. We haven't got a precise figure.



HIS HONOUR: Now do you understand I have also been asked to make an order that you pay the prosecution's costs. You are entitled to ask for time to pay, you do not have to pay all this today or tomorrow. The costs should be as agreed or assessed. If you cannot pay the $500 fine you can ask the Registrar of the Criminal Registry of the District Court for time to pay. You have got to understand if you are running a business and you are using dangerous equipment the law imposes duties upon you even though you think any sensible person would not commit an injury to himself you cannot assume people are sensible. Some people are plain stupid. I am not criticising the man who was injured, I am not saying he is plain stupid but some people are and you still have a duty towards them.



10HIS HONOUR: The order of the court is that the defendant be convicted and is to pay a fine of $500 plus the costs of the prosecution. Those costs to be assessed.

		11 December 2014",2014-03-25 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705311,State of NSW v Scott [2014] NSWSC 276,"Judgment
Introduction
1By summons filed on 26 November 2013, the State of New South Wales applies for a Continuing Detention Order (CDO) or Extended Supervision Order (ESO) in respect of Terrence Scott pursuant to the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act). 
2On 14 March 2007 Mr Scott entered a plea of guilty to offences of sexual intercourse without consent and maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm (the index offences). The index offences were committed on 27 May 2006 when he was 23 years old and on parole. Norrish DCJ sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of seven years six months, expiring 29 December 2013, with a non-parole period of three years nine months expiring on 29 March 2010. When his sentence expired on 29 December 2013, he had not been released on parole. He is now 31 years of age.
3The victim of the index offences was a 19-year old university student in Wagga.  She was walking along a street at about midday, when Mr Scott pulled over in a car and got out and followed her into a shop. When she left the shop, Mr Scott approached her and asked for directions. She continued walking and he followed her. He then grabbed her from behind on her right shoulder and forced her towards a fence. The complainant yelled, ""Get off me"", and started struggling.  Mr Scott grabbed hold of her vagina and penetrated her with his fingers, through her clothing. He said: ""If you keep screaming, I'll wreck your pussy"".  The victim tried to scratch Mr Scott, who hit her across the back of the head three or four times.  She continued screaming. He put his hands over her mouth and nose and she bit down on one of his fingers. Then he used his left hand to grab her left breast and then squeezed her right breast.  Mr Scott pushed her toward the ground and punched her left eye. At this point the victim ran away and alerted a nearby resident. The police were called. She was treated at Wagga Wagga Base Hospital for a number of injuries to her face.
4Mr Scott has remained in custody since his arrest on 30 June 2006.  He became eligible for parole on 29 March 2010.  It was initially refused. Later Mr Scott declined to apply for parole. His explanation was: ""I don't want parole on my back. I'll only end up breaching. It will be easier doing my whole time.""
5Justice Davies made an interim detention order (IDO) on 10 December 2013, which commenced on 29 December 2013, being the expiry of Mr Scott's sentence: State of New South Wales v Scott [2013] NSWSC 1834. The order has been extended for the maximum period of three months. As at the date of this judgment, Mr Scott remains in custody pursuant to the IDO. Section 18C(2) of the Act provides that an interim detention order may be renewed from time to time, but not so as to provide for the detention of the offender under such an order for periods totalling more than 3 months. Accordingly, Mr Scott is entitled to be released from custody on 28 March 2014 if no CDO is made in respect of him.
6The Act lists matters to be taken into account when determining whether a CDO or ESO ought be made. Rather than addressing these matters in order, I propose to set out the facts in a narrative form before considering the factors relevant to whether an order, and if so which order, ought be made.
The Facts
7The facts set out below have been derived from the following evidence:
(1)Affidavits of Paul Nash (solicitor from Crown Solicitor's Office) dated 25 November 2013 and 6 December 2013 and Exhibits PN-1, PN-2 and PN-3;
(2)Affidavit of Meagan Donaldson (clinical and forensic psychologist) dated 28 February 2014 and Exhibit MD-1;
(3)Affidavit of Kim Ward (the manager of the Nunyara Community Offender Support Program) dated 28 February 2014;
(4)Affidavit of Sharon Castellino (who works for the NSW Department of Family and Community Services in the Community Justice Program (CJP)) dated 28 February 2014;
(5)Affidavit of Zoumier Abedine (the manager of the ESO Team in Community Corrections) dated 28 February 2014;
(6)Dr Emma Collins (court-appointed expert psychologist) - Report dated 23 January 2014;
(7)Dr Jeremy O'Dea (court-appointed expert psychiatrist) - Report dated 18 February 2014.
Mr Scott's background and intellectual disability
8Mr Scott was born on 23 August 1982. His father was absent throughout his childhood. His mother, who abused alcohol, neglected him. He attended school until about year 8. From an early age he, too, abused alcohol. He also sniffed petrol and used cannabis. These substances permanently damaged his developing brain. From the time he was 17, he was diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia and substance abuse. He has a long-standing history of non-compliance with medication. He has an intellectual disability. His IQ has been assessed as 53, which is in the extremely low range of intellectual functioning.  His low IQ arises from the organic brain damage referred to above. He has refused assessments in recent years.
Mr Scott's history of offending
9Mr Scott has a lengthy history of non-sexual criminality commencing from the age of 14. His prior offences included: assault, robbery, and drug (marijuana) offences.  His mental illness has played a significant role: it has caused disinhibition and compromised his ability to control himself or foresee the consequences to himself and others of his actions. On at least three occasions, charges against Mr Scott were dismissed under the Mental (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) on the grounds of mental illness.
10Mr Scott has a history of breaching bail conditions, community treatment orders and parole as illustrated by the following chronology of the two years preceding the index offences. In April 2004 he breached his bail conditions by continuing to use cannabis.  On 7 October 2004 he breached parole by failing to return to the Percy Green Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre as directed. His parole was revoked on 22 October 2004. He was released on parole again on 10 February 2005 with a direction that he satisfactorily complete the drug rehabilitation programme at the Percy Green Centre. On 24 April 2005 he was discharged from the programme because he smoked marijuana and was violent to other residents. He subsequently tested positive to cannabis and admitted to using substitute urine when subject to drug testing. His parole was revoked on 3 June 2005. On 21 March 2006, Mr Scott was released again on parole. On 24 May 2006, he assaulted his mother, with whom he was living.  He was arrested and charged, and an AVO taken out to protect his mother. On 26 May 2006 he was discharged under s. 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act on condition that he comply with the conditions of a care plan which included taking his medication.
The index offences and immediate aftermath
11On 27 May 2006, Mr Scott committed the index offences. Although his conduct was, to some extent, impulsive, in that there appears to have been little planning, his acts were nonetheless persistent and deliberate. They involved considerable violence towards the victim, who was fearful, alarmed and suffered physical injury. 
12On 3 June 2006, a week after the index offences, Mr Scott assaulted his mother and grandmother, breached an AVO and committed property offences, for which he was convicted on 4 June 2006 and placed on a bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act 1999.
13On 30 June 2006, Mr Scott was arrested for the index offences.
The views of the sentencing judge
14Norrish DCJ, the sentencing judge, accepted that Mr Scott was not taking his medication at the time and that he was suffering from a significant long-term mental disorder. His Honour noted that his conduct on this occasion was:""a major and significant elevation of the level of anti-social conduct...It suggests that the prisoner is a person who does present as a possible or probable danger to other people and the facts of this case are eloquent testament to that position...""
15Norrish DCJ observed that it was:""not much consolation to the community that the likelihood of the prisoner to behave in this violent way may be entirely dependent upon whether he chooses to maintain himself on his medication"". 
Misconduct in prison
16Mr Scott has incurred 29 institutional misconducts since his incarceration in 2007, 11 of which involved violence. On 23 August 2013 Mr Scott threatened another inmate with a plastic knife to have sex with him and hit the inmate because he was making too much noise. He received an institutional misconduct conviction for assault.
17Prison documents record that on 8 December 2006 Mr Scott said that he was really glad he raped and bashed his victim and he did not regret it because it felt really good at the time he was doing it. The degree of exaggeration and bravado that is evidenced in this statement is consistent with his mental illness.
18During a search of Mr Scott's cell on 26 February 2009, two diaries were found which contained written descriptions of violent and non-consensual sex with detailed plans to carry out such acts once released. During a subsequent search of Mr Scott's cell conducted on 11 February 2011, handwritten documents were found which contained confused and rambling descriptions of sexual acts.
Mr Scott's participation in treatment for sex offenders and other treatment received in prison
19There are various treatment programmes that are available to prisoners. I accept the evidence of Dr O'Dea, the court-appointed expert, that Mr Scott would not able to participate in any of them because of his compromised intelligence. 
20On 28 July 2011 Mr Scott was transferred to the mental health unit at Long Bay Hospital pursuant to an order under s. 55(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. The order was made due to a significant deterioration in Mr Scott's mental state, his refusal to take medication and his assault of another inmate. He remained there until the order was revoked on 16 August 2011. However, a further order to the same effect was made on 14 September 2011, for similar reasons. The Mental Health Review Tribunal on 3 November 2011 reviewed the order and determined that Mr Scott remained mentally ill and should continue to be detained in a mental health facility. On 16 April 2012 he was transferred back to Junee Correctional Centre, as he was assessed as no longer mentally ill.
Assistance with provision of post-release accommodation
21On 25 November 2009 Mr Scott said that when he was released he would prefer to reside independently but would consider living with his mother in Leeton if necessary. In December 2009 Mr Scott reported that his mother did not want him to live with her and that he could live in Goulburn, although he did not know anyone there. He suggested that he could obtain accommodation through the local paper. 
22Mr Scott's mother's home was assessed as being marginally suitable following a home visit on 17 December 2009. At that point the assessing officer became concerned about the management of Mr Scott's mental health and intellectual disability after his release, as well as the problems that could arise from the inability to control his sexual drive arising from his mental incapacity. 
23On 22 March 2011, State-wide Disability Services (SDS) asked Mr Scott to sign forms consenting to exchange client information in order to obtain a referral to Ageing Disability and Home Care (ADHC) for case management services. Mr Scott refused to sign the consent form. On 18 February 2013, SDS applied to the Guardianship Tribunal for orders in relation to Mr Scott. The evidence does not explain the reason for the delay. On 23 June 2013, the Guardianship Tribunal made an order appointing the Public Guardian as Mr Scott's guardian for a period of 5 months, with the guardian's functions expressed to be limited to deciding accommodation (where Mr Scott resides), advocacy, and making decisions about legal services and other services to be provided to Mr Scott.  On 26 November 2013, the Guardianship Tribunal renewed the order for a further 12 months. Representatives from the Public Guardian were present in court throughout the hearing of the Crown's application in order to give instructions to Mr Scragg, who appeared for Mr Scott. Mr Scott was also present throughout.
24The Public Guardian authorised SDS to seek to obtain a referral to ADHC for Mr Scott. On 29 October 2013, an ADHC referral was completed and sent to CJP to determine Mr Scott's eligibility for services and accommodation in the community. 
25The CJP is a community-based program run by ADHC for people such as Mr Scott with an intellectual disability who have been incarcerated, who are likely to place themselves or others at serious risk of harm, and who present a level of complexity that requires services beyond those which ADHC normally provides.  The primary aim of the CJP is to minimise recidivism rates and enable appropriate community integration for this group of people.
26CJP offers, to people assessed as requiring high support, accommodation known as Intensive Residential Support (IRS), which amounts to 24-hour support for clients with very high support needs. IRS provides a closely supervised home environment, in which it is possible to separate one or more residents into different living spaces. IRS services are usually large houses with two living spaces and some separation from neighbours. IRS can provide substantial levels of behaviour support with a view to understanding, managing and reducing offending and other challenging behaviours. I am satisfied that the IRS offered by CJP is the most suitable accommodation available for Mr Scott at times when he is not an in-patient in a psychiatric hospital.
The prospects of Mr Scott obtaining IRS from CJP
27At its meeting on 5 February 2014, the CJP Referral and Assessment Panel recommended Mr Scott be regarded as eligible for CJP. The director of CJP endorsed its recommendation.  The assessment is thorough and careful and takes about 6 to 8 weeks.  On the basis of the assessment an accommodation placement and service model is determined having regard to the person's strengths, needs, risks and goals, as well as availability of vacancies and support, priority and resources. Once approved, the relevant service provider is approached and staff trained, upon which service to the client can be commenced. 
28The assessment process for Mr Scott began on 21 February 2014.  It is unlikely there will be a support model available by the end of March 2014. The CJP does not provide an emergency response service. Ms Castellino expects a support model to be available for Mr Scott by June 2014.
Expert evidence
Ms Donaldson: psychologist
29Ms Donaldson, psychologist, prepared a report on 8 November 2013, following a risk assessment of Mr Scott conducted on 4 and 6 November 2013 for the purposes of these proceedings. Ms Donaldson remarked on the difficulty she encountered in distinguishing the effects of Mr Scott's intellectual disability from his mental health and the impact the presence of both have on Mr Scott. Whereas compliance with medication might lead to improved mental health, it would not ameliorate the effects of his intellectual impairment.  She opined that his level of intellectual understanding and chronic mental illness affected his capacity to make informed decisions, which led him to reject supervision and treatment.
30Ms Donaldson discussed the index offence with Mr Scott. He acknowledged he sexually assaulted the victim and the level of intrusiveness and violence involved. He said he knew what he did was wrong and he should not have done it.  He was not aware of risk factors that contributed to the index offences.  He stated that 'life was good at the time', living with his mother and smoking cannabis. He was unable to identify how he was going to manage his risk in future. He did not link his substance use with his risk. 
31Ms Donaldson undertook an assessment of the risk posed by Mr Scott. She noted Mr Scott's score of 6 on STATIC 99  (an actuarial risk assessment tool which uses static (unchangeable) risk factors to calculate the risk of reoffending, such as number of prior charges/convictions, unrelated/stranger/male victims etc). A score of 6 and above places Mr Scott in the high risk category relative to other male sexual offenders. The rates of sexual recidivism for sexual offenders within normative samples who had the same total score as Mr Scott were between 14.7 - 31.2 percent over five years, and 26.7 - 41.9 percent over ten years. The recidivism rates of individuals convicted/charged with sexual offences with the same score as Mr Scott would be expected to be over 3.77 times higher than the ""typical"" sexual offender as identified in the same population.  Ms Donaldson noted that the use of STATIC 99 has not been specifically validated for use with offenders with intellectual disabilities.  
32Ms Donaldson also considered the dynamic risk presented by Mr Scott. She noted that Mr Scott's sex offending is not considered chronic since it is effectively confined to the index offence and some misconduct in gaol. The risk posed by him is largely explained by his poor self-awareness, limited insight into his disability, mental health and concomitant lack of inhibition.
33Ms Donaldson considered that if Mr Scott was to return to a similar way of life as before his imprisonment he would be highly likely to reoffend. The relevant factors are: the limited structure, unstable accommodation, non-compliance with medication, use of illicit drugs, being unresponsive to supervision and feeling sexually aroused in circumstances that lead to sexual preoccupation. Ms Donaldson opined that any recidivism would be likely to be opportunistic against an adult female on her own. He was likely to use physical violence. 
34Ms Donaldson considered Mr Scott's primary difficulty to be managing his mental health in the community where non-compliance with medication and substance abuse could lead to further offending.  Ms Donaldson noted that if Mr Scott was subject to an ESO, it was likely that he would be subject to intensive supervision and case management by Corrective Services NSW and recommended that there be consultation with the Community Forensic Mental Health Team to determine what options are available to assist Mr Scott manage his mental health in the community.
Court-appointed expert reports 
35Pursuant to orders made by the Court under s 15(4) of the Act, Dr O'Dea (psychiatrist) and Dr Collins (clinical and forensic psychologist) were appointed to provide reports to the Court.  They both gave evidence at the hearing. Dr O'Dea returned to court on the second day of the hearing as he had further reflected on the evidence he had given and considered that it required further explanation.
Dr O'Dea
36Dr O'Dea interviewed Mr Scott on 30 December 2013. He considered his presentation to be superficially cooperative although he was readily aroused, frustrated and irritable. Dr O'Dea considered Mr Scott to be suffering severe chronic treatment resistant schizophrenic illness, complicated by alcohol and other drug abuse and dependence and intellectual impairment. In his view Mr Scott's general and sexual offending behaviour may be understood in the context of disinhibited expressions of his anger, aggression, and sexual urges, related to his schizophrenic illness, intellectual disability and substance use. 
37At the time of the interview, 30 December 2013, Dr O'Dea considered that Mr Scott's schizophrenia was not under adequate control and he was a ""mentally ill person"" within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 2007 (NSW). As such, Dr O'Dea opined that he needed ongoing psychiatric treatment in a secure psychiatric hospital prior to discharge and ongoing psychiatric treatment under a Community Treatment Order (CTO), in order to adequately and appropriately manage the risk he poses of serious harm to others.
38In his report, Dr O'Dea opined that, due to Mr Scott's psychiatric needs, it was more appropriate to manage Mr Scott's ongoing risk of harm to others under the Mental Health Act rather than the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act. However, he considered there to be a significant risk that Mr Scott will commit further sex offences in the community in the long term and that it was unlikely that psychological therapy alone would be sufficient to mitigate this risk. Dr O'Dea said in his report:""the above comprehensive psychiatric treatment program followed by psychiatric treatment in the community under the provisions of a CTO, and in conjunction with CJP as appropriate at the time, is likely to prove the most appropriate and effective intervention in managing and minimising Mr Scott's risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours in the community in the longer term.""
 ""Mr Scott's risk of engaging in further serious sex offending behaviours and committing a further serious sex offence, in the community in the long term, would be considered significantly high and appropriate for specific psychiatric treatment as outlined above.""  
39In his oral evidence, Dr O'Dea refined his opinion. He said that in his view, Mr Scott was not sufficiently mentally stable to be released into the community to IRS run by CJP although this would be the most suitable option if Mr Scott became mentally stable. He said that accommodation within a secure psychiatric hospital under the Mental Health Act would be the most appropriate way of managing Mr Scott's risk to the community and ensuring that he obtains the treatment and stability that he requires. Dr O'Dea considered that it would not necessarily be sufficient for there to be a CTO in force in respect of Mr Scott and that it would be desirable that an ESO be in place in order to provide sufficient supervision and structure for Mr Scott.
40Dr O'Dea proposed that Mr Scott ought be admitted to a psychiatric hospital as a ""correctional patient"" under the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act while still subject to the IDO and that his status could be changed to an ""involuntary patient"" under the Mental Health Act when the IDO expired. 
Dr Collins
41Dr Collins interviewed Mr Scott on 20 January 2014. He displayed poor social behaviour, his affect was blunted and  refused to participate in psychometric testing. Dr Collins concurred with the risk assessment of Ms Donaldson (using Static-99R and another risk assessment tool known as RSVP). She assessed Mr Scott using the Assessment of Risk and Manageability of Intellectually Disabled Individuals who Offend Sexually (ARMADILLO-S). She opined that Mr Scott is a high-risk sex offender with  a medium-high to high risk of sexual reoffending.
42Dr Collins was of opinion that Mr Scott ought attempt offence-specific treatment as a priority. I do not accept this view. I accept Dr O'Dea's assessment that Mr Scott does not have the intellectual capacity to benefit from such treatment. In these circumstances I do not consider there to be any utility in requiring such treatment to be undertaken. 
43I accept Dr Collins' opinion that any ESO ought include conditions that provide for support in his accommodation, pro-social engagement in activities as well as substance abuse monitoring and intervention.
The applicable law
The Act
44Section 3 of the Act provides:Objects of Act(1)  The primary object of this Act is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of high risk sex offenders and high risk violent offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community.(2)  Another object of this Act is to encourage high risk sex offenders and high risk violent offenders to undertake rehabilitation.
45This protective purpose is fundamental: Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Gallagher [2006] NSWSC 340 at [21]; Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Quinn [2007] NSWSC 873 at [10]; Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119 at [10]. The legislative purpose of the Act is protective, not punitive.
46Section 5 defines ""serious sex offence"". Mr Scott is a  ""serious sex offender"" as he is presently serving a sentence following conviction for offences against s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900.
47Section 5B provides:High risk sex offender(1)  An offender can be made the subject of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order or a high risk sex offender continuing detention order as provided for by this Act if and only if the offender is a high risk sex offender.(2)  An offender is a high risk sex offender if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.(3)  The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence.
48In Cornwall v Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 374 the Court of Appeal said at [21]:""The expression ""a high degree of probability"" indicates something ""beyond more probably than not""; so that the existence of the risk, that is the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, does have to be proved to a higher degree than the normal civil standard of proof, though not to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt...""
49Section 5C confers power on this Court to make an extended supervision order in respect of a high risk sex offender. Section 5D empowers the Court to make a continuing detention order if the offender is a high risk sex offender and the Court is satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order.
50Implicit in s 5C is that the supervision imposed by an ESO is sufficient to counter what would otherwise be an ""unacceptable risk"". Where supervision imposed by an ESO would be inadequate to manage what would otherwise be an unacceptable risk, a CDO ought be made: s 5D.  Supervision can only be regarded as ""adequate"" if it is effective to reduce the risk such that the offender no longer poses an unacceptable risk.
51Section 9 provides that the following are to be taken into account in determining whether to make an ESO:  (a)  the safety of the community,(b)  the reports received from the persons appointed under section 7 (4) [court-appointed experts] to conduct examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender's participation in any such examination,(c)  the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further relevant offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender's participation in any such assessment,(d)  the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further relevant offence,. . .(e)  any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender's participation in any such programs,(f)  the level of the offender's compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order,. . .(h)  the offender's criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history,(h1)  the views of the sentencing court at the time the sentence of imprisonment was imposed on the offender,(i)  any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature (in the case of an application for a high risk sex offender extended supervision order) or serious violence offences (in the case of an application for a high risk violent offender extended supervision order).
52Section 10 provides that an ESO can be made for a total of five years. Section 10A provides for interim supervision orders (ISO) to be made in certain circumstances. 
53Section 11 provides for the conditions that may be imposed on an ESO. 
54Section 13A provides that the State may apply for a CDO in respect of offenders, including a high risk offender. The application may be determined by making an ESO, a CDO or by dismissing the application. The relevant matters are listed in s 17(4) and replicate those in s 9 for making an ESO.
55Section 18A authorises the Court to make an IDO if the offender's current custody will expire before the proceedings are determined and an ESO or CDO would be justified, if the matters alleged in the supporting documentation were proved.
56Section 18D provides that an ESO ceases to have an effect during the operation of a CDO or IDO. Section 19 provides that a detention order may be varied or revoked.
57These proceedings are to be conducted as civil proceedings: s 21.
58Section 25B provides that nothing in the Act prevents this Court from making an ESO in respect of a person at the same time as it makes a CDO in respect of such person. The ESO, in that event, commences on the expiry of the CDO.
The Mental Health Act and the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act
59Because of the potential relevance of the Mental Health Act and the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, some brief reference to their provisions ought be made.
60Section 14(1) of the Mental Health Act relevantly defines ""mentally ill persons"" as follows:(1)  A person is a mentally ill person if the person is suffering from mental illness and, owing to that illness, there are reasonable grounds for believing that care, treatment or control of the person is necessary: (a)  for the person's own protection from serious harm, or(b)  for the protection of others from serious harm.

61Section 18(1)(a) of the Mental Health Act provides that a person may be detained in a declared mental health facility on a mental health certificate given by a medical practitioner or accredited person. Section 19(4)(a) provides that a mental health certificate may not be used to admit or detain a person certified to be a mentally ill person in a facility more than 5 days after it is given.
62Section 42 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act defines ""forensic patients"" as including, relevantly, a person who is detained in a mental health facility, correctional centre or other place. As Mr Scott has served his sentence of imprisonment, he is a ""forensic patient"", rather than a ""correctional patient"". Section 64  provides that a correctional patient ceases to be a correctional patient if the person's sentence of imprisonment expires.
63The Director-General may, by order pursuant to s 55 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, transfer a person imprisoned in a correctional centre to a mental health facility on the basis of two certificates about the person's condition issued by two medical practitioners, one of whom is a psychiatrist. Section 56 provides for the person to be transferred back to the correctional centre in certain circumstances.
64Section 67 provides for the making of community treatment orders by the Mental Health Review Tribunal.
The proposal that Mr Scott be transferred to a psychiatric hospital prior to his release to CJP accommodation
65Dr O'Dea initially expressed the opinion that Mr Scott could be more appropriately dealt with under the Mental Health Act, since he is a ""mentally ill"" person who requires ongoing psychiatric treatment in a secure psychiatric hospital. 
66Dr O'Dea, however, ultimately considered that a regime under the Mental Health Act, even if it was be invoked and implemented, is not apt to address that risk sufficiently. Dr O'Dea suggested that Mr Scott be admitted to a psychiatric hospital under s 55 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act until he is mentally stable, at which point he could be transferred to IRS provided by CJP and subject to an ESO. Dr O'Dea said that the psychiatric hospital most appropriate to Mr Scott would be the forensic hospital next to Long Bay Gaol. As Dr O'Dea was appointed by the court to give expert opinion, and does not, therefore, play any role in Mr Scott's treatment, it would not be appropriate that he provide a certificate under s 55. Such certificate would, in the normal course, be provided by a person's treating psychiatrist.
67On 14 March 2014 I adjourned the proceedings to 19 March 2014 in order that this possibility raised could be investigated and the views of his treating psychiatrist, Dr Henderson, ascertained. Although Dr Henderson is Mr Scott's treating psychiatrist, he has only seen Mr Scott once, on 7 March 2014, following his admission to the mental health facility of the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre known as the Hamden Clinic. Dr Henderson also reviewed Mr Scott's medical records since in custody.
68After considering Dr O'Dea's report (but not the transcript of his evidence) and speaking with Dr O'Dea, Dr Henderson affirmed an affidavit on 18 March 2014 in which he deposed that he would not support Mr Scott's transfer to the forensic hospital next to Long Bay Gaol pursuant to s 55. The reasons for his opinion were twofold. First, Dr Henderson considered Mr Scott to be presently compliant with his medications, to be generally co-operative with psychiatric treatment and to have a stable mental state. Secondly, Dr Henderson learned that Mr Scott could undertake offence-specific treatment for persons with mental impairment and thought that he would benefit from such treatment while in custody.
69Dr Henderson was required for cross-examination. In the course of his oral evidence Dr Henderson deferred to Dr O'Dea's opinion that Mr Scott would not be able to undertake offence-specific treatment, even such treatment as was modified so that people with mental impairment could undertake it. Dr Henderson also explained that his objection to a s 55 transfer was based on the proposition that Mr Scott was not a ""mentally ill person"" within the meaning of s 14(1) of the Mental Health Act while he was in custody because the conditions of his incarceration were such as to mean that he was not in need of protection from serious harm and that others did not need protection from him.
70When it was put to Dr Henderson that Mr Scott might be released into the community, he accepted that, in those circumstances, he would fall within the definition of ""mentally ill person"" and that it would be appropriate to make an order for his transfer to the forensic hospital next to Long Bay prison under s 55. He said that he would, as Mr Scott's treating psychiatrist, sign a certificate in the form required by s 55 and that he would expect that a transfer would ensue. Dr Henderson also said that he would expect the hospital not to discharge Mr Scott into the community until suitable accommodation was available.
71Since this evidence was given, events have transpired which mean that I can have no confidence that Mr Scott will be transferred to the forensic hospital next to Long Bay prison pursuant to s 55 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act. Although I consider, on the material available to me that such a transfer would be desirable, I have no power to order it to occur. 
The threshold question
72I am satisfied on the basis of the following matters that the Crown has established to a high degree of probability that Mr Scott poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if not kept under supervision:
(1)Mr Scott has a history of violence and other offences - the index offence was highly opportunistic - it was a violent sexual assault committed in broad day light on a street against a female stranger. 
(2)Mr Scott suffers from chronic schizophrenia and substance abuse and has a lengthy history of failing to comply with medication.
(3)Mr Scott cannot undertake offence-specific treatment because of his low intellect.
(4)Mr Scott has a lengthy history of failing to comply with bail and parole which I am satisfied is a reflection of his low intellect and poor insight.
(5)The uncontroverted opinions of Dr O'Dea, Dr Collins and Ms Donaldson as to the risk he poses.
Whether a CDO ought be made and on what terms
73In determining whether to make a CDO or ESO, the Court must consider each of the matters listed in s 9 and s 17(4) of the Act as well as any other matters considered relevant.  Each of these matters has been addressed above in the narrative of facts. 
74I consider that the safety of the community (the primary object of the Act) will be compromised if no order is made under the Act. Although the index offences are the only sex offences of which Mr Scott has been convicted, he has displayed a continuing pattern of highly antisocial behaviour. The index offences were opportunistic and involved a significant level of violence, in broad daylight on a public street against a female stranger. The material found in his cell in February 2009 suggests a continued appetite for violent and non-consensual sex and indicates some level of sexual pre-occupation. Mr Scott's mental health has been implicated in most of his offending history. He has a history of poor compliance with his medication. He has repeatedly failed to comply with supervision imposed (in particular, committing offences whilst on bail or parole) and his institutional misconduct also indicates an inability to comply with rules.  
75Mr Scott is unable, because of mental illness and poor intellect, to learn to control his impulses by offence-specific treatment and therefore there is no point in requiring him to undertake any such treatment. He will need to reside in secure highly supported accommodation for his own well-being and for the safety of the community. Because of my finding (based on Dr O'Dea's opinion) that offence-specific treatment would be futile, I do not consider that it would be appropriate to impose a CDO to require Mr Scott to undertake such treatment in custody. The only purpose of imposing a CDO would be to ensure his safety, and that of the community until suitable CJP accommodation in the community becomes available. 
76It is a substantial step to order Mr Scott's continued incarceration beyond the expiry of his term of imprisonment. A CDO ought not be made lightly. Ms Callan, who appeared on behalf of the Crown, accepted that the further deprivation of liberty entailed by a CDO was an important relevant consideration against making such an order although it is not referred to in s 17(4) of the Act. The purpose of a gaol is to incarcerate those serving sentences for criminal offences, not as substitute accommodation for those entitled, but for a CDO, to be at liberty. This consideration is particularly strong in the present case where there is no reason to suppose that suitable CJP accommodation would not have been available when Mr Scott's sentence expired, had it been applied for in a timely way.
77However, in my view, the Crown has established that adequate supervision cannot presently be provided by an ESO. I accept the Crown's submission that a CDO ought be made for a limited period to permit CJP to finalise its assessment and identify suitable accommodation.
78The Crown referred to State of NSW v Davis [2008] NSWSC 664 (Davis), in which the lack of availability of suitable post-release accommodation meant a CDO was ordered, where otherwise an ESO might have been sufficient. In Davis, there was agreement between the parties that a CDO was appropriate in the short-term. In the present case, there is no agreement in the strict sense because Mr Scott wants to be released into the community at the earliest available opportunity. However, Mr Scragg indicated that the Public Guardian supported orders that would safeguard Mr Scott until he could be discharged to live in suitable accommodation to be provided by CJP, particularly if he could be treated at a forensic hospital during this interim period.Conclusion
CDO
79In my view, the optimum way of obviating the risk posed to the community by Mr Scott is to keep him in custody (preferably in a forensic hospital following a transfer pursuant to s 55 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act but otherwise in gaol, if no such transfer eventuates) until IRS accommodation provided by CJP is available. In my view he should be detained for a maximum period of three months to permit this to occur. If the accommodation is available prior to the expiry of three months, I consider that he should be released on the basis that he will be transferred to such accommodation. Upon his release he will be subject to an ESO with the specified conditions.
ESO
80If and when Mr Scott is released into the community, an ESO would provide much more appropriate and rigorous supervision than a CTO, and oblige Mr Scott to engage with services/accommodation provided by CJP. In the event of Mr Scott's admission to a psychiatric hospital, the term of any ESO would be suspended for the period of that admission (s 10(2) of the Act).  
81I accept the Crown's submission that, without the services available through CJP, the supervision provided by Community Corrections if Mr Scott were released into the community would be inadequate having regard to the risk he poses. However, if a place for Mr Scott is found in IRS, then I consider the risk would be sufficiently obviated by an ESO with appropriate conditions
82The plan proposed by Community Corrections (in a report dated 18 November 2013) involves the following:
(a)supervision by staff of Corrective Services;
(b)regular reporting obligations;
(c)the right of Corrective Services staff to see him at his accommodation at unscheduled times;
(d)electronic monitoring to assist that his whereabouts are known;
(e)a curfew requirement;
(f)a condition prohibiting the consumption of drugs and alcohol and permitting random drug and alcohol tests;
(g)a condition that Mr Scott provide a schedule of movements in advance.
83The plan is reflected in the terms of the ESO that are set out in the Schedule to the summons. Mr Scragg did not wish to be heard against any of the conditions, following concessions made by the Crown in relation to prohibition on his seeing films of a certain rating and the requirement that he be assisted in the provision of a schedule.
84I note that the Act provides for a CDO (s 19), or an EDO (s 13), to be varied, on application to this Court. I would expect any such application to be made if the plan to which my orders are intended to give effect does not, for whatever reason, come to pass.
Orders
85I make the following orders:
(1)Order, pursuant to s 17(1)(b) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (the Act), that the defendant be detained in a correctional centre until the earlier of the following two events:

FURTHER THE COURT NOTES AND RECOMMENDS

2705312,R v Cook [2014] NSWDC 18,"Judgment

The Events of 16 January 2013


1On 16 January 2013 Mr Raymond O'Neill, then 65 years of age, planned to go fishing. He drove to old Ferry Road at Illawong where he parked his car and commenced to unload his fishing equipment. As he arrived he saw a Harley Davidson motor cycle with two people standing next to it. One of them, the accused Cameron Cook, approached him and asked whether he had any jumper leads. Mr O'Neill told Mr Cook that he didn't. Mr O'Neill took his equipment to the spot where he planned to fish and returned to his car. Again Mr Cook asked him for assistance saying something like ""can you help me?"" Mr O'Neill again told Mr Cook that he couldn't help him because he didn't have any jumper leads. 

2What I have described so far would be the sort of interaction between human beings which occurs regularly as part of every day life. But what immediately followed Mr O'Neill's response to the accused's second request for assistance was very much out of the ordinary.

3Without warning the accused punched Mr O'Neill to his head. Mr O'Neill fell to the ground where the accused began kicking him to his body and his head. At one stage Mr O'Neill was able to grab the accused's leg. The accused then bent over and began punching Mr O'Neill in the head. Mr O'Neill tried to roll away and had almost got to his feet when he went down again, he presumed because he had been hit. The accused began kicking him again. Whilst all this was happening Mr O'Neill was, not surprisingly, trying to get away. Because he couldn't get up he was forced to crawl 20 or 30 metres, all the time being kicked or punched by the accused. 

4At one stage whilst he was trying to crawl away from the accused the accused said that he was going to shoot him and kill him. Mr O'Neill thought that if he carried out this threat, it was obviously all over for him.


5At another stage the accused briefly paused, long enough to say something to Mr O'Neill which he recounted in the following way:

""if the police caught him he was going to say that I attacked him first and there was two of them and police probably wouldn't believe him but the judge, they're stupid, or silly, and he'll believe me.""

6Eventually the accused stopped kicking and hitting Mr O'Neill and he, significantly injured, went to seek assistance. He couldn't find anyone but when he walked back to where his car was parked he saw the police had arrived and had the accused under control. 

7Mr O'Neill was left with injuries which, it is conceded, amounted to grievous bodily harm: fractures to an eye socket and swelling to his throat which affected his breathing and which required later draining.

8As a result of what the accused did he now faces trial on a charge of causing grievous bodily harm to Mr O'Neill with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to him. He pleaded not guilty to that charge but pleaded guilty to an alternative, recklessly causing grievous bodily harm, which the Crown did not accept in satisfaction of the indictment.

Trial by Judge Alone

9The accused elected for trial by judge alone. An election signed by the accused was filed. On the first day of the trial before me, the Crown indicated that it had no opposition to the late application by the accused, and consented to that mode of trial. The Crown Prosecutor then signed the election.

10I viewed that election and satisfied myself, through making enquiry of the accused, that he had received appropriate legal advice before choosing to have his trial heard by a judge rather than a jury. 

Relevant Principles of Law

11Before I further discuss the evidence called in the trial, and the conclusions which I draw from it, I will set out some preliminary matters. They are the sorts of things that I would tell a jury were this a trial where the jury decided the guilt or otherwise of the accused.

12I have determined all the relevant issues of fact according to the evidence. The evidence in this case was made up of what witnesses said in Court, including the accused, and the evidence which has been tendered. I have made no enquiries of any kind about anything that came up in this trial. I have never been to the location where the attack occurred.

13I have decided this case coldly and unemotionally. Were there a jury I would instruct them to ignore any feelings of sympathy or any other emotion that they might feel in deciding whether or not the accused is guilty of the charges he faces. Judges are not immune to feelings of sympathy. It is impossible not to feel sorry for Mr O' Neill who was looking forward to an afternoon's fishing before being attacked without warning by a complete stranger. I have recognised those feelings, recognised their effect upon me and then put those feelings to one side. Both the Crown and the accused are entitled to my judgment free from prejudice and sympathy. 

Onus of Proof

14The most important and fundamental principle of law which I apply concerns the onus and standard of proof. Because this is a criminal trial, the burden of proving the guilt of the accused is placed firmly on the Crown. The accused starts from the position that he is presumed innocent and that presumption continues until the Crown satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty.

15The accused does not have to prove that he is innocent, The accused does not have to prove that he is not guilty. It is for the Crown to prove his guilt if it can.

16What the Crown must prove, and prove beyond reasonable doubt, are the ingredients or essentials facts contained in the charges on the indictment. 

17As it turned out, and as I will shortly explain, there was much that was not in dispute in this trial. The real issue concerned the state of mind of the accused when he did certain things.

18There is no dispute that Mr Cook did what Mr O'Neill said that he did. As I have mentioned there is no dispute that the accused caused grievous bodily harm to Mr O'Neill. Indeed the accused made formal admission to that effect. I therefore make findings that the Crown has proved those matters beyond reasonable doubt.

19The only issue for me to resolve is whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time he did what he did, the accused intended to cause grievous bodily harm to Mr O'Neill.

The Issue at the Heart of this Trial

20Intent and intention are very familiar words; in this legal context they carry their ordinary meaning. There is little point in me using synonyms to explain what intention is.

21In this regard the accused raises the issue of his intoxication. He says that is a relevant factor in determining whether he intended to cause grievous bodily harm. Of course this is correct. When examining the question as to whether the Crown has proved that Mr Cook intended to cause grievous bodily harm that afternoon I look at the accused as he was at the time he was assaulting Mr O'Neill.

22I must examine the accused's state of mind as it was when he was assaulting Mr O'Neill. So this means that in deciding what he intended, I must take into account any effects of alcohol or dugs or both.

23It is for the Crown to satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the intention to inflict really serious bodily injury upon Mr O'Neill in spite of the evidence of how intoxicated he appeared to be.

24In some circumstances, an intoxicated person may act without forming any particular intention at all. On the other hand, a person may be considerably affected by alcohol or drugs or both and yet still commit an act with a specific purpose in mind. 

25The fact that his or her judgment was affected so that the person acts in a way different to how he or she would have acted if sober does not necessarily mean that the person was not acting with a specific intention. 

26And it is important to remember that a person may not be able to remember what they did, but nevertheless have acted intentionally. To say the same thing another way, a person may have intended to do something, and to achieve a certain result, even if they later can't even remember doing anything at all.

27I will give an example which is often used when instructing a jury on the issue of intoxication and intent.

28A man drives to a hotel where he drinks a lot. Well over the limit he then drives home and goes to bed. The next morning he has no recollection of how he got home. He goes outside and sees his car in the driveway and realises that he must have driven home but has no memory of doing so. In that situation it may well be that the man intended to drive even though the following morning he has no memory of doing just that. 

29Of course it is important to remember that it is not enough for the Crown to prove an intention to commit the acts, namely hitting and kicking Mr O'Neill. What has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt is the specific intention stated in the charge in the indictment, that is an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. That is simply bodily injury of a really serious kind. This type of injury does not have to be permanent or even life threatening. 

30There is no obligation on the accused to prove either that he could not or did not act with the intention to cause grievous bodily harm. It is an essential fact that the Crown must prove before I can find the accused guilty of the offence charged.

Did the Accused Intend to Cause Grievous Bodily Harm to Mr O'Neill?

31The accused gave evidence in his trial. He said that he had no memory of having struck Mr O'Neill although he accepted that he did. In fact he said he had no memory from when he started drinking earlier that day until waking up in the police cells. He was thus of course unable to say that he did not intend to inflict grievous bodily harm on Mr O'Neill. But of course that does not alter the fact that the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had that intention.

32The accused was certainly under the influence of alcohol and possibly drugs as well. The accused can remember starting to drink and when he was breath tested about two hours after his arrest his blood alcohol level was 0.123. Thus, when he assaulted Mr O'Neill about two hours earlier his blood alcohol level was not at an extreme level. I am not suggesting that he wasn't significantly under the influence of alcohol, but it would have been a blood alcohol level which is fairly commonly achieved by a substantial proportion of drinkers. 

33But then there is the unknown concerning the possibility that the accused took some form of drug as well which would have added to his inability to form the relevant intention. He could not remember taking any drug but he was prescribed Xanax at the time, carried that drug with him in case he needed it, and there were drugs available where he was drinking. It is thus a possibility, indeed a likelihood, that the accused took drugs as well as alcohol.

34Rather than focusing on blood alcohol levels and the possible effect of the accused having consumed drugs in an abstract sense, the best evidence as to his state of intoxication in those circumstances, is to be found in his behaviour.

35There were some aspects which were quite strange. Pointing to a significant level of intoxication is the very behaviour that has led to these proceedings. The assault upon Mr O'Neill was committed in bizarre circumstances. The accused had no grudge against him and indeed Mr O'Neill apologised for being unable to provide jumper leads which the accused had sought. 

36Many of the police officers who were involved in the accused's arrest describe him as ""ranting"", ""not making any sense"", ""away with the fairies"", speaking in jumbled words and similar descriptions. A video of the accused's behaviour soon after he was arrested was played. He is shown to be seated on the ground in handcuffs yelling out, amongst other things, that he had merely come down to check on his, or his father's, houseboat when he was hit in the face by a man with a fishing rod. He has trouble remaining upright, and is clearly agitated.

37After going back to the police station he slept for a long time before being finally interviewed some nine hours after arrest. A video of that interview was also played. In it the accused appears to be sober although tired and crying at times. He then spent some time detoxifying in jail (although his behaviour during that time was not explored).

38On the other hand there are many features of the evidence which point to an awareness on the part of the accused as to what was happening around him and what he was doing. 

39Firstly as mentioned earlier, the accused at one stage told Mr O'Neill that if police got involved he would blame Mr O'Neill. That is a logical thought process. Even the accused's assertion about the relative gullibility of police and judges points to an ability to reason, a knowledge of wrongdoing and an awareness of a suitable argument which might persuade Mr O'Neill not to report the matter to police.

40But there is more on this topic to be taken into account. After police had arrived and arrested the accused, he did precisely what he said he was going to do, supporting the Crown's assertion that the accused was capable of carrying out a connected set of actions. The accused told police that it was Mr O'Neill who had assaulted him, rather than the other way around, by hitting him in the mouth with a fishing rod. For example Constable Ross said that although the accused was ranting and not making any sense, he said about Mr O'Neill ""I didn't do anything. It was that fucking cunt over there. He hit me with a fishing rod. He can get fucked.""

41Then there is the video of the accused taken at the scene of his arrest. As I mentioned earlier, the accused explained his presence by saying that he had been checking out a houseboat owned by him and his father. In his evidence the accused told me that he and his father did own a houseboat which was moored in the vicinity. Thus the accused knew where he was. Also on the video it is apparent that he is aware of what is going on, able to comprehend what was said to him, and able to make himself understood. 

42Although, as I have noted earlier, it is important to distinguish between an intention to do the acts and intention to cause grievous bodily harm (the Crown needing to prove the latter beyond reasonable doubt) the ferocity of the assault upon Mr O'Neill, and the length of time over which it took place, are such that proof of an intention to do the act goes a long way to proving an intention that grievous bodily harm result. Indeed the accused said in his evidence that he would expect that kicking someone to the face and the throat would cause really serious injuries.

43I am satisfied that despite the accused's intoxication he displayed a clarity of thinking at the time of the assault and soon after it, which demonstrated that he did intend to cause grievous bodily harm to Mr O'Neill. That is a finding I make beyond reasonable doubt. I have found particularly important in making that finding the following unchallenged evidence and conclusions I have drawn:


The nature of the assault was such that grievous bodily harm would inevitably result. 


The accused demonstrated an ability to reason that the police would be after him for what he had done.


The accused was capable of using a threat in an attempt to have Mr O'Neill not report the matter to the police.


The accused kept that thought in his mind when he later carried out the threat to falsely claim that Mr O'Neill had attacked him.


The accused knew where he was, knew that the houseboat was nearby, and, as revealed in the video taken of him immediately after arrest, understood what was being said to him, understood what was happening and was able to make himself understood.

44In accordance with the findings I have made I find the accused guilty of Count 1 on the indictment.

2705318,R v Rawlinson; R v Proud; R v Spicer [2014] NSWSC 336,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR:  Following my rejection of Mr Spicer's application to discharge the jury after the unexpected evidence from Ms Proud on 24 March 2014, Mr Steel requested that he be permitted to cross-examine Ms Proud after the Crown had done so. That was said to be for the reason that he was unable to predict what other evidence might fall from Ms Proud in the course of what remained of her evidence and did not want to be left stranded between what emerges from his own cross-examination of her and what might ultimately be said by her when finally cross-examined by the Crown.

2The Crown opposes that application. One of the reasons for that opposition derives from the somewhat unusual, although by no means unique, position in which the Crown is now placed. That position arises from the fact that the Crown will no doubt wish to embrace Ms Proud's latest revelations of what Mr Spicer told her in bed at the motel in the early hours of 27 October 2011 as evidence inculpating Mr Spicer. On the other hand, the Crown will also wish to suggest that Ms Proud's exculpatory protestations in both her evidence in chief and elsewhere when interviewed by the police are untruthful and unreliable and cannot avail her in defence of the Crown case against her. That will involve a balancing exercise that the Crown insists can only fairly be carried out after either of her co-accused has completed his cross-examination of her. In that last respect I observe that Mr Terracini has already foregone his opportunity to cross-examine Ms Proud.

3Although the order proposed by the Crown is the usual or customary order for the cross-examination of an accused who gives evidence in a joint trial, the Court retains a discretion to alter the order in an appropriate case. Section 26 of the Evidence Act 1995 provides as follows:

""26 Court's control over questioning of witnesses 

The court may make such orders as it considers just in relation to: 

(a) the way in which witnesses are to be questioned, and 

(b) the production and use of documents and things in connection with the questioning of witnesses, and 

(c) the order in which parties may question a witness, and 

(d) the presence and behaviour of any person in connection with the questioning of witnesses.""

4I consider that there is presently no principled basis upon which to change the usual order of cross-examination. Neither the substance nor the fact of the unanticipated evidence that was given by Ms Proud two days ago reliably informs Mr Spicer's concern that further evidence of that type may yet emerge. There remains in any event the opportunity to consider whether he should be entitled additionally to cross-examine Ms Proud following conclusion of the Crown's cross-examination of her if some circumstances appear at that time to warrant it. It is obviously neither possible nor necessary to express a concluded view about that now. I observe in any event that both the Crown and Mr Pullinger have indicated that they would oppose that course if it were to arise.

2705328,Goodridge v R [2014] NSWCCA 37,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offence and sentenceThe appellant was charged with the murder of Carmel George.  On 21 March 2011 Rothman J found him unfit to be tried on the charge of murder and referred him to the Mental Health Review Tribunal under the provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.
2By determination on 26 July 2011 the Tribunal determined that the appellant would not be fit to be tried during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness.
3On 16 April 2012 the appellant was arraigned on an indictment charging that between 13 and 17 May 2009 at Moss Vale he did murder Ms George, contrary to s18(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900.  The appellant was taken by s21(3)(a) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act to have pleaded not guilty to the offence charged.
4The matter proceeded before Adamson J, without a jury, on 16, 17 and 19 April 2012.  No witnesses were called by either party.  The Crown brief of evidence was tendered without objection, along with psychiatric reports from Dr Westmore (retained by the Crown) and Dr Neilssen (retained by the appellant) and a report by a psychologist, Dr Lennings.
5On 20 April 2012 Adamson J returned a verdict that on the limited evidence available the appellant had committed the offence of murder (R v Goodridge [2012] NSWSC 378).  On 21 September 2012 her Honour nominated a limiting term of 18 years (R v Goodridge (No 2) [2012] NSWSC 1180).
6The appellant has appealed under s5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against her Honour's verdict.  Under s22(3)(c) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, the verdict given at a special hearing is subject to appeal in the same manner as a verdict in an ordinary trial of criminal proceedings.  The appellant has also sought leave to appeal against the limiting term imposed by her Honour.
7The appellant relies upon the following grounds of appeal:
ConvictionGround 1:  Her Honour's verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.
Ground 2:  Her Honour erred in not directing herself that she should not reject unanimous expert evidence unless it was contradicted by other persuasive evidence.
Ground 3:  There was a miscarriage of justice because her Honour did not advise the parties that her Honour intended to reject the unanimous evidence of the expert witnesses and invite the parties to provide the witnesses with further material and call them to give further evidence.
SentenceGround 4:  The limiting term her Honour imposed on the appellant is manifestly excessive.
Evidence
8The appellant was born in March 1957.  He was 52 at the time of the offence and is now 57.  He had a long term history of alcohol and other substance abuse.  He lived in Moss Vale and had not worked since 2006.
9He owned a dog called ""Zone"" whom he obtained from the pound in 2001.  He used to take Zone for a walk at about 4am every morning around the Moss Vale town centre.  On his way he would drink the dregs from wine bottles left out for him by a sympathetic restauranter.  He would then go to the Jemmy Moss Hotel, which opened at 8am, where he would drink schooners of VB whenever he could afford to.
10In May 2009 the appellant was evicted from his Housing Commission flat.  For a few nights he stayed in a unit in which Paul Knight, a friend of his, resided.  On 9 May 2009, Ms George who was then 39, left a rehabilitation centre for drug addicted persons and alcoholics where she had been residing and went to stay at Mr Knight's unit.
11On 10 May 2009 John Parry, a local barber, heard the accused yell ""Come on dog I'm going to go and lie on the road.""  Later Mr Parry saw the appellant lying in the middle of the road surrounded by people.  He had been hit by a car at low speed, suffering abrasions to his nose and forehead, a black eye and an injury to his leg which caused him to limp.  Ms George approached Mr Parry and told him that she intended to sit with the accused all night in hospital.  She tried unsuccessfully to persuade Mr Parry to buy her a bottle of vodka because she said that she was coming down off heroin.
12On 12 May 2009 the appellant resumed his usual practice of drinking at the Jemmy Moss Hotel at 8am.  He was observed drinking with Ms George that day.  She purchased alcohol for him to consume at the hotel.  When the barmaid refused to serve Ms George because she was intoxicated, she purchased a bottle of vodka, which was her preferred drink, to take away.
13At 12.30pm on 12 May 2009 Ms George bought another bottle of vodka from the BWS (Beer Wine & Spirits) outlet at Moss Vale.  She returned at 2.30pm for yet another bottle of vodka.  She gave an explanation to the manager of the shop that she was shaken up because she had been looking after the appellant in hospital after he had been hit by a car.
14On Wednesday, 13 May 2009 the appellant and Ms George were again seen drinking at the Jemmy Moss.  That day the appellant went to the bank to collect his fortnightly disability pension.  He proceeded to use it to purchase two casks of Stanley chardonnay, some of which he then consumed.  Ms George returned to the BWS bottle shop at Moss Vale at 10.30am and purchased a bottle of vodka.
15Later that day, Mr Knight and the appellant drank considerable amounts of alcohol at Mr Knight's unit.  Ms George was drinking vodka at the time.  The appellant and Mr Knight then went to the Moss Vale Hotel with a view to engaging in a fight.  When they returned to Mr Knight's unit later that evening, they drank the rest of a cask of wine with Ms George.  That night Mr Knight and Ms George shared a bed, as they had previously, and the appellant slept with Zone.
16On 14 May 2009 Mr Knight told the appellant that he could no longer stay at his unit because the owners objected.  The appellant and Ms George told Mr Knight that they intended to stay at the railway barracks.  That building was a disused accommodation block within the boundary of the Moss Vale Railway Station.  It comprised a single storey, brick structure with a metal roof.  It was used by squatters and itinerants and was in a state of disrepair with several windows smashed.
17On that morning the appellant went with Ms George to the Jemmy Moss Hotel for a drink.  He was wearing a bright red jumper.  At about 11am Ms George went to the BWS bottle shop and purchased the cheapest bottle of wine available for $5.  At about this time the appellant moved his possessions with the aid of a shopping trolley to room 6 at the railway barracks.
18That night (14 May 2009) Ms George and the appellant stayed at the railway barracks.  During the course of the evening and into the night, they continued to consume substantial quantities of alcohol.  At some time before the appellant left the barracks on Friday morning, he made sexual advances to Ms George which were unwelcome.  He became angry and violent.  He wanted to hurt her and to ""teach her a lesson"".  On several occasions he pushed Ms George against the wall of room 6 with such force that she fell to the ground.  At some stage, he repeatedly forced his right arm into her vagina and rectum, causing the internal injuries and profuse bleeding from which she eventually died.
19On Friday, 15 May 2009 the appellant awoke and said that he was horrified by the pool of blood which surrounded Ms George's body.  He restrained Zone from sniffing or licking the blood and took him for a walk.
20The appellant went to the Jemmy Moss Hotel at about 9am.  The bar attendant noticed him entering through the back door, which was unusual since he usually came in through the side door near where he tied up Zone outside.  When the appellant came into the bar, the attendant could see that his entire face and the right side of his upper body were covered in dried blood.  There was dried blood on his jumper and the shirt he wore underneath.
21The attendant did not observe any injuries that would account for the blood.  She said:  
""Fuck Michael, what's happened to you?  It looks like you have murdered somebody.  Get to the toilets and wash your face.  I'm not going to serve you looking like that"".
The appellant's face was blank.  He went off to the toilets and then returned to drink a schooner of VB.  The attendant noticed that his black jeans were on inside out.  
22Later that morning, another bar attendant refused to serve him, not because she regarded him as drunk but because he was ""such a mess"".  Shortly afterwards, the appellant untied Zone, left the Jemmy Moss and did not return.
23Later that Friday morning, the appellant went to the Moss Vale branch of the Commonwealth Bank and withdrew $100.  The teller noted that his clothes and face were covered in blood.  On several occasions on Friday, 15 May 2009 the appellant returned to the railway barracks and saw Ms George's body lying on the floor in a pool of blood.  He partly covered her with sheets and tried to wipe up some of the blood in an ineffectual way.  He neither disclosed what had happened nor sought help.  At some stage he touched Ms George's body and found it to be cold.
24On Saturday, 16 May 2009 Sharon Millbank, a mutual friend of the appellant and Ms George, was in Moss Vale on a visit.  At about 11am she was walking past the Central Hotel when she recognised Zone.  She went inside to renew her acquaintance with the appellant who purchased a schooner of VB for her.  
25When John Marnach, a local, arrived at the Central Hotel at 12.15pm on Saturday, he noticed that the appellant had changed his clothing since he saw him at the Jemmy Moss the previous morning.  The appellant looked clean and was wearing white pants.
26Ms Millbank, who wanted to get in touch with Ms George, asked the appellant whether she was still in rehabilitation for her alcohol problem.  At first he said that he had not seen her but after some time, said that she was at the railway barracks ""covered in blood"".  When Ms Millbank asked what had happened, the appellant said that he thought she might have been raped a couple of days earlier.  Ms Millbank went with the appellant to room 6 of the barracks and found Ms George's body on the floor in a pool of blood.  Ms Millbank then telephoned triple 0 and handed the telephone to the appellant so that he could guide ambulance officers to the location.
27While the ambulance officers were on the telephone, the appellant confirmed that Ms George was dead.  When the ambulance officers arrived, they found Ms George's body lying on the floor of room 6 in a pool of blood.  She was naked from the waist down, with only a sheet or blanket to cover her.  She was dressed in a bra that was pulled up to her neck area, a blue and white striped T-shirt, also pulled up, a black jersey and brown socks.  Her head was partly covered with the mattress.  Her eyes were still open and her head was tilted back.  Blood was smeared on the wall beside her.  There was also a palm print on the wall in blood.  Analysis later established the palm print to be that of the appellant and the blood to be that of Ms George.
28The coronial evidence of the direct cause of Ms George's death was exsanguination due to vaginal and rectal injuries. Acute alcohol intoxication was identified as a significant condition contributing to her death since it could impair the metabolic, haemodynamic and inflammatory response to haemorrhagic shock.  An analysis of Ms George's blood alcohol content recorded 0.373 g/100mL.
29The evidence established that the appellant inflicted the injuries which caused Ms George's death.  Detective Sergeant Moon, who investigated the scene and physical evidence, concluded that the blood patterns on the accused's sleeve were consistent with the accused using his right arm to inflict the injuries which Ms George had sustained. Blood staining on a white shirt apparently worn by the accused tended to establish that there was a subsequent sexual assault after the initial injuries had been inflicted.  
30The appellant was asked some questions by Senior Constable de Haan who recorded that the appellant said that he had seen Keith Doherty in the building the previous night; that he thought Ms George had been raped or otherwise injured due to the amount of blood; and that he had drunk a lot of wine and vodka in the past week. The appellant denied that he had any sexual relationship with Ms George.
31The appellant was interviewed and the interviews were electronically recorded. The first ERISP commenced at 11.16pm on Saturday 16 May 2009 and lasted about 3 hours.  The second commenced at 6.11am on Sunday 17 May and lasted 2 hours.
32In the first ERISP, the appellant:
(a) Denied that he had had sexual relations with Ms George;
(b) Admitted that he had kissed her ""a while back"";
(c) Sought to implicate Mr Doherty, who had had a former association with Ms George, by suggesting that he had come to the railway barracks while Ms George was there;
(d) Denied that he had touched Ms George;
(e) Said that he tried to wipe away the blood because he was fearful that he would get the blame for doing it;
(f) Said that it was ""wonderful"" to have Ms George stay with him at the barracks because she understood him and was a ""pretty good friend of mine"";
(g) Said that he tried to clean up the blood around her body because he ""hate[s] the sight of blood""; and
(h) Said that he did not call anyone or report her death because of ""fear"".
33When asked in the first ERISP what he thought had happened to Ms George he said:
""I think someone got in there and took her life, I don't know, that's what I was thinking, I can't, it wouldn't be me, I wouldn't do it, I wouldn't even have enough guts in me to kill anyone.""
34The following exchange occurred about his drinking habits:
""Q456  Would you drink every day?A  If I've got it to drink I do drink every day, but if I haven't got it I don't ... So I can take it or leave it.""
35In the course of the second ERISP the appellant admitted that he had had sex with Ms George in the last three days.  He also said:
""I got very cranky with her and pushed her, and she fell down on the floor and hit her head, not the mattress, actually, she just hit her head.  I picked her back up, and then I threw her down again.""
36When asked to explain how Ms George made him angry, he said:
""""I don't know, she started yellin' and carryin' on like she normally used to... it just got to me and I freaked out, and pushed her hard...[She was yelling] Get away from me, or somethin'. The more she was yelling, the more angrier I got, and I pushed her.""
37When asked why Ms George was yelling for him to get away, he said:
""""She probably thought I was tryin' to hurt her, but then she... [I] just got goin' and give her a good hard push.""
He admitted that he had pushed her very hard.  He admitted that he wanted to hurt her.  When asked what he was trying to do, he said:
""Most probably tryin' to teach her a lesson or something.""
38The appellant told the police that she screamed that she did not want to have anything to do with him which made him ""cranky"" and he pushed her again.  He said that he was ""hurt"" by this because he ""liked her a lot"".  
39The appellant admitted that he pushed her to the floor on several occasions.  He said that they were drinking throughout Thursday night.  On one such occasion, Ms George asked him why he pushed her.  The appellant told police that he then ""ripped her clothes off"" because of the ""mood I was in"".  The appellant then decided that he wanted to have intercourse with Ms George.  He told police that when she resisted he raped her.
40The appellant told police that he then went to sleep.  When he woke on Friday morning to take Zone for a walk, Ms George was dead and lying in a pool of blood.  He tried to clean up the blood ""to get rid of the evidence"" because he knew that he would ""get in a lot of trouble"".
41At no stage during the ERISPs did the appellant address the injuries sustained to Ms George's vagina or rectum.
The judgment
42Her Honour made the following finding in relation to intent:
""49 Although the accused was intoxicated by alcohol at the time of the conduct that caused the death of Ms George, I am satisfied that he was capable of intending, and did intend, to cause her grievous bodily harm. Although the admissions he made in the second ERISP about his intention to hurt her related to his acts of pushing her to the floor when she was trying to resist his advances and yelling at him to keep away from her, his conduct in pushing her was part of the whole course of conduct in which he assaulted her because she would not comply with his wishes and would not behave as he wished her to.  I am satisfied that he appreciated at the time of these events that his acts towards her would cause her really serious injury and that he intended to do so. There is, in my view, no basis to distinguish between his acts of pushing her to the floor, which he has admitted were done to hurt her and ""teach her a lesson"" and his acts of pushing his right arm into her vagina and rectum which caused her to bleed to death.""
43Her Honour recognised that this finding was relatively uncontroversial and that the real issue before her was the consideration of ""substantial impairment by abnormality of mind as a partial defence to murder"".
44The resolution of this question is determined by s23A of the Crimes Act 1900 (the Act).  That section provides:
""23A   Substantial impairment by abnormality of mind
(1) A person who would otherwise be guilty of murder is not to be convicted of murder if:
(a)   at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, the person's capacity to understand events, or to judge whether the person's actions were right or wrong, or to control himself or herself, was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, and
(b)   the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.
(2)   For the purposes of subsection (1) (b), evidence of an opinion that an impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter is not admissible.
(3)   If a person was intoxicated at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, and the intoxication was self-induced intoxication (within the meaning of section 428A), the effects of that self-induced intoxication are to be disregarded for the purpose of determining whether the person is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of this section.
(4)   The onus is on the person accused to prove that he or she is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of this section.
(5)   A person who but for this section would be liable, whether as principal or accessory, to be convicted of murder is to be convicted of manslaughter instead.
(6)   The fact that a person is not liable to be convicted of murder in respect of a death by virtue of this section does not affect the question of whether any other person is liable to be convicted of murder in respect of that death.
(7)   If, on the trial of a person for murder, the person contends:
(a)   that the person is entitled to be acquitted on the ground that the person was mentally ill at the time of the acts or omissions causing the death concerned, or
(b)   that the person is not liable to be convicted of murder by virtue of this section,
evidence may be offered by the prosecution tending to prove the other of those contentions, and the Court may give directions as to the stage of the proceedings at which that evidence may be offered.
(8)   In this section:
underlying condition means a pre-existing mental or physiological condition, other than a condition of a transitory kind.""
45Section 428A of the Act relevantly defines ""self-induced intoxication"" as ""any intoxication except intoxication that is involuntary"".  The onus of proving s23A is on the accused but it must be proved only on the balance of probabilities.
46Her Honour posed the relevant question as follows:
""56 The first matter which the accused must establish is that at the time he pushed his right arm into the vagina and rectum of Ms George, his capacity either to understand events or to judge whether his actions were right or wrong or to control himself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from a pre-existing mental or physiological condition which is not transitory. By reason of s 23A(3) of the Act I am obliged to disregard self-induced intoxication.
57 This question invites a comparison between the impairment caused by the accused's underlying condition, alcohol-related brain damage, and the impairment caused by intoxication from alcohol, to the effects of which the accused was more susceptible, having regard to the underlying condition. If the impairment of his relevant capacity was substantial within the meaning of s 23A of the Act, even if the super-imposed intoxication caused by alcohol is disregarded, then he can establish substantial impairment within s 23A(1)(a).  However, if the impairment in his relevant capacity from his underlying condition was not substantial unless he was intoxicated, then he cannot establish the partial defence.""
47Her Honour sought to answer the question which she posed by reference to four categories of evidence: the evidence of lay observers, the ERISPs, the likely affectation of the appellant by alcohol and the opinion of the two psychiatrists and the psychologist.
48Her Honour regarded the evidence of lay observers as important because they were able to describe the behaviour of the appellant over a period of time and in various stages of intoxication.  Most particularly, they were able to describe the effect on his behaviour of the ingestion of alcohol.  Mr Pollard (the baker) said the appellant was ""usually a nice man but that he could get violent and those instances of violence appeared to be related to the consumption of alcohol or drugs"".  Mr Knight's evidence was that the appellant had ""been drinking a lot more lately and getting aggressive"".  Ms Baxter, a bar attendant, said that she had never seen the appellant ""misbehave or carry on in the hotel at any time"".  Mr Marnach said that he had never known the appellant to be violent, although he would ""yell loudly"".
49Ms Daley, the bottle shop manager at the Jemmy Moss Hotel, said that she had seen the appellant in town ""carrying on, yelling and screaming at no-one"" but that this had always been when he was intoxicated and that he was usually quiet when he was in the hotel.  Mr Acton, another patron of the Jemmy Moss, said that he had never actually seen the appellant sober and described him as an alcoholic.
50Mr Parry said of the appellant:
""I have never seen him in the past being physically violent except being a bit abusive with his language... 
Michael went off the rails in the last six or seven months. He became so abusive to others. The more he drank the worse he got, whereas before he was different, hardly abusive, just language.""
51Mr McVie, the manager of the BWS bottle shop, said that the appellant had a bad temper and:
"" ... would kick the dog and start being abusive to us for not serving him because he was too intoxicated which had happened several times.""
52On the basis of that evidence, her Honour concluded that:
""""68 ... the accused's conduct was affected by alcohol which caused him at times to be aggressive and loud. Because of his alcoholism, he is likely to have had some base level of alcohol in his blood at any given time. His behaviour was more controlled when this level was lower. He became more erratic and aggressive the more he drank.""
53As a guide to the level of intoxication of the appellant at the time he killed Ms George, her Honour had regard to the blood alcohol concentration of 0.373 percent of Ms George.  She concluded:
"" ... having regard to their similar statures and the fact that she and the accused had been drinking together, provides some broad indication of his state of intoxication.""
54In relation to the expert evidence from Drs Nielssen, Westmore and Lennings her Honour noted that they had not been provided with the ERISPs, the statements of the lay witnesses or the autopsy report.  In particular she noted that Dr Westmore had been provided with the Crown case statement and some extracts from the ERISPs but this material was purely documentary ""and incapable of conveying the accused's demeanour which was apparent when viewing the films of the ERISPs.""  (Judgment [70]).  The Crown Case Statement was not provided to the other two experts.
55The appellant was interviewed by Dr Nielssen, at the request of his solicitors, by audiovisual link from gaol on 3 November 2009 and 5 August 2010.  Her Honour made the following observations concerning Dr Nielssen's assessment.
56She noted that he had obtained a history of a head injury in gaol in January 2010 which ""might have resulted in further damage in intellectual function"".  He had diagnosed two psychiatric conditions:  alcohol dependence and abuse disorder and alcohol-related brain damage.  Her Honour noted this conclusion in the 2010 report:
""The history suggests Mr Goodridge was drinking heavily around the time of the offence and was probably affected by a large quantity of alcohol at the time of the offence itself.""
57Her Honour recorded the following opinion of Dr Nielssen:
""Mr Goodridge's alcohol related brain damage is an underlying condition within the meaning of section 23A of the Crimes Act.  His condition would affect his perception of any events, his ability to judge right from wrong and especially his capacity to control his actions. His underlying condition would result in an increased susceptibility to the effects of alcohol.""
58By reference to that quotation, her Honour said:
""75 This opinion does not assist in determining the principal issue: whether the impairment in the accused's relevant capacity as a result of the underlying condition was substantial if the effects of self-induced intoxication from alcohol are disregarded.""  
59Following an interview on 16 March 2012 Dr Nielssen prepared a report dated 23 March 2012.  He commented that the appellant's mental state had deteriorated since the previous interview.  He thought this deterioration might be attributable to the assault which occurred in prison in January 2010.  Dr Nielssen made a new diagnosis of dementia.
60Her Honour recorded the following opinion of Dr Nielssen in his 23 March 2012 report:
""I confirm the opinion expressed in the previous report about the availability of the defence of substantial impairment of abnormality of mind, based on the assumption that Mr Goodridge had significant degree of alcohol related brain damage at the time of the offence.  Brain damage is an underlying condition within the meaning of Section 23 A of the Crimes Act.  His underlying condition would give rise to an abnormality of mind which would have a significant effect on his perception of any events and his ability to judge right from wrong, even in the absence of intoxication with alcohol.  However, because of his underlying brain damage, aggressive behaviour associated with Mr Goodridge's consumption of alcohol is due to the effect of alcohol on an abnormal brain, and is a form of pathological intoxication, rather than a voluntary form of intoxication in which the effects on behaviour can be anticipated.  Intoxication with alcohol on a background of brain damage is likely to have resulted in significant impairment in the perception of events, capacity to judge right from wrong and the capacity to exercise self-control.""  (Emphasis added by her Honour.)
61By reference to that quotation her Honour said:
""79 I accept Dr Nielssen's opinion in the second underlined passage. However, it does not follow from the fact that the alcohol consumed by the accused had a greater effect on his capacity than it would have done had it not been for the underlying brain damage that he was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from the underlying condition when he committed the offence if the substantial impairment arose from the intoxication, rather than the underlying condition.
80 Dr Nielssen uses the term ""pathological intoxication"" which, without further explanation could be taken to mean that the accused's intoxication was involuntary, and therefore not self-induced.  However, I do not consider that it can properly be understood that way.  As Dr Westmore explained it in his most recent report, referred to below, it is a term which describes an abnormal response following the consumption of alcohol.  As long as the consumption of alcohol is not involuntary, its effects must be disregarded by reason of s 428A of the Act.""
62Dr Westmore examined the appellant on behalf of the DPP, on 9 March 2011, approximately 21 months after the offence.  His conclusion in relation to s23A was:
""I would agree with Dr Nielssen when he wrote that Mr Goodridge has an underlying condition, specifically the acquired brain damage (alcohol and possibly head injuries).  I note however that he has not, by his own account, displayed any aggressive behaviour since being placed into custody and that would suggest that the underlying condition itself is not the primary source of his aggression.  He acknowledges that sometimes he becomes aggressive with alcohol and he acknowledges that in relation to the victim he had been violent after drinking.  That would indicate that alcohol is the critical factor in his aggressive behaviour and the alleged aggressive behaviour towards the deceased.""
63Dr Westmore prepared a further report, dated 29 March 2012, where he said:""Under the heading ""Presenting Complaint"", on page 2 of my report, I described his account of the incident and I note, in a Record of Interview, he told the police that he had been angry because he could not find his alcohol. He said that he did not remember saying that, but said he probably had said that.  In relation to why he had been aggressive towards the woman, he said he did not know why, but ""I just had enough of her.  She was driving me nuts, I just had enough of her"".  He had memory difficulties relating to the incident and it is probable he had consumed alcohol on the day.  (Emphasis added by her Honour.)
On the balance of probability, I would accept that this man suffers from an underlying condition, specifically a disease of the brain, which has its aetiology in a past history of head injuries and alcohol abuse and the disease of the brain would represent an abnormality of mind which, at the relevant time, is likely to have impaired Mr Goodridge's capacity to control himself in relation to the deceased.
To that extent he would be eligible to raise the defence of substantial impairment to the charge of murder which, I understand, is now before the court."" 
64By reference to that quotation, her Honour said:
""84 The sentence emphasised in the passage extracted above is a serious understatement and indicates that Dr Westmore was unaware of the extent of the drinking binge that had started no later than Wednesday 13 May 2009 and continued relatively unabated until at least the time of the offence.  Although Dr Westmore opines that the accused ""would be eligible to raise the defence of substantial impairment"" I do not read his opinion as necessarily supporting the proposition that the undoubted impairment from the underlying condition was substantial at the relevant time.  Furthermore, the weight to be given to his opinion is substantially undermined by his insufficient apprehension of the accused's level of intoxication at the relevant time.""
65Her Honour set out the following conclusion from Dr Westmore's report which was designed to answer Dr Nielssen's further report of 23 March 2012:
""In this particular case, Mr Goodridge has established organic brain damage, which would make him more vulnerable to alcohol and to provocation.
Mr Goodridge is likely to become behaviourally disturbed as a result of his underlying brain damage, even in the absence of alcohol consumption.  I note that he has not demonstrated behavioural problems since being placed into custody and that raises the probable importance of provocation at the time of the incident.
I understand that the deceased may have concealed, hidden or prevented Mr Goodridge accessing alcohol leading up to the events now before the court and that could well have been sufficient provocation, even in the absence of alcohol, to result in Mr Goodridge acting aggressively.  It is probable that he has not experienced similar levels of provocation in custody, hence no similar problems have been identified since he has been in prison.""   (Emphasis added by her Honour.)
66In relation to that quote from Dr Westmore, her Honour said:
""86 ... Although I accept that Dr Westmore considers it was possible the accused could have reacted aggressively to provocation, even if not intoxicated, by reason of the underlying condition, I do not understand his opinion to go further than that.
87 I read Dr Westmore's evidence as supporting the proposition that the accused's relevant capacity was impaired by an underlying condition and that his capacity could become substantially impaired when he consumed alcohol.  I do not read it as amounting to an opinion that the accused's relevant capacity was necessarily substantially impaired if the effects of ingestion of alcohol at the time are disregarded.""
67The evidence of Dr Lennings did not take these issues any further.
68Her Honour then set out her assessment of the evidence of the two psychiatrists.  She accepted that there was some support in the opinions of both Dr Westmore and Dr Nielssen to the effect that the appellant's capacity was substantially impaired by an underlying condition, even if the effects of his intoxication with alcohol were disregarded.  She noted that Dr Westmore's opinion was more qualified than that of Dr Nielssen.
69With respect to the appellant's reaction to provocation, her Honour said:
""91 Both Dr Westmore and Dr Nielssen appear to consider that it is possible that the accused would have responded ""aggressively"" to provocation in the absence of alcohol. However, it is one thing to respond aggressively because he did not get what he wanted (more alcohol or a willing response to his sexual advances) but it is quite another to do what the accused did which resulted in the death of Ms George.
92 The issue raised by Dr Westmore and considered by Dr Nielssen as to the ""probable importance of provocation at the time of the incident"" is vexed. There are two relevant distinctions between the circumstances at the time of the offence and his circumstances in gaol.""
70Her Honour identified the two distinctions which were absent from gaol as (1) the presence of the deceased and the availability of alcohol and (2) at the time of the offence, the appellant was grossly intoxicated.  Her Honour concluded:
""95 Although I accept that the accused has not been subject to the same provocations in gaol as those to which he was subject at the time of the offence, nonetheless I consider that had the accused's relevant capacity been substantially impaired as a result of his underlying condition, as distinct from intoxication, it is likely that his behaviour in prison would have manifest some of the features which he displayed at the time of the offence. That his behaviour has not is, in my view, supportive of the proposition that his impairment at the time of the offence was made substantial by his self-induced intoxication.
96 However, even if the psychiatric evidence is taken at its highest for the accused, I would still not be satisfied that the defence under s 23A(1)(a) of the Act had been made out in part because of what I regard as the deficient foundation of the expert opinions.""
71Her Honour then set out what she regarded as that ""deficient foundation of the expert opinion"".
""98 Neither of the psychiatrists reviewed the ERISPs, had access to the statements tendered by the Crown which form the basis for the factual narrative set out above and the summary of the accused's general behaviour set out above, or was aware of Ms George's blood alcohol concentration as revealed by the autopsy report. The ERISPs and the statements are, in my view, the most reliable pieces of evidence of the accused's relevant capacity and the extent to which it was impaired by his underlying condition proximate to the time of the acts that caused Ms George's death, if one disregarded the effects of intoxication.

99 For example, Dr Westmore seems to have been under what I consider to be a misapprehension: that a significant trigger for the accused conduct was that Ms George may have concealed, hidden or prevented the accused from accessing alcohol.  It emerges from the second ERISP that the accused put the wine cask under the sink himself, but had forgotten where he had put it. I consider that the ERISPs taken together are more consistent with the principal trigger for the accused's violence being that Ms George did not want to have sex with him and refused his advances.  He then became angry and violated her.  Whether he was able to penetrate her with his penis is a moot point, although he said that he did so on more than one occasion, but he undoubtedly did so with his right arm, causing the injuries which proved to be fatal.
100 This may be regarded as a matter of detail as to the particular provocation which inclined the accused to act as he did. However, of greater importance, the ERISPs, viewed as a whole, display the extent to which the accused was capable of understanding events, judging whether his actions were right or wrong and, to a lesser extent, his capacity to control himself. The autopsy report shows, in broad terms, the probable level of the accused's intoxication at the relevant time.
101 In my view, the ERISPs show the accused's capacity to understand events and judge whether his actions were right or wrong to be impaired by his underlying condition, but not substantially so. The lay witness statements show that when the accused was relatively sober he was reasonably capable of controlling himself, but that when he was intoxicated by alcohol, his capacity was substantially impaired. The autopsy report provides some circumstantial evidence of his state of intoxication, which was considerable.
102 For the foregoing reasons, I am not satisfied that the accused's relevant capacity to control himself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition at the relevant time. I accept that his capacity at the relevant time to understand events, judge whether his actions were right or wrong or to control himself was, to some extent, impaired. However, in my view, his substantial impairment came from his consumption of excessive quantities of alcohol which I find to have been not involuntary, and therefore self-induced, and, by reason of s 23A(3) of the Act, to be disregarded.""
72In relation to the second limb of s23A(1) of the Act her Honour said:
""107 Because of the special nature of this hearing, which is conducted, in the absence of an election, by judge alone (s 21A(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act), I must decide this question, bearing in mind that manslaughter is regarded as a less serious crime than murder and that the community places less blame and condemnation upon a person guilty of manslaughter than of murder. In this case there is no jury to bring to bear its collective wisdom or sense of justice. In making this decision, I must not, and do not, take into account any of the opinion evidence of the psychiatrists or psychologist that could otherwise bear on the question, since such evidence is inadmissible on this question: s 23A(2).
108 The accused has not discharged the onus of persuading me that any lessening of the blame and condemnation upon him is warranted. Ms George appears to have been staying at the barracks with the accused, rather than at Mr Knight's unit, because she was concerned about the accused's wellbeing following his having been hit by a car some days earlier. The acts of the accused that resulted in her death were horrendously violent and savage.  His acts involved a substantial and determined use of force, which both violated and denigrated her in a brutal and degrading way.
109 The admissions made by the accused on the ERISPs set out above, and in particular that he wanted to hurt her and ""teach her a lesson"" for not responding positively to his advances, cast his behaviour in a particularly abhorrent light. 

110 Even had I otherwise found the partial defence of substantial impairment to have been made out I would not have considered that it would be such as to warrant the accused's liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.""
Submissions
Ground 1:  Her Honour's verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.
73The appellant submitted that contrary to the finding of the trial judge there was unanimity between the psychiatrists to the effect that he had made out the partial defence of substantial impairment.  The appellant submitted that by interpreting the psychiatric evidence in the way in which she did, her Honour had misread the effect of what the psychiatrists were saying.  The appellant submitted that when the psychiatrists said that the partial defence was open to him or was available to him, they in fact meant that the first limb of s23A(1) had been made out.  By expressing themselves in that way, they were making sure that they did not appear to be expressing an opinion as to the second limb of s23A(1).
74The appellant submitted that this misunderstanding of the effect of the psychiatric evidence was evident in pars [78] and [80] of the judgment.  The appellant submitted that there was no basis for her Honour's qualification of Dr Nielssen's opinion by using the introductory words ""At its highest ... "" in [78].  The appellant submitted that to the extent that her Honour meant that there was some doubt about Dr Nielssen's conclusion or that this conclusion was contradicted by other parts of his reports, her Honour was in error.  He submitted that the meaning of the first sentence of that part of Dr Nielssen's report extracted at [77] was clear and unambiguous.
75The appellant submitted that her Honour erred in not taking into account his intoxication on the basis that it was ""involuntary"".  He submitted that a decision of a severely brain damaged individual to drink alcohol was not truly a voluntary decision.
76The appellant relied upon the authority of such cases as R v Maxwell [1998] 217 ALR 452 where the NSWCCA (Spigelman CJ, Sperling and Hidden JJ) said that while a jury is not bound by what the medical witnesses say, they must act on the evidence and if there are no facts and circumstances before them which throw doubt on the medical evidence, then that is all they are left with and the jury must accept it.  The appellant also relied upon the observations of Allsop P (with whom Price J agreed) in Devaney v R [2012] NSWCCA 285 at [88].
77The appellant submitted that the other three bases relied upon by her Honour for not accepting the psychiatric evidence were flawed.  By reference to the lay witnesses, the appellant submitted that this evidence did not establish an increased level of aggression on his part in the months leading up to the killing and that even if it did, there was insufficient evidence to connect that increase in aggression to his consumption of alcohol.  The appellant submitted that any increase in aggression could be explained by a deterioration in his underlying mental state.
78The appellant submitted that of the eight witnesses to whom her Honour had referred, only four could be regarded as connecting his aggression with drinking (Messrs Knight, Parry and McVie and Ms Daley).  The appellant submitted that it would be difficult for them as lay persons to determine whether or not alcohol was the cause of his aggression.
79The appellant submitted that apart from kicking the dog, there was no evidence of any actual violence associated with his aggression.  He submitted that the most telling criticism of her Honour's analysis was the contrast between his long history of heavy drinking and his relatively minor criminal history which did not record any significant acts of violence except for damage to property which occurred in 1982 and 1997.
80With respect to the ERISPs the appellant submitted that the weight which her Honour gave to her own analysis of them was unjustified.  He submitted that it was not unusual for intellectually disabled persons to become practised at feigning an understanding of questions.  The appellant submitted that in this case it was clear from the beginning of each ERISP that the appellant did not understand the caution which was administered to him.  The appellant submitted that this was apparent, not only from his own words but from the reaction of the interrogating police officer.
81The appellant submitted that his answers in the first, and particularly the second ERISP, would inevitably lead to the conclusion that his recollection of the events leading up to the killing was chaotic, patchy and incomplete.  The appellant submitted that completely inconsistent answers were given within minutes of each other.  On occasions, admissions were made but were contradicted immediately afterwards.  The appellant submitted that the ERISPs confirmed, rather than undermined, the conclusions of the psychiatrists as to the availability of the partial defence.
82The appellant submitted that the autopsy report for Ms George which showed that her blood alcohol concentration was .373 percent was an unreliable indicator of his level of intoxication at the time of the killing.  The appellant submitted that her Honour's conclusion on this issue depended upon a number of assumptions which had not been made out:  that the appellant and Ms George were drinking at about the same rate, that the appellant and Ms George were drinking the same strength alcohol, that the appellant and Ms George had about the same tolerance for alcohol.  The appellant submitted that the available evidence was contrary to those assumptions, i.e. there was no comparison of their rate of drinking, the appellant preferred wine whereas Ms George drank vodka and although both were heavy drinkers, the appellant had been drinking heavily for a longer time than Ms George, i.e. 40 years compared to 25 years.
83In the alternative, the appellant submitted that even if her Honour's conclusion as to his level of intoxication were accepted, there was nothing to suggest that this would have changed the opinions of the psychiatrists.  Both were aware that he was an extremely heavy drinker and at least implicitly accepted that he was heavily intoxicated at the time of the killing.  The appellant referred to the report of Dr Nielssen of 14 September 2010 at p 9 where Dr Nielssen said:
""The history suggests Mr Goodridge was drinking heavily around the time of the offence and was probably affected by a large quantity of alcohol at the time of the offence itself.""
84In relation to the second limb of s23A(1) the appellant submitted that once her Honour had concluded that he was not substantially impaired by reason of abnormality of mind, her finding in relation to the second limb, i.e. that his impairment was not so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter, was almost inevitable.  The appellant submitted that if the Court concluded that her Honour's conclusion in relation to the first limb of s23A(1) was unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence, the Court would reach the same conclusion about the second limb of the defence.
Consideration
85There was no issue that at time of the killing the appellant had brain damage arising from his past use of alcohol, and possibly from a head injury suffered as a child, and that this was ""an underlying condition"" for the purposes of the substantial impairment provisions in s23A.  There was also evidence that the appellant was heavily intoxicated at the relevant time of the acts causing death.  Under s23A(3) of the Act, her Honour was obliged to disregard the effects of the appellant's self-induced intoxication in determining whether substantial impairment had been established by the appellant.  Accordingly, the question at the special hearing was whether the appellant's capacity was substantially impaired as a result of the underlying brain damage if the effects of the large quantity of alcohol he consumed were disregarded.
86In determining a ground of appeal which asserts, for the purposes of s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, this Court is required to apply the test set down in M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493 and restated in MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606.  
87The Court is to make an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and quality.  This involves a question of fact.  The Court is to determine whether the evidence is such that it was open to her Honour to conclude that the appellant was guilty.  The central question is whether the Court is satisfied that the appellant committed the offence of murder:  Morris v R [1987] HCA 50, 163 CLR 454 at 473; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at [11] - [14] and [20] - [22].
88In considering this ground of appeal, it is necessary to bear in mind that the appellant bore the onus of proof at trial on the balance of probabilities, to establish the partial defence of substantial impairment.  This is not a case where this Court is exercising its appellate function upon issues where the Crown bore the onus of proof, beyond reasonable doubt, on all issues.  Nevertheless, there is no reason in principle why an unreasonable verdict ground cannot apply to a case where the appellant bore the onus of proof at trial on the balance of probabilities(R v Welsh (1996) 90 A Crim R 364 at 373-374).  In considering this ground of appeal, the Court ought not consider the evidence piecemeal, but consider the totality of the evidence which was before her Honour.  This includes making its own assessment of what was contained in the ERISPs (The Queen v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; 236 CLR 397 at [128], Rasic v R [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [29]).  
89That having been said, the observation of Bathurst CJ in Kurdi v R [2011] NSWCCA 179 at [8] as to what should be done to comply with M v R is pertinent:
""8 ...  it is necessary for the Court to review the whole of the evidence available to the jury. That is not to say that a court of appeal conducts its own trial. The question which it must answer is whether it was open to the jury to reach the verdict which it in fact reached. Further, as was pointed out in M v The Queen supra, the Court must pay full regard to the primacy of the jury as the fact-finding tribunal ...""
90Before examining in more detail the reports of the psychiatrists, it is necessary to consider the appellant's submission to the effect that the appellant's consumption of alcohol should not be regarded as a voluntary form of intoxication.  The submission depends upon the observation of Dr Nielssen in his 23 March 2012 report (see [60] here of) where he said:
""However, because of his underlying brain damage, aggressive behaviour associated with Mr Goodridge's consumption of alcohol is due to the effect of alcohol on an abnormal brain, and is a form of pathological intoxication, rather than a voluntary form of intoxication in which the effects on behaviour can be anticipated.""
91Her Honour effectively answered that submission in pars [79] and [80] of her judgment (see [61] hereof).  In addition, there is the evidence of the lay witnesses to the effect that the appellant appeared to choose when and where he consumed alcohol in the months leading up to the killing.  While I agree with the appellant that only limited weight can be given to his assertion in the first ERISP that he could ""take it or leave it"" in relation to alcohol, that statement cannot be ignored.  Moreover, it is consistent with the observations of the lay witnesses.
92The provisions of s23A(3) and 428A of the Act need to be kept in mind.  Self-induced intoxication is defined to mean any intoxication except intoxication that is involuntary.  It would require a significant stretch of the statutory language to interpret that provision so that it encompassed the consumption of alcohol by an alcoholic.  It is not, however, necessary to reach a final conclusion on that issue.  It is sufficient that the evidence of the lay witnesses, taken with that of the appellant in the first ERISP, together with the concept of ""pathological intoxication"" as understood by psychiatrists, means that it was well open to her Honour to conclude, as she did at [80], that the appellant's consumption of alcohol was not involuntary.
93As was raised during oral argument, there is a difficulty for the appellant in maintaining his submission that there was full agreement between the psychiatrists that at the time of the offence he was substantially impaired by an abnormality of the mind, disregarding self-induced intoxication.  This arises from the conclusion of Dr Westmore in his report of 29 March 2012 that:
""On the balance of probability I would accept that this man suffers from an underlying condition specifically a disease of the brain which has its etiology in a past history of head injuries and alcohol abuse and the disease of the brain would represent an abnormality of mind which, at the relevant time, is likely to have impaired Mr Goodridge's capacity to control himself in relation to the deceased.
To that extent he would be eligible to raise the defence of substantial impairment to the charge of murder...."" (my emphasis)
What is significant is that Dr Westmore does not use the word ""substantially"" before the word ""impaired"" when expressing that opinion.  That appears to be intentional rather than an oversight because the next line commences with the words ""To that extent"".  I read that expression of opinion, as did the trial judge, as significantly qualified and not sufficient to satisfy the first limb of s23A(1).  Accordingly, it is not correct to say that there was a unanimity of opinion between the psychiatrists.
94The real issue under this ground of appeal is whether the other evidence in the categories identified by her Honour, which the psychiatrists were not privy to, was such that it was open to her Honour to conclude that the appellant had not established substantial impairment.
95Before considering the ERISPs in detail, it needs to be appreciated that Dr Nielssen saw the appellant for the first time approximately five and a half months after the offence and that his second interview took place a further 10 months later.  Both interviews were by way of audiovisual link.  In the case of Dr Westmore, his consultation took place approximately 21 months after the offence.  It is common ground that by the time Dr Nielssen saw the appellant on the third occasion and at the time Dr Westmore saw him, his underlying condition had greatly deteriorated and Dr Nielssen added dementia to his diagnosis.  This would make it particularly difficult for the psychiatrist to extrapolate backwards as to the appellant's condition at the time of the offending.
96The ERISPs were conducted within two days of the offending.  It is trite to observe that the ERISPs would provide a more accurate picture of the mental health state of the appellant at the time of the offending than would the later consultations.  A viewing of the ERISPs would have been of considerable assistance to the psychiatrists in reaching their conclusions as to the extent of the appellant's underlying impairment at the relevant time.  Neither psychiatrist had the transcript of the ERISPs, nor had they watched the electronic recordings.  
97The first ERISP took place between 11.16pm and 2.25am on 16/17 May 2009 and comprised 954 questions and answers.  The second ERISP commenced at 6.11am on 17 May 2009 and concluded at 8am.  It comprised 658 questions and answers.  In between the two ERISPs the appellant underwent a number of forensic procedures in relation to the clothing found in the railway barracks and the blood spatter.  These lengthy visually recorded interviews were played to her Honour during the course of the special hearing.  Her Honour was entitled to form a view on the issues in the case insofar as they affected the appellant, having regard to what he said and the way in which he said it in the ERISPs.  It was accepted that as a result of the time that the appellant had been in police custody, he was not intoxicated when the ERISPs took place.
98In the first ERISP, it is clear that the appellant had some difficulties with memory and his answers were somewhat rambling.  They were, however, responsive.  The appellant's memory as to dates was poor but his description of events was clear and appropriate.
99The observation by her Honour to the effect that one does not get a true appreciation of the appellant's capacity until one actually sees his performance on the ERISPs, conforms with my observation.  What does not emerge from the transcript of the ERISPs is the demeanour of the appellant in that he was alert and related appropriately with the two police officers.  During the course of the first ERISP, the appellant prepared a diagram of the railway barracks and indicated on it the room which he and the deceased were occupying and the location of other rooms in the building.
100The first time in the first ERISP that the appellant appeared to contradict himself was when he suggested that another person was in the barracks at the same time as he and the deceased, a person he identified as Keith Doherty.  Having said (accurately) that the deceased had been staying with him at the barracks for about four nights (Q.218) he subsequently said that Keith Doherty, an old friend of the deceased, had come to the barracks two weeks before at a time when the deceased was there (Q.223 - Q.250).
101The explanation for this contradiction is clearly that the appellant was not telling the truth about Mr Doherty and had tripped himself up.
102The tenor of the appellant's responses in the first ERISP is that he was attempting to deflect attention from himself and was not prepared to admit that he had behaved violently towards the deceased.  This is to be contrasted with the second ERISP where (perhaps as a result of having undergone the forensic procedures) the appellant made a number of admissions as to pushing, striking and ultimately sexually assaulting the deceased.  Apparently during one of the forensic procedures, the appellant told the investigating police officers that they would ""find something"" (Q.66).
103It was in the second ERISP that the appellant said that after consuming a large cask of wine with the deceased, he had assaulted her on a number of occasions by pushing her so hard that she fell back and hit her head (Q.115, Q.119-120, Q.122, Q.128, Q.141, Q.143, Q.146, Q.149, Q.156, Q.157).  The appellant described ripping off the deceased's clothes and having sex with her, going ""berserk"", being variously ""cranky"" and ""frigging angry"" with the deceased.  The appellant said that he wanted to ""teach her a lesson"" and ""to hurt her"".
104Having viewed the first and second ERISPs, I agree with her Honour that it is difficult to see how the psychiatrists could have made an accurate assessment of the appellant's mental state without having seen them.  Even the transcripts do not provide an adequate impression.  The ERISPs provide reliable evidence of the appellant's capacity and the extent to which it was impaired by his underlying condition (the brain damage) proximate to the time of the offence.  I agree with her Honour's conclusion at [100] that ""the ERISPs viewed as a whole display the extent to which the accused was capable of judging whether his actions were right or wrong and, to a lesser extent, his capacity to control himself.""
105In viewing the ERISPs I, like her Honour, have made due allowance for the observations of Dr Lennings to the effect that the appellant might present as being somewhat more intellectually sophisticated than he in fact was because of his superficial verbal skills.
106I agree with what her Honour said at [101] to the effect that the ERISPs do show that the appellant's capacity to understand events and judge whether his actions were right or wrong to be impaired by his underlying condition, but not substantially so.  That is a finding clearly open from a viewing of the entirety of the two ERISPs. 
107The appellant was shown to be oriented and reasonably coherent.  The answers he gave to questions were appropriate.  He remained substantially focused throughout the two lengthy interviews and was able in some instances to recall past events in considerable detail.  It is quite incorrect to characterise his recollection of past events as chaotic, patchy and incomplete.  When giving an account of his actions, he was able to recognise when his conduct had been wrong.  While his recollection as to dates and the precise timing of events displayed some confusion, when the investigating police officers took him back to pension day (Wednesday) he was able to work forward from there.
108The appellant's submission in relation to the evidence of the lay witnesses is that although he had lost his temper, shouted and made threats when intoxicated, he had not engaged in any actual violence.  He submitted that this, coupled with the absence of any violent behaviour on his criminal record, made it unsafe for her Honour to rely upon the evidence of the lay witnesses as establishing that there was a connection between his intoxication and the offence.  There is a circularity in that argument.  The offending behaviour was so violent that there was nothing in the appellant's history which would provide any indication that he would behave in that way.  There was nothing in his underlying mental condition historically to explain the behaviour.  There was no indication that his underlying mental condition had deteriorated in the months leading up to the offence.  Accordingly, that consideration was largely neutral.
109There was, however, a body of evidence, being that of the lay witnesses to the effect that in the six months or so leading up to the offence, not only had the appellant's behaviour become aggressive, but he was drinking a lot more.  This was the observation of Mr Knight who was a close friend of the appellant and so considerable weight needs to be given to his assessment.  There was another trigger identified by Mr Knight, not only for the increased drinking but also for the aggressive behaviour, and that was the eviction of the appellant from the flat where he had resided for the preceding 9 years.
110Mr Pollard, in paragraph 20 of his statement, referred to the appellant being involved in a fight at the Moss Vale Hotel on Wednesday, 13 May (the day before the offence).  We know that the appellant had been drinking heavily that day because of the evidence of Mr Knight to that effect.  There was no evidence of the appellant being involved in actual physical fighting before this incident.
111The evidence of the other persons, to whom her Honour referred, i.e. Ms Daley, Mr Parry and Mr McVie, is to similar effect.  They linked his aggressive behaviour to the consumption of alcohol.  The overall effect of the lay evidence referred to by her Honour is an escalation in the months leading up to the offence of both the appellant's drinking and of his aggressive behaviour.  Her Honour's conclusion at [68] that the appellant's behaviour was more controlled when his alcohol level was lower, and became more erratic and aggressive the more he drank, was not only open to her but was a proper inference to be drawn from the factual material to which she referred.
112I have concluded that the evidence of the lay witnesses, which was not available to the psychiatrists, was not only relevant to the central question of whether the appellant's brain injury substantially impaired his ability to control himself but had a real significance when considering that question and the associated question of the extent to which the consumption of alcohol had aggravated the situation by significantly reducing the appellant's self control.
113In relation to the appellant's level of intoxication, there seems little doubt that he was heavily intoxicated at the time of the offence.  By referring to the blood alcohol concentration of the deceased of .373 percent, her Honour was doing no more than giving a ""broad indication"" of his state of intoxication.  What is clear is that both he and the deceased had been drinking very heavily in the two days leading up to the offence.  The fact that the deceased and the appellant were of a similar size is important, as is the evidence of the appellant in the second ERISP that they had both been drinking a substantial quantity of cask wine on the day of the offence.
114The extent of the appellant's intoxication was an important matter.  Dr Nielssen assumed that he was heavily intoxicated at the time of the offence, but Dr Westmore did not have that information.  Neither of them, however, had any detailed information about the extent of the intoxication, particularly the possibility that the level of blood alcohol concentration could be in the order of .373 percent.  The level of the appellant's intoxication at the time of the offence was clearly a relevant and important consideration.
115It follows from the above analysis that it was well open to her Honour to reach a different conclusion to that of the psychiatrists.  This material, in particular the presentation of the appellant in the ERISP, was important to the resolution of both limbs of s23A(1) of the Act.  It was also important to note that the psychiatrists were not privy to much of this evidence when preparing their reports.
116It is trite to observe that juries (and judges sitting alone) are not bound to accept and act upon expert evidence but they are not entitled to disregard it capriciously - R v Hall (1988) 36 A Crim R 368 at 370; R v Klamo [2008] VSCA 75; 18 VR 644 at [44].  In this case, there was evidence which was not available to the experts and which was important upon the issue of substantial impairment.  In those circumstances, her Honour was entitled and bound to consider not only the psychiatric material but the whole of the evidence before her.  The other evidence, not available to the psychiatrists, enabled her Honour to assess the quality and weight of the psychiatric evidence, particularly when, as indicated, the opinion of Dr Westmore at least was somewhat qualified.
117The process of reasoning followed by her Honour was logical.  She identified a rational basis upon which the expert opinion was not to be accepted.  She comprehensively considered all of the evidence that was tendered during the special hearing.  It was open to her to conclude that the effects of alcohol played a significant role in the commission of the offence by the appellant.  It was open to her Honour to conclude in relation to the first limb of s23A(1) that it was the fact of the appellant's heavy intoxication superimposed on the underlying brain injury which resulted in substantial impairment rather than the brain injury alone.  
118As was accepted during the appeal, it was not only the psychiatric evidence which would determine the outcome of the special hearing.  Her Honour indicated that, even if she had been satisfied of substantial impairment in the absence of alcohol in accordance with the psychiatric material, she would still not have concluded that the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter under s23A(1)(b).  Expert opinion is not admissible under the second limb of s23A(1) and the issue is one for the tribunal of fact to determine.  This was a determination which has been described as giving rise to ""an issue which is quintessentially one for the determination of a jury"" (or a tribunal of fact):  R v Hucker [2002] NSWSC 1068 at [2] (Howie J); R v Potts [2012] NSWCCA 229.
119Her Honour's finding that the appellant had not discharged the onus of persuading her that any lessening of condemnation upon him was warranted was clearly open, given the nature and circumstances of the killing.  I am not satisfied that her Honour was bound to find that the partial defence of substantial impairment was made out on all of the evidence.  It was open to her Honour to find the offence of murder proven.  The verdict is not unreasonable.
120This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 2 - Her Honour erred in not directing herself that she should not reject unanimous expert evidence unless it was contradicted by other persuasive evidence.
Submissions
121The appellant's submission in relation to this ground is based more on form than on substance.  The appellant submitted that a judge in a judge alone trial is required to set out the relevant principles of law to be applied  and to take into account any warning which would be given to a jury - Fleming v R [1998] HCA 68; 197 CLR 250 at [31] - [33] where Gleeson CJ and McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Callinan JJ said, with reference to s33(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW):
""31 Finally, there may be a breach of s 33(3) with respect to the requirement to take a warning into account. The present appeal is put as such a case. Section 33(3) is framed in a fashion which differs from that of s 33(2) and which emphasises the particular importance attached by the legislature to the requirements of the law with respect to warnings. Section 33(2) requires the inclusion of principles of law applied and of factual findings relied upon, whilst s 33(3) obliges the judge to take the particular warning into account.
32 The obligation imposed by s 33(3) ""to take the warning into account"" is not only to be discharged but also to be seen to be discharged. The means by which the obligation may be discharged is that indicated in s 33(2), namely the inclusion in the reasons for judgment of the particular requirement for a warning among the principles of law applied by the judge. The various requirements that warnings be given have been expressed as rules of law or practice. The failure to give such a warning does not always lead to the setting aside of a conviction. But that does not mean that it is not a principle of law within the terms of s 33(2). The judge is obliged by s 33(3) to take the warning into account and in doing so the judge applies a principle of law.
33 The result is to require the recording and heeding of a warning, if one is called for in the particular case, and the giving of effect to it in a real sense by stating reasons why, notwithstanding the warning or as a consequence of it, a particular verdict is reached. A mere recording or statement of it, without more, would amount to an empty incantation. If these criteria are not satisfied in a particular case, then the judge is to be taken as not discharging the obligation imposed by s 33(3) that the warning be taken into account.""
122The appellant submitted that because her Honour had not in terms set out in her judgment that she had given a direction to herself that she should not reject unchallenged, unanimous expert evidence unless it was clearly contradicted by other evidence, she had not complied with s33(3) and as specified in Fleming, had not taken the warning into account.
Consideration
123It is true that her Honour did not in terms give herself a direction as set out in Ground 2.  Equally, a fair reading of her Honour's judgment as a whole, shows that it was a legal principle which her Honour was clearly applying throughout.  
124Having fully reviewed the medical evidence, her Honour said:
""97 The expertise and experience of the experts is undoubted. However, for the reasons set out below, their opinions are insufficient to persuade me that impairment is made out.""
Her Honour thereafter set out her reasons for not accepting the expert evidence.  She identified the other persuasive evidence which contradicted the evidence of the experts.  This was the ERISPs, the lay witness statements and the likely high degree of intoxication of the appellant at the time of the offending.
125The appellant's submission also fails to have regard to the qualification in Fleming at [30] where their Honours said:
""30 Seventhly, if the judgment fails to show that the judge applied a relevant principle of law, two possibilities are presented. One possibility is that, notwithstanding such failure, the principle was applied. Upon that hypothesis, there has been a breach of s 33(2) by reason of the omission from the judgment. The other possibility is that the principle was not applied, with the result that, independently of the question of breach of s 33(2), there has been an error of law which may attract at least the second limb of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. The obligation imposed by s 33(2) was to ensure that the judgment included all principles of law which the judge applied. Unless the judgment shows expressly or by implication that the principle was applied, it should be taken that the principle was not applied, rather than applied but not recorded.""
126In this case the judgment clearly shows expressly and by implication that the principle was applied.  There has accordingly been no error of law or miscarriage of justice.
127There also remains the difficulty identified in the discussion of Ground 1, i.e. that the opinion of the psychiatrists was not unanimous.  Even if by implication, one accepts that the effect of the reports of Dr Nielssen is to establish the partial defence, that is not the effect of the reports of Dr Westmore.  He does not in terms refer to ""substantial"" impairment.  That difficulty undermines the basis upon which Ground 2 is postulated.
Ground 3 - There was a miscarriage of justice because her Honour did not advise the parties that her Honour intended to reject the unanimous evidence of the expert witnesses and invite the parties to provide the witnesses with further material and call them to give further evidence.
Submissions
128In support of this ground, the appellant submitted that the trial had proceeded in an abbreviated fashion with no witnesses called to give oral evidence.  The Crown brief was tendered, including the reports of Drs Nielssen, Westmore and Lennings, the statements of the lay witnesses and the discs of the electronically recorded interviews.  Those discs were then played.  When the Crown closed its case, counsel for the appellant advised that there would be no additional evidence called by the appellant because the psychiatric reports were already in evidence.  The matter resumed on 19 April 2012 for submissions.
129The appellant noted that before her Honour the Crown had said:
""So I won't be submitting that s23A does not apply your Honour; I think I would be agreeing with Mr Winch in relation to his submissions on its applicability.""  (T.17.4.12, p25, line 33)
130The appellant also accepted that during submissions on 19 April 2012 her Honour expressed reservations about the evidence and in particular, about whether the defence had made out the partial defence under s23A.  The appellant submitted that referring to a ""slight reservation"" about the opinion of the psychiatrists was a very different thing to warning the parties that her Honour proposed to reject their opinion when they had not been required to give evidence and when their opinions had not been challenged by other expert evidence.  He submitted that in the circumstances of this case, her Honour should have invited the parties to provide the witnesses with the material which concerned her Honour and to have called the witnesses to respond to her Honour's concerns.
131The appellant submitted that such flexibility was one of the advantages that existed in a judge alone trial.  The appellant submitted that her Honour's failure to give the appellant the opportunity to meet her concerns amounted to procedural unfairness and consequently a miscarriage of justice. 
Consideration
132What the appellant's submission fails to acknowledge is that a special hearing is to be conducted as closely as possible as if it were a trial of a criminal proceeding (s21(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990).  It follows, that even in the case of a special hearing, the courts operate on the adversarial system.  This is particularly so in a case such as this where the appellant is unfit to plead.  In such circumstances, there is no question of the Crown dealing with matters by consent.  There are issues upon which the trial judge has to be satisfied.  This is so in relation to s23A where the second limb requires a value judgment made on all of the evidence except the medical evidence.
133In Madden v R [2011] NSWCCA 254 at [29] Simpson J (with whom Whealy JA and Hislop J agreed) said in relation to the adversarial system:
""29 ...  The roles of counsel and the judge are clearly defined and trespassing by one upon the role of the other is not to be encouraged, certainly not by this Court.  It is not the role of a judge to seek out evidentiary material, nor to determine the scope of the evidence put before him or her. ...  a judge must be very circumspect in intruding into the role of counsel.""
134Her Honour clearly raised for the parties' consideration the reservation she had about the psychiatric material.   She identified what was ""troubling her"" by drawing to the parties' attention the evidence that she saw as highly significant in terms of ascertaining the appellant's capacity to control himself, to understand whether his actions were right or wrong, and to understand events.  Her Honour specifically referred to the ERISPs and the content of the witness statements about observations of the appellant when intoxicated. 
135The indications given by her Honour as to her reservations were clear and by no means precluded the appellant either seeking an adjournment to meet those reservations or otherwise dealing with them.  The following exchanges between her Honour and counsel during the course of submissions makes that clear:
""HER HONOUR:  Can I tell you what's troubling me and that is in terms of ascertaining the accused's capacity to control himself to understand whether his actions are right or wrong and to interpret past events, in terms of my appreciation of that matter, his presentations on the ERISPs and also the lay witness statements are highly significant because they are, broadly, the ERISPs are broadly contemporaneous and one might imagine the effects of intoxication had warn off by the time the accused was interviewed by police, or worn off to the extent to which they can wear off, so that in the ERISP I would be seeing his underlying condition, albeit without provocation or without such provocation as is entailed in that kind of interview.
I've got that piece of real evidence, as it were, of his capacity to interpret past events and to know whether his actions are right or wrong.  It may be that the ERISPs don't necessarily tell me about his capacity to control himself but at least in respect of two out of three I would have thought that might be quite powerful evidence.
Then when one moves to the statement of the townspeople from Moss Vale who observe him on a, pretty much, daily basis and in various stages of intoxication, I notice that the person who took the statements - or the statements contain detail about what he's like when he's sober or, if I may say so, relatively sober, and what he's like as he becomes more and more intoxicated.  So I've got that factual foundation.  
...
The difficulty I have is those three categories or pieces of evidence, the ERISP, the statements and autopsy report, are a very significant foundation, I would have thought, in my consideration of whether the partial defence under section 23(1)(a) have been made out, and yet the psychiatrists were not privy to those matters except in a very limited extent Dr Westmore had the Crown's case statement.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Yes.
HER HONOUR:  So I just wondered whether, I would like to hear from both of you on why that wouldn't affect the weight I would give to Dr Westmore and Dr Nielssen's reports.
The other thing I would like you to address me on if I'm not satisfied the partial defence is made out either because I'm not satisfied of 23(1)(a) or 23(1)(b) what you would say about the relative terms, the limiting terms, that I should impose in either event for murder or manslaughter.
...
HER HONOUR:   In terms of that first matter I raised, though, about the reliability, obviously Doctors Westmore and Nielssen are very experienced, very qualified psychiatrists whose expertise is undoubted and unchallenged.  But I have a slight reservation about their opinions and the weight I should attribute to their opinions in light of the fact that they have not been provided with what I see as being quite, well, valuable, important evidence.  I'm not being critical of anyone here.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  I understand that.
I've just spoken to Mr Winch.  If your Honour feels that you would be assisted by the doctors receiving that material and providing a further report, as I understand it the defence doesn't object to that, and if that's what your Honour wishes then the Crown would  ...
HER HONOUR:  I'm not really sure if it's my wish.  The accused has an onus under section 23(a) he is relying on a construction of those psychiatrist reports and says, as Mr Winch has said in his submissions, that they are congruent and that essentially they establish or could be taken by me to establish the defence of substantial impairment under 23(1)(a).  You are both very experienced in running these cases so I'm not telling you how to run the case, it's just that seemed to me to be something which could, I suppose, make me pause more before accepting their opinions.
Now, there is still, notwithstanding that, a question of what they are actually saying in their reports because I don't think they address it.  Well, they address it in their own words as they should do but in terms of the decision I have to make under the statute it is a different decision and obviously their opinions will assist me in that.  So I'm not wanting to suggest to you that you should have prepared the evidence differently or run the special hearing differently.
I don't know that it would be appropriate for me to say send them away and look at this and maybe we'll have concurrent evidence.  I don't really think that's my role or that I should do that.
CROWN PROSECUTOR:  Yes your Honour.  I appreciate what your Honour is saying and I thought I appreciated the significance of the absence of the material in the reports, and that's why I got that latter report from Dr Westmore because there was the hiatus really in relation to the one issue that your Honour has to consider.
HER HONOUR:  Certainly their attention has both been directed to the fundamental question of substantial impairment and the relationship between the underlaying condition of the impairment and the intoxication.  They have certainly focused on that and, to my mind, addressed that in their own terms.
...
WINCH:  Your Honour, I do have the onus, and I can see the concern your Honour has or the reason that your Honour is giving considerable weight to the interviews that we saw and to the behaviour of the accused as noted by the townsfolk in Moss Vale.  
It's certainly the case that it's not the law that it's for the experts to tell your Honour or to give an opinion about it whether the partial defence is made out or not, but there is a large amount of psychiatric evidence and whether I put it too highly that it's congruent it certainly points all the one direction, if I can put it less forcefully, particularly in relation to the taking out of the equation of the intoxication and what is left.
...
HER HONOUR:  In terms of the underlying condition you can take it I accept there is an underlying condition.  It really a question of whether the impairment absent the intoxication would be substantial.  There is obviously an impairment, I can see that.  It's just whether I'm satisfied of that  ...
WINCH:  I see your Honour.  My response is that when the doctor saw him he was sober but he deteriorated; when we saw him on the ERISP and the doctors did not he was sober and in better condition than when the doctors saw him.  And my respectful submission is that he was not in good shape at all in terms of the impairment and in terms of his capacity.
HER HONOUR:  Although he did   I'm not suggesting he was in good shape and anything I have to say shouldn't be seen as making light of what is obviously a serious underlying condition but he did, it seemed to me, have a recall of past events such - I should say some recall of past events which was compromised perhaps by a horror or abhorrence of what he had done, and he also appeared to me to understand that he knew very well that what he had done was wrong.""  (T.19.4.12 - p, 29.1-32.47)
136The remaining exchanges between her Honour and counsel made it clear that her Honour retained the reservations which she had identified.  It was open to both counsel to have made an application to her Honour but they declined to do so.  That is a very different situation from a case where there has been a denial of procedural fairness.  This is not the sort of case where the judge remained silent and failed to reveal opinions thereby depriving the party affected of the opportunity to persuade the judge to change or modify those opinions.
137Having clearly expressed her reservations and concerns with respect to the psychiatric material, it was for the parties to decide what course they wished to take.  It was not her Honour's role to decide how they should proceed.  That was a matter for counsel.  Importantly, there was no requirement for her Honour to tell the parties outright that she intended to reject the evidence of the psychiatrists.  In fact her Honour may not have reached that conclusion at that point in time given that submissions were continuing.  The identification of her concerns was sufficient. 
138I am satisfied that no procedural unfairness took place and that this ground of appeal has not been made out.  
Application for leave to appeal against sentence
Ground 4 - The limiting term her Honour imposed on the appellant is manifestly excessive.
139Before setting out the appellant's submissions, it is important to understand the facts upon which her Honour sentenced the appellant.  The general factual background to the offending has already been set out.  The additional findings on sentence were:
""17 The deceased bled to death as a result of injuries she sustained to her vagina and her rectum for which the Forensic Patient was responsible. His conduct in pushing his right arm into her vagina and her rectum caused her to bleed profusely which resulted in her death. He intended to cause her grievous bodily harm to punish her because she would not comply with his wishes.

18 At the time the Forensic Patient killed the deceased he was grossly intoxicated and he also had an underlying condition of alcohol-related brain damage. His judgment was substantially impaired by reason of his self-induced intoxication, which tended to make him behave aggressively and erratically. His judgment was also impaired, but not substantially so, by the underlying brain damage.

19 Nonetheless the Forensic Patient appreciated at the time of these events that his acts towards the deceased would cause her really serious injury and that he intended to do so. There is, in my view, no basis to distinguish between his acts of pushing her to the floor, which he has admitted were done to hurt her and ""teach her a lesson"" and his acts of pushing his right arm into her vagina and rectum which caused her to bleed to death.
20 The Forensic Patient's actions that resulted in the deceased's death were horrendously violent and savage. They involved a substantial and determined use of force, which both violated and denigrated her in a brutal and degrading way.  He utterly abused the goodwill which she, from a generous concern for his welfare, had shown him by spending time with him in hospital and accompanying him to the railway barracks.""  (R v Goodridge (No 2) [2012] NSWSC 1180)

140At the time of sentencing, her Honour had before her a report of Dr Reutens, dated 6 August 2012.  Dr Reutens was a specialist in the psychiatry of old age.  Dr Reutens assessed the appellant as having deteriorated intellectually since he was assessed by Dr Lennings and Dr Nielssen.  When she examined him, he was aware that he was in prison but was not sure why this was so.  He could not remember what his charges were.  He was unable to recognise his own face in a mirror.  Because of his dementia, his life span was probably about 5 years.  
141Her Honour imposed a limiting sentence of 18 years.  When doing so, her Honour found that because of his mental condition, specific and general deterrence had no bearing on the sentence and that the appellant no longer presented a danger to the community.  In relation to the offending itself, her Honour found that there was no intention to kill, that the period of premeditation was very short and that the appellant's ability to form an intent would have been affected by his use of alcohol and his mental condition.
Submissions
142It was against that background that the appellant submitted that he was a severely disabled person whose judgment at the time of the offence was severely impaired, who had a very short estimated life span with no significant criminal record, who was unable to remember why he was in custody and who presented no danger to the community.  He submitted that it was difficult to see which, if any, of the purposes of sentencing were served by the imposition of a 18 year limiting term.
143The appellant submitted that in view of the findings of Dr Reutens, one might have expected that he would be transferred to a more appropriate facility than where he was currently located (i.e. the aged care and rehabilitation unit of the prison hospital).  He submitted that this had not yet happened and was unlikely to happen given that the role of the Mental Health Review Tribunal was not to provide the best environment for persons such as him, but to ensure that there continued to be an element of punishment in his continued detention (Matter of Adams - MHRT 25 July 2013).
Consideration
144The appellant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the limiting term imposed upon him, pursuant to the provisions of s23(1)(b) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, now known as the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.  A limiting term is defined by s23(1)(b) as:
""... the best estimate of the sentence the Court would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for that offence and the person had been found guilty of that offence.""
145This Court has held that limiting terms are ""the equivalent of the total term of the sentence that would have been imposed and not simply the minimum period that the person would have been required to spend in custody before being released to parole"" (R v AN [2005] NSWCCA 239 at [13]; R v Mailes [2004] NSWCCA 394; 62 NSWLR 181 at [22] - [41]).  In Mailes Dunford J (with whom Adams and Howie JJ agreed) said:
""43 The difficulty with the submission is that it is contrary to the statute which, as I have shown, requires the limiting term is to be set by reference to the head sentence that would have been imposed following a guilty verdict in a proper trial.  The fact that there is no provision for the equivalent of a non-parole period does not affect the term of the head sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, and there is no logical reason for reducing it simply because there is no provision for a non-parole period or its equivalent.""
146At the heart of the appellant's submission is that her Honour failed to have adequate regard to his mental illness, particularly as described by Dr Reutens.  Implicit in the submission is the proposition that although her Honour acknowledged that specific and general deterrence had no part to play and that the appellant no longer presented a danger to the community, she did not give effect to those findings.  Also implicit in the submission is the proposition that had her Honour properly taken those matters into account, she would have imposed a lesser limiting term.
147The difficulty for the appellant is that her Honour went into considerable detail in analysing his mental disability and its effect upon him, even though she had rejected the defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind in the special hearing.  Her Honour indicated that she was conscious of the fact that she was required to sentence the appellant upon the assumption that he was an offender who was not fit for trial but suffering from a mental illness.  Her Honour accepted that the appellant's heavy drinking ""tended to make him behave erratically and aggressively"".  She accepted that ""his intoxication impaired his judgment and contributed to abhorrent behaviour towards the deceased"".
148As her Honour appreciated, however, those considerations did not exhaust the matters to which she had to have regard.  In that regard, her Honour found that the most significant factor in determining the limiting term was the seriousness of the offence.  The details of that offending have been set out at [139] hereof.  The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment.  The limiting term imposed by her Honour against the background of this horrendously violent and savage attack was 18 years.  That sentence had appropriate regard not only to the seriousness of the offence but the requirements for retribution and denunciation which remained important.  The circumstances of this offence required that the acknowledgment of the victim and the wrong to society be recognised.
149As is clear from her Honour's judgment, she took those matters into account together with the appellant's mental illness and the effect which that had on sentence.  In reaching her conclusion as to the limiting term, her Honour appropriately acknowledged the difficulties involved when she referred to the observation of McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Howie and McCallum JJ agreed) in Bhuiyan v R [2009] NSWCCA 221 where his Honour said:
""30 In R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 Gleeson CJ recognised the difficulties faced by a court when sentencing persons with mental disorders. Those difficulties are compounded when a person is found not fit to be tried but, applying conventional principles a court is required to determine a limiting term. It is necessary to keep steadfastly in mind that although in most cases the serious mental illness will have deprived an offender of their usual capacity for reason and control it must not be allowed to overwhelm appropriate consideration of the circumstances of the offence and the other subjective features of the offender. The particular difficulties faced by an offender which may have contributed to the offence will be addressed by the Mental Health Review Tribunal which in appropriate circumstances may release the offender before the limiting term has expired.""
150I am not persuaded that the appellant has demonstrated that the limiting term imposed by her Honour was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" (Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 325).  This ground of appeal has not been made out.
151The orders which I propose are as follows:
(1) In relation to the conviction appeal, the appeal be dismissed.
(2) In relation to the application for leave to appeal against sentence, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.
152SIMPSON J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.  I also endorse the additional observations of Johnson J.
153JOHNSON J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL.  I agree with his Honour's judgment.
154I have viewed the recorded interviews held by investigating police with the Appellant on 16 and 17 May 2009.  Having done so, I express my complete agreement with the statements and conclusions contained at [96] - [107] of the judgment of the Chief Judge at Common Law.
155I wish to make some additional observations.  The audio-visual recording of police interviews with suspected persons has many benefits for the criminal justice system.  The clearest advantage has been to reduce, if not eliminate, what had previously been significant areas of dispute concerning records of interview (including admissions) said to have been made by an accused person.
156There are further benefits as well.  An audio-visual recording of a record of interview will assist a jury, Judge or Magistrate in assessing the account given by an accused person, frequently close to the time of the alleged offence, and the demeanour of the person during the interview.
157Where, as in the present case, there are issues likely to arise concerning the mental state of the accused person at the time of the alleged offence, an audio-visual recording of an interview with the person is an important piece of evidence.  There is significant scope for issues of this type to arise in this Court, in the context of a charge of murder where the defence of mental illness may arise and the partial defence of substantial impairment is available.  
158Where forensic psychiatrists are retained to examine an accused person charged with murder concerning issues of fitness to be tried, the defence of mental illness and the partial defence of substantial impairment, then it is desirable that legal representatives for the Crown and the accused person take steps to ensure that audio-visual records of interview are available to medical practitioners from whom opinions are sought.
159The present appeal concerns a special hearing. As Hoeben CJ at CL observes with respect to Ground 3, a special hearing is an adversarial proceeding to be conducted as nearly as possible as if it were a trial of criminal proceedings:  s.21(1) Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.  The procedure is to be contrasted with an inquiry as to fitness to be tried, an inquisitorial process to be determined on the balance of probabilities, and not to be conducted in an adversary manner, with the onus of proof not resting on any party to the proceedings:  ss.5-12 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.
160It was for her Honour to determine the real issue at the special hearing, namely whether the Appellant had established the partial defence of substantial impairment on the balance of probabilities, by reference to the evidence adduced by the parties.  That evidence included the audio-visual recordings of the two interviews conducted with the Appellant.  It was necessary for her Honour to have regard to that evidence in the discharge of the Court's functions at the special hearing.  Her Honour conducted the special hearing in accordance with the law, and in a manner which was fair to the parties.  
161I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL.

2705330,R v Murray [2014] NSWDC 200,"Sentence


1HIS HONOUR: Trevor Clayton Murray was jointly arraigned with Edward Joseph McGrath last Monday, 24 March 2014, on a charge alleging against each of them that they on 15 December 2012 at Cowra in the State of New South Wales being in company with each other did assault Peter Beattie thereby then occasioning to him actual bodily harm. 

2This is an offence contrary to s 59(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 which the Crown informed me and which I accept carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. It does not have a standard parole period. 

3The plea of guilty by Mr Murray to this particular charge which was the only charge on the indictment was apparently made some time before the end of last week. I have no evidence before me about the course of the negotiations but I accept from the discussion I had at the callover last Thursday that discussions relating to the matter to negotiate a possible resolution of the matter without a trial had been going on for some time. The prisoner had offered to plead guilty to an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm with which he was charged when the matter was before the Local Court and I accept that a letter was forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions representatives in relation to that matter in April last year. 

4In that regard that charge stood with either an offence alleged contrary to s 111(2) Crimes Act 1900 or 112(2) Crimes Act 1900 relating to the same set of events, depending upon which document amongst the various court attendance notices produced at the Local Court one wishes to rely upon. Learned counsel for the prisoner showed me some information, or some documentation, that suggested that the 111(2) Crimes Act 1900 offence, one that carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of five years, was not actually proffered until June when the accused was committed for trial. In any event it is neither here nor there because the offender was ultimately committed for trial, to summarise, for the aggravated breaking entering and commit serious indictable offence. 

5I am informed and I accept, that the offer to plead guilty to the assault occasioning actual bodily harm charge occurred before the formulation of that charge.

6Learned counsel for the prisoner particularly submitted that I should grant the prisoner either a discount of 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty entered in this Court or alternatively up to 25% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence. This was submitted having regard to the circumstances that I have shortly summarised above. It was submitted that if the accused had been permitted to plead guilty to the assault occasioning actual bodily harm charge at the Local Court that would have been matter that would have required consideration of the fact that they were in company.

7The counsel for the accused took the Court to a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Johnson [2003] NSWCCA 129, particularly I was drawn to the judgment of Bell J for the Court set out between [37] and [45]. I do not propose to analyse that judgment other than to refer to the discussion that I had with the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for the prisoner earlier today. The error of law in that appeal identified by the Court necessitating judicial intervention was the failure of the judge at the court below to have any regard to the applicant's willingness to plead guilty to the charge of manslaughter albeit that that offer was not accepted by the prosecution. Her Honour, giving the judgment for the Court of Criminal Appeal noted at [44], referring to other authorities including a judgment of Hidden J and a judgment of Grove J, that the learned sentencing judge was in error. The exercise of the judge's sentencing discretion having miscarried it was necessary for the Court to consider the question of sentence afresh (see [44]-[45]). I have also had regard the discussion that was set out within the judgment at [41] of some relevant considerations to the issue of discounts for matters, where offers or pleas of manslaughter are not accepted by the Crown per Hidden J at [17]-[21] in the decision of Cardoso [2003] NSWCCA 15.

8It is to be pointed out of course that that decision is of some assistance in addressing the question of circumstances in which courts err when they fail to give any relevant consideration in the circumstances there pertaining. But, of course, it is not a matter that is anywhere near on all fours with the situation I have here. In this particular matter in any event the accused had made an offer to plead to a charge that ultimately he did not plead guilty to. He was committed for trial. The plea of guilty to the current charge was entered into by him after negotiations a short time before the trial was to commence.

9In relation to the matter there has been a disputed facts hearing which has not been entirely unsuccessful, but the fact that there has been a disputed facts hearing in my view is not a matter that detracts from the need to recognise the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty.

10In the context of what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton, having regard to the range of discount that may be given to recognise the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, the discretionary character of the calculation of discounts, but the need for the Court to take into account all relevant considerations, I am of the view that a discount of 20% should be provided to the offender for that plea of guilty. The learned crown prosecutor suggested the range of discount should be between 10% and 15% and I have already set out the submission of counsel for the prisoner.

11In this matter there was a statement of facts which raised matters about which there was dispute requiring evidence from Mr Beattie and some additional evidence being tendered such as his statement, a statement from a physical evidence officer, photographs and the transcript of a triple-0 call made by Mr Beattie after he had been assaulted. Most of the disputed facts issues were matters particularly pertinent to the co-accused Mr McGrath. Although, this was a case, putting aside the pleading of the offenders being in company, where clearly the proof of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm element was a matter of establishing a joint criminal enterprise.

12Although the matter that particularly concerned Mr Murray fell away, given the evidence of Mr Beattie, I propose to resolve matters in dispute for the purposes of making a fact finding for the sentence of Mr Murray.

13The daughter of the prisoner Mr McGrath, as I understand, it was injured in what was described as a disturbance the night before the assault upon Mr Beattie at the home of another person, Ms Gordon, in Cowra. Mr McGrath, the facts clearly show, believed that the person who had injured his daughter was in fact Mr Beattie. He had a belief that Mr Beattie had kicked his daughter in the head. Whether this allegation against Mr Beattie is true or not was not a matter dwelt upon in the sentence proceedings. The facts make it clear that the offender Mr Murray and Mr McGrath are to be sentenced in the context that was Mr McGrath's belief.

14Mr McGrath went to Mr Beattie's home at Cowra at about 3pm in the afternoon clearly to confront him in relation to what he believed to be an assault upon his daughter. He went in company with Mr Murray and was driven there by another person referred to in the facts who at a later stage intervened in the altercation between Mr McGrath, Mr Murray and Mr Beattie. That person was Sandra Anderson.

15Mr Beattie saw the motor vehicle that was carrying Mr McGrath and Mr Murray arrive and as they approached him he retreated into his home followed by the two offenders. He retreated after Mr McGrath said to him the words, ""You're the fellow who kicked my daughter in the head last night"". The facts tendered in this Court do not reveal that he disputed that particular allegation. 

16The two accused then entered his house and Mr Beattie was assaulted in the manner that has been particularised. What is clear from the evidence of Mr McGrath, which is of course relevant in the sentencing proceedings, was that he struck Mr Beattie with a punch and Mr McGrath choked Mr Beattie in a struggle that apparently moved, for part of the time while the both men were on the floor, from the hallway ultimately to a bathroom. 

17In the course of the struggle Mr Beattie suffered some injuries. A witness saw some blood coming out of what looked like two lacerations on the top of his head and there were some graze marks on his top left cheekbone. These injuries are, in the absence of any medical evidence, relatively minor. I accept that Mr Beattie was frightened by the arrival of the two men and certainly entitled to be frightened at the fact that he was approached and assaulted in his own home. He did not know the two offenders well as I understand it, in fact Mr McGrath was a stranger to him although apparently from the evidence of Mr Murray I take it that at least he had met Mr Murray the night before. He certainly knew why the men were there.

18The facts are relatively silent about the actions of Mr Murray other than his presence and perhaps some actions at one point in holding Mr Beattie. This brings me really to the matters in dispute.

19The facts allege that the offender Mr McGrath was on Mr Beattie's back with his knee in his back with both hands around his neck pulling his head back. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that allegation has been established. A further allegation that was the subject of dispute was set out in para 11 which alleged that, 

""The struggle on the floor continued during which the offender Murray held Mr Beattie while the offender McGrath stood and stomped on the back and side of Mr Beattie's head"". 

20Mr Beattie's evidence in this court resiled from a clear assertion that Mr Murray was in fact holding him at the time that he alleged that occurred. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr McGrath stood and stomped on the back and side of Mr Beattie's head.

21The other matter that was primarily in dispute relating to Mr McGrath was the allegation that as they departed Mr McGrath turned and told Mr Beattie that if he called the police he would kill him. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that allegation was made.

22The reason I have come to these conclusions are firstly that Mr Beattie in the detail of his evidence did resile from the detail of his statement. The injuries that he suffered are not, in my view in light of the evidence of Mr Beattie, consistent with being stomped on the head whether it be by a pair of sandshoes or other light-weight footwear or boots as claimed by Mr McGrath. Certainly there are no injuries consistent with the allegation of Mr Beattie, that he was stomped on the head in a way that his head came into collision with the concrete floor of the bathroom. The injuries were relatively minor. But there are other matters to take into account. The physical evidence from the physical evidence officer and the photographs do not support the very graphic account that Mr Beattie gave in his statement of the manner in which the men forced entry, on his version, into the house. In fact Mr Beattie made claims in his statement, particularly at para 10, which are contradicted by the physical evidence. As it transpired the charge preferred by the Crown so far as pleading is concerned at least shows that the Crown abandoned an allegation of forced entry in that material respect.

23Mr Beattie spoke to a triple-0 operator after the assault has occurred. I take into account that he would have been shocked by what had happened to him, but I note in relation to that triple-0 call that he made no reference to the stomping that he later disclosed to the police when he made his statement. He did, however, as the Crown pointed out to me, in the triple-0 call referred to the fact that one of the offenders, that was Mr McGrath as I understand it, had threatened him that if went to the police he would kill him. 

24In the scheme of things, however, I do not regard this as a serious threat. Yet it is a matter that represents to my mind Mr McGrath mouthing off in the spirit of aroused emotions, or in the spirit of departing in high dudgeon having been involved in the assault of Mr Beattie earlier.

25In relation to the other matter, not of really great moment as far as I was concerned that I have not already referred to, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr McGrath had to be pulled away by another person. Mr Beattie in fact resiled from a positive assertion of that. 

26I accept that the offender was called away by Ms Anderson. I accept that there is absolutely no doubt as was apparent from Mr McGrath's own evidence, that he was very angry. That is a matter that will need to be addressed at some later time in the context of his criminal history and other matters with the aid of submissions from his counsel.

27It is to be fairly said in relation to the matter of course that it seems a little unclear as to why Mr Murray involved himself in this matter. It would appear as though he was sort of picked up at some time during the afternoon and taken to the house. He apparently had no particular grudge against Mr Beattie. But then again he played a very minimal role. Certainly there is no allegation in the facts tendered that he struck a blow. But again he stands to be sentenced for his participation in the relevant joint criminal enterprise.

28The prisoner was arrested on 15 December 2012 and granted bail. I note as it be relevant to all the matters I have to take into account under s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 21A of the Act and of course s 44, that on his release on bail it is clear the offender committed other offences between then and April 2013. He then came into custody in relation to those fresh matters and received a gaol sentence on 19 June 2013, at which date as I understand it he was committed for trial in relation to the matters with which I am concerned.

29The Magistrate for some reason best known to himself when fixing a non-parole period of six months for the fresh charges backdated the sentence to March instead of April. That matter is not entirely explained by the custody record or the criminal history. He directed that the offender be released to parole in early September 2013 but the offender remained in custody because he was bail refused in relation to the current matter in its various guises and he remained in custody until he was granted bail by the Supreme Court some time in late November. Bail could not be entered until 4 December 2013.

30Once he was granted bail he was automatically released to parole in accordance with his Honour's direction. But he breached that parole it would seem by walking out of Oolong House, a drug rehabilitation program conducted in Nowra, particularly concerned with providing assistance to Aboriginal people. 

31He walked out of that program on or about 20 December 2013, as I understand the evidence. I have had very close regard to the prisoner's evidence about his reasons for leaving Oolong House. I accept that whilst in custody the prisoner had suffered a number of very significant personal tragedies including the loss of his mother and his sister and was unable to go to funerals and had no doubt a great deal of grief to resolve. 

32He also gave evidence about the temptation of drugs within Oolong House. But, ultimately on analysis, both in the manner of its giving and the detail of it his explanations for leaving Oolong House, given all the circumstances, including the fact that he was on parole and on Supreme Court bail were not convincing or satisfactory. 

33The truth of the matter is when one has regard to his evidence and his explanations for leaving the program, even accepting an underlying sense of grief, he chose to discharge himself from the program because it did not suit him to remain there. This led to his re-arrest on his breach of bail and I assume by reason of a decision made to revoke his parole which was revoked he is in custody serving the balance of the sentence, the balance of sentence being something in excess of five months.

34I am informed that he has spent in custody in relation to the current matter slightly shorter than three months that is solely referrable to this matter. The Crown drew my attention to the fact that he was still serving the sentence imposed by the Magistrate, but whilst I note that of course, that submission ignores the fact that but for this matter he would have been released to parole on the expiry of the non-parole period in September 2013.

35To endeavour to ensure full recognition of the time spent in custody I propose to backdate the sentence I impose to, for three months from the date he pleaded guilty, not today's date which was 24 March 2014.

36I have played close regard to the evidence the prisoner has given. I accept the prisoner has had a most disadvantaged upbringing which is reflected in his past social and present social circumstances. It is also reflected eloquently in one sense by his history of offending. 

37I accept, of course, that he had a close relationship with his mother, that he and his mother and his siblings were abandoned by his father when he was of a young age. I accept in the context of his upbringing on Erambie Mission that his social circumstances have contributed to his long-standing use or abuse of drugs and his dependency upon prescribed and prohibited drugs.

38The prisoner did give evidence that on the night before the commission of the offence, and I take that to include the early morning, that he had taken drugs such as amphetamines, oxycontin and the like. He explained when asked if he was affected by drugs that the drugs were, ""coming through (his) system"". But the witnesses' evidence about the extent that he was affected by drugs was quite unconvincing and quite imprecise and in my view deliberately guarded. In any event there does not appear to be any particular evidence within the facts or the other material presented to me objectively of the effect of the offender being substantially affected by drugs or alcohol.

39I bear in mind it takes quite a deal of time for any sort of drug, be it prohibited or prescribed, to be eliminated from a person's blood. But this offence occurred at 3pm in the afternoon. As I said in any event his evidence was ultimately unconvincing.

40The prisoner also gave evidence in relation to a number of matters that are set out in the pre-sentence report that was prepared for the offences for which he was sentenced in June 2013 at the Cowra Local Court. That report confirms, given the extensive contact the prisoner has had with the Probation and Parole Service or Community Corrections, a long history of binge drinking and drug abuse dating back to the age of ten and in more recent years abuse of oxycontin immediately prior to the preparation of the report in May 2013.

41The report chronicles the attempts by the prisoner to deal with relationship issues that have led to a number of instances of domestic violence committed by him against others and other related charges over a period of time. The report notes the prisoner's continual failure to either respond favourably to those programs, to undertake them or to complete them. For example in 2011 he self-discharged from a drug rehabilitation program and claimed at the time that he would never return or not return to a residential program. He provided, as I said, a history of drug and alcohol abuse over a lengthy period of time, but he is noted to have a failed to respond to suggestions from Probation and Parole Officers to undertake treatment programs. I accept that a lot of his past offending to that point had been dominated by his abuse or use of drugs and alcohol.

42An escape from police custody denied him an opportunity to undertake drug rehabilitation programs in custody although he was able to undertake some ""recovery"" programs. Whilst the prisoner gave evidence before me of being in custody and wishing to improve himself and address offending behaviours it is to be borne in mind that the prisoner is now 40 years of age and as the criminal history reveals as the probation and parole service report reveals he has had many opportunities in the last ten years for example which has not taken or specifically renounced.

43In this particular matter, in the context of the prisoner's aboriginality, I was required, it was said in the submissions to have regard to what we have described in submission as ""Bugmy principles"". I sought assistance from counsel as to how those particular principles in conjunction with ""Fernando principles"" might be pertinent to this particular sentencing exercise. 

44In early October 2013 the High Court handed down decisions in two judgments which were directly related, although concerned with different applicants. One decision was Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37. The other was Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38. 

45The grant of special leave in Bugmy concerned a number of issues, some which did not find favour with the learned judges of the High Court in majority, although the matter was remitted ultimately to the Court of Criminal Appeal because of the failure of the Court of Criminal Appeal at first instance to properly consider the matter, in the absence by the prosecution of a clear articulation of the basis upon which it could be recognised as a Crown appeal.

46In Bugmy v The Queen, at [41], the majority of the Court said this,

""Aboriginal Australians as a group are subject to social and economic disadvantage measured across a range of indices but to recognise this is to say nothing about a particular offender. In any case in which it is sought to rely on an offender's background of deprivation and mitigation of sentence it is necessary to point to material tending to establish that background"".

47This observation was made in the context of complaint being made, if that is the correct expression, of the fact that the mere assertion of something as being so may not necessarily provide a basis for finding that it is so.

48This general observation at the beginning of that passage is one example of judicial expression reflecting upon the findings of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in custody where The Hon Elliott Johnson QC concluded,

""It is important that we understand that the legacy of Australia's history as it helps to explain the deep sense of injustice felt by Aboriginal people, their disadvantaged status today and their current attitudes towards non-Aboriginal people in society. In this way it is one of the most important underlying issues that assists us to understand the disproportionate detention rates of Aboriginal people.""

49In the subsequent in time judgment in Munda, the majority made this observation at [52]ff,

""In R v Fuller-Cust [2002] 6VR 496, Eames JA observed that in the application of the principle stated by Brennan J (in Neal v The Queen), regard to an offender's Aboriginality serves to ensure that a factor relevant to sentencing which arises from the offender's Aboriginality is not 'overlooked by a simplistic assumption that equal treatment of offenders means that differences in their individual circumstances related to their race should be ignored'. Moreover, the personal disadvantages affecting an individual offender may be, because of the circumstances in which they are engendered, so deep and so broad that they serve to shed light on matters such as, for example, an offender's recidivism.""

50Their Honours went on to say, 

""Mitigating factors must be given appropriate weight, but they must not be allowed to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instance offence. It would be contrary to the principles stated by Brennan J in Neal to accept that Aboriginal offending is to be viewed systematically as less serious than offending by persons of other ethnicities.""

51Their Honours said, 

""It may be argued that general deterrence has little rational claim upon the sentencing discretion in relation to crimes which are not premeditated. That argument has special force where prolonged and widespread social disadvantage has produced communities so demoralised and alienated that it is unreasonable to expect the conduct of individuals within those communities to be controlled by rational calculation of the consequences of conduct. In such cases it may be said that heavy sentences are likely to be of little utility in reducing the general incidents of crimes, particularly crimes of passion.""

52Their Honours went on to say, however, there are three points to be made. First of all, the criminal law is not limited to the utilitarian value of general deterrence, special deterrence or personal deterrence as a relevant matter. The other point to be made is that sometimes addictions may be relevant to the assessment of re-offending. The third point their Honours raised was that raised by Gleeson CJ in the Court of Criminal Appeal decision in New South Wales of Engert,

""Where matters that point in one direction may also point to another direction such as a mental disability that might leaven the need for greater weight to be placed on general deterrence but leading to greater weight to be placed on personal deterrence"".

53I accept, of course, what the High Court majority said in relation to Fernando principles as they have been described, that is that the principles laid down by Wood J in the sentencing exercise of Mr Fernando from Brewarrina, where the High Court observed, 

""The experience of growing up in an environment surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may leave its mark on a person throughout life. Among other things a background of that kind may compromise the person's capacity to mature and learn from experience. It is a feature of a person's makeup and remains relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence notwithstanding that the person has a long history of offending.""

54There can be no doubt, of course, that judicial officers are entitled to take judicial notice of matters that are widely known. The Evidence Act specifically addresses that issue, particularly at s 144. In that regard, of course, it is a matter of which the Court can take judicial notice of the social circumstances of the community from which this offender comes. It has been the subject of a great deal of discussion in a range of places.

55The principles that emerge in decisions such as Bugmy, Fuller-Cust, Munda, Fernando and the like will continue to have currency, even if there be continual offending. The Court of Criminal Appeal itself has said on a number of occasions that there is not a ""sunset"" clause on relevant considerations in this respect and particularly this is what the High Court ultimately found in Bugmy. How could it be otherwise? Underlying factors that contribute to offending are not removed necessarily by intervening custodial sentences before particular offending. 

56Community Corrections assessed that Mr Murray was suitable for ""medium to high level of intervention"" by it. He certainly needs intensive supervision whilst on parole, although that has been unsuccessful in the past. To come to grips with the contributing factors to his offending. Particularly his reckless and frequent use and abuse of alcohol and drugs, that has, as his criminal history makes clear, particularly led to acts of violence, usually in a domestic situation.

57Of course it is common knowledge that people such as Noel Pearson and Professor Michael Dobson have on a number of occasions reflected upon the concern about the incidence of domestic violence within Aboriginal communities. They have particularly called upon Aboriginal men and elders to take responsibility for their actions. This offence, of course, is not a domestic violence offence. It is a case of two men in a sense taking the law into their hands to address a grievance held by at least one of them against the victim. Whilst this prisoner apparently knew Mr Beattie he had no grudge against him, as I understand the evidence, and really had no reason to be involved other than whatever loyalty he had to Mr McGrath.

58I accept in the assessment of the objective facts, however, that his contribution to the level of violence, such as it was, was minimal. That having been said it is the case that this is a matter where, in the context of general sentencing principles, without regard to s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, two offenders took the law into their hands in the metaphorical sense, if not the literal sense.

59The other aspect of this matter arising from the aggravating factors particularised under s 21A(2), is that the offence was committed in the home of the victim and that is an identified aggravating factor under that particular provision.

60The offender's criminal history understood in the context that I have just earlier outlined by reference to principle is still a lengthy one, going back to the Children's Court, reflecting the dysfunction and dislocation of his upbringing. It reports that the first time he appeared at the Children's Court he was only aged ten years of age. This is a very very sad situation which may highlight the extent of his disadvantage. I have little doubt that he was socialised at a young age in a manner that made him accept some aspects of anti-social behaviour, including acts of violence and drug abuse, as accepted norms.

61However, in fairness, although he appeared in the Children's Court in 1984 for the first time and had many appearances in the Children's Court and the Local Court, his first conviction as I calculate it for assault was in 1995 when he was 22. He has a conviction for robbery in 1998. Thereinafter there are a large number of findings of guilt for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, stealing from a person, accessory after the fact to robbery, common assault, contravening apprehended domestic violence orders and the like, for which he has been variously imprisoned or given terms of imprisonment that have been suspended. I note in 2008 a suspended sentence was revoked and he was ordered to serve the 18 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 months, by committing a further act of contravening an apprehended violence order. I hasten to say that the offending with which I am concerned is quite distinct from his course of conduct in a domestic situation.

62In recent years there has been an increasing intensity of offences of violence, either assault occasioning actual bodily harm, contravening apprehended domestic violence orders, common assault and the like. There is no suggestion in the record that the prisoner's previous convictions for assault involve him being hired to provide muscle for others to address their grievances. He does, however, have an unenviable history of violence, much of which has been directed at his partner, or his then partner, as I would understand the record.

63In sentencing the offender I have been provided with the victim impact statement provided by Mr Beattie and I take it into account in accordance with the legislation. However, there are a number of matters particularised in that victim impact statement that go outside the facts alleged by the Crown and the Crown has indicated that I should pay no heed to matters that fall outside the statement of facts.

64I accept, of course, that Mr Beattie no doubt was quite shaken by the assault given the fact that it was committed in his home and I accept that he may, for a period of time after that, have maintained some heightened vigilance.

65In the submissions from learned counsel for the prisoner I had something of a lengthy debate with him about aspects such as the discount to be given to the prisoner for the plea of guilty and of course the relevance of Fernando principles although that was not a matter upon which we dwelt.

66I also take into account the submissions put on behalf of the prisoner in respect of the relevance of the fact that the offence with which I am concerned, if dealt with summarily, carries a maximum penalty as a jurisdictional limit of two years imprisonment. I appreciate the prisoner did not have the opportunity to plead to this matter at the Local Court. He was not charged with this matter. The reason for that, it is clear, was because he was charged not just with assault occasioning actual bodily harm but the more serious charges to which I earlier referred. However, the relevance of the maximum penalty for an offence if dealt with summarily has been discussed in a number of authorities. Counsel took me to some extracts from a practice and I am mindful of judgments such as Doan.

67As I have said earlier, I accept the social context of the prisoner's upbringing as a relevant matter and I have taken it into account. However, bearing in mind his criminal history does not entitle him to any particular leniency, fully understood as I said in the wider context, bearing in mind the time that he has been in custody and his conduct since he was originally granted bail in relation to this matter, having regard to the maximum penalty of the offence in the context of the provisions of s 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I can do nothing else other than impose a term of imprisonment.

68I have clearly had regard to the terms of s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and I need not reiterate the various matters sometimes referred to as ""guideposts"" pointing in opposite directions, as was the expression used in the High Court judgment of Veen (No.2) from 1988.

69I have determined in this matter that there are special circumstances pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I realise the prisoner has had many opportunities to be released early on a finding of special circumstances. But I still feel that notwithstanding his slips before it is to his advantage and the community's advantage, in the manner discussed by Wood J in Blackman and Walters, that he continue at least at this point to have that advantage. But the truth of the matter is he may get to the point one day when courts will just stop fixing non-parole periods altogether.

70In relation to the matters that arise under s 21A(3) I have concluded that the injury and loss suffered by the victim was not substantial. I accept the plea of guilty as a mitigating factor. The prisoner has expressed remorse, not expressed in a timely fashion. But I am prepared to accept that as a mitigating factor of some small measure in this matter. Of course his prospects of rehabilitation and his likelihood of re-offending are matters about which I cannot make a positive finding on balance in his favour. That would not be a reasonable conclusion in light of his past performance.

71As I said at the outset, I have ultimately determined in the context of the maximum penalty the starting point should be 20 months imprisonment with a 20% discount. The sentence imposed should be 16 months imprisonment. The sentence shall date from 24 December 2013 for the reason that I have given. I am mindful of the fact, as I said earlier, the prisoner is currently serving the balance of parole, however this matter does not involve any particular breach of conditional liberty as I understand it. I am mindful of the decision of Simpson J in Callaghan from 2006 but I am also mindful of the terms of s 47 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the terms of that provision. 

72In the context of this sentencing exercise that means that I cannot prospectively fix a sentence from today's date because of the terms of s 47 and the cases that have interpreted it. I have decided in any event to backdate the sentence so that I can give full effect to the time spent in custody. As I have earlier said the submissions made by learned counsel for the prisoner were quite proper and appropriate in assisting me in that regard.

73In relation to the offence to which you pleaded guilty you are convicted. You are sentenced to a total sentence of 16 months imprisonment. I fix a non-parole period in relation to that sentence of nine months. That term of imprisonment will commence on 24 December 2013 and will expire on 23 September 2014. I direct that you be released to parole on that date. Do you understand that? 

74OFFENDER: Yes.

75HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown any technical matters from you?

76CREASEY: No your Honour.

77HIS HONOUR: Any technical matters from you Ms Pettet?

78PETTET: No your Honour.

2705331,R v Fossey [2014] NSWDC 49,"Sentence

1HIS HONOUR: The offender, Adam Fossey, a man of 27 years of age and thus some maturity, made the decision one day that he would involve himself in drug supply. That was not only an unwise decision, it was a criminal one. It is remarkable that Mr Fossey who has done much that he can be proud of in his life, and who has no prior convictions, should decide to become a drug supplier simply as a favour for his flatmate.

2Police became aware of the matter when they observed what appeared to be a transaction involving the supply of drugs. They saw a man approach a motor vehicle driven by Mr Fossey. There was a short conversation and the two separated. Police then stopped the vehicle driven by Mr Fossey and searched it. They found a substantial quantity of cocaine in three bags in the centre console of the car. 

3Mr Fossey now faces charges involving the supply of 27.74 grams and asks that when I sentence him for that matter I take into account on a Form 1 a charge relating to the possession of 1.95 grams of cocaine. Fortunately for the offender police were able to intercept telephone calls which revealed his role. Those telephone calls suggested that it was the offender's job to pick up the drugs and to deliver them, thus I have no trouble accepting the categorisation of the offender's role that Mr Williams puts forward. His role was to accept drugs and deliver them to someone else. That of course is still a serious criminal matter. The maximum penalty indeed is imprisonment for 15 years. 

4 Anyone who has been involved in the criminal law for any length of time can understand why drug supply offences are treated as seriously as they are. The commission of such crimes harms not only the users of the drugs but, like ripples on a pond, the harm spreads outwards, as drug users commit crimes to obtain money to purchase their drugs, as drug suppliers import drugs to meet their demand and in a very real sense the entire community suffers because of offences such as this. It is easy to simply look at the offender's conduct and say all he did was on one occasion to get drugs intending to move them to another place but for the reasons I have just outlined any involvement in drug supply, including involvement as a delivery person, is serious criminal conduct. 

5The offender's background was described by a psychologist who prepared a report for the Court as ""average"". His parents separated when he was six and he has had little contact with his mother since then. He was brought up at first by his father but then moved in with his grandparents, with his grandmother becoming his primary carer. He did well enough at school and after leaving school has an enviable work history. He worked selling televisions but then decided on a change of career and moved into personal training. That was not much of a success, he had difficulty getting clients and of course those clients he did have wanted to do their personal training outside normal work hours, with the result that Mr Fossey was working very early in the morning to late at night, with a large gap in the middle. 

6What led to the commission of this offence is the offender's involvement with less than desirable friends and companions after he moved into accommodation in Rushcutters Bay. He was vulnerable at the time because of a number of circumstances. Firstly his grandmother, who was more like a mother to him, passed away. That led to an increased use of both drugs and alcohol on the offender's part. He also had a falling out with his father with the result that they were not speaking. He experienced depression, anxiety and stress. It was in those circumstances that when his flatmate ask that he obtain the drugs and deliver them to him he said yes. 

7Since the commission of this offence things have changed. He is now living again with his father and his stepmother. He is seeking help from a psychologist and he is not associating with those with whom he used to associate. It is to be hoped that this offence is a one-off matter. References tendered today attest to the underlying good character of the offender. There is a reference from his current employer, this speaks very highly of him. It appears that that reference was made in circumstances where the referee was made aware of the charge involving drugs. Notwithstanding that disclosure the offender is highly regarded by his employer and it appears that he has a future there. Other references reveal that this offence is very much out of character and can be explained by the particular circumstances which I have referred to earlier. 

8Consistent with the offender's attitude towards his offending, he has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity so the sentence I impose upon him will be 25% less than it would otherwise have been. 

9Of course there is a wellknown principle of law that must be applied here. Those who traffic in drugs to a substantial degree must ordinarily receive a sentence of full time custody unless there are exceptional circumstances. That principle of law is subject to one qualification, the cases which stated that principle all pre-date the introduction of the sentencing option of an Intensive Corrections Order. No case that I am aware of has examined the application of that principle now that such a sentencing option is available. 

10In any case however I am not satisfied that the offender was trafficking to a substantial degree. Of course one-off supplies can nevertheless be categorised as trafficking to a substantial degree, but in this case where it was a single occasion involving a relatively small quantity of drugs and the offender's role was limited to being that of a delivery man, I am able to say without any hesitation that this was not trafficking to a substantial degree. Thus exceptional circumstances need not be demonstrated in order to avoid a full time custodial sentence. On the other hand there is no principle of law that says those who are not trafficking to a substantial degree should not receive sentences of full time imprisonment in an appropriate case. 

11Sentences of imprisonment are very much sentences of last resort, but a fundamental rule in sentencing is that a sentence must reflect the objective gravity of an offender's conduct. Acting as a delivery man for your flatmate whereby you collect drugs and deliver them to him is, as I have made clear I trust, serious criminal conduct. I am satisfied that a sentence of imprisonment is therefore required. 

12Mr Williams suggests that it would be appropriate to suspend such a sentence, in the event of course that the sentence I have selected is two years or less. I do not propose to suspend the sentence of imprisonment. As the Crown accurately pointed out general deterrence is of importance in this case. People involve themselves in drug supply activities for various reasons. Some seek to make a profit out of it, some seek to support their own drug habits, but whatever the precise cause it is undeniable that many people do engage in drug supply and those offences cause great harm. General deterrence is of prime importance in this case. I do not consider that a suspended sentence of imprisonment would have sufficient deterrent effect. I am however prepared to investigate the possibility of the offender being able to serve his sentence of imprisonment other than by full time custody. I have decided that the sentence I will impose upon him, taking into account the matters on the Form 1 is likely to be two years or less. Accordingly I will grant him bail and refer him for assessment as to his suitability to serve that sentence of imprisonment by means of an Intensive Corrections Order. 

13Mr Fossey's bail is therefore continued to 2 o'clock on 23 May and I request an CO report. I will also order a transcript of my remarks that I have just delivered. I note that the matter on the 166 certificate has been taken into account on the Form 1.

ADJOURNED TO FRIDAY 23 MAY 2014 AT 2PM

		12 May 2014",2014-03-26 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705332,R v BW [2014] NSWDC 45,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Judges have to deal with young people who commit serious offences with depressing regulatory. One thing is particularly important to be borne in mind, and that is that children of 15, as the offender was when he committed his serious offence, do not have the same level of maturity as a 25 or 30 year old. Sometimes we hear phrases like, ""If a child is going to act like an adult, he or she should be sentenced like an adult"". Certainly serious offending requires appropriate responses from the Courts, but nothing should dilute the important principle which assesses the moral culpability of an immature 15 year old as being less than the moral culpability of an adult who committed a similar offence. 

2I have begun these remarks on sentence with that observation because of the two most important matters in this sentencing exercise, the seriousness of his misconduct and his youth. 

3On 29 April 2013 the offender came across a Mr Wong, the ultimate victim of the offender's crime. It appears that this was a case of mistaken identity, that the offender for his own reasons wanted to intimidate a person who looked like Mr Wong, in order to keep him out of the Kings Cross area. That explains some of the things that the offender said to Mr Wong when they met up. 

4The offender said to him, ""This is my turf, get off my turf. You have to go that way,"" and pointed Mr Wong in the direction away from a popular street into a relatively isolated lane. Not wanting any trouble, Mr Wong complied with the offender's direction. He felt a push to his back and felt someone pulling at his backpack. He turned around and saw the offender standing in front of him. He said, ""Give me your bag, I want your phone and money."" When Mr Wong did not respond, he repeated ""Give me your bag."" Mr Wong loudly said, ""No, I don't have anything, leave me alone."" At this the offender produced a knife. He pointed it directly at Mr Wong's chest, about 20 centimetres away. He said, ""Give me your phone and money now."" 

5The commotion attracted the attention of people living nearby, who called police. Another woman yelled out from a nearby apartment. The young person briefly looked towards her and then lunged towards Mr Wong with the knife in his right hand. In order to protect himself, Mr Wong put his left arm in front of his stomach. The blade hit his inner left forearm. He immediately felt a lot of pain and became dizzy. The offender ran away, still carrying the knife. 

6Mr Wong went to a liquor store on Macleay Street. A staff member bandaged his wound and an ambulance and police were called. Mr Wong was taken to hospital. He required 20 stitches to close the wound he had suffered. He remained in hospital for three days until discharging himself. 

7Police looked at CCTV footage from around the area and when they came across the offender the next day they arrested him. 

8He has now pleaded guilty to an offence of assault with intent to rob whilst armed with an offensive weapon and causing wounding. That is a serious offence, carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. It means that the offender, although only 15 at the time of the offence and 16 now, must be dealt with according to law. 

9The offence that I have described is serious enough, but at the time the offender was on probation for seven other offences and on bail for three more. On top of that, a few hours before he committed this offence, he committed an offence of robbery in Parramatta. 

10Although due to his youth the offender has not been committing offences for very long, in that short space of time he has clearly demonstrated a continuing attitude of disobedience towards the law. 

11As well as sentencing for an offence, I must sentence the offender. In another jurisdiction of this Court judges are called to decide child custody matters where FACS, and previously DOCS, have intervened in order to protect the welfare of children. Judges see some terrible circumstances and wonder what will happen to many of the children who are the subject of such proceedings. These proceedings demonstrate what can happen.

12In a large part, this offender's behaviour and misconduct can be traced to his terrible upbringing involving interventions by the authorities in order to protect his welfare. When he was four months old he was removed from his parents' care due to concerns about his physical welfare and the risk of sexual abuse. His parents exposed him to their drug use and criminal behaviour. The offender at one stage sought access to his FACS file and knows now the terrible way in which he was brought up. It is clear that the offender was exposed to serious child protection violations, to use the words in the psychological report tendered on behalf of the offender today. 

13After being removed from his parents, he was placed with his paternal aunt. She was a loving and caring woman. He enjoyed living with her because he felt that someone cared about him. Unfortunately the offender behaved badly. Again to use the words of the psychologist, he was a behaviourally difficult child, and so when he was nine his aunt relinquished care of him to the State. She was unable to cope with his misconduct. 

14Due to the level of his misbehaviour, he was apparently not suitable for foster care and was placed in community based group homes. They apparently offered little to him by way of care or nurturing and he began to engage in criminal conduct, such as theft. He was also often aggressive with staff when his needs were not met. As he has grown up, his criminal behaviour has worsened. 

15As if that were not enough, other tragedies have befallen him. The aunt with whom he had previously resided, accidentally caused the death of his cousin, by running over her with a car. Quite irrationally the offender blames himself for this. He believes that if he had remained living with his aunt, he would have been able to look after his cousin and thus prevent her death. 

16I mentioned before that the offender obtained access to his FACS file. The details within that document were apparently quite disturbing to him. It is easy to understand why he would want to know where he came from, but the answer does not appear to have been terribly helpful. 

17At one stage he was placed in Juvenile Detention. When he left at the age of 15, shortly before committing this offence, he was placed in a group home but rarely lived there. Instead he was staying with friends around the city or living on the streets in the Kings Cross area. He had been doing this for about a month before he committed the offence for which I must now sentence him. 

18A psychologist summarises it this way, ""Overall BW is a young boy who has been exposed to serious child protection violations and significant inconsistency in care."" 

19What I have described thus far is concerning indeed. The Juvenile Justice report also paints a very bleak picture regarding the offender, his propensity for aggression and the prospects for his future. Things are not all one way however. Since going into custody the offender's behaviour has improved. He has received a visit from his mother and one from his sister, a person about whom Juvenile Justice speaks very highly. He hopes to live with his sister upon his release from custody. 

20He is now completing year 10 and says that he is doing well. He has recently completed a bricklaying, block laying certificate involving a number of separate subjects. He told the psychologist and he told me as well that he was motivated to continue his schooling. Education is one way that the offender might be able to turn off the path on which he is apparently currently headed. 

21As I began these remarks on sentence it is important to remember that despite the seriousness of his misconduct, the offender is still a child. Section 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act sets out the principles which I must have regard to when I sentence the offender. Clearly rehabilitation is an important aim. Clearly also, however, that does not mean that the principles of general deterrence and punishment are unimportant. 

22I take into account very much in the offender's favour the following circumstances. He was 15, well short of 18, at the time of the offence. He was immature. He lacked any sort of ongoing adequate support as he grew up and his upbringing was very unstable. Ms Cook also refers to what she describes as mental health fragilities that have arisen as a result of the offender's upbringing and childhood. I take those into account as well. 

23I also take into account the offender's expressed motivation towards rehabilitation, but I would be the first to note that it is easy to promise rehabilitation, but much harder to demonstrate it. 

24The offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so the sentence I impose upon him will be 25% less than it would otherwise have been. Since committing the offence the offender has been dealt with in the Children's Court for a number of matters, including the one committed earlier that night. Thus not all the offender's time in custody since being arrested relates solely to this offence. The principle of totality of course applies and so in considering questions of accumulation I have taken into account the overall sentence which takes into account both the Children's Court matters, and my sentence must be appropriate for the offender's overall criminality. 

25It is also important that no offence goes unpunished. No offender, including young offenders, should ever get the impression that they can commit offences without being punished. For that reason the sentence I will shortly announce will date from 30 July 2013. The offender thus remains punished for the offences which resulted in him being dealt with in the Children's Court. 

26It is, of course, a seriously aggravating factor that he was on probation and bail at the time of this offence, but I have to be careful not to double count by both extending the sentence from that I would have imposed in the absence of that aggravating feature and also selecting a starting date which does not take into account the principle of totality. I have not done that, of course. 

27As the Crown reminded me, this was a very serious offence. The offender diverted Mr Wong from a place where there were many people to a place where he was effectively isolated. The offender was armed with a knife and it was his deliberate act of producing it and then lunging towards Mr Wong which led to him suffering the serious injury to his arm which he suffered. It is conceded that the offender must receive a sentence of imprisonment. 

28I make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour. They result from, of course, the mathematical effect of accumulation, as well as the need for very close supervision upon the offender's release, given the bleak nature of the Juvenile Justice report. Such close supervision will be necessary to ensure, as much as possible, that the offender does not commit offences in the future. The community and the offender himself will both benefit from that close supervision. 

29The offender expressed his remorse in court today. He said that were Mr Wong in court he would apologise to him for what he has done. I accept that expression of remorse as genuine. 

30The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a nonparole period of two years, to date from 30 July 2013, and a head sentence of four years. The nonparole period will thus expire on 29 July 2015, on which date the offender is eligible to be released to parole. 

31I make an order under s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act that the whole of the sentence be served as a juvenile offender. There are special circumstances in this case under s 19(4A). They are that the offender's schooling should be continued for as long as necessary. Education is very important in this case as part of the process of aiding the offender to become a productive member of society. Also as regards these special circumstances, I note and accept the contents of para 50 of the psychological report of Ms Laura Durkin. I will not read that paragraph out, it is to be found in one of the exhibits should further attention to this matter be required.

2705340,Meimaropoulos v Cheum [2014] NSWDC 26,"Judgment

Introduction

1The plaintiff brings proceedings for damages arising out of an incident on 30 August 2008, when she fell from a footpath onto the gutter following an attack by the defendants' dog. The claim is brought under the Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW) (""the Act"") only, a claim for negligence under the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) having been abandoned in closing submissions.

2The plaintiff and the defendants are neighbours, living in the same street in Hinchinbrook, a suburb of Sydney. On Saturday 30 August 2008, the plaintiff, a 68-year-old pensioner, was walking to the shops along the suburban street in which she lived, which entailed passing by the defendants' home. The defendants, like many other residence in the area, kept dogs; the sight of other residents walking their dogs was a familiar one to the plaintiff, and she had no particular fear of dogs herself. 

3As the walked past the defendants' home, a dog described as ""small and fluffy"" ran towards her barking, having burrowed under the gate to the high fence surrounding the defendants' yard, by reason of its small size. The plaintiff's evidence is that the dog circled her several times and attempted to jump up on her at least once, putting its front paws at knee level. There is no suggestion that the dog knocked her over or bit her. As the plaintiff was frightened by the dog's barking and jumping up, she took one or more steps backwards, tripping over the edge of the footpath and falling onto the roadway immediately adjacent to a nearby car.

4According to the plaintiff, a young woman wearing pyjamas was in the defendants' front yard at the time, accompanied by the other small fluffy dog belonging to the defendants, which was barking at the time but which remained in the yard.

5The neighbours in the adjoining house, which was Number 1 in the same street, heard the plaintiff crying. He went out onto the roadway and observed the plaintiff leaning on his car, crying and saying, ""bloody dogs attacked me"", and ""the owner saw and didn't do anything"". He observed the palm of her hand was bleeding and gave her a bandage. He did not observe the dogs, or the young woman wearing pyjamas, in the defendants' front yard. As the plaintiff was distressed, he offered to drive her home.

Injuries and disabilities

6The plaintiff pleads that she has suffered the following injuries:

(a)Injury to the right shoulder;

(b)Injury to the right side of the face and eye;

(c)Lacerations to the forehead;

(d)Injury to the right hip;

(e)Injury to the right knee;

(f)Injury to the abdomen;

(g)Head injury;

(h)Injury to the right foot involving fracture to right fifth metatarsal bone; and

(i)Shock.

7The following disabilities are particularised:

(a)Pain and restricted movement to the right foot;

(b)Pain and restricted movement to the right hip and knee;

(c)Diminished visual acuity;

(d)Altered sensation to the right side of the face;

(e)Likely future requirement to undergo pinning and plating procedure to the right foot;

(f)Requirement to undergo an operative procedure to the right shoulder (now performed);

(g)Likely future requirement to undergo further operative procedures to the right shoulder;

(h)Likely onset of early degenerative change to the right shoulder and right foot;

(i)Difficulties walking or standing for long periods;

(j)Difficulties kneeling, crouching or squatting;

(k)Difficulties engaging in household activities;

(l)Anxiety and depression;

(m)Disturbed family relationships;

(n)Increased moodiness and irritability.

8The plaintiff's claim for damages must be views in light of her complicated medical history and health problems unrelated to the accident. This includes a prior fall in 2003, where she suffered similar injuries. For these reasons, it is necessary to set out the plaintiff's history of medical consultations with care in the section of this judgment concerning the quantum of the claim.

The legislation applicable to accidents involving companion animals

9Who is an ""owner"" of a companion animal such as a dog or cat? Section 7 provides:

""7 Meaning of ""owner""

(1) Each of the following persons is the ""owner"" of a companion animal for the purposes of this Act:

(a) the owner of the animal (in the sense of being the owner of the animal as personal property),

(b) the person by whom the animal is ordinarily kept,

(c) the registered owner of the animal.

(2) A reference in this Act to ""the owner"" of a companion animal is a reference to each and all owners of the animal.

(5) When a companion animal is ordinarily kept by an employee on behalf of his or her employer, the animal is for the purposes of this Act taken to be ordinarily kept by the employer and not the employee. This subsection does not prevent an employee being the registered owner of an animal and does not prevent the employee being an owner if the employee is the registered owner.

(6) In any prosecution of the owner of a companion animal for an offence against this Act it is a defence if the defendant establishes that:

(a) another owner of the animal has been convicted of an offence arising out of the same circumstances, or the commission by another owner of the animal of an offence arising out of the same circumstances has been proved but a court has made an order under section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in respect of the offence, or

(b) another owner of the animal has paid the amount of the penalty prescribed under section 92 (Penalty notices) for an alleged offence arising out of the same circumstances.

10In what circumstances is the owner of a dog liable? Section 25 of the Act provides:

""25 Liability for injury to person or damage to personal property

(1) The owner of a dog is liable in damages in respect of:

(a) bodily injury to a person caused by the dog wounding or attacking that person, and

(b) damage to the personal property of a person (including clothing) caused by the dog in the course of attacking that person.

(2) This section does not apply in respect of:

(a) an attack by a dog occurring on any property or vehicle of which the owner of the dog is an occupier or on which the dog is ordinarily kept, but only if the person attacked was not lawfully on the property or vehicle and the dog was not a dangerous dog, menacing dog or restricted dog at the time of the attack, or

(b) an attack by a dog that is in immediate response to, and is wholly induced by, intentional provocation of the dog by a person other than the owner of the dog or the owner's employees or agents.

(3) This section does not apply in respect of a police dog or a corrective services dog.

(4) This section does not affect the liability apart from this section of any person for damage caused by a dog.""

11In Hatch v Wood-Davies [2006] NSWDC 96 at [137] - [142], Neilson DCJ explained the history and construction of these definitions in the Act:

""[137] I have been unable to find any particular explanation of the meaning of the words ""to keep a dog"". It is clear that the 1898 Act speaks of the dog ""being found"" on premises. That is it only extends to the actual physical placement of the dog on the property.[138] Of course ""keep"" can be used in many ways. It does not mean to have, but to hold onto something. One could always use the word to keep a dog or to keep a cat as meaning to care for it, to provide it with sustenance, shelter, food and drink, but in my view it should not be given too narrow a meaning in the Companion Animals Act 1998, bearing in mind previous legislative history.[139] It appears to me that the phraseology ""keeping"" a dog extends merely to maintaining its physical presence in a place or under that person's custody or power. It cannot extend as far as possession because the possessor of an animal is prima facie the owner of it, and therefore that person would fall within the provision of s 7(1)(a).[140] If para (b) required actual possession of the dog, para (a) would be otiose as has been submitted by learned counsel for the plaintiff.[141] A person in my view can keep a dog merely by permitting it to stay or rest upon his or her property, by feeding it, by providing it with water, by providing it with a place of shelter. If an animal comes to my house and I permit it to stay in it, one might be forgiven for thinking that I was keeping it. If someone asked me whether I had just acquired a new cat and I said, ""No, it is a stray which has entered into my house and I have no intention of keeping it,"" one might be forgiven for thinking that my visitor was correct in thinking that I was stupid not to eject the cat from my house.[142] Again, I accept therefore that permitting an animal to stay on one's premises, to use it as a place of shelter or repose habitually, amounts to keeping it. It is now 6.15. I shall continue these reasons at 9.30 in the morning.""

12How is s 7(1)(c) to be interpreted where the animals were not registered until after these proceedings commenced? At the time of the attack, neither of the dogs had been micro chipped or registered. One of the dogs had been found wandering in the street by the first defendant and brought home as a family pet, and the other had been a gift from a friend of the third defendant. After the statement of claim was served, these two animals were registered in the name of the third defendant only. 

13The third defendant stated in her evidence that only she was the owner of the dogs. The first and second defendants deny ownership, both in the pleadings and in their evidence, although they and their daughters conceded the dogs were ""family pets"" and described activities they all performed that involved in the dogs' care. The third defendant was certainly responsible for feeding the dogs, but the first and second defendant each played an important part in their welfare. For example, the first defendant built an enclosure for the dogs, and was responsible for securing the gate that kept them in the back yard. The second defendant (the first defendant's wife) would buy the dogs' food if the third defendant asked her to. She and the first defendant were the jointly registered proprietor of the property on which the dogs were kept. Their daughters were responsible for taking the dogs for walks; the third defendant, who is aged 79, did not take the dogs for walks. In addition, the whole family would pat the dogs and play with them, hence their concessions that the dogs were family pets. 

14The language of s 7(1)(b) of the Act picks up on the repealed legislation, s 4(2) Dog Act 1966 (NSW), the meaning of which is discussed in Porter v Cook [1971] 1 NSWLR 318 and Zappia v Allsop [1994] NSWCA 355. In Porter v Cook, supra, the dog in question was a stray dog who had been brought onto the defendant's premises some weeks prior to the date of the attack. In that case, as well as in Zappia v Allsop, supra, the dog in question was unregistered, as was the case here.

15All of the evidence points to all three defendants being the persons by whom these dogs were ""ordinarily kept"". As the animals were unregistered at the time of the incident, s 7(1)(c) does not apply. The fact that these animals were registered to the third defendant some years subsequent to the accident is irrelevant to the question of ownership at the time of the accident. The first and second defendant, who were the owners of the property on which the dogs resided, and who had materially contributed to their well-being and welfare as well as treating them as family pets, were persons by whom the animals were ""ordinarily kept"" in the sense of s 7(1)(b) and, in that sense, are also ""owners"".

16Having noted this finding, I now consider the circumstances of the accident.

The circumstances of the accident

17The plaintiff's evidence on all issues was coloured by exaggeration, and I have found her to be a witness whose evidence should not be accepted unless that evidence can be corroborated. Unfortunately, I have similar reservations about the evidence of the defendants.

18The plaintiff stated that, on the day of the incident, she was walking to the shops, along a route familiar to her, in that she passed that way several times a week. In the course of that journey, she walked past the address at which the defendants and their dogs lived. It was fairly early on a Saturday morning and there were few other people in the area. The plaintiff saw a young lady who she described as ""the owners' daughter"" in pyjamas at the front entrance of the defendants' home with a dog, which was yapping. Another dog, which was in the fenced yard to the defendants' premises, came then managed to get ""outside, coming around, around, around, jumping on me"", according to the plaintiff. 

19The plaintiff had previously heard the dogs were barking when she came around the corner and was unconcerned as she was not afraid of dogs. The next thing she knew, she saw one dog (described in counsel for the plaintiff's opening as ""a small fluffy beige dog"") ""at my feet"". 

20The plaintiff said, ""I thought the dog was going to bite me"". She was unable to say if she saw the dog's teeth. She described how the accident happened, namely that after the dog ran around her and jumped up: ""I took a step, as I took a step I tripped over, had a fall"".

21The plaintiff hit her head above her glasses, striking her right temporal and cheek, as well as her posterior. Her right hand was bleeding. Half her body was on the grass and the other half was below the footpath, next to a parked vehicle, on the concrete of the road. 

22The plaintiff said that after she fell, the dog then ""went in Number 3"" but that she was unable to describe how this occurred, as she was on the ground and dizzy. The plaintiff said that she called out to the young woman who was starring at her, saying: ""come here and see what your dog did to me"" and ""please help me"", but that the young woman ran inside as soon as she saw the neighbour from the adjoining house come to help the plaintiff.

23The plaintiff was unable to get to her feet and had to be helped up by the neighbour of the defendants, who came out of his house. He told her the dogs were dangerous, that another person had also been attacked, and that he had had a bad relationship with the occupants of the defendants' house. He asked if she wanted an ambulance and, when she refused, drove her back to her home. 

24The plaintiff also claimed that when she walked past the premises some weeks later, the same young woman was in the yard with the dogs. When she spoke to the young woman and reminded her about the incident, this young woman laughed and told the dogs to attack her. Ms Welsh has indicated in her closing submissions that this subsequent incident, as described by the plaintiff, does not form part of her case, but the fact that this claim was made is relevant to the plaintiff's credit.

25In cross-examination, the plaintiff agreed she had told Dr Glancey she had an ""unreliable memory"". However, the plaintiff was insistent that she had a good recollection of the events in question. She agreed that when she fell, she landed on the road rather than on the footpath or driveway, but on her description of events, it is clear that for her to travel from walking down the footpath to coming to rest beside the neighbour's parked motor vehicle, she must have moved in a backwards direction and slipped, or tripped, over the edge of the footpath.

26The plaintiff said she was unable to get up on her own, and that the neighbour who had come to give her assistance ""told me to grab the bull bar of the car and pull myself up"". The plaintiff said she had fallen forward behind the car, off the footpath, rather than on the footpath. There was a grass verge on the footpath, but she thought that there was no grass where she had fallen.

27The plaintiff said she had a cut hand, was very sore in her head, shoulder and posterior, and had broken her glasses in the fall. It was put to her that she had not consulted an optometrist until 9 October 2008, two months after the accident, asking for a new prescription, and that she said nothing about breaking her glasses on that occasion. It was also put to her that the occasion when she had broken her glasses was a previous accident on 14 March 2001 (described in more detail below), when she had similarly claimed to have broken her glasses. The plaintiff was adamant that she had broken her glasses on both occasions. 

28There is no reference to the plaintiff complaining to her general practitioner at the time about breaking her glasses on this second occasion. She was referred to an optometrist by her general practitioner ""complaining of distance blur with her current glasses"" (Exhibit 7). Not only does the optometrist note that he considers she needs a new prescription for 6/9, but he notes that ""her old glasses only gave R:6/30 6/45"". He goes on to consider whether high sugar levels from the plaintiff's diabetes problem are the explanation. For both the doctor and the optometrist to fail to note that this very shortsighted lady had been managing without glasses for two months in circumstances where she had broken them in a fall is implausible. This was one of a series of claims made by the plaintiff for injuries and treatment which are relevant to issues of credit, and which are discussed in more detail in the section on quantum below.

29The plaintiff's description of the accident varies in two important particulars. Firstly, she referred to ""dog"" both in the singular and the plural in her evidence and in her complaint to the Council, which is set out in more detail below. The plaintiff was asked whether one or both dogs had attacked her. She answered that there were two dogs at the house, but that one was able to get out of the fenced garden, and ran around and jumped up on her. She repeated what she had said in examination in chief, namely that she had thought that nothing would happen when she first saw and heard the dogs, but that then she saw the dog ""in front of my feet barking and attacking"".

30Secondly, the plaintiff gave a different and more dramatic account of the accident in a complaint she made to Liverpool City Council. Her account of 16 October 2008 (recorded in Exhibit 9) contains a number of statements that are difficult to understand. Firstly, her explanation for her delay in reporting the dog attack is ""her son and herself reported to Police as they are friends of hers"". This cannot be correct as neither the defendants nor the police are friends of the plaintiff's. Secondly, the advice she was given was that she should seek expenses from the dog owner ""and was advised to report to Council to get reimbursed"". It is hard to believe that police would have given her such advice. Thirdly, the injuries she described to the Council were different to those described to her doctor and, indeed, in these proceedings. She claimed she suffered ""dog bite to forehead, pain in right shoulder, cut in left hand, large bruise on top of right leg, bleeding on bottom"". No mention was made of broken glasses. 

31The plaintiff does not say in her evidence in court that the dog bit her on the forehead. The dog was too small to have reached her because, as is noted in the comments at the bottom of the Council report, these are ""really small dogs"", so small that it escaped under the gate. 

32Fourthly, the plaintiff told the council the dog was ""still getting out & Police have not followed up"". The plaintiff said that she had told police about the attack, but there is no corroboration of this, as appears to be inferred from the notes of Mr Miller about the Green Valley Police. Nor is there any corroborative evidence of the dog (or dogs) continuing to get out. The plaintiff's evidence is that she went past their home very rarely after these events and on only one of these occasions (namely the time the young woman allegedly told the dogs to attack her) did she see the dogs at all.

33Exhibit 7 also contains an account of Mr Miller's meeting with a person described as ""owner of dog"". He describes their conversation as being that ""they are unaware of this occurring, nor has any person approached or said anything to them"". This evidence is discussed in more detail in relation to the evidence of the defendants.

Mr Bilal Raad's evidence 

34The plaintiff's description of her encounter with one of the defendants' dogs receives some corroboration from the defendants' next-door neighbour, Mr Bilal Raad. Mr Raad had moved into these premises in August 2008, a few weeks before the accident, and lived there until 2011. 

35Mr Raad described the properties in the street along which the plaintiff was walking when she had her accident. His house had no front fence but there was a high front fence in front of the defendants' property. He knew that the defendants kept dogs because he heard them in the backyard when they barked. He described them as ""two small female Maltese terriers"" which were generally looked after to his observation by one of the daughters of the defendants, who he described as ""always there, I assumed she lived there"". There was another small dog, which lived in the house behind Mr Raad. This house had no fence. 

36On the day of the accident, Mr Raad was in bed asleep, when he was woken up by his wife who told him that she could hear someone was outside, crying. He went out into the street and saw the plaintiff ""leaning on my car, crying, saying she had been ""attacked by a dog"", and he helped her to sit down on the low stone fence outside his home. Her palm was bleeding, so he obtained a band-aid for her. As she did not want an ambulance he offered to take her home and drove her to her home.

37Mr Raad did not see any dogs or any person in front of Number 3. Although his wife came out with him, she remained on the veranda, and there were no other people in the street.

38In cross-examination, Mr Raad confirmed his account of what he had seen. He gave evidence in a clear and straightforward manner, describing again where he had seen the plaintiff leaning against his car, and what conservation they had had. He was certain that she had not been lying in the street and that she was standing up and leaning on the car. 

39Mr Raad was asked about the plaintiff's account of him telling her that a boy had been attacked by the dog at Number 3. He denied saying this. Given Mr Raad's honest and objective presentation of his evidence, I accept this, and regard the addition of a story about another person being attacked by a dog coming from the house as Number 3 as being an embellishment made by the plaintiff. Similarly, the plaintiff's claim that Mr Raad had told her about conflict between himself and the people at Number 3 was denied by him, and I find this was not said. As Mr Raad himself pointed out, he had only just moved into this house a few weeks before the incident.

40Mr Raad was certain he had never seen the dogs coming through the fence before, or seen the dogs in the front yard area other than accompanied by one of the residents, at any time before or since the accident. On the few occasions that he had seen the dogs in the front yard, they were accompanied by a young female.

41Mr Raad completed a statement on 5 April 2013, the relevant portions of which are as follows:

""8. The accident occurred on a weekend morning between about 8 am and 12 noon. I was awoken by my partner Maya. We were both in bed. I heard someone crying. I got up and saw a lady leaning on my car crying. I went outside the [sic] spoke to her. She said something about the bloody dogs attacking her, and that the Owner had said nothing.

9. The lady's hand was bleeding. She sat down on a ledge. I went inside and got a Band-Aid, and came out again. I offered to call an ambulance. The lady did not want an ambulance. She said she lived down the street. She spoke again about how the dogs had attacked her and that the Owner was there and did nothing.

10. I then drove her home.""

42Mr Raad agreed that his recollection would have been better then than at the present, but his recollection of events in the witness box are, I find, consistent with his statement.

43Mr Raad presented as an objective and honest witness doing his best to give evidence accurately. He has no connection of any kind with the plaintiff. He has not seen her since, or spoken to her or to any member of her family.

44The effect of Mr Raad's evidence is to confirm the plaintiff's contemporaneous claim of an accident involving a dog. The principal difference between his statement and his evidence in the witness box was that the plaintiff said something about ""bloody dogs"" attacking her, according to his statement.

45The evidence of the plaintiff in these proceedings at all relevant times had involved a description of one dog circling her and attempting to jump up on her while the other dog sat on the front yard of the defendants' home barking. The explanation of this apparent inconsistency is, I find, that the plaintiff regarded herself as being under attack by two barking dogs, notwithstanding the fact that one of them was barking at her from inside the defendants' premises. However, the reason that the plaintiff took a step backwards was because one of the dogs got out under the fence (which, as the third defendant stated in her evidence, they were able to do because they were so small they could fit underneath), run around her and attempted to jump up on her. This was the proximate cause of the accident, not the barking of the other dog.

The evidence of the defendants

46Mr Cheum and his wife, Ms Muy Lim Hay (the first and second defendants), were categorical in their statements that the dogs in question belonged to Ms Hay's mother, the third defendant, and not to them. They conceded the animals were family pets, and that one dog had been found by Mr Cheum in the streets and brought home as a family pet, and that the other was a gift from a friend of the third defendant. 

47Mr Cheum's evidence was that the first he knew of these events was when his daughter told him that a representative from the Council had come to their home and told her that the plaintiff had complained to the Council. The Council representative had pointed out that neither of the dogs was registered. The dogs were micro chipped, but Mr Cheum played no part in this. He knew nothing about registration in 2011, three years later.

48Crucially, Mr Cheum agreed that the dogs only went into the front yard with someone in attendance ""because they could get out under the fence"". Both he and his wife, Ms Hay, agreed that the side gate had been put up to prevent the dogs getting into the front yard. This was, I find, because once the dogs were in the front yard, they were able to get under the front gate.

49The third defendant, who is aged 79, gave evidence that she regarded the dogs as belonging to her, and that she cleaned up after them as well as fed them. When asked where the dogs lived, she said, ""Behind the house we made a two layer fence"". She agreed that this fence was built by the first defendant and not by her. 

50The third defendant said that she asked the first and second defendants' daughters to register the dogs in her name as they belonged to her, although the time at which she made this request was unclear. None of the defendants took any steps to register the dogs despite the Council's warning about fines being passed on by their daughter. 

51The third defendant agreed that the first and second defendants' daughters walked the dogs and that they were regarded as family pets. She said, ""the dogs can crawl under the fence but I never let them do that"". She was asked, ""How do you know the dogs could crawl under the fence?"" and she replied that ""the dogs have attempted to do so"", to her observation.

52The first and second defendants' three daughters also gave evidence. The evidence of Cindy and Jessica related to their roles in relation to the dogs, which consisted of taking them for walks, and in relation to ownership of the dogs by the third defendant. 

53The evidence of Jennifer Cheum included her conversation with the representative of the Council who came to the door in October 2008 and asked if she knew anything about a lady being attacked by a dog. Ms Cheum said she did not, and the Council representative said that the animal in question needed to be both microchipped and registered at a veterinary surgeon's office. Ms Cheum said that the third defendant gave her the money for microchipping, which is $150 for each dog, although conceding that either she or her sister had paid for this to be done, and stating that the third defendant had reimbursed her. 

54However, the animals were not registered at the same time as the micro chipping, and remained unregistered for three years. Ms Cheum gave inconsistent explanations for this, namely that ""We didn't know you had to register"", and ""I forgot to go to Council to get this done"". It was put to Ms Cheum that the dogs were only registered in the name of the third defendant in order to help her parents evade responsibilities for the accident. Ms Cheum replied that this was untrue, as the third defendant did in fact own the dogs. However, the circumstances in which the dogs were registered in the name of the third defendant almost three years after the accident in question, and only after these proceedings were commenced, is indicative of such an intention having regard to the unpersuasive evidence of all of the defendants' witnesses to the effect that the dogs belonged to the 79 year old third defendant and that they played little or no part in the dogs' welfare.

55The third defendant is a frail 79 year old. All of the witnesses agreed that the third defendant did not take the dogs for walks; this activity was carried out by the first and second defendants' daughters. Although the third defendant said she fed and cleaned up after the dogs and paid for their food, it is clear from the concessions of the other defendants and their daughters that these were tasks in which other members of the family assisted to a very great degree. This is, to a degree, consistent with Exhibit 7, where Mr Miller records that he had a conversation with someone he calls ""owner of dog"". 

56Some of the information Mr Miller was given by Jennifer Cheum was misleading. I am satisfied that someone was in the front yard, which makes it unlikely that the defendants and their daughters were unaware of the plaintiff's fall. In addition, the information supplied to Mr Miller about the ownership of the dogs was less than frank, and inconsistent with the evidence in these proceedings. Mr Miller noted that the two dogs at the property were a two year old Maltese beige terrier named Hugo, which ""belongs to grandmother's friend and will be returned"", and a three year old caramel terrier named Louis, described as ""unregistered, unidentified"". He noted:

""7 days given for registration to occur, otherwise fines will be incurred"".

57The explanations given by the first and second defendants and their daughters for failure to register the dogs until after these proceedings are implausible. These explanations are inconsistent. The information that Mr Miller was given about Hugo - namely that he belonged to a friend of the third defendant ""and will be returned"" was untruthful. There was no intention to return the dog. Nor was a description of Louis as an ""unidentified"" dog an accurate description of a family pet of some years' standing.

Conclusions concerning liability

58I am satisfied that the plaintiff was passing the defendants' home when one of their dogs, having got under the fence, run around her barking and attempted to jump up on her. The plaintiff had seen the dogs from a distance but had assumed, no doubt because they were small fluffy animals which did not appear dangerous, that she was not at any risk. She was frightened by the conduct of the dog, which was barking as well as attempting to jump up on her, took one or more steps backwards, and fell.

59The provisions of s 25 of the Act are clear. The question is whether a dog running around a person and attempting to jump up on them amounts to an ""attack"".

60The facts of this case are unlike the much more dramatic events of many of the decisions on s 25, such as Mason v Demasi [2009] NSWCA 227 at [15]. However, it is not necessary for a dog to make some form of wounding contact with a person for the requirement of ""wounding or attacking"" to be made out, as is explained by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Sarkis v Morrison (2013) 64 MVR 433 at [7]-[9]:

""[7] The critical feature for present purposes is the use of the word ""wounding"" in subs (1)(a). It was common ground in the present case that the term ""wound"", when used with respect to bodily injury, involved a breaking of the skin, such as a bite, tear or laceration. The plaintiff's case was founded on the proposition that the phrase ""wounding or attacking"" was disjunctive and it was sufficient for him to establish that the dog caused him to be wounded. The appellant, on the other hand, contended that what was sought to be characterised was not the consequence of the dog's act, but the action itself. Thus, liability did not attach to all forms of bodily injury ""caused by the dog"", but only to the circumstances in which the dog wounded or attacked the injured person. The appellant accepted that a wound is a form of bodily injury, but argued that it is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for liability.

[8] Much was sought to be made of anomalies flowing from the adoption of one or other construction. Thus, the appellant contended that if a person could recover damages for any wound caused by a dog it would be sufficient if the plaintiff tripped over a sleeping dog and suffered some form of laceration as a result. Further, there would be absolute liability for all parties who might suffer cuts (and other injuries) in the course of a motor vehicle accident caused by a dog chasing a cat across the road. On the other hand, the plaintiff contended that if liability only arose where the dog had attacked the plaintiff, nice questions would be raised as to the motive of the dog, which would be critical in the absence of a wound. The plaintiff accepted that the transitive form of the gerund, ""wounding"", may have implied active conduct on the part of the dog, but not necessarily conduct directed towards the plaintiff. Thus, liability should accrue where the dog attacked another person or animal and the plaintiff was wounded in attempting to save the victim, although the plaintiff was not attacked. Liability would also follow if a rider were injured by a dog chasing a cat across the road.

[9] There are two aspects of the section which support the more limited reading of para (a) adopted by the appellant. First, para (b), dealing with damage to personal property including clothing, requires that the damage be caused by the dog ""in the course of attacking that person"". If the concept of ""wounding"" were thought to have an entirely separate operation involving no aggression on the part of the dog, it might be thought curious that if the consequence were bodily injury, liability would accrue, but not in respect of damage to property. Second, and in similar vein, there are exclusions in subs (2), each of which is identified by reference to ""an attack by a dog"". Thus, the owner will not be liable for an attack on a trespasser, unless the dog was a dangerous or a restricted dog: subs (2)(a). It would be curious if the owner were nevertheless liable to a trespasser on the owner's land where the trespasser was wounded, but the dog did not attack. The apparent intention of each limb of subs (2), when engaged, is to exclude the whole operation of subs (1), not merely a part. On that view ""wounding"" is a form of ""attack"".""

61As the Court of Appeal noted at [15], wounding and attacking are alternative bases of liability. For example, in Crump v Sharah t/as Sharah Henville & Co [1999] NSWSC 884, two dogs barking at a horse caused it to buck and throw the plaintiff to the ground. Davies AJ at [26] found that actual contact was not necessary to establish an attack. I note, however, that actual contact is alleged here by the plaintiff, and the explanation for her taking a step backwards was that the dog puts its paws onto her leg at about the knee level. I note the Court's explanation of the use of the word ""chasing"" (at [34]); although the conduct of the dog in running up to and around the plaintiff is perhaps explicable because the plaintiff is not a physically fit person who moves slowly, nevertheless this is a form of ""chasing"".

62Where a dog causes bodily injury due to aggressive or other deliberate intent on its part, liability will flow to the owner under s 25 of the Act (Sarkis v Morrison, supra, at [36]). The fact that the dog in question is small and fluffy, as opposed to large and aggressive-looking, does not mean that its conduct should be seen as being less aggressive or frightening, particularly if it makes physical contact with a person in circumstances such as the present. The plaintiff has established liability under s 25. 

63Whether the plaintiff's response to the circumstances in which a small barking dog ran around and attempted to jump up on her was appropriate is a matter going to contributory negligence, rather than to liability. 

Contributory negligence

64Section 28 of the Act provides:

""28 Contributory negligence

(1) When damage suffered by a person that gives rise to a liability on the part of the owner of a dog to pay damages under this Division is the result partly of contributory negligence on the part of the person who suffers the damage, the damage is, for the purposes of Part 3 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965 , taken to have been suffered as the result partly of a wrong by the owner of the dog and partly of the contributory negligence of the person who suffered the damage.

(2) This section does not affect the operation of Part 3 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965 in respect of any liability for damage caused by a dog that arises otherwise than under this Division.""

65The facts in these proceedings differ markedly from other actions for damages under the Act. The defendants' dog ran towards, and around, the plaintiff while barking, and then ran away. I have accepted the plaintiff's claim that the dog jumped up on her on one occasion, and I also accept that the dog ran around her while barking. The other dog, on the plaintiff's own admission, remained on the property, barking, and as the plaintiff's accident occurred because of ""dogs"", I must take into account that her accident was triggered in part because of a non-compensable event, namely that a dog barked at her from the confines of a property. However, the proximate cause of the accident was the dog running around her, barking, and jumping up once.

66The plaintiff did not fall because the dog knocked her over. She fell because she stepped back and fell over the kerb. This is why the neighbour who went to her assistance found her in the roadway leaning on his car.

67In stepping backwards the plaintiff failed to look where she was going: Czatyrko v Edith Cowan University [2005] 79 ALJR 839 at 840. This was the street on which the plaintiff lived, so she was not in unfamiliar territory: Knight v Tassal Ltd (Supreme Court of Tasmania, Wright J, 18 August 1993) at 6. In addition, although the plaintiff portrayed herself as being attacked by a dangerous dog, her description of the dog is of a small, fluffy animal, which ran around her barking, not of a dog, which attacked or bit her. 

68Claims for contributory negligence in dog attack cases are rare, in part because the fact situation in most cases involves an actual attack or biting. A claim for contributory negligence was considered in Simon v Condran [2013] NSWCA 388 and Penfold v Betteridge [2011] NSWDC 146, where the plaintiff was injured when two dogs began fighting, but in both cases the court considered no issue of contributory negligence arose.

69Barking dogs are a feature of suburban life. The plaintiff had walked past the defendants' house on many occasions and was used to seeing dogs in the street. The presence on the street of a small dog off the leash, even if it was running around her, should not have prevented her from keeping a proper lookout and remaining on the street, rather than stepping back without looking, and tripping or falling over the curb. 

70The plaintiff was not knocked over by the dog, but unwisely took a step backwards without looking. By doing so she contributed to the circumstances of her fall. A modest allowance of 15% for contributory negligence is appropriate in the circumstances. 

71This brings me to the issue of quantum.

Quantum of the claim

72I shall first set out the circumstances in which the plaintiff sought treatment for her physical injuries.

The plaintiff's physical injuries

73Following the incident, the plaintiff's son took her to Fairfield Hospital, where she left after waiting for some hours. She then attended her general practitioner, Dr Patel, on 1 September 2008, giving a history of ""dog attack"" on 30 August 2008 (Exhibit A, report of Dr Patel, 17 August 2010). Dr Patel recorded that she had suffered injuries to her right shoulder, vaginal area, both knees and face. She had bruising in front of both knees and around her left eye but he did not note that her glasses had been broken. Her right shoulder was painful and movements were restricted. The plaintiff was also distressed due to trauma and ""inability to get help"" during the incident.

74The plaintiff attended a podiatrist and a physiotherapist about ""better care of feet"" and ""relief of joint pains"" on 5 September 2008. She attended Dr Ong and Dr Ho at the medical centre she attended, but two of these were for a gynaecological check up. There was no complaint of injuries relevant to these proceedings on these occasions. 

75As noted above, on 9 October 2008 the plaintiff attended an optometrist complaining of distance blur with her current glasses. The optometrist considered that changes to her vision could be relevant to her sugar levels as she was a Type II Diabetic (Exhibit 10, p 92). 

76The plaintiff consulted Dr Ong again on 18 October 2008 complaining of headaches, and on 28 November 2008 underwent a brain scan. This does appear to be related to injuries she complained of after the accident, in that she complained of headaches.

77The plaintiff's shoulder continued to trouble her and she was referred to Dr Davé on 31 October 2008. An MRI scan of the shoulder on 14 October 2008 confirmed a rotator cuff tear and some acromioclavicular joint arthritis. In December 2008 she underwent an arthroscope of her shoulder and the findings of large rotator cuff were confirmed. There can be no doubt that this complaint and injury are related to the accident.

78Dr Davé described the plaintiff's progress at this stage as follows:

""She was nearly getting full forward flexion and this was pleasing [sic] she was asked to have physiotherapy and start on a gentle therapy program. She continued improving forward flexion range about 140 but weakness [sic] with overhead lifting. I saw her again on 25.03.2009. She represented with further pain and was recommended to have a subacromial injection of cortisone. She was now lifting her arm to about 90, she was seen again on 10.09.2009 and had irreparable rotator cuff [sic] she was injected with some cortisone with good result. She was asked to continue building her anterior deltoids.""

79The plaintiff continued to complain of headaches. A CT brain scan on 28 November 2008 showed no intracranial abnormality. She continued to complain and was referred to Dr Neil Griffith, a neurologist. She told him she had only had headaches rarely prior to her fall but now suffer them regularly. His diagnosis was as follows:

""Following initial assessment I found Antonia Meimaropoulos to have chronic daily headaches and dizziness. The latter likely secondary to associated anxiety. In addition to sensory change over the right 1st division trigeminal nerve. She was using a considerable amount of analgesic medication on a daily basis and this may have been contributing to her headaches producing chronic analgesic overuse induced headaches. I thus changed her from Panamax to Neurontin use building up from 100mg tds and organised a cerebral MRI scan and vestibular function tests.""

80The vestibular investigations were normal. The MRI scan showed changes due to her age and known vascular risk factors, but these were not changes that would be expected to produce headaches.

81Dr Griffith considered that, as at 15 July 2009, the mild sensory impairment affecting the purely sensory 1st division of the trigeminal nerve were a direct result of her fall on 30 August 2008. There was however no evidence of trigeminal neuralgia and her headaches were not characteristic of pain due purely to trigeminal nerve injury. He considered she should see a psychiatrist in relation to her complaints of headache.

82The MRI performed on 23 October 2009 (Exhibit A and Exhibit 10, p 124) concludes there is no abnormal sign or thickening of the right trigeminal nerve and that no abnormal enhancement is demonstrated. As her headaches are stated by Dr Griffith to be ""not characteristic of pain related purely to a trigeminal nerve injury"" the most likely explanation is non-organic reasons. I note that Dr Griffith adds that ""[w]hether the headaches and dizziness are permanent would [sic] best assessed at 2 years following the injury and following assessment by a psychiatrist.""

83Although the plaintiff's medication was changed and she was warned not to take analgesics, she has continued to do so. Whether the headaches are the result of chronic analgesic abuse and if so over what period that abuse has taken place is discussed by the defendants' expert, Dr Harvey-Sutton but not commented upon by the experts retained by the plaintiff. This is one of many unsatisfactory aspects of the medical evidence in this case. The unsatisfactory nature of the psychologist's reports (the plaintiff not having consulted a psychiatrist) is dealt with in more detail below.

84If the headaches are not the product of trigeminal nerve damage, as seems clear, and any damage to the trigeminal nerve is slight, any claim in relation to trigeminal nerve damage would be of a minor nature.

85Another difficulty is the failure of the plaintiff's treating doctors, and the doctors who prepared her medico-legal reports, to be aware of, and take into account, her prior fall in March 2001.

The plaintiff's prior shoulder injury

86On 14 March 2001 the plaintiff tripped on an uneven footpath. Her injuries included an injury to her right arm, this being the site of her rotator cuff injury following the 2008 accident, as well as smashing her glasses. She was seen by Dr Mahony, who provided a reported dated 30 June 2003. Dr Harvey-Sutton (Exhibit 1) comments both about her condition and Dr Mahony's conclusions, at paragraph 1.6.3:

""1.6.3 She noted that the case appears to have come before the court in 2004 and she believes that subsequently her condition improved.

I note Dr Mahony indicates that she had symptoms referrable to capsulitis of the right should, right lateral and medial epicondylitis, low lumbar back strain with degenerative changes, with nerve irritation affecting the left lower limb and there was evidence of discogenic lesions at the L3/4, L4/5 and lumbosacral levels, as well as right S1 nerve root irritation. She also has symptoms referrable to bilateral chondromalacia patellae of the knees, and she does have evidence of Baker's cysts behind the knees, bilateral tendonitis of the tendoachilles, as well as bilateral plantar fasciitis.""

87After her fall in August 2008 the plaintiff saw Dr Patel, who said that the plaintiff ""recovered from soft tissue injuries but her should pain gradually got worse. An ultrasound scan of the right shoulder revealed a tear of the supraspinatus tendon. She continues to have ongoing pain and will need surgery in the future"".

88Dr Harvey-Sutton notes that this tear is ""consistent with her age"" (p 9, Exhibit 1) and goes on to state:

""I note on 10 May 2001 there was reference to slight instability in the left ankle.

As noted above Dr Mahoney diagnosed injuries,

- capsulitis of the right shoulder,

- right lateral and medial epicondylitis,

- lower lumbar back strain with degenerative changes, with nerve irritation affecting the left lower limb and there was evidence of discogenic lesions at the L3/4, L4/5 and lumbosacral levels, as well as right S1 nerve root irritation.

She also has symptoms referrable to

- bilateral chondromalacia patellae of the knees, and she does have evidence of Baker's cysts behind the knees,

- bilateral tendonitis of the tendoachilles, as well as 

- bilateral plantar fasciitis

and indicated a 15% permanent impairment of the nose, 20% permanent loss of efficient use of the right upper limb at and above the elbow, 25% permanent impairment of the back, 25% loss of efficient use of the right lower limb at and above the knee to include impairment below the knee, and also 25% permanent loss of efficient use of the left lower limb at and above the knee to include impairment below the knee.

Dr Mahony recommended that she needed eight hours of domestic assistance per week following that accident

Ms Meimaropoulos believes she improved from that accident of 2001 with time.

The following replies to your specific questions are based on the history that was given to me, the clinical examination, special investigations, accompanying information, my training and experience and regular review of the current literature, as follows:

1. A history of the incident from which the claim arises, subsequent treatment and progress and any other history relevant to the plaintiff's complaints or disabilities.

See para 1.

2. Comment upon any x-rays supplied by the plaintiff or that you may order, as appropriate.

See para 2.

3. Examination of the plaintiff in light of the allegations of injury and disability in the statement of Claim and Particulars and the matters raised by the plaintiff in the course of your examination.

See para 3.

4. Comment upon the plaintiff's condition in each areas of alleged injury or disability.

Based on the accompanying documentation, the injury arising from the subject fall is

- Aggravation of underlying degenerative rotator cuff of the right shoulder.

Her right shoulder continues to have restriction in movement, particularly elevation at and above shoulder height, with consequent difficulty with overhead activities.""

89Dr Harvey-Sutton states that the plaintiff suffered an aggravation of an underlying degenerative rotator cuff of the right shoulder. She has restriction in movement, particularly elevation at and above shoulder height.

90The plaintiff's medical reports confirm the plaintiff's rotator cuff tear. Dr Peter Conrad describes the tear as ""large"" and ""not repairable"". Dr Harvey-Sutton notes in her follow-up report of 12 March 2013 (Exhibit 1) that Dr Conrad indicated under the heading ""past injuries"" that there were ""nil relevant"". This is clearly a mistake. 

91Dr Mahony in his report of 30 June 2003 estimated 20% permanent loss of efficient use of the right upper limb at and above the elbow, on the basis that she had symptoms referrable to capsulitis of the right shoulder. There can be no doubt the plaintiff aggravated this injury in her fall, but the prior history of injury should be taken into account.

92I formally note that counsel for the plaintiff has withdrawn any claim in relation to the plaintiff's foot problems. Occurring in 2010, these are clearly unrelated to the accident.

93The plaintiff's physical injuries are, however, not the principal problem in relation to the plaintiff's claim for non-economic loss. The plaintiff also claims for ongoing depression, anxiety and related problems.

The plaintiff's ongoing psychiatric/psychological injuries and disabilities

94The plaintiff was referred by Dr Patel on 1 November 2010 to Dr Zareena Anantharaman, whom she first saw on 4 October 2010. This is two years and three months after the accident. 

95The difficulties of analysis of claims arising from medical treatment first sought after a lengthy period of time has elapsed have been set out in The Nominal Defendant v Kostic [2007] NSWCA 14. It is, however, not uncommon for referrals for depression and anxiety problems to emerge as a result of injuries, or not to become apparent for some time after the accident, so I must be cautious not to place undue weight on a period of delay in reporting symptoms of this nature. Depression, anxiety and other problems of this nature not infrequently take some time to appear and be diagnosed.

96However, other aspects of the plaintiff's claim cast serious doubts upon her credibility, requiring me to reconcile inconsistencies between her evidence and contemporaneous medical reports, in the manner explained in Riley v The Owners of Strata Plan 73817 [2012] NSWCA 410 and McGlen-McLeod v Galloway [2012] NSWCA 388. In Riley v The Owners of Strata Plan 73817, supra, the plaintiff gave inconsistent evidence about where she had slipped on a ramp and the trial judge's findings concerning the plaintiff's lack of credit were undisturbed. In McGlen-McLeod v Galloway, supra, all of the contemporaneous medical records including X-rays referred to a minor injury to one leg but the medico-legal reports, written two years later, referred only to a significant injury to the other leg. The Court of Appeal held that findings as to credit were necessary and it was insufficient to find that the absence of contemporaneous treatment meant that the only injury the plaintiff suffered was the injury she complained about at the time and which was treated by the doctors at the time. 

97It is necessary to set this material out in some detail, and to start with the plaintiff's treating doctors' reports as tendered to the court (Exhibit A). Dr Anantharaman has provided a report dated 29 April 2011 concerning the 26 individual sessions she had held with the plaintiff over six months. A provisional diagnosis of adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood was made. The prognosis is described as ""[n]ot good, due to the chronicity of the physical problems since the dog attack on 30.08.2008"".

98Dr Anantharaman sets out her conclusions and recommendations in point form. Owing to the serious issues raised by the defendants in relation to this report, it is necessary to set these out in full:

99The precise status of this report is unclear. Was it a report to the general practitioner, or to the court? Counsel for the defendants points out that it is addressed and headed ""To Whom It May Concern"", and not to the plaintiff's treating doctor, Dr Patel. This would mean that it is a medicolegal report, albeit from a treating doctor, according to the submission of the plaintiff. If that is the case, the Code of Conduct should have been referred to, but this has not occurred. In fact, the contents of this report are a good example of the reasons for the Code of Conduct forming an essential part of medical reports provided for court purposes, as the following additional material will demonstrate.

100What has not been disclosed by Dr Anantharaman, although it must have been known to her at the time, was the list of main concerns provided to her both by Dr Patel and, more importantly, by the plaintiff, when the plaintiff commenced her treatment. These are set out in Dr Anantharaman's own notes of 4 November 2010, which have been tendered by the defendants. 

101Counsel for the defendants informed me that these notes were not obtained from Dr Anantharaman but from another source, under subpoena. The failure of the plaintiff's general practitioner and Dr Anantharaman to answer a subpoena in relation to this issue has been demonstrated by the tender of the subpoenae.

102The ""patient's main concerns"" are identified by Dr Anantharamn, for the purposes of her treatment of the plaintiff, as being entirely different to those set out in her report ""to whom it may concern"". It is necessary to set out this document in full:

""Patient's Main Concerns are:

- Daughter with drug addiction.

- Son in law too with drug addition.

- Conflicts with daughter.

- Daughter is not allowing her to see her kids.

- Conflicts with sister/nephew.

- Nephew with antisocial and drug related problems.""

103The ""patient's main goals"" were stated as follows:

""Patient's Main Goals are:

- To stabilize the mood.

- To be able to improve relationships with daughter.

- To be able to see her grand kids.

- To feel safe / secure in her home.

- To feel normal and confident like before.""

104Her current mediation is listed as ""Efexor 75 mg / daily"" and her presenting problems were as follows:

""Presenting problems:

- Depression: Unable to sleep due to preoccupied [sic] with conflicts with sister [? , before that] grand children.

- Anxiety: On 10.10.10 incident happened on her sister's B'day party. Nephew got [? violent] and threatened to kill / destroy her things. Very insecure.

- Stress: [There does not seem to be an entry for this]

- Relationship Problems: Conflicts with daughter due to daughters drug addiction / neglect of her kids. DOCS are involved. Conflicts with her sister and her son threatening to hurt her or destroy her property.

- Work Related Problems: [There does not seem to be an entry for this]

- Health Related Problems: 

Chronic back pain

NDDM

Gout

Hypotension

Reflux and gastro-oesophageal

Multiple injuries due to a fall when dog attacked 2008

[?] Blood clot / mild stroke""

105The sole reference to the dog attack is in the second-last line of this document.

106Many of the statements in this doctor's report to the court, when compared to the list she made when treating the plaintiff, must be untruthful to the knowledge of the doctor preparing the report. For example, there is no evidence that a bloody clot was diagnosed following the dog attack, or that the pain in her knees and feet or a stroke are connected. In addition, the very serious family and social problems set out in the notes of Dr Anantharaman of 4 November 2010 have not found their way into her report, which I am satisfied was prepared with the knowledge that it could be used in court proceedings.

107The plaintiff made a number of concessions in her cross-examination about the ongoing extent of these problems. Her daughter is now deceased and she has no contact with her grandchildren, mainly because of her damaged relationship with her son in law. She says that she has reconciled with her sister, and now enjoys a good relationship with her, although she gave no date as to when this reconciliation took place. She agreed that the Department of Community Services had been involved in relation to neglect issues for the children, but said that it was her son in law who was the drug user, rather than her daughter.

108The circumstances in which the report of Dr Anantharaman contains misleading and untruthful information do not reflect well on the plaintiff's credit. I have taken into account that the plaintiff, who cannot read or write English, would have played little part in the preparation of this report. It must materially undermine the claim that the plaintiff's emotional and psychological problems arise from the circumstances of the accident the subject of this claim.

109However, the plaintiff repeated these claims when she saw Mr Gerard Glancey for medicolegal purposes on 23 May 2011, and I must assume that the plaintiff played a greater role in the giving of information to this psychologist than may have been the case with Dr Anantharaman. Mr Glancey's reports of 23 May 2011, 6 July 2012 and 7 August 2013, contained in Exhibit A, contain similar findings, although Dr Anantharaman's report is referred to by him only in the third of these reports (7 August 2013). I shall discuss each in turn.

110The contents of the first and second reports tell a story not dissimilar to that which is contained in the report of Dr Anantharaman, namely a history of the plaintiff having had friends and a happy lifestyle, including relative independence from pain or ill health, prior to the injury. Following the injury the plaintiff told Mr Glancey she suffered black outs, a stroke, a right ankle injury requiring surgery, an injury to her left ankle and a loss of independence. The family problems were briefly identified as a ""family dispute"" which meant she had no contact with her daughter or grandchildren as a result (p 3, report of 23 May 2011). 

111The description of the events set out in Dr Anantharaman's notes of 4 November 2010 as a ""family dispute"" is also similar to the plaintiff's complaints to Mr Glancey. When the plaintiff ""laments the loss of her previous life"" (p 5 of the report), Mr Glancey accepts at face value the assertions that her life prior to the accident was a happy one where she enjoyed good health. There is no reference to the 2001 injury, to the long period of time on which she had been on disability pension, or to the family issues which caused such serious concerns to her in the years leading up to November 2010, only six months beforehand. Not only has the plaintiff provided a slanted and selective history, but Mr Glancey has not sought to inquire.

112Mr Glancey's second report, dated 6 July 2012, again emphasises that the plaintiff blames her blackouts on the blow to her head sustained in the dog attack (p 2). This included suffering a stroke on 22 April 2012. She described the previous conflict with her daughter as ""now resolved"" and said she was having ""frequent contact with her daughter and her three grandchildren"" (p 2). She described her foot injuries as being a significant issue and complained of flashbacks in relation to the dog attack as well as nightmares which caused her to awake screaming about once every three weeks, persisting depression and irritability. Whereas prior to the accident she used to sing and dance, she is now depressed and feels her life has no meaning. Mr Glancey diagnosed major depressive disorder. He described the depression as ""a consequence of the major stressors of her life"". These stressors are the chronic pain and physical restrictions, her physical condition involving black outs and stroke and post traumatic stress disorder (p 6). She was concerned about the condition of her feet and the prospect of reliance on a wheelchair, as well as the possibility of further stroke and death. 

113Mr Glancey concludes:

""Her reports support the view that black outs which she claimed occurred following 29/6/2008 [sic] and subsequent stroke generated significant stress in her life which generated specific anxieties and compounded her depressive disturbance.

If pressed to apportion, mental disturbance to injuries sustained in the dog attack of 29/6/08 [sic] and her history of blackouts and stroke, I would suggest that fifty percent of her anxiety is related to her experiences of blackout and stroke.

In apportioning her depressive disturbance to the alternate stressors of her life, I would express the view that her depression is primarily related to the dog attack of 29/6/08 [sic] and would be evident in her mental functioning had she not experienced the blackouts and subsequent strokes. One must remember that depression is a neuro-chemical disorder. In my view her experience of dog attack and the injuries sustained in the attack established the neuro-chemical imbalance manifest [sic] by depression.

The stress of her general health problems has served to reinforce depression and therefore could be considered responsible for thirty percent of her depressive disorder.""

114Mr Glancey went on to comment that the plaintiff would benefit from continued psychological counselling.

115Mr Glancey's third report of 7 August 2013 is along similar lines. I note that he describes the plaintiff's son as being now self-employed and that he ""spoke of juggling work demands and the demands of caring for his mother"" (p 2). In fact, as is set out below, the plaintiff's son was put before me as her carer. In response to an enquiry about family relationship, the plaintiff told Dr Glancey that her daughter had died in 2012 and that she was having no contact with the children because of opposition from the daughter's husband. He commented that ""little has changed"", although this is inconsistent with the information in his previous report. He saw no basis upon which to speculate optimistically regarding her prognosis in respect of mental disturbance.

Analysis of the evidence of psychology/psychiatric disability

116No report has been provided by the defendants. However, the tendering of an expert report is not a necessary prerequisite to findings of fact on matters the subject of expertise. No alternative expert report was tendered by the defendant in Makita (Aust) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705.

117In Mason v Demasi, supra, at [123]ff, Simpson J set out the correct method of analysis of conflicting evidence as to psychiatric or psychological conditions. Her Honour commenced by noting that there were two questions for determination. These were firstly from what psychiatric or psychological condition (if any) did the plaintiff suffer? If such a condition existed, what were the causes of it? I have adopted the same approach here.

118The facts in Mason v Demasi, supra, were similar to the present in that the plaintiff was attacked by a dog and the issue of causation was a significant issue at the trial. The trial judge found that the plaintiff was an unreliable historian given to exaggeration of her complaints, minimising her pre-accident functioning to the psychiatrist, overstating the circumstances of the attack and treatment that followed and a witness whose credibility should not be accepted.

119Simpson J considered the report of the defendant's expert, Dr Samuell, to be unsatisfactory in that it ""did not provide a proper basis for the trial judge to make the findings adverse to the appellant that he did"" (at [131]). Trial judge's reliance upon the reports of Dr Samuell was ""misplaced"", as an analysis of these reports together with ""other evidence"" showed (at [131]).

120Some of the examples of exaggeration are set out at [126] of the judgment, these included telling Dr Samuell that she could not walk, that she had no prior history of alcohol or illicit drug abuse, that she had a ""perfect life"" before the injury, and that she had no past psychiatric history. Simpson J was critical of Dr Samuell's findings that most of her symptoms appeared to be on a continuum with what she experienced before the attack, including a reference to family history of psychological illness and personal vulnerability.

121The medical evidence for the plaintiff in those proceedings included a report (coincidentally also from Mr Glancey) describing symptoms of ""hypomanic functioning"". Mr Glancey concluded the plaintiff suffered from bipolar disorder. How this related to the dog attack was not explained; his diagnosis was challenged by Dr Robertson, who made a positive diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (at 80).

122Simpson J was also critical of the trial judge's failure to give adequate attention to the general practitioner's notes, which her Honour considered provided ""the most reliable guide to the ""before and after"" picture that was essential to the assessment of the appellant's claim"".

123The trial judge in Mason v Demasi, supra, was in a difficult position. The diagnosis of bipolar disorder by Mr Glancey was contradicted by both Dr Robertson and Dr Samuell. The trial judge had to reconcile three different diagnoses of the plaintiff's psychological and psychiatric issues without the benefit of cross-examination, in circumstances where the plaintiff's own account in her evidence was, her Honour found, unreliable and exaggerated, both in her statements to the doctors (at [124]) and in the witness box (at [127]-[128]).

124The dog attack in Mason v Demasi, supra, was far more severe than the events in these proceedings. Ms Mason was walking with her youngest child and their dog in an area where the respondents lived when a Rottweiler ran from the driveway of the respondent's home towards Ms Mason and her son. In order to protect her child, Ms Mason took the force of the attack. The dog bit her on her legs and arms on many occasions before a neighbour came to her assistance. She was taken by ambulance to Liverpool Hospital when she underwent surgery and she suffered scarring. It was a significant and frightening attack. In the present case, there was a brief encounter which involved, at most, a very small dog jumping up as far as the plaintiff's knees. These circumstances are also of some relevance.

Conclusions concerning psychiatric/psychological evidence

125In the present case, as was the case in Mason v Demasi, supra, I have the benefit of a report and contemporaneous notes from Dr Patel. It is clear from the reports of Dr Patel, who saw the plaintiff on a regular basis, that any sign of psychiatric or psychological problem would have been acted upon promptly. However, Dr Patel's referral was not until 4 November 2010, two years and three months after the accident, and in circumstances where the matters for referral are set out in Exhibit 5.

126I am satisfied, from the failure of Dr Patel to refer the plaintiff prior to this date, and from the contents of Exhibit 5, that the reason for the referral to Dr Anantharaman were those set out in Exhibit 5 and that the dog attack played so small a part in this referral that it was put as the second last item on the list of problems. The plaintiff's long list of family and health problems resulted in her being referred to Dr Anantharaman. The report of Dr Anantharaman is so wholly inconsistent with her own referral notes as to amount to an attempt to mislead the court, a finding I reach with considerable reluctance, but one which must be made. The reports of Mr Glancey demonstrate a failure to inquire into the plaintiff's symptoms, with the result that they are of little or no assistance to the court. 

127I am satisfied that the plaintiff suffered no psychiatric injury following her fall and that any distress she suffered was of short duration. Her headaches are due to analgesic abuse, and her emotional distress is due to the very significant family problems which occurred principally over the two years following the dog incident, as well as to the foot problems which play a significant role in her current health problems, but which are conceded to be unrelated to her injuries arising from the dog attack. 

Injuries relevant to the non-economic loss claim

128As is set out in more detail below, I am also satisfied that there is no connection between the plaintiff's feet and ankle injuries and the accident. I note that Ms Welsh has effectively conceded that she makes no claim for these injuries and ongoing disabilities. This means that the assumptions by both psychologists that the plaintiff's knee and ankle problems relate to the accident are in error. Consequently, insofar as there is a reference at the end of Dr Anantharaman's list to physical injuries following the dog attack, this is in fact limited to her arm injury and, to a very minor extent, any impact caused by damage to the trigeminal nerve. In addition, unlike the plaintiff in Mason v Demasi, supra, the plaintiff in these proceedings was in receipt of a disability pension for long periods of time prior to the accident in August 2008.

129Taking all of the above into account, I am satisfied that the plaintiff was distressed about the events following the dog attack, but that her careful and attentive general practitioner saw no need to refer her for psychological/psychiatric assessment until November 2010, and then did so because of the very serious family problems described by Dr Anantharaman in Exhibit 5. The reference to the dog attack at the bottom of this form, and then in the context of physical problems including the feet and knee injuries which I have found not to be attributable to the accident, places the comparatively minor role of the dog attack in the plaintiff's list of problems in a more accurate context than does Dr Anantharaman's report.

130As I have indicated earlier, I have not accepted the plaintiff as a witness of credit in relation to her ongoing disabilities as being attributable to the dog attack. I am satisfied, from her demeanour in the witness box and from her minimising of her family problems to Dr Glancey, that she has exaggerated her claim of disabilities arising from the dog attack when the true cause of her problems was the sudden exacerbation of her longstanding family problems. 

Non-economic loss

131The plaintiff sought an assessment of 28% of the most extreme case, which as at 1 October 2013 equates to an award of $77,210 (14% of $551,500).

132Counsel for the defendant referred me to Reece v Reece (1994) 19 MVR 103 at [5], concerning the assessment of non-economic loss for a person of the plaintiff's age. I am conscious, however, of the NSW Court of Appeal's warning in Varga v Galea [2011] NSWCA 76 at [72] - [76] as follows:

""72 Reece v Reece states the uncontroversial proposition that the plaintiff's age at the time of the assessment of damages is a factor relevant to the assessment of non-economic loss, a proposition Handley JA made abundantly clear when considering Reece v Reece in Marshall v Clarke (Court of Appeal, unreported 5 July 1994); see also Christalli v Cassar [1994] NSWCA 48 (at 3) where Kirby P (with whom Powell and Cole JJA agreed).
73 Age, however, is only one of the numerous matters the Court takes into account in its assessment of non-economic loss, which is defined in s 3 of the 2002 Act as follows:

""'non-economic loss' means any one or more of the following:

(a) pain and suffering,

(b) loss of amenities of life,

(c) loss of expectation of life,

(d) disfigurement.""

74 The assessment of non-economic loss depends on the circumstances of each plaintiff, albeit as s 16 of the 2002 Act now requires, as assessed by reference to a ""most extreme case"". In this respect, in my view however, Windeyer J's remarks in Thatcher v Charles [1961] HCA 5; (1961) 104 CLR 57 (at 71 - 72) remain cogent:

""Compensable loss depends not only on the severity of the physical injury but on the consequences for the individual. No two injuries are really the same; and the consequences of apparently similar injuries vary infinitely for different individuals. Thus amounts given in different cases may be harmonious on principle, although appearing disproportionate when the physical injuries alone are regarded. Measuring in money such things as pain and suffering or the impairment of capacity to lead life to the full really involves dealing in incommensurables. It is an attempt to weigh imponderables.""

As Handley JA observed in Dell v Dalton (1991) 23 NSWLR 528 (at 532), although Windeyer J was in dissent, this passage ""reflected the previous law"".""

133The defendants must take the plaintiff as they find her, and the fact that she is a person with health problems of long standing is to be seen in her favour. However the plaintiff is only able to claim damages for those injuries arising from the fall she suffered when frightened by the defendants' dog. For the reasons set out above, that is limited to the claim in relation to her shoulder injury and a claim for damage to the trigeminal nerve, the consequential disabilities of which appear to be insignificant. 

134Issues relevant to the determination of non-economic loss are:

(a)An accurate identification of the injuries the subject of the claim;

(b)An assessment of the medical evidence taking into account that Drs Dave, Conrad and Bodel were not given an accurate history of prior injuries and claims;

(c)The plaintiff's age: Reece v Reece (1994) 19 MVR 103;

(d)In relation to claims of ongoing disabilities, the plaintiff's credit.

135In Coleman v Barrat [2004] NSWCA 27 the New South Wales Court of Appeal held that an assessment of 22% of a most extreme case for a similar injury was a reasonable award. The defendant submits that if I accept the plaintiff's injuries were suffered as alleged, the non-economic loss damages would be in the range of 20-22%.

136Taking all of the above into account, I consider an assessment of 22% to be appropriate. By multiplying $551,500 by 4.5% (s 16 Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW)), this gives $24,817.50. Rounding this up to the nearest $500 would entitle the plaintiff to $25,000.

Past out-of-pocket expenses

137Although past out of pocket expenses are generally agreed, these were in dispute in this case. The following areas were challenged by the defendants:

(a)Medicare: No details are provided by Plaintiff

(b)Optometrists' costs: The plaintiff smashed her spectacles in her 2001 fall. The defendants have submitted, and I accept, that the delay in obtaining fresh glasses for a person with such poor uncorrected vision, the absence of reference in the optometrist's report to her glasses being smashed (it is not stated that he read her prescription, which increases the likelihood that he estimated her vision from her actual glasses) and the reference by the obstetrician to other information being provided as the reason for her visit confirm that the cost of new glasses is unrelated to the plaintiff's accident.On 8 September 2008 Dr Ong (Exhibit 10 are difficult to read) appears to have referred the plaintiff to Valley Plaza Optometrist after checking her blood sugar, not as a result of injury. On 9 October 2008, Valley Plaza Optometrist-Michael Jackson reported:""Thanks for asking me to see this lady who has been complaining of distance blur with her current classes. She is a type II diabetic but is not checked sugar levels recently.""3 November 2008 - Claim for new spectacles provided by Irena Lombardi optometrist Merrylands.The Plaintiff said in evidence that she broke her glasses and then threw them in the bin when she got home. This is unbelievable and should be rejected in view of the evidence of Dr Ong and Michael Jackson (supra).

(c)Sleep Advisory and Sales Services: this claim is withdrawn by the Plaintiff (letter Plaintiff's Counsel 3 February 2014 received in DX 6 February).

(d)Dr Dave: The defendants agree that the following expenses from Dr Davé relate to the plaintiff's shoulder (see Dr Davé - Report 13 May 2010 part of Exhibit A):31 October 2008 referred by Dr Patel-new consult - $12014 November 2008 subsequent consultation - $505 December 2008 subsequent consultation - $5018 December 2008 see comments below $220021 January 2009 no tax invoice25 March 2009 subsequent consultation - $5022 April 2009 professional attendance specialist - $100The plaintiff claims that subsequent tax invoices between March 2010 and January 2012 do not appear to relate to shoulder injury. The following are the relevant entries in Exhibit 10:On 28 December 09 Dr Sorani refers the plaintiff to Dr Dave, noting that ""Chronic pain both feet right is worse"". In relation to ""Current problems"" there is no reference to injuries arising from the dog attack or indeed any injury. (Exhibit 10, p 99).5 February 10 Dr Davé notes: ""Foot has caused her pain. Denies any twisting injuries, but has had spontaneous onset of pain mainly on lateral aspect of her feet"" (Exhibit 10, p 121). The plaintiff's account leaves the dog attack out of the picture.12 February 10 Dr Davé noted: ""Bone scan picks up stress fracture in fifth metatarsal"" (Exhibit 10, p 120).On 12 April 10 Dr Davé noted ""Treated fifth metatarsal fracture with boot"" (Exhibit 10, p 117).On 11 May 10 Dr Davé noted ""Some pain over fifth metatarsal. Walking unaided"" (Exhibit 10, p 114).On 1 July 10 Dr Patel noted, as the reason for visit, ""anxiety. Form for carer's allowance done"" (Exhibit 10, p 48).On 1 July 10 Dr Davé noted: ""Ongoing pain in foot"" (Exhibit 10, p 113).On 2 February 11 Dr Davé reported: ""Had internal fixation for non-union of fifth metatarsal"" (Exhibit 10, p 59).On 10 March 11 Dr Davé reported: ""Hardware removed. Needs a bit of podiatry to help with her planter fasciitis. Part of her pain I suspect is from some neuropathy from her diabetes"" (Exhibit 10, p 62).On 4 May 11 Dr Davé reported: ""Some pain in base of fifth metatarsal"" (Exhibit 10, p 70).On 30 August 11, Dr Patel noted ""Reference for counselling under mental health plan. Past history: chronic back pain, anxiety, depression, diabetes, gout, hypertension, reflux, sleep apnoea"" (Exhibit 10, p 156).On 5 February 2010, Dr Davé noted: ""Foot caused her pain. Spontaneous onset of pain mainly on the lateral aspect of feet. organised bone scan to look for any stress fractures"" (Exhibit 10, pp 74, 121).

(e)Dr Griffith: the defendants submit that neither this claim, nor the claim for trigeminal nerve generally, relate to the fall on 30 August 2008. He considers the plaintiff suffers from ""chronic analgesic overuse induced headaches"" (Exhibit A, report 13 July 2009) and adds: ""There may be a component of chronic analgesic overuse and I have given her regime to change from Panamax to Neurontin building up to 100 mgs tds"" (Exhibit 10 page 142). The plaintiff complains of headaches, but despite the Doctor's advice, she said that she continued to take Panamax. No Panamax boxers or receipts were produced nor any for Neurontin. The plaintiff does, however, claim $560 for three visits to the neurologist on 13 and 15 July 2009 and 28 October 2009 and I have allowed this.

(f)Dr Sumich: this claim is withdrawn by the Plaintiff (letter Plaintiff's Counsel 3 February 2014). Dr Sumich was seen on 19 November 2008 on the referral of Irena Lombardi optometrist Merrylands. No report was provided.

(g)Dr Thakkar: The defendants concede that this doctor, who assisted Dr Davé 18 December 2008, is entitled to be paid although his services are charged at $600 by the plaintiff. Dr Davé on Tax Invoice/Receipt number 51339 apparently charged $400 for the assistant for surgery in the operating theatre. The difference is unexplained. I shall allow for the lower amount.

(h)Sydney Southwest Private Hospital: $5772. The defendants submit that this claim of $5772 appears to be made up of adding together a deposit in cash ($4231 - 18 December 2008) and ""Patient Refund Accom"" ($1541.30 - 30 January 2009). The actual cost of invoice number 151673 was $2689.70. This has been agreed to by Ms Welsh.

(i)Ambulance Service of NSW: A receipt dated 27 May 2013 is provided, but there are no further details are provided relating this expense to the plaintiff's disabilities. It is not related to the events the subject of this litigation.

(j)Green Valley Physiotherapy: The defendants submit that there is no referral from any doctor for this physiotherapy, nor is there any report from the physiotherapist, and that in these circumstances no allowance should be admitted.I do not accept that either of these complaints are of relevance. The plaintiff was advised to have physiotherapy, and did not need a referral to do so. Reports from physiotherapists are rarely provided, and generally of little assistance to the determination of issues. Between 28 January 2009 and 22 February 2010 there were 18 visits for a total sum of $900. The only notation on that ""Attendance Report"" is ""shoulders-both multiple areas"" but I am satisfied that the plaintiff attended complaining of her shoulder.There are a further 13 similar visits Between 8 April 2010 and 20 July 2011 except that on 7 April 2011, 31 March 2011 and 20 July 2011, there were consultations relating to ""shoulder-right"". The defendants submit that these three invoices appear to be the only physiotherapy in relation to the right shoulder.On 16 February 2010 Dr Patel (Exhibit 10 page 50) clinical notes-""having physiotherapy-known to have degenerative changes in multiple joints"". On 23 September 2010 Dr Patel (Exhibit 10 page 45) clinical notes-""left ankle pain++, x-ray-normal, having physiotherapy, adv to continue physio"". As is noted above, Dr. Patel's earlier clinical notes were not produced in answer to a subpoena.Some allowance should be made for the fact that the plaintiff's physiotherapy included her ankle and foot problems.

(k)Physiotherapy Professionals: These two documents appear to be a statement and a receipt page each in the sum of $37. The first document number 93537 but they both refer to ""initial hospital consultant"" as a service provided and the area ""mobility"". I accept the defendants' submission that it appears that the receipt and the statement have been added together.

(l)Pharmacy: This claim consists of a number of items. Ms Welsh has sensibly suggested that a small buffer only for analgesics should be allowed for, and I propose to take this step.

(m)Purchase of a Rollator in 2012: This appears to be a 4-wheeled walking frame in relation to the plaintiff's foot problems. There is no evidence of it, or its use. Well prior to its purchase, on 19 May 2009, Dr Yiannikas reported that the Plaintiff ""has dyspnoea after walking 10 to 15 minutes"". (Exhibit 10 page 146 (Dyspnoea is shortness of breath).On 9 September 2010 Dr Yiannikas reported that the Plaintiff ""since her last visit she has noted a retro sternal painful discomfort and breathlessness when she does her housework. She has dyspnoea walking 1/2 a kilometre."" On 25 February 2012, Dr Hassan (at pages 5 and 6 of Exhibit 10) reports ""She is able to go out to the shops and is independent with activities of daily living though she feels that her son needs to be with her for support."" ""She appears quite well and is able to ambulate without any walking aid."" ""Opinion and recommendations: the most recent symptom of rotational vertigo on head movements is that benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Her more longstanding symptoms are quite non-specific and her subjective gait and balance impairment is not substantiated by any objective abnormality. In particular there is nothing on examination to preclude her from being able to mobilise independently without her son's help.""On 27 March 2012 Dr Bazina (at page 21 of Exhibit 10) reported ""MRI scan was performed and this does demonstrates (sic) multilevel degenerative disease."" And ""has restriction in range of movement of her left hip"". On 7 July 2012. Dr Hassan (at page 7 of Exhibit 10) reports: ""I reassured Mrs Meimaropoulos that there is no evidence of any neuropathology. I attributed her symptoms to 'lack of confidence' and pain due to degenerative disease of the spine.""Ms Welsh has not pressed this claim.

138The amounts I propose to allow are:

(1)Dr Davé $2670 (this includes an allowance for assistance for surgery in the operating theatre, but for the amount in Dr Dave's invoice);

(2)Sydney Southwest Private Hospital - $2689.70;

(3)Pharmacy $61.20 and a small buffer for analgesics ($500);

(4)Physiotherapy: I propose to allow the claim for $900 for the 18 visits. I will round this figure up to $1,000 to allow for a small percentage of subsequent visits including shoulder physiotherapy.

(5)Three visits to the neurologist (17 July 2009, $350; 15 July 2009, $105; 28 October 2009, $105) totalling $560.

139The total for past out of pocket expenses is $7,480.90.

140I am indebted to counsel for the defendants for his painstaking analysis of these accounts. The sum claimed by the plaintiff was more than twice this amount. Out of pocket expenses are rarely properly analysed, but where a defendant is able to demonstrate that items cannot or should not be claimed, the court must analyse these submissions and determine them accordingly: Dybka v McKenzie [2002] NSWCA 171.

Future out-of-pocket expenses

141The plaintiff's rotator cuff injury is not operable and requires no further treatment, as is the case with the injury to the trigeminal nerve. The plaintiff elects to take analgesics although she has been advised to use other medication. She is taking analgesics for other physical problems.

142A claim for medication for sleeping problems was abandoned. 

143The plaintiff should be awarded a very modest cushion to allow for some of these future analgesic purchases. I have accordingly allowed $1,000.

Past and future care

144The plaintiff's son gave evidence that he gave up work in 2010 to become his mother's carer. All the evidence points to his having done so partly as a result of her requirement for foot surgery and partly because of the ongoing family problems.

145He agreed in cross-examination that the work he had done around the house before 2008 had not changed after the accident. The basis of the claim for home care is that he gave up work outside the home in 2010. As the plaintiff's list of concerns to her psychologist shows, this was not a decision welcomed by the plaintiff.

146According to statements the plaintiff's son made to doctors in the medical reports tendered, he is in fact running a business from home. He conceded in cross-examination that this was the case, and acknowledged the purchase of a considerable amount of equipment for his home-based business.

147Ms Welsh's submissions on this issue were made so faintly that I was unclear whether the claim had been abandoned. On the assumption that it was not abandoned, I formally note that I accept the submissions made on behalf of the defendants, and am satisfied that the plaintiff did not receive, and did not require, any home care for her accident-related injuries other than gratuitous assistance (such as performance of heavier housework) of the kind that might be expected from an adult son living at home.

148No allowance is made for past or future home care.

149As the amount of damages award falls below the threshold under r 42.35 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) I have reserved the issue of costs. If no order is sought within 28 days, no costs orders will be made.

Summary of damages

150I summarise the damages as follows:

(1)Non-economic loss (at 22%): $25,000

(2)Past out of pockets: $7,480.90

(3)Future out of pockets: $1,000

(4)Past and future home assistance: Nil

(5)Less 15% contributory negligence (-$5,022.13)

Total: $28,458.77.

Orders

(1)Judgment for the plaintiff for $28,458.77.

(2)Costs reserved with liberty to apply, to be exercised in 28 days.

(3)Exhibits retained for 28 days.

		08 April 2014",2014-03-26 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705350,Application by Joy Lorraine Knight pursuant to s.78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 285,"Judgment

1JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Joy Lorraine Knight, seeks an inquiry into sentence under s.78(1) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (""Appeal and Review Act""). The Applicant submits that her matter ought be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

2The Applicant contends that there is a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance in her case, namely that the Applicant's sentence was infected by error in that undue weight was accorded to the standard non-parole period, contrary to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. 

3It is not necessary for the purposes of this application to canvass the nature of the process under s.78 Appeal and Review Act. It is sufficient to observe that the function I am exercising is administrative in nature, and it is not necessary to determine whether there is merit in the grounds of the application that might warrant interference in the sentence. Provided a doubt or question arises, it is appropriate that the application be granted. 

4The Applicant pleaded guilty on the day fixed for trial to an offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (ecstasy) contrary to s.25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years applies. 

5The primary offence arose from the arrest of the Applicant on 29 September 2005, when police located 961 grams of MDMA (ecstasy) in premises used by her. This amount is almost double the large commercial quantity of 500 grams. 

6The Applicant requested the sentencing court to take into account on a Form 1, four further offences of supplying various prohibited drugs, being:

(a) 440 grams of ketamine (where the indictable quantity is 12.5 grams and the commercial quantity is 1.25 kilograms);

(b) 139 grams of methylamphetamine (where the indictable quantity is five grams and the commercial quantity is 250 grams);

(c) 66 grams of cocaine (where the indictable quantity is five grams and the commercial quantity is 250 grams); and

(d) a quantity of cannabis.

7At first instance, the Applicant was sentenced on 24 May 2007 by her Honour Judge Murrell SC to a head sentence of 10 years' imprisonment, with a non-parole of six years commencing on 29 September 2005 and expiring on 28 September 2011. 

8The Crown appealed against sentence and, on 24 September 2007, the Court of Criminal Appeal allowed the Crown appeal and sentenced the Applicant to a term of 14 years and four months' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 10 years expiring on 28 September 2015: R v Knight; R v Biuvanua [2007] NSWCCA 283; 176 A Crim R 338. 

9The Applicant contends that a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance arises from Muldrock error which is said to be discernible in the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. The leading judgment of the Court was given by Howie J, with McClellan CJ at CL and Hidden J agreeing with additional comments. 

10The nature and circumstances of the Applicant's offending behaviour was described by Howie J at 342-343 [14]-[17]:

""14 The dates specified on the charge brought against Ms Knight represented the period over which police were monitoring her telephone calls. The date of 29 September 2005 was the date upon which police raided premises used by Ms Knight and referred to by her and others as the 'office' from where she carried out her drug business. The amount of drugs referred to in the charges of both respondents represented the amount of ecstasy found in those premises at the time of the raid. It was 961 grams, about twice the large commercial quantity specified for that drug. The charges referred to in the Form 1 related to other drugs found in the 'office' at the time of the raid and of a kind that Ms Knight was supplying over the period of surveillance. 

15 The agreed facts described Ms Knight as 'the head of a drug syndicate which involved a number of men who acted as runners' and who sold drugs on her behalf returning the profits to her. She supplied quantities of various drugs and was even prepared to arrange special mixtures depending on a particular customer's needs. She used persons, including Mr Biuvanua, to help sort, weigh and package the drugs. It is clear from the phone calls that she was prepared to supply very significant amounts of drugs that were obviously going to be on-supplied. Some of her customers were buying for personal use. The 'office' was open at night to allow the distribution of drugs by runners although persons also attended the premises to purchase drugs for themselves. Ms Knight maintained a ledger in which she recorded her transactions and this indicates that at times she supplied significant amounts of drugs to particular customers. 

16 The transcripts of the telephone calls are illuminating as to the nature of Ms Knight's enterprise. They contain references to the hours when the 'office' was open for business: it was not open on Mondays. Ms Knight told her partner in one of the calls that she was 'going to work now' at the 'office'. It appears that she employed a cousin to work for her who, according to Ms Knight, loved being back at work. Employees enquire when she would be requiring them to work and others report to her on the amounts of drugs they packaged on particular shifts and she comments on their performances. She chats to many of her customers as personal friends and offers discounts and assurances as to the quality of the drugs. She indicates to one customer that she is prepared to make up a particular combination of drugs, a 'party pack', for use and supply by him on a particular occasion. She is so self-assured that she indicates to one customer that she does not like talking in code. 

17 The statement of facts tendered before the judge stated, accurately: 

'Knight was in complete control of this syndicate and (demonstrated) a flagrant disregard for the law. It is clear from the telephone intercepts that Knight (considered) herself beyond the reach of the police'.""

11In support of the present application, the Applicant points to a number of passages in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal. Howie J stated at 346 [39]:

""The Judge described the objective seriousness of the offence committed by Ms Knight as 'at least in the mid-range of objective seriousness'. The Crown on this appeal conceded that 'her Honour correctly assessed the objective seriousness of the offending'. With respect to both the Judge and the Crown Prosecutor, it is impossible to understand how such an assessment fulfils the obligation on a trial judge in applying the standard non-parole provisions to assess the objective seriousness of the offence committed. Presumably the Judge thought that the offence was somewhere above midrange but believed that she did not have to assess the exact level of seriousness because it was sufficient that she found it was 'at least mid-range'. But with respect, if that is how her Honour approached the matter, she was clearly in error. Although such an assessment cannot be made with absolute precision, it must at least indicate whether the offence is assessed as below, of, or above midrange of seriousness with some indication as to the degree to which it departs from the midrange if that is the finding.""

12Reference was made to the judgment of Howie J at 346-347 [41]-[42]:

""41 On this summary of the criminal activity in which Ms Knight was involved, it is difficult to see how it could be assessed as other than above midrange. When also is added the following facts: that the conduct occurred over a month and was not an isolated episode of offending; that Ms Knight employed other persons to pack and prepare the drugs for supply; and that the amount of ecstasy found in the office on her arrest was almost twice the commercial quantity, it was in my opinion an offence that was objectively well over the midrange of seriousness although not at the upper range. A determination that it was 'at least in the mid-range of seriousness' was in my opinion not a sufficient assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence and was an error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. 

42 However, as the Crown did not take issue with the Judge's assessment but to the contrary accepted its correctness, this Court should give the benefit of the finding made by the Judge to Ms Knight and accordingly act on the basis that it was within the midrange of seriousness.""

13The Applicant relied, in particular, upon observations of Howie J at 347 [45]-[47]:

""45 In my opinion the sentence imposed upon Ms Knight is manifestly inadequate to a very significant degree. This is so even if the Court accepts in the respondent's favour that the objective seriousness of the offence was in the midrange of seriousness. There were a number of aggravating factors, as her Honour noted, and little but the discount for the plea of guilty of about 10 per cent and some prospect of rehabilitation in mitigation. Yet as against the guidepost of a standard non-parole period of 15 years, the respondent is required to serve only 6 years before being eligible for release to parole. 

46 The Judge failed to give adequate reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period notwithstanding the requirements of s 54B(4). It is necessary to remind sentencing judges once again that the section requires the court to 'identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account' (my underlining). This Court has repeatedly noted that it is insufficient compliance with the section merely to state that the offender has pleaded guilty: R v Mills (2005) 154 A Crim R 230; R v Zegura [2006] NSWCCA 230. Had the Judge attempted to fulfil the task required of her, she might have found it difficult to indicate those factors that permitted her to reduce the standard non-parole period to the degree she did for an offence that was 'at least within the midrange of seriousness'. 

47 In my opinion it is clear that the Judge failed to give sufficient weight to the standard non-parole period even though it provided only a guidepost or indicator of the appropriate sentence. Even after a plea of guilty there must be an appropriate relationship between the standard non-parole period and the objective criminality of the offence regardless of the other matters that may be taken into account by way of mitigation. When the objective criminality is above midrange then, of course, the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence becomes of more significance.""

14Finally, the Applicant pointed to the judgment of Howie J at 348 [50]:

""In my opinion, had there been a proper evaluation of her criminality as being well above midrange in seriousness, an appropriate discount for her plea of guilty of 10 per cent and even with a finding of special circumstances, the appropriate non-parole period should have been at least twice that imposed by her Honour. The courts must treat the standard non-parole provisions seriously, as Parliament intended, and bring them to bear in a meaningful way upon the sentence to be imposed even after a plea of guilty. If the Judge had approached the sentencing of Ms Knight in that way she could not have imposed a sentence anywhere near that which she did.""

15The Applicant submits that a relevant doubt or question has arisen in this case because the leading judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal has given primary or determinative significance to the standard non-parole period. Had the Crown appeal been considered in accordance with the decision in Muldrock, it was submitted that a different and lesser sentence would have resulted. 

16The NSW Attorney General submitted, firstly, that a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance on sentence cannot arise from an error of law in sentencing and that, in any event, there is insufficient evidence of Muldrock error to warrant referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal.

17The first submission cannot be sustained in light of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Sinkovich v Attorney General of NSW [2013] NSWCA 383.

18The Attorney General submitted that, when considering a Part 7 application based upon a claim of Muldrock error, careful consideration must be given to the role that the standard non-parole period played in the sentencing process. It was accepted that, in allowing the Crown appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal accorded significance to the standard non-parole period. It was acknowledged, as well, that the Court of Criminal Appeal placed more weight on the significance of the standard non-parole period than the sentencing Judge. However, it was submitted that the High Court in Muldrock observed that the standard non-parole period was to be taken into account as a legislative guidepost. The Attorney General relied upon Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 172 at [26]-[28] in support of the contention that no doubt or question concerning sentence arose in this case.

19The Applicant was sentenced following her plea of guilty. Unlike many other matters which have given rise to Part 7 applications, this is not a case where the Applicant was sentenced after trial with the principles in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 having full application. Even after Muldrock, the standard non-parole period may play a very significant role on sentence in a particular case: R v Nguyen [2013] NSWCCA 195 at [63]. This is such a case.

20The passages from the judgment of Howie J relied upon by the Applicant demonstrate that the Court of Criminal Appeal placed significant emphasis upon the standard non-parole period as a factor on sentence with respect to the Applicant. As the extract from the judgment (at [13] above) makes clear, his Honour used the standard non-parole period as a ""guidepost"", and an important one, an approach which is not inconsistent with Muldrock. This was understandable given the gravity of her offending conduct, involving her as a head of a drug syndicate engaged in the organised supply of different drugs for substantial gain. 

21The Form 1 offences added a feature to the case, demonstrating the multi-faceted nature of the Applicant's drug supply business. The Form 1 offences were significant matters to be taken into account on sentence for the primary offence, in accordance with the principles in Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115.

22This is not a case where a two-stage approach to sentencing has been taken. Rather, the application relates to a decision where the Court of Criminal Appeal formed the view that the standard non-parole period played a most significant part on sentence, having regard to all the circumstances of the case and, in particular, the objective gravity of the offence.

23I bear in mind that my function on this application is not to determine the merits of any appeal and the question whether the Applicant's sentence ought be reduced. The question on this application is whether there is a sense of unease or disquiet giving rise to a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance in the case, being alleged Muldrock error.

24Having considered the matters raised on the application, I am not satisfied that a doubt or question arises for the purpose of s.79(2) Appeal and Review Act.

25The application is refused.

		21 March 2014",2014-03-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705358,R v CMB [2014] NSWCCA 5,"Judgment
1THE COURT:  This is an appeal by the Attorney General pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 from the decision of Ellis DCJ imposing sentences upon the respondent on 4 April 2013.  The respondent pleaded guilty to four counts of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J and one count of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M of the Crimes Act 1900.  The s 61J offences each carry a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.  The s 61M offence carries a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 5 years.  The victim of these offences was in all cases the daughter of the respondent and they were committed in 2005 and 2006 when she was aged 11 and 12.  His Honour imposed sentences upon the respondent in each case by way of bond to be of good behaviour for periods of 2 years and 3 years as follows:
""1. The offender must be of good behaviour and appear before the court during the bond term if required.
2. The offender is to notify the Clerk of the Court of any change of address as approved by the Cedar Cottage Program Director.
3. The offender is to comply with the treatment undertaking signed on 14 November 2012.
4. The offender is to comply with all directions of the Cedar Cottage Program Director.
5. The offender is to remain in the Cedar Cottage Program until released from the Program by the Program Director.""
2The Director of Public Prosecutions declined to lodge a Crown appeal against these sentences on 17 July 2013.  On 26 July 2013 the Attorney General (unnecessarily) filed and served a notice of intention to appeal and an application for an extension of time within which to appeal.  The Attorney General filed a notice of appeal on 6 August 2013.
3In this Court the Attorney General contends that Ellis DCJ erred in the following respects:
1A. In erroneously taking into account how certain further disclosures by the respondent of other offences would have been dealt with under regulations made pursuant to the Pre-Trial Diversion of Offenders Act 1985 at a time when the regulations had by then been repealed.
1B. In failing to have regard to the errors that had been made in referring the respondent to the Program in the first place.
1C. In giving no weight or insufficient weight to the objective seriousness of the offences.
2. By imposing sentences that were in the circumstances manifestly inadequate.
Background
4The respondent sexually assaulted his daughter NB on numerous occasions between 2004 and 2006 when she was aged between 10 and 12.  This offending first came to light in 2011 when NB reported the incidents to police.  She was by then 17 years of age.  The respondent was interviewed by police on 27 October 2011 and charged on that day with 22 sexual offences against his daughter.  That was later reduced to five counts of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act, two counts of attempted aggravated indecent assault contrary to ss 61J and 344 of the Crimes Act and three counts of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M of the Crimes Act (""the first set of charges"").
5The respondent entered pleas of guilty in the Local Court to the first set of charges.  Because he had pleaded guilty to ""child sexual assault offences"" within the meaning of the Pre-Trial Diversion of Offenders Act, the respondent was potentially eligible for referral to the Pre-Trial Diversion of Offenders Program at Cedar Cottage.  That Program was established under the Pre-Trial Diversion of Offenders Regulation 2005.  Entry into the Program was conditional upon two events.  First, the offender must be referred by the DPP for assessment pursuant to s 10 of the Act.  Secondly, the offender must be assessed by the Program Director as suitable pursuant to s 14 of the Act.  If a person gives an undertaking at the request of a court under section 23, the court is (subject to sections 25 and 28) to proceed to conviction of the person for the offence concerned but is not to sentence or otherwise deal with the person in respect of the offence:  s 24 of the Act.  After the person has complied with the undertaking and the requirements made by or under the Act or the regulations, no further proceedings shall be taken against the person in respect of the offence:  s 30(1).
6On 3 April 2012 the DPP referred the respondent for assessment pursuant to s 10 of the Act.  The DPP was informed that there were no places available in the Program at that time.  The DPP informed the court of this advice, and the respondent was subsequently committed for sentence in the District Court.  On 9 August 2012, a place became available in the Program so the proceedings were remitted to the Local Court.
7On 17 August 2012 the matter came before Magistrate Railton in the Gosford Local Court.  His Honour erroneously purported to refer the respondent for assessment for consideration of whether he was suitable for referral to the Program, no doubt relying upon what he had been told by the solicitors for both sides.  On 23 August 2012 the DPP wrote setting out his view that the respondent was suitable and inquired whether a place was available.  The Program Director advised the DPP the following day that a place was available for the respondent in the Program.
8On 1 September 2012 the Regulation was repealed:  see ss 10 and 11 of the Subordinate Legislation Act 1989.  The effect of the repeal was that the Program was not available in relation to charges laid after 1 September 2012, but remained available in relation to charges laid before that date:  s 30 of the Interpretation Act 1987.
9In the course of being assessed for entry into the Program pursuant to s 14 of the Act, the respondent disclosed to staff at Cedar Cottage that he had committed additional sexual offences against his daughter to which her statement had made no reference.  He was therefore re-interviewed by police on 2 November 2012.  He was cautioned at the commencement of the interview.  The respondent indicated that he was making the further disclosures as part of the Cedar Cottage assessment process.  He described an incident in which he had used his mouth to sexually abuse his daughter in the family home in May or June 2005 when his wife was at church.  He described other offences that he had committed in the United Kingdom when NB was 9 years of age.  He also spoke of other occasions where he had sexually abused NB in the same manner in Australia in 2006 when she was 12 years of age.
10The respondent was subsequently charged with five further counts of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act and four counts of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M of the Crimes Act.  The charges were later reduced to four counts of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J and one count of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M (""the second set of charges"").
11The Program Director assessed the respondent on 7 November 2012 in respect of the first set of charges as being suitable for participation in the Program pursuant to s 14 of the Act.
12Both sets of charges were listed before the Gosford Local Court on 9 and 23 November 2012.  The respondent pleaded guilty on 23 November 2012 to both sets of charges and he was formally committed to the District Court for sentence.  On 31 January 2013 both sets of charges were listed at Gosford before Ellis DCJ for submissions on sentence.  With respect to the first set of charges the respondent gave an undertaking to participate in the Program for 2 years from 14 November 2012.  Although the respondent should then have been convicted on the first set of charges in accordance with s 24, that did not occur.  With respect to the second set of charges, his Honour simply fixed 4 April 2013 as the date for sentence.
13The DPP appears from the outset to have taken the view that the respondent should not be sentenced to full-time imprisonment.  The respondent's representative outlined the background to the charges and asked that the second set of charges be adjourned for sentence until the respondent had completed the Program.  That course was not opposed by the DPP.  The DPP indicated to the court that it would be ""unfair, given that they are very serious charges"" for the court to consider them at that time.  
14Significantly, his Honour asked about the attitude of the victim.  He was informed by the DPP that she had suffered psychological damage and had attempted suicide.  The DPP also confirmed that the victim had never been asked for her views about her father entering the Program and that she had in fact changed her name and totally disassociated herself from her parents.  It was, or should by then have been apparent, that the victim did not consent.
15His Honour observed that if the charges were to be adjourned for two years (as sought by the respondent) it would be ""hardly likely"" that he would be sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  His Honour said, ""if he was going to get a sentence of imprisonment, it ought to be now probably.""  The DPP's representative then acknowledged that the charges ""do call for a custodial sentence"" but stated that it was a ""difficult situation"" because the respondent had disclosed the offences as part of the Program.  She indicated that it would be ""against the spirit"" of the Program to sentence the respondent to a custodial term and proposed that he should receive a suspended sentence.  There was some discussion with his Honour about the imposition of s 12 bonds, conditioned upon successful completion of the Program.  The DPP's representative acknowledged that she would be content with that course.  His Honour indicated that he wanted to give the victim ""an opportunity to understand all of this"".  The DPP's representative suggested that a victim impact statement might be appropriate.  The proceedings were then adjourned to 4 April 2013 for sentence.
16On that day the DPP tendered the Crown briefs in respect of both the first and second sets of charges, reports from the Program Director dated 31 March 2013 and 3 April 2013, a four-monthly review report prepared by the Program Director and a victim impact statement.  The respondent tendered a report from Dr Bruce Westmore dated 9 July 2012.  Legal representatives for both sides indicated that they agreed that it would not be appropriate for the respondent to be sentenced to imprisonment.  The DPP summarised the procedural history and informed his Honour that up until September 2012, when the Regulation was repealed, the making of further disclosures as part of the Program would not necessarily generate fresh charges.  The respondent had to be charged with the second set of charges because the Regulation had not been renewed. As appears below, that was not a correct statement of the law.
17His Honour expressed a dislike for diversionary programs in cases where the victim did not agree, but stated that the case before him was different because the respondent was ""trying to do the right thing"" when he made the disclosures that led to the second set of charges.  His Honour indicated that he was proposing to impose a s 9 bond for a term that extended beyond the length of the respondent's involvement with the Program on the first set of charges.
18His Honour proceeded to sentence the respondent to a two-year s 9 good behaviour bond in respect of the s 61M charge of aggravated indecent assault and a three year good behaviour bond in respect of the four s 61J charges of aggravated sexual assault.  In his remarks on sentence his Honour referred to the procedural history and to the ""lapse"" of the Regulation.  He concluded that ""the only fair and just outcome"" would be to ""defer"" sentence so that the respondent could complete the Program.  He stated that this would mean that the respondent's position would then be ""identical"" to that of other defendants in criminal proceedings who were dealt with prior to the ""lapse"" of the Regulation.
19The DPP thereafter wrote to the victim and publicly announced on 17 July 2013 that he had declined to appeal against the sentences.
The legislative scheme
20The Program is constituted under s 30A of the Act.  The purpose of the Program is ""for the treatment of a person who commits a child sexual assault offence with or upon the person's child or the child of the person's spouse or de facto partner"":  s 30A(1).  The rationale for the Program was explained by Barr J in R v Humphries [2004] NSWCCA 370 at [23] as being ""to protect children and to encourage them to come forward without the fear of being held responsible for the break-up of families.""
21That objective of protecting the victim is reflected in s 2A of the Act, which is in these terms:
""2A Purpose of Act 
The purpose of this Act is to provide for the protection of children who have been victims of sexual assault by a parent or a parent's spouse or de facto partner. The Act provides for the establishment of a program administered by the Department of Health. In the implementation of the Act, it is intended that the interests of a child victim are to prevail over those of a person pleading guilty to a charge of sexual assault in relation to the child.""
22The Act applies to a person who is charged with a ""child sexual assault offence"" committed upon particular categories of victims.  Offences with which the respondent was charged fell within that term as defined.
23The Act provides that the prosecutor must first consider whether to refer an offender for assessment in relation to the offender's suitability for the Program.  Section 10 of the Act provides that the prosecutor must consider the guidelines set out in the Regulation and must also ascertain from the Program Director whether a place for the offender in the Program is available.  Prior to its repeal, cl 5 of the Regulation provided that the prosecutor should not refer an offender for assessment:
""(a) if the child sexual assault offence with which the offender is charged is alleged to have been accompanied by acts of violence towards the alleged victim or others, or
(b) if the offender is under 18 years of age, or
(c) if the offender has a prior conviction for a sexual offence, whether in New South Wales or elsewhere, or
(d) if the alleged victim is 18 years of age or more when the person first appears before a court in relation to the offence, or
(e) if the person has previously been requested under section 23 of the Act to give an undertaking in relation to any offence."" 
24If an offender is referred for assessment as to his or her suitability to participate in the Program, the Local Court may adjourn the proceedings pending the assessment:  s 13 of the Act. The offender must be assessed in accordance with the Regulation:  s 14(1) of the Act.  In this regard, cl 6 of the Regulation provided that the assessment must be ""carried out by means of structured clinical interviews"" of the offender and ""such other persons acquainted with [the offender] as the Director may determine.""
25A person who is to be referred for assessment in relation to the person's suitability for participation in the Program must be referred for assessment, and be assessed, in accordance with the regulations:  s 14(1).  The Director is then required to assess a person's suitability for the purposes of s 14(1) and in doing so may take into account any or all of a number of specified matters which appear to be relevant and any other matter which he or she considers to be relevant.  Those matters include statements made to police in relation to the offence, relevant information concerning treatment, interviews conducted as part of the assessment, whether the offender accepts responsibility for the sexual assault of the child and demonstrates understanding of the impact of the offence, whether the offender and the offender's spouse or de facto partner are prepared and able to participate in the Program and whether such participation is in the ""best interests of the child.""
26If an offender is assessed as suitable for the Program, the charges must not be dealt with summarily:  s 19 of the Act.  Upon entry of a guilty plea in the District Court or the Supreme Court, the offender will be requested to enter into an undertaking to participate in the Program for a period not exceeding two years, and during that period to comply with all reasonable directions of the Director:  s 23 of the Act.  If an offender gives this undertaking to the Court, he or she will be convicted of the offence in question, but will not be sentenced or otherwise dealt with in respect of the charges:  s 24 of the Act.
27The Act applies to an offender until an event occurs that causes the Act to ""cease to apply in respect of that charge"".  These events include:
Where the offender requests that the Act cease to apply: s 7.
Where a prosecutor informs a Magistrate that an offender is not to be referred for assessment:  s 12. (In this respect it should be noted that s 11 of the Act provides that the prosecutor must inform the Magistrate that the offender will not be referred if the prosecutor has ascertained that there are no available places for the offender in the Program).
Where a prosecutor informs a Magistrate that an offender has been assessed as not being suitable for participation in the Program:  s 16.
Where an offender does not enter a plea of guilty to a charge (unless the person pleads guilty to another child sexual assault offence, and that charge is accepted by the Magistrate) or if an offender's plea of guilty is not accepted by the Magistrate:  ss 17(3), 18 and 22.
Where an offender does not comply with the directions of the Program Director pending the offender's appearance before a higher court:  s 21.
28The offender may also apply to be released from an undertaking made to the Local Court at any time, in which event the offender will be sentenced as if the undertaking had not been given:  s 25 of the Act.  If an offender breaches an undertaking, and the breach is not minor or trivial, the court may sentence the offender as if the undertaking had not been given, or may extend it for a further period not exceeding 12 months:  s 28 of the Act.
Grounds of appeal - errors
Ground 1A:  His Honour erroneously took into account how certain further disclosures by the respondent of other offences would have been dealt with under regulations made pursuant to the Pre-Trial Diversion of Offenders Act  at a time when the regulations had by then been repealed.
29The appellant submitted that it was apparent from his Honour's remarks on sentence that he intended to structure a sentence that duplicated the effect of the Regulation as it had existed prior to its repeal.  His Honour indicated that he proposed to ""defer"" the sentence in order to enable the respondent to complete the Program and then continued as follows:
""Effectively this means that his outcome will be identical to that of all other offenders who have been honest and made admissions as part of their involvement in the Pre-Trial Diversion Program.  As I say but for the lapse of the regulation, this offender would never have appeared before this Court.""
30In R v ABS [2005] NSWCCA 255 the offender was unable to gain access to the Program due to the unavailability of places.  The sentencing judge deferred sentence under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 so as to enable the offender to undertake a rehabilitation course that was similar to the Program.  The Court determined that a s 11 deferral was ""entirely inappropriate"" given the objective seriousness of the offending conduct.  Buddin J observed at [18] that:
""...reconciling the outcome provided for in s 24 of the Act with the way in which the courts, particularly in recent times, have approached the sentencing of offenders who have committed offences as serious as those which the respondent committed, may be thought to be extremely difficult, if not impossible.""
31Moreover, the appellant contended that his Honour misconstrued the effect of the Regulation as it existed prior to its repeal in any event.  At page 2 of his remarks on sentence his Honour said the following:
""Originally, the regulations that deal with the pre-trial diversion of offenders program had a provision which allowed for full disclosure to be made and for a person to continue in the course without further charges or the matter being relayed back to the court.  That is in fact what has occurred in the past for all those who have been diverted to the program and who have complied with the program.  That is, further charges would not have been laid and the accused would not have been brought to this Court or sentence.  Unfortunately, for some reason, the regulation lapsed in September 2012, or some six weeks before the present charges.""
32That was an incorrect statement of the effect of the Regulation, which was unfortunately not drawn to his Honour's attention by any of the lawyers appearing before him in the proceedings.  Prior to its repeal, the Regulation did not contain any protection concerning disclosures made during assessment for, or during the course of, the Program.  The Program has never contained a provision at any time since the Act and the Regulation came into effect that modified the obligation for the Program staff to notify police when an offender confessed to further offences:  see, for example, s 316 of the Crimes Act.
33The appellant contended that prior to the repeal of the Regulation, if an offender confessed to other offences during the course of the assessment for, or treatment in, the Program, those offences would have been reported to police and charges would have been laid in the usual way.  His Honour stated that ""but for the lapse of the regulation, this offender would never have appeared before this Court.""  That was an incorrect statement made during the proceedings that neither party sought to correct and which was in fact supported by the Crown's representative.
34The repeal of the Regulation did change the position in respect of the second set of charges, in that it was no longer possible for the second set of charges to be referred to the Program.  Prior to its repeal, it would have been possible for the second set of charges to be referred to the Program, effectively combining both sets of charges.  However, it is incorrect to say that but for the lapse of the Regulation the respondent would not have been charged or brought to Court:  even if further charges were ultimately to be referred to the Program, they would still have been laid and the respondent would still have appeared before the Court during the assessment process and the giving of the undertaking.
35Additionally, prior to the repeal of the Regulation there was nothing that required further offences disclosed during the assessment process to be combined with earlier charges.  Rather, the later charges would be subject to the procedures required by the Act and the Regulation, namely, referral by the DPP and assessment by the Program Director.  The Regulation never had the effect of protecting further disclosures, nor did it require the offender to make any.
36The appellant contended that if the Regulation had not been repealed, it was not inevitable that the second set of charges would have been referred to the Program.  For example, the Program Director may have determined, in accordance with s 2A of the Act, that it was no longer in the interests of the child for the respondent to be referred to the Program.  The victim's attitude to her father being referred would likely have been particularly significant in this respect.  She was by then almost 19 years of age.
37In these circumstances the appellant submitted that his Honour erred in finding that the Regulation previously allowed for full disclosure to be made of conduct amounting to further offences without further charges being laid or the matters coming before the Court and in presuming that all offenders who made further disclosures pursuant to the Program would necessarily be dealt with under the provisions of the Act.
Ground 1B:  His Honour failed to have regard to the errors that had been made in referring the respondent to the Program in the first place.
38The appellant contended that the respondent was not even properly admitted to the Program in respect of the first set of charges.
39When the matter first came before the Local Court, the prosecutor informed the court that there were no places available for the respondent in the Program.  Section 11 provided that in these circumstances the prosecutor was required to inform the Magistrate that the respondent would not be referred for assessment.  Section 12 further provided that where a prosecutor informs the magistrate that a respondent is not to be referred for assessment, ""this Act shall cease to apply to the person in relation to the charge.""
40There is no provision that re-enlivens the operation of the Act once it has ""ceased"" to apply.  The appellant submitted that in such circumstances the prosecutor was not empowered to refer the respondent for assessment after the matter was remitted to the Local Court by the District Court.  Section 23 of the Act is conditional upon the offender being ""a person to whom this Act applies.""  It is therefore doubtful that the District Court had power under that section to accept the undertakings.  In R v ABS at [16], Buddin J commented that where the court is informed that no place is available in the Program for an offender, the Act ""ceases to apply"" and ""thereafter the matter could only proceed in what may be regarded as the conventional fashion.""
41By reason of the committal of the respondent to the District Court and the subsequent remittal of the charges to the Local Court, there was a delay of almost ten months between the first return date of the charges and the second referral of the respondent for assessment.  At the time of the second referral on 23 August 2012, cl 4 of the Regulation provided that the maximum adjournment period to enable the DPP to make a decision regarding referral was four weeks.  The same clause provided that the maximum adjournment period to enable a decision to be made regarding assessment was eight weeks.
42The appellant accepted that any errors concerning the referral of the first set of charges to the Program were not the subject of this appeal and that this Court had no jurisdiction concerning them.  The appellant submitted, however, that even though the errors were not detected below, they infected his Honour's decision to grant the respondent good behaviour bonds so as to give effect to a placement in the Program.  The appellant also contended that the errors might be relevant contextually in the exercise of the Court's residual discretion.
Ground 1C:  His Honour erroneously gave no weight or insufficient weight to the objective seriousness of the offences.
43It appears that his Honour concluded that a good behaviour bond was appropriate only by reference to the unfortunate procedural history of the charges and the rehabilitative benefits of the Program. His only reference to objective seriousness is to be found in his Honour's remark at page 4 that:
""Had he not been sent to the Cedar Cottage program, which this Court had nothing to do with, he would in the normal course of events [have] been committed to this Court for sentence and a lengthy sentence of imprisonment would have followed.""
44All of the offences were committed after 1 February 2003.  The appellant accordingly submitted that the offences in this case were objectively very serious having regard to the relevantly applicable standard non-parole periods.  
45The repeated and continued nature of the offences over an extended period had also to be taken into account.  As Buddin J remarked in R v ABS at [25], ""[t]his fact deprived the respondent of any claim for leniency which may have been available to him had his offending only involved an isolated incident.""  See also R v Holyoak (1995) 82 A Crim R 502.  The respondent engaged in various forms of sexual misconduct, each of which constituted a serious offence in its own right.
46The offences also involved the most fundamental breach of trust and abuse of parental authority:  see R v BJW [2000] NSWCCA 60; (2000) 112 A Crim R 1; R v JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209; (2000) 112 A Crim R 466; s 21A(2)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  The victim was also at a vulnerable age at the time of the commission of the offences and the offences caused her substantial emotional harm:  s 21A(2) (g) and (l).  The respondent instigated the offences and engineered the circumstances in which they were committed:  see generally R v CJP [2004] NSWCCA 188.
47In R v ABS, Buddin J commented at [26] as follows:
""[26] Offences involving acts of significant sexual exploitation against children are almost without exception met with salutary penalties.  Moreover, the legislature has in recent years provided for increased penalties in respect of many such offences.  It is an area in which the need to protect children from exploitation and to deter others from acting in a similar fashion assume particular significance:  see R v Fisher (1989) 40 A Crim R 442; R v Burchell (1987) 34 A Crim R 149 at 150-151.""
48Similar comments are to be found in R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; (2002) 54 NSWLR 368 at [57] and R v TJH [2001] NSWCCA 433 at [35].
49His Honour noted that the offending conduct involved acts that were ""in the main"" acts of indecency or cunnilingus.  The remarks on sentence do not in terms otherwise address the specific seriousness of the criminal conduct concerned.  The appellant contended that his Honour has accordingly failed in any way to take account of the objective seriousness of the offences.
Ground 2:  The sentences were manifestly inadequate
50The appellant submitted, uncontroversially in our opinion, that but for the fact that the offences came to light during the respondent's assessment for the Program, the sentences imposed would be well outside the range of permissible sentences for these particular offences. The prospect of rehabilitation alone would not have justified a non-custodial sentence.
51This is not a case where any particular factors such as mental impairment lead to a conclusion that deterrence, denunciation or retribution assumed some lesser significance than might ordinarily be the case. The appellant contended that, objectively assessed, the offences required the imposition of a substantial prison term.
52The single most important issue that demands consideration in this case is the effect and relevance of the fact that the circumstances underpinning the second set of charges only came to light as the result of the respondent's admissions made during the assessment phase of the Program.  Does that fact support a conclusion that the imposition of good behaviour bonds was within a range of permissible outcomes?  The appellant argued that it did not, for the following reasons.
53The appellant acknowledged that where an offender makes voluntary disclosure of involvement in serious crime that is unknown to police, and which may never have otherwise come to light, the offender is entitled to a ""significant added element of leniency"":  R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604; s 23(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  However, s 23(3) provides that a lesser penalty imposed as a result of assistance to authorities ""must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.""  The appellant also acknowledged that as entry into the Program was to an extent conditional upon disclosure of all previous offending conduct, the respondent's revelation of the further offences was partly the result of coercion. 
54These matters have to be balanced against the fact that the respondent was not given any false or misleading assurances or promises.  He was cautioned.  When he made the admissions he was in the course of being assessed for the Program.  Acceptance was not guaranteed.  He always faced the prospect of being sentenced for the further offences.
55The appellant also contends that it is significant that the respondent did not disclose the additional offences when first interviewed by police.  The appellant referred to the remarks of Barr J in R v Humphries at [23] that ""the applicant himself could have taken his chances of getting into the programme if he had been prepared to tell the police what had happened.""  See to like effect R v EGC [2005] NSWCCA 392 at [27].
56In summary, the appellant adopted the position that even with the significant added elements of leniency arguably indicated by the particular circumstances in which the admissions were made, a sentence of full-time imprisonment was still appropriate.
The residual discretion to dismiss Crown appeals - discussion
57The appellant acknowledged that this Court has a residual discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though it is erroneously lenient:  see Green and Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [1].
58Section 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provides that an appeal court must not dismiss a prosecution appeal or impose a less severe sentence than would otherwise be appropriate, because of any element of double jeopardy in the respondent being sentenced again.  That provision removes from consideration by this Court the distress and anxiety to which respondents to Crown appeals are presumed to be subject if they have to undergo sentencing for a second time and also prevents this Court from having regard to the frequency of Crown appeals as a sentencing principle:  R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; (2010) 77 NSWLR 7 at [141].
59The conduct of prosecuting authorities nonetheless remains relevant:  R v JW at [92].  The appellant conceded that there were at least two features of the present case that are relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion.  First, delay in instituting this appeal.  Secondly, the conduct of the DPP at first instance.
60In the present case there was a delay of three and a half months between the imposition of the sentence and the filing of a notice of intention to appeal.  That occurred eight days after the DPP publicly announced his decision not to file a Crown appeal.  The notice of appeal was filed ten days after that.
61The significant consideration is the extent and degree of prejudice that is occasioned by the delay.  The prejudice may be great if the respondent faced a return to prison following completion of the original sentence.  Even so, the seriousness of the crime may outweigh even substantial prejudice.  Presumptively the respondent is prejudiced by the delay in this case to the extent that a non-custodial sentence was originally imposed:  R v Y [2002] NSWCCA 191 at [34]; R v Tortell [2007] NSWCCA 313 at [63].  The appellant contended that the seriousness of the crimes being considered in this case outweighed the significance of any prejudice otherwise evident.
62More pressing would appear to be the circumstances that influenced his Honour in dealing with the respondent at the sentence hearing.  The prosecution quite plainly contributed to his Honour being led into error.  This is relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion:  R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561; R v Chad (NSWCCA, 13 May 1997 - unreported); R v JW at [92].  
63The facts sheet that was provided to his Honour correctly referred to the repeal of the Regulation and to the fact that in those circumstances the offences ""must be dealt with at law.""  However, at the sentencing hearing the prosecutor not only acquiesced in the Court imposing a good behaviour bond, but also misled his Honour with respect to a highly relevant matter, namely, the operation of the Regulation prior to its repeal.  Notwithstanding these matters, the appellant contended that the seriousness of the crimes and the manifest inadequacy of the sentences lead to the conclusion that this Court should intervene.
The respondent's position
64In response to ground 1A, the respondent submitted that the error was not material so that the ground was not therefore established.  But for the repeal of the Regulation, the second set of charges could have been dealt with alongside the first set of charges.  The respondent contended in those circumstances that the error was not material:  Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284 at [83].  The change was relevant to the operation of the Regulation but only to the extent that ""the technicalities were misunderstood by all parties concerned at first instance.""
65The respondent contended that ground 1B was not a proper ground of appeal.  Errors in relation to the respondent's admission into the Program on the first set of charges were irrelevant to the adequacy or inadequacy of any sentence imposed upon the respondent in relation to the second set of charges.
66The respondent dealt with grounds 1C and 2 together.  He submitted that his Honour did take account of the objective seriousness of the offences when passing sentence.  The difference between the parties in this respect would appear to be whether his Honour's reference to the likelihood of a substantial prison term was a sufficient recognition of the objective seriousness of the offences if the sentence imposed by his Honour did not itself otherwise appear to reflect or to give effect to that assessment.
67The respondent contended that his Honour demonstrated that he had a full appreciation of the objective seriousness of the offences and the prospect that they would ordinarily attract lengthy terms of imprisonment.  His Honour also had a similar appreciation of the unavoidable context of the Cedar Cottage Program that the respondent was undertaking.  It followed that the sentence was not manifestly inadequate having regard to the onerous nature of the Program and the careful monitoring of the respondent's behaviour to gauge compliance, his potential for progress to rehabilitation and the prospect that if the Program requirements were not met the respondent could be re-sentenced on all charges to a lengthy term of imprisonment.
68The respondent also drew attention to the importance of the limitation upon appellate review of the exercise of the sentencing discretion:  Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321.  This Court cannot simply substitute its opinion as to the appropriate sentence for that of the sentencing judge:  Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671-672.  On the contrary, this Court may only interfere where error is demonstrated:  R v Tait (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388; Wong and Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 605 and 624.  
69In support of these contentions the respondent made the following written submission:
""30.  As emphasised at the outset, a Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons.  This power, however, extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand:  Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299-300; Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321, at 340-1, and Wong and Leung v The Queen at 624.  Here, it is submitted, that in the unique circumstances of this case manifest inadequacy has not been established.  Should this Court find otherwise the residual discretion is relevant.""
70The so-called residual discretion was recently considered and discussed by the High Court in Green and Quinn at [1]-[2], [24] and [43] as follows:
""[1] The primary purpose of appeals against sentence by the Attorney-General or Director of Public Prosecutions (Crown appeals) under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 ... is 'to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons.' That purpose distinguishes Crown appeals from appeals against severity of sentence by convicted persons, which are concerned with the correction of judicial error in particular cases. The Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D, has a discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient. That discretion is sometimes called the 'residual discretion'.
[2] In Crown appeals, circumstances may combine to produce the result that if the appeal is allowed the guidance provided to sentencing judges will be limited and the decision will occasion injustice. Relevant circumstances include consequential disparity relative to an unchallenged sentence imposed on a co-offender and delay in the appeal process which may be associated with disruption of the offender's progress towards rehabilitation. In such cases it may be appropriate for a court of criminal appeal, in the exercise of its residual discretion, to dismiss a Crown appeal....
[24] Section 5D was enacted in its original form in 1924. Crown appeals under s 5D and like provisions in other States and Territories have long been regarded by this Court as exceptional. That exceptional character, reflected in the primary purpose of such appeals, informs the exercise of the Court's 'residual discretion' embedded in the words 'may in its discretion' in s 5D(1). That 'residual discretion' is a discretion to dismiss a Crown appeal notwithstanding that the sentence appealed against is shown to be erroneously lenient. Where an appeal is allowed, the powers to vary the sentence and to impose such sentence as seems proper are engaged. Those powers should be read with the general provisions of the Sentencing Act which constrain and inform their exercise....
[43] Other circumstances may combine to produce injustice if a Crown appeal is allowed. They include delay in the hearing and determination of the appeal, the imminent or past occurrence of the respondent's release on parole or unconditionally, and the effect of re-sentencing on progress towards the respondent's rehabilitation. They are relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion. The guidance afforded to sentencing judges by allowing the appeal should not come at too high a cost in terms of justice to the individual."" 
71Without in any way wishing to derogate from the significance of the respondent's other contentions, it is apparent that the exercise of this Court's residual discretion to decline to intervene in this case lies at the heart of his response to this appeal.  The respondent proffered detailed submissions in this respect to the following effect.
72The residual discretion, where it is exercised, necessitates an immediate and highly subjective assessment of the circumstances of the case in hand:  R v Holder and Johnston [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 256.  In determining whether or not it should be exercised, it is open to the Court to look at material that has occurred up to the time of the hearing of the appeal:  R v Deng [2007] NSWCCA 216; (2007) 176 A Crim R 1 at [28]; R v Todorovic [2008] NSWCCA 49 at [32].  If this Court determines that error has been established in this case, it should nevertheless exercise its discretion not to intervene and re-sentence the respondent on the basis of the following factors.
73First, it is appropriate for the Court in the exercise of its residual discretion to dismiss the appeal where the guidance provided to sentencing judges will be limited and the decision will result in injustice:  Green and Quinn at [2].  In the case of this respondent, the guidance provided to sentencing judges will be particularly limited and the decision will result in injustice when account is taken of the unique procedural history of the matter, including the fact that the admissions that led to the second set of charges were made with a view to the respondent's participation in the Cedar Cottage Program that has since been dismantled.  It is of particular relevance to the exercise of the residual discretion that the charges that are the subject of this appeal were disclosed as a result of compliance with that Program.  The offending had not been reported by the victim and would not have come to the attention of authorities but for the respondent's confession to the Cedar Cottage counsellor.
74Secondly, there was considerable delay by the Crown in lodging the appeal:  R v Hernando [2002] NSWCCA 489; (2002) 136 A Crim R 451 at [30]:  R v JW at [92].  The respondent was sentenced on 4 April 2013.  On 26 July 2013, the Attorney General served a notice of intention to appeal.  Section 10(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, which provides that an appeal must be filed 28 days from the date of sentence, does not apply to Crown appeals.  While there is no formal time limit to bring a Crown appeal, the delay in bringing it is a matter relevant to the Court's exercise of its discretion whether to intervene:  Green and Quinn at [43].  
75Thirdly, the case is being conducted on appeal partly on a different basis to that pursued at first instance:  see R v JW at [92]:
""Accordingly, conduct by the Crown with respect to sentence hearings and Crown appeals may be taken into account in exercising the discretion as to whether to intervene at all.  Such matters are not, in my opinion, limited to considerations of double jeopardy.  The responsibility of the prosecutorial authorities for the fair, just and proper administration of the criminal justice system is such that many forms of inappropriate or unfair conduct can be taken into account in the exercise of the power and discretion vested in a Court.""
76Fourthly, the respondent has made substantial progress toward rehabilitation:  R v Tortell at [63]; R v SC [2008] NSWCCA 29 at [55]; and ""the effect of re-sentencing on progress towards the respondent's rehabilitation"" are factors that should be taken into account:  Green and Quinn at [43].  This is a factor that looms large in this appeal and clearly emerges from the respondent's affidavit and the reports from the Cedar Cottage Program.  Additionally, the Attorney General concedes that there is a degree of prejudice that arises from the fact that a non-custodial sentence was imposed at first instance:  R v Y at [34]; R v Tortell at [63].
77Fifthly, the forensic conduct of the Crown below must be considered:  R v Allpass, R v JW at [92].  The Crown did not challenge the approach adopted by his Honour and in fact positively led the Court into error.  The Attorney General concedes that it is relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion if the prosecution leads a court into error at first instance.  
78At the proceedings on sentence on 31 January 2013, the Crown representative said this:
""NORRIS:  Your Honour I don't object to that course of action.  It would be unfair, given that they are very serious charges, to perhaps look at them at law at this point in time.  It would be against the spirit of the program and it was just that on 1 September 2011 [sic, 2012], the lapse of the regulation, he wasn't entitled to have those dealt with as part of the program which would've been the normal course.  So it would be unfair to deal with him in any other way at this point I think your Honour.""
79Further, at the sentencing proceedings on 4 April 2013, the Crown representative responded to comments from the bench as appears in the following exchange:
""HIS HONOUR:  And is the suggestion that up until September 2012 there was a regulation which provided that if a person made further disclosures that could, as it were, be taken into account as part and parcel of what had brought him before Cedar Cottage in the first place?
NORRIS:  Correct....
HIS HONOUR:  And people like that do not normally put their hand up and say yes I did it all, they often go to trial as my list will show here, 50% of pending trials in this place relate to allegations of a sexual assault and often with children and there is a rather large stigma so I have always considered that a plea of guilty in a sexual assault involving a plea of guilty to sexual abuse of a child is more likely to be demonstrative of genuine contrition than a plea of guilty in some other areas because it brings with it a rather large social stigma.
All right well today you are asking me to allow him to continue in the Cedar Cottage program by giving him a s 9 bond conditioned that he comply with the Cedar Cottage program.
DAY:  Yes.
HIS HONOUR:  What is the Crown's attitude to that?
NORRIS:  Well it seems like a sensible course of action.  I can't put before your Honour the penalty that normally would be invoked by these offences given that that's against the spirit of the program and it is not the accused's fault that in fact the regulation lapsed as much as the Crown would like to submit otherwise.""
80Sixthly, s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act  dealing with double jeopardy has not removed from consideration evidence of any actual anxiety or distress experienced by the respondent to a Crown appeal:  DPP v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 79 NSWLR 1 at [175], R v Rae [2013] NSWCCA 9 at [71].  In this context the affidavit of the respondent is relevant.
81Finally, in R v Hernando at [12], Heydon JA (as he then was), with whom Levine J and Carruthers AJ agreed, indicated that the Crown must surmount two hurdles if the Court is to impose a more severe sentence.  The first is identification of an appellable error.  The second is negativing any reason why the residual discretion of this Court not to interfere should be exercised.  The Court in R v Smith [2007] NSWCCA 100 took the opposite approach in relation to onus.  Hernando, however, has been considered, applied and cited with approval in a number of cases:  see for example R v Tam Van Nguyen [2004] NSWCCA 155 at [39], R v Fadde Assaad [2009] NSWCCA 182 at [46].  The respondent contended that the Attorney General bears the onus of negativing any basis for the exercise of the residual discretion.
Consideration
Ground 1A
82It seems apparent that his Honour's approach to the sentencing problem that confronted him was significantly born of a not unreasonable concern for the fact that the respondent was facing charges based upon a voluntary disclosure of conduct that might not otherwise have come to light.  In simple terms, some unfairness arguably attended the disclosures.  The respondent was never eligible for inclusion in the Program in respect of the second set of charges.  He was not given any false or misleading assurances or promises and always faced the prospect of being charged.  It is therefore not entirely clear whether at the time he confessed to his further criminal conduct he erroneously expected or believed that he was eligible for inclusion in the Program with respect to that conduct, or that he would not have revealed the earlier offences without such an expectation or belief.  It is also not entirely clear whether or not the respondent apprehended that admissions made in the course of the Cedar Cottage counselling or assessment phase would not be made the subject of criminal charges.  Having regard to his treatment with respect to the first set of charges, such an apprehension on his part seems unlikely.  
83It is apparent that his Honour was attempting, to the extent possible, to ameliorate or eliminate the consequences of the perceived unfairness.  The approach that he took was both fostered and encouraged by the Crown.  The patent unavailability of his Honour's approach should have been drawn to his attention.  His Honour's so-called error was directly referable to a failure by the Crown to address him accurately on the law as it then applied.
84As unfortunate as that combination of failings may have been, it nonetheless bespeaks error.  We are unable to accept that the error was not material or merely technical.  It underpinned and characterised the whole sentencing process.  So much is apparent from his Honour's references to the fact that the offences would ""otherwise"" have attracted significant custodial terms.  The assumption of, and reliance upon, factors otherwise permitting a departure from what the circumstances warranted, which his Honour described as ""a lengthy sentence of imprisonment"", was erroneous.
Ground 1B
85This ground is without merit.  The correctness or validity of the respondent's referral or admission to the Cedar Cottage Program was not before his Honour for determination.  The Crown's attempt to enliven possible or even established irregularities concerning his referral or admission to that Program in aid of the current appeal is precatory at best.
86As noted already, the appellant has accepted that any errors concerning the referral of the first set of charges to the Program were not the subject of this appeal and that this Court had no jurisdiction concerning them.  We do not accept in such circumstances that even though the errors were not detected below, they therefore somehow infected his Honour's decision to grant the respondent good behaviour bonds facilitating his continuation in the Program.  Nor in our opinion can it helpfully be said that the errors become relevant contextually in the exercise of the Court's residual discretion.  This is so for the fundamental reason that there was no legal basis for the admission of the respondent to the Program on the second set of charges quite independently of whether or not the respondent's admission to the Program with respect to the first set of charges was also in doubt.
Grounds 1C and 2
87At the centre of any assessment of the adequacy or inadequacy of the sentences imposed by his Honour must be an understanding and appreciation of the details of the particular offences concerned.  The offences charged, based upon what the respondent revealed to the police during his electronically recorded interview, were as follows:
""Offence 1 - Aggravated Indecent Assault
Between 1 May 2005 and 30 June 2005 whilst residing at Green Point, the victim got into her parent's bed whilst the accused was sleeping.  The victim's mother was attending a Sunday morning church service.  The accused woke to find the victim in his bed and began stroking her legs with his hands.  The accused was lying on his back with the victim's head against his chest.  The accused had his right arm around the victim.  The accused began to stoke the victim's vagina with his fingers and stated 'I stroked her on her clitoris'.  The accused did this for a few minutes before rolling her onto her back.
Offence 2 - Aggravated Sexual Assault
Whilst the victim was on her back the accused parted her legs and removed her underpants.  The victim was wearing a nightie and the accused recalls that he was wearing a tracksuit, as it was cold.  The accused was kneeling on the floor and was bent over the bed.  The victim was lying on her back on the bed with her legs parted.  The accused believed that the victim was pretending to be asleep as she was lying still with her eyes closed.
The accused kissed the victim's vagina using his lips.  The accused indicated that he then used his tongue to lick the victim's clitoris.  The accused did this for some time before getting back into his bed.  The accused stated that the victim rolled over and placed her head on his chest.  The accused placed his arm around the victim and he returned to sleep.  The accused did not say anything to the victim during this incident nor did she say anything to him.  The victim was 11 years of age at this time. 
Offence 3 - Aggravated Sexual Assault
During the electronically recorded interview with the accused he indicated that there were occasions where he 'orally abused' the victim during the year 2006 when she was 12 years of age.  On one occasion in 2006 the victim was lying on a lounge in the downstairs lounge room of the family home at Green Point.  The accused was kneeling on the ground next to her.  The accused bent over the victim and kissed her vagina with his lips prior to licking her clitoris with his tongue.  The accused stated he did this for approximately one or two minutes before stopping.
Offence 4 - Aggravated Sexual Assault
On a further occasion in 2006, the victim was lying in her parent's bed with the accused.  The child was lying on her back.  The accused told the victim to spread her legs and he kissed her vagina prior to licking her clitoris for approximately one to two minutes.  After doing so the accused rolled the victim over so that she was laying face down on the bed.
Offence 5 - Aggravated Sexual Assault
On a further occasion during the year 2006 the victim was lying on her parent's bed with the accused.  The victim was lying on her back on the bed.  The accused climbed off the bed and knelt on the floor beside it.  The accused spread the victim's legs apart and kissed her vagina prior to licking her clitoris whilst she was lying fully on the bed with her legs apart.  The accused did this for approximately one to two minutes.  The accused indicated that the victim had her eyes closed and was pretending to be asleep.  The accused climbed back onto the bed.""
88We have already indicated our opinion that these offences were objectively very serious.  They were not isolated in number or time and extended over two years.  The physical acts involved were also not confined to a single reoccurring act but were multifaceted.  It also goes without saying that the familial relationship between the respondent and his daughter compounds the seriousness of all the offences as they involve the most basic breach of trust existing between a parent and a child.  There is no issue that the offences also caused the victim substantial emotional harm, culminating in her complete disinclination to have any further contact with her parents and her understandable refusal to endorse or engage in the respondent's referral to the Cedar Cottage Program in the first place.
89Subject to consideration of whether or not the residual discretion not to intervene should be exercised in this case, we consider that the sentences imposed by his Honour were erroneously lenient and manifestly inadequate.  No sentence other than a period of full-time imprisonment is appropriate.  That is so in our opinion even after the subjective and procedural considerations are taken into account.  These are considered and evaluated below.
The proper sentence
90In NT v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 143 at [38]-[39], Harrison J referred to authority dealing with sexual abuse by parents as follows:
""[38]... this Court has on many occasions stressed the need to protect children from sexual abuse by adults and that this is especially so when the perpetrator is the victim's parent. In R v Dent (Court of Criminal Appeal, 14 March 1991, unreported) Lee J at [6], with whom Gleeson CJ and Loveday J agreed, stated:
'One begins with the proposition . . . that our community views with great concern the sexual molestation of children by adults and that has been acknowledged by the legislature in providing for greater penalties when the victim is under sixteen . . . That acknowledgement has been in our legislation over a long period of time. Little children are entitled to grow up free from defilement by sexual predators and free from risk of psychological upset, confusion and difficulties in later life, caused by such conduct.
When a child is living in a family situation, he or she is particularly vulnerable to sexual molestation from the male parent, or stepparent. The community regards the family unit as one in which each parent is in a position of trust in respect of the child, under a duty to rear it and give it proper guidance and to refrain from using the child for sexual pleasure. The child is usually helpless to protect itself against sexual attack from the parent - as in this case - and that can be seen in so many other cases of a like kind that come before us. One sees in such cases that the child is too embarrassed, too afraid or develops too great a sense of guilt to complain. When the male parent takes advantage of the helplessness of the child, he not only commits a breach of trust, but it is a cowardly breach of trust. The protector of the child's body, the guide and mentor of the child, in those circumstances has abandoned his proper role in order to gratify his lust on the child'. 
[39] It is well established that the age of the victim is important in determining the criminality of the offending behaviour. Generally speaking, the younger the victim the more serious the criminality due to the helplessness of a young child in a family unit:  R v BJW (2000) 112 A Crim R 1 at [21], a case involving a 13 year old child.""
91These remarks remain relevant and pertinent in the context of the present case.
92More particularly, material tendered without objection in this appeal by the Crown for consideration in the event that this Court were minded to allow the appeal and to re-sentence the respondent, confirmed in stark and troublesome terms the profound and deleterious effect that child sexual abuse may have upon victims for many years, if not for the whole of their lives.  That material consisted of reports from Dr Colette Hourigan dated 1 May 2013 and Dr Patricia Jungfer dated 9 May 2013.  Part of Dr Jungfer's report is in the following terms:
""9.3 [The respondent's daughter] reports as a consequence of the experiences in her childhood and the events subsequent to the disclosure of the sexual abuse, that her entire life has been disrupted.  She reports that her academic performance, her right to a stable and secure home environment, her ability to socialise, engage in an intimate relationship have all been devastated by the ramifications of the sexual assault.  She reported as a consequence of disclosing the sexual assault, a constant preoccupation with what occurred, although prior to the disclosure this was something that she constantly focussed on and tried to put out of her mind.  She described developing a strategy of dissociating from her past and her experiences to be able to function in the community.  She continues to work hard at repressing the events that occurred in an attempt not to have to deal with the emotional consequences of acknowledging these events.
9.4 [The respondent's daughter] reports recurrent intrusive thought about the sexual abuse that occurred to her.  She dreams of the sexual abuse.  She finds it difficult to concentrate and focus with the thoughts constantly intruding.  Coupled with the thoughts of the abuse are feelings of guilt, self blame and considering that she is in some way at fault for the circumstances.  She describes difficulties with concentration, memory, avoids wanting to have to deal with the issues in any way, shape or form.  She actively avoids engaging in relationships with others for fear that she will be abused and that her trust will be broken.  She finds it difficult to enjoy and experience pleasure in a sexual relationship.  She has found it difficult to form friendship relationships because of her secret past.
9.5 [The respondent's daughter] as a consequence of the disclosure of the events, and as a consequence of the ramifications of this, became seriously depressed and has made a number of severe suicide attempts.  She continues to have thoughts of self harm, remains depressed, has difficulties with regards to self esteem, decision making and self confidence.  [Her] ability to engage in normal community activities has been profoundly affected by the events that occurred to her with the repeated sexual contact with her father.  This repeated sexual contact has also resulted in a confusion regarding her identity.  She is troubled by the events that occurred and distressed that the events occurred and she did nothing to stop them.  She maintains a somewhat childlike approach to the events that occurred and blames herself for the activities, internalising the accusations that were directed by her parents.""
93It is uncontroversial that the facts underpinning the second set of charges only came to light as the result of the respondent's admissions made during the assessment phase of the Program.  However, the significant added element of leniency to which the respondent is therefore entitled must not lead to a sentence that is unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offences. The respondent's entry into the Cedar Cottage Program was conditional upon full disclosure of all previous offending conduct, so to that extent the respondent's revelations were partly the result of illegitimate influences.  While that must be a matter of significance, it should also be noted that the first set of charges arose from complaints by the victim that were unrelated to the respondent's admission or self-reporting of the criminal conduct involved.  The respondent did not come forward before that occurred.  To that extent the context in which the admissions were made consisted of a process that was only taking place as the result of a police investigation triggered by the victim's original report.  The revelations by the respondent that led to the second set of charges did not therefore materialise in a neutral setting, but were clearly prompted by the looming prospect of imprisonment in relation to the first set of charges.  There was a considerable element of self-interest in the respondent's admissions, which were not in those circumstances unambiguously altruistic or purely cathartic.  The additional offences were not in that sense unconditionally volunteered. 
94Part of the material upon which the respondent relied in this Court included an affidavit affirmed by him on 25 November 2013.  It was read against the contingency that this Court might consider terms of imprisonment were warranted.  The whole of the affidavit is relevant to that consideration.  Portion of it is in these terms:
""2. Between September and November 2012 I was assessed for participation in the Pre-Trial Diversion of Offenders Program run by Cedar Cottage. During the course of assessment I was told that treatment is based on making a full disclosure of all offences, not just those for which I had been charged. 
3.  I made a disclosure of additional offences to Cedar Cottage during assessment. I wanted to be completely honest and open to my wife and family in saying this is everything that happened. If I did not disclose everything, both my daughter and I would know I was participating in the Program on the basis of a lie by omission. 
4.  I do not want to spend any more of my life living with secrets and the fear of their being disclosed. 
5.  During assessment I came to understand the only way I could adequately demonstrate my remorse was to disclose the additional offences to the police. I had previously been told that established precedent was that these offences were normally included with those for which I was being assessed by Cedar Cottage. 
6.  After disclosing to Cedar Cottage I consulted my solicitor about going to the police. I voluntarily attended an interview with the police at Wyong police station and was subsequently charged with these additional offences.
7.  I was advised by my solicitor that prior to the change in Regulations additional offences disclosed during assessment could be included with the original offences for referral to Cedar Cottage.
8. I was admitted to the Cedar Cottage Program in November 2012. I am very grateful to be given this opportunity to rehabilitate myself. I feel a tremendous obligation to my wife, my family and the many others who have faith in me to rehabilitate myself. I promised my family that I shall do everything in my power to complete the Program because I don't want to let them down.
9.  Though I was relieved to be accepted into Cedar Cottage, the additional charges were a source of great anxiety when I commenced the Program. I experienced deep depression while waiting to be sentenced. I managed this with considerable help from my therapists at Cedar Cottage. 
10.  I was relieved that the sentences were such that I could continue to participate in the Cedar Cottage Program. I felt that I could now concentrate on my participation in the Program. I am very aware that failing to complete the Program or any breach of my good behaviour bonds will result in my imprisonment. I felt that my fate was now dependant on my behaviour, and my actions, attitude, diligence and effort in completing my treatment at Cedar Cottage.""
95It is apparent that, with minor and presently irrelevant exceptions, the respondent adhered to the conditions of the Program and complied with its rules.  He expressed both his desire to complete the Program and his opinion that it was of great benefit to him and, he hoped, ultimately to his family.  The respondent has deposed to being extremely anxious about the outcome of these proceedings and to being terrified at the prospect of gaol.  He has had suicidal thoughts from time to time.  He also expressed remorse in his affidavit in the following terms:
""58. I look back in astonishment, horror and shame at the sexual abuse I perpetrated on my daughter and the behaviour that I am capable of.  There are no words that adequately express the remorse I feel for the pain, distress and ruin my actions have caused my daughter and family.  There is no apology I can give that will make it up to them.  Every day I regret my abusing my daughter.  I wish I could somehow undo the harm I have done.""
96These are all important matters to be taken into account in the sentencing equation.  Indeed, the respondent's rehabilitative efforts are impressive and well documented.  It is a troubling matter that the imposition of a custodial sentence carries with it the necessary, or at least highly likely, consequence that those rehabilitative endeavours would be severely truncated if not entirely destroyed.  That is a concern that also commands incorporation in the sentencing process, including a finding of special circumstances.  It leads necessarily to the result that the sentences that we are minded to impose are less than those that should have been imposed if the respondent had been sentenced by his Honour.
97There are also at least two other matters that are important in that context.  They are first, the attitude and approach taken by the Crown in the proceedings on sentence before his Honour, and secondly, the question of delay.  Whatever else may be said about the fact that his Honour received less than proper assistance from the bar table, the net effect of what occurred included vocal support from the Crown for a non-custodial sentence.  It is not to the point that such support only arose because of the misunderstanding concerning the application and the applicability of the Act to the second set of charges.  It had the significant consequence that the respondent was not then sentenced to a term of imprisonment, as in our view he should have been, and he has since then been subjected to a wholly unsatisfactory and undoubtedly distressing uncertainty concerning his fate.  The effect upon him of that uncertainty has no doubt been considerably exacerbated by the fact that the announcement of what should happen to him has ultimately run an arguably unsatisfactory course over many months until the publication of these reasons.  These are matters that should be taken into account in the overall assessment of what is a proper sentence in this case.  They also combine to produce the result that the sentences that we consider to be appropriate now are less severe than sentences that might have been imposed if the respondent had been sentenced when he should have been.
98The respondent relevantly pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.  He is entitled to a discount of 25 percent for the utilitarian value of that plea.
99In the circumstances of this case, paying due regard to the objective seriousness of the offending conduct, and the particular subjective factors attending the respondent, no penalty other than the imposition of a term of full-time imprisonment is appropriate.  The nature of the offences under consideration commands the imposition of sentences that recognise and give effect to the requirements of punishment, denunciation and retribution, as well as specific and general deterrence.  The importance and relevance of these factors are not in our view offset in this case by the respondent's particularly awkward current uncertain status or the subjective considerations outlined in his affidavit and elsewhere.  
100We have already indicated that the s 61J offences each carry a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years and that the s 61M offence carries a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 5 years.  
101We consider that the respondent should be sentenced as follows.  For the s 61M(1) offence, the respondent should be sentenced to a term of 12 months, reduced to 9 months for the early guilty plea, with a non-parole period of 6 months.  For each of the s 61J offences, the respondent should be sentenced to a term of 4 years, reduced to 3 years for the early guilty plea, with a non-parole period of 2 years.  The sentences for offences 1 and 2 should be concurrent in as much as they concern the one incident and the s 61M offence does not materially add to the criminality inherent in the s 61J offence.  There should however be some accumulation of the other sentences to reflect the fact that they each concern discrete incidents.  We consider that the respondent should be sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 5 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years.
Should this Court re-sentence?
102It will be apparent that we have taken the view that the answer to that question should be yes.  The issue was discussed with counsel in the course of this appeal.  No strong or principled opposition to the respondent being sentenced by this Court was raised by either side.  Indeed, material was placed before this Court by both sides for consideration in the event that we were minded to re-sentence the respondent.  Neither counsel indicated a desire to make additional submissions upon the issue or upon the proper sentence in the circumstances.  Senior counsel for the respondent did not suggest or indicate that there was any further or other material upon which she would propose to rely in the event that the matter were remitted to the District Court for sentence.  There is as well the added consideration of even further delay if that course were to be adopted.  It will be apparent from what has already been said about delay that such an outcome would be entirely unsatisfactory. 
The residual discretion to dismiss Crown appeals - conclusions
103In accordance with the s 68A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, any presumed distress or anxiety occasioned by the need to re-sentence the respondent must be disregarded.  The same is not true of actual distress and anxiety to which a particular respondent to a Crown appeal may be subject.  The distinction is made plain in the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in De La Rosa at [174]-[175] as follows:
""[174] At [14] in JW, the Chief Justice provided a summary of the propositions which emerged from his analysis of the situation following the enactment of s 68A. His Honour said: 
'The following propositions emerge from the above analysis:
(i) The words ""double jeopardy"" in s 68A refer to the circumstance that an offender is, subject to the identification of error on the part of the sentencing judge, liable to be sentenced twice.
(ii) Section 68A removes from consideration on the part of the Court of Criminal Appeal the element of distress and anxiety to which all respondents to a Crown appeal are presumed to be subject.
(iii) Section 68A prevents the appellate court exercising its discretion not to intervene on the basis of such distress and anxiety.
(iv) Section 68A also prevents the appellate court from reducing the sentence which it otherwise believes to be appropriate on the basis of such distress and anxiety.
(v) Section 68A prevents the Court from having regard to the frequency of Crown appeals as a sentencing principle applicable to an individual case by taking either step referred to in (iii) or (iv), or otherwise.'
[175] I have added my own emphasis to make plain my understanding of his Honour's reasoning. In short, s 68A has removed from consideration the element of anxiety and distress to which all respondents to a Crown appeal are presumed to be subject. However, it has not removed from consideration any actual anxiety or distress occasioned by the fact that the respondent may be re-sentenced. Notwithstanding s 68A, being a subjective consideration of that particular offender, it must be considered. The appropriate sentence must be informed by all of the relevant objective and subjective circumstances. It may be that, in the circumstances of a particular respondent, including his or her actual anxiety or distress, the appeal court should exercise its discretion and decline to intervene (at [95], [146]) or impose a lesser sentence.""
104The respondent's affidavit sets out in detail the matters that he has drawn to this Court's attention in terms of the anxiety and distress to which he has been subject since he was notified of the Attorney General's proposal to prosecute this appeal.  The affidavit was read without objection or cross-examination.  We accept that the respondent's description of how this appeal has affected him is both truthful and reasonable.
105The respondent did not become the subject of the present appeal until three and a half months after the imposition of his original sentences.  Unlike many cases in this area, the respondent does not face a return to prison following his release upon completion of the original sentence.  The prejudice faced by a respondent to a Crown appeal in such cases would be considerable.  However, in our opinion, the prejudice faced by an offender anticipating a return to prison on the one hand and that confronting the respondent, being the prospect of imprisonment for the first time on the other hand, cannot legitimately be distinguished.  Each is likely to be significant in its own way and the source of considerable prejudice, albeit in slightly different terms.
106The prejudice to the respondent arising in this way has also to be assessed in light of the fact that the Crown representative at the sentencing proceedings was largely, if not predominantly, responsible for the way in which his Honour dealt with the respondent in the first instance.  It is probable that his Honour would not have placed the respondent on bonds if it had been apparent to him that the respondent was not eligible for consideration as a candidate for admission to the Program.  But for that error, the respondent would, and should, have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment.  We do not understand the respondent in this case to suggest otherwise.  If it is suggested, we are unable to accept it. 
107However, we do not consider that the conduct of the Crown representative in the proceedings before his Honour could be characterised as either inappropriate or unfair. The undiluted responsibility of the prosecutorial authorities for the fair, just and proper administration of the criminal justice system produced a result at first instance that the respondent quite obviously sought to embrace.  The Crown's errors were not the subject of complaint by the respondent's representative at the time.  His latter day dissatisfaction with what occurred is as much the result of his representative's arguably opportunistic, if understandable, failure to correct the error as it is the result of the error itself. 
108The Cedar Cottage Program has now been dismantled.  To that extent at least the determination of this Court has a more limited effect than it otherwise might.  For example, this Court's decision will be of no utility in guiding courts or practitioners with respect to the operation of the Pre-Trial Diversion of Offenders Act.  The significant aspect of this case, that the respondent disclosed the offences in the course of complying with requirements for entry in that Program, is unlikely ever to arise again.
109We are not satisfied that the respondent's apparent progress within the Program so far, and his accepted rehabilitative achievements, are sufficient to outweigh the patent seriousness of his offending and the corresponding propriety of imposing a sentence upon him that reflects it.
110We are ultimately not satisfied that there is any basis upon which, or reason why, this Court should exercise its residual discretion not to intervene.  We take the law to be that ""the onus lies upon the respondent to establish that that discretion ought to be exercised in his or her favour"", as indicated by Simpson J in R v Smith at [60].  The respondent in this case has identified and analysed an impressive collection of factors pertinently informing the exercise of that discretion. The identified matters do not satisfy us, however, that his Honour's sentencing discretion did not wholly miscarry in a way that mandates correction in this Court.  It is correspondingly wholly inappropriate in this case to exercise the available discretion not to intervene.
Conclusions
111In the circumstances the Court makes the following orders:
1. Allow the appeal.
2. Quash the sentences imposed upon the respondent by Ellis DCJ on 4 April 2013.
3. In lieu of the sentences imposed upon the respondent by Ellis DCJ, sentence the respondent to an aggregate sentence of 5 years and 6 months commencing on 19 March 2014 and expiring on 18 September 2019 with a non-parole period of 3 years expiring on 18 March 2017.
4. The first date upon which the respondent will become eligible for release on parole is 19 March 2017.

		19 March 2014",2014-03-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705377,R v FAZAH [2014] NSWSC 231,"SENTENCE

1The offender, Farden Fazah, has pleaded guilty to the murder of his child and the wounding of his wife with intent to cause her grievous bodily harm, the two offences having been committed in the course of an incident at their home unit in Canley Vale on 1 January 2011. His plea of guilty to the charge of wounding with intent in respect of his wife was accepted by the Crown in satisfaction of a count of wounding with intent to murder her.

2Murder carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for life and a standard non-parole period in this case of 25 years, while wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm carries a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years.

Facts

3An agreed statement of facts records that the offender and his wife, Rasa Fazah, were both born in Afghanistan. They met in 2003 in Pakistan, and married in 2006 in Afghanistan. The offender came to Australia, where his family were living, and he was granted Australian citizenship in July 2007. In December of that year Rasa joined him, having been granted a spousal visa.

4At the time of the offences the offender was 32 years old, and Rasa was 24. The child who was the victim of the murder was their daughter, Maria, who was born in September 2008. She was their only child, and she was 2 years old when she met her death.

5The relationship between the offender and his wife was troubled. The offender was controlling of her, forbidding her to manage her own money or to buy groceries on her own. Shortly after she arrived in Australia, there was an argument during which she cut her wrist with a knife. The offender took the knife from her and stabbed himself in the stomach area, saying words to the effect of, ""Before you stab yourself I will stab myself."" He threatened her with cancellation of her sponsorship and her removal from Australia. Her mother in Afghanistan insisted that she remain with him and be an obedient wife. 

6On a number of occasions the offender was violent towards her. On one of those occasions, when she was about 5 months pregnant, he threatened to kill her if she told police about his violence or wanted to divorce him. However, he promised not to hit her again. On an occasion in February 2009, he punched her to the face during an argument. A concerned neighbour called the police and, as a result, an apprehended domestic violence order for 6 months was made. On yet another occasion, during an argument, he said that he would not hit her again, adding, ""Next time if I hit you I will kill you, I will kill Maria and I will kill myself.""

7However, he was never violent towards the child, Maria, and always treated her affectionately. 

8The fateful day, 1 January 2011, was the offender's 32nd birthday. Rasa Fazah had made an arrangement to go to the beach with a friend, Fariha Kanwal, who lived at unit 1 in their block, with their respective children. In the morning of 1 January, although the offender appeared to be resentful of the fact that Ms Kanwal and her children were to join them, he said that he was happy to go to the beach with the family. However, he later changed his attitude. During an argument about an inconsequential matter he became angry, and Rasa said, ""Do you not want to go to the beach? You go and tell Fariha we are not going.""

9Rasa left their unit, unit 6, and went to unit 1. She told Ms Kanwal that she and the offender were having an argument, and that they were not going to the beach. She was upset and crying by this time because the offender would often change their plans. The two women discussed going to a nearby park, but remained in unit 1 because it was cooler than unit 6.

10Rasa returned to unit 6 and collected Maria, some personal belongings and some spare clothes for the child. The offender said, ""If you leave, don't come back."" Raza replied, ""You are always saying these things, I am going to Fariha's house because it is too hot.""

11She returned to unit 1, where she and Ms Kanwal decided to go to the park with their children. At about 6.30pm she returned to unit 6 because Maria had wet herself and required a change of clothes. She and the offender did not speak to each other. At one stage she said to the child, within the hearing of the offender, that they were going to the park and that she would give her some juice. The offender called out, ""You cannot go anywhere.""

12He walked over to her and raised his hand with a closed fist. He put his hand across her neck and pushed her against a wall next to the fridge. He laughed and said, ""You are scared of me"". Rasa said, ""No, I am not scared of you, if you hit me I will call the police, I want my phone"". He said, ""Are you serious?"" She replied, ""Yes, I am serious, if you hit me I will call the police"". Rasa walked over to the lounge, where her phone was.

13As she approached the lounge the offender started punching her to the right side of her face, around six times. She was screaming and trying to cover her face. Maria was standing in the same room, screaming and crying. She was uninjured at that time.

14The offender walked to the front door and locked it, then hurriedly walked to the kitchen. Rasa ran to the door and opened it, and then ran down the stairs. The offender chased after her. The child was left alone in their unit.

15The stairs led to a ground floor landing. As Rasa reached the bottom of the stairs, she tripped over and fell to the ground. The offender stood over her, holding a kitchen knife. Rasa said, ""Don't do this, please don't do this"". The offender stabbed her deep into her right shoulder. She held her hands above her face and her heart to protect herself. She could feel the knife striking her arms, hands, shoulders, face, chest and stomach. She called out for help, and she could hear Maria calling out her name from upstairs.

16Ms Kanwal opened her unit door, which was close to where the assault was taking place. She saw the offender bent over Rasa and he turned towards her, pointing the bloodstained knife in her direction. She quickly closed her door and called 000.

17A bystander, Son Tran, was nearby outside the building at that time. He heard screams and ran over. He saw the offender standing over Rasa, striking her as she was on the ground. He saw the offender strike her directly to the face twice. Mr Tran picked up a skateboard that was nearby and screamed out to the offender to get back. He moved closer towards the offender and Rasa. The offender ran away up the stairs towards unit 6.

18Mr Tran went to Rasa, noticed that she was bleeding heavily, and asked if she was ok. Rasa replied, ""My 2 year old daughter, she's still upstairs, he has got her with him, please, please."" Mr Tran asked what unit she was from and she told him it was unit 6. He walked up the stairs. He found a knife, with a broken handle, on the stairs. He was concerned that the offender may be armed in his unit so he did not knock on the door. He went back down the stairs to assist Rasa and arranged for a nearby relative to call the police.

19Rasa was concerned about Maria because she could not hear her screaming anymore. She said to him, ""My daughter is still up there with him, please help, please help."" During this time the offender used another knife to inflict fatal stab wounds to the child. He then inflicted various stab wounds to himself. 

20Police arrived on the scene a little after 6.45pm. Asked what had started the argument, Rasa said, ""My husband would not let me go out with a friend, he never lets me out."" She was conveyed to Liverpool Hospital. At about 7.20pm Tactical Operations officers arrived and attempts were made to get the offender to leave the unit. 

21Police made contact with him by phone and told him they were concerned for his welfare. At about 7.45pm, in a phone conversation, the offender said that he was injured. Asked if the child was ok, he did not reply. Asked if he was ok, he replied, ""I have hurt myself ... help me, break my door, I have stabbed myself heaps of times, I need help, she is dying ... I cannot open the door, I'm hurt. I cannot get up, I need help, I am stabbed, my child is dying.""

22Shortly thereafter police entered the unit. The offender was sitting on the lounge room floor, covered in blood, and the child was lying near him, motionless, on her back. First aid was applied to both of them and they were rushed to hospital. 

23Attempts to revive Maria at Westmead Children's Hospital were unsuccessful. According to a post mortem examination, the direct cause of her death was ""penetrating incised (stab) wounds to chest and upper abdomen"". She was found to have three stab wounds to those areas. In addition, she was found to have minor recent injuries to her right leg and bruising to her upper neck ""possibly reflecting blunt force trauma to this side at around the time the stab wounds had been inflicted"".

24Rasa Fazah was taken to Liverpool Hospital. She was found to have numerous stab wounds to her upper body, arms, hands and head. She was severely bruised to the face. The treating surgeon opined that the injuries observed were consistent with direct and defensive injuries in the course of an assault with a sharp object such as a knife. The injuries to the hands would cause ""prolonged considerable morbidity and reduction in function."" She was cleared for discharge 7 days later, although she had to remain in hospital for a further period while arrangements for housing were made for her.

25The offender was taken to Liverpool Hospital. On his arrival his Glasgow Coma score was 14 and he had no detectable blood pressure. There were puncture wounds to his neck, chest and abdomen. He underwent surgery, where a penetrating wound to his left chest and a laceration of the anterior abdominal wall muscles were repaired. The treating surgeon noted other superficial abdominal lacerations and three small puncture wounds to the neck. Analysis of a blood sample taken from him detected no drugs or alcohol.

26When interviewed by police on 7 January 2011, the offender said that he could not remember anything. He asked to see his wife. He was discharged from hospital on 11 January. He has remained in custody since his arrest on 1 January 2011.

Victim impact statement

27Rasa Fazah was told of the death of her child on 2 January 2011. Police described her reaction as ""overwhelming"", screaming over and over, ""Not my daughter, not my daughter."" She told police that the only reason she had stayed with the offender was for the child's sake. She begged police to take her to Maria and said that she wanted to die too.

28At the sentence proceedings she read a victim impact statement. It must have been very difficult for her. As one would expect, she was very emotional and she had to pause from time to time to compose herself before she could continue. Nevertheless, she persevered with courage and dignity.

29As one might also expect, the focus of her statement was upon the loss of her daughter, not her own injuries. She said, ""I have scars all over me, my face, my hands and my body that I can't even look at myself but these scars are not as deep as the emotional pain."" She went on to describe eloquently her love of Maria, her grief and outrage at the child's violent death, and the enduring effects that this tragedy has had upon her life. I expressed my deepest sympathy to her at the time, and I do so again now.

Subjective case

30The offender is now 35 years old. He has no previous convictions. His background is to be found in the reports of Dr Usman Malik, a psychiatrist who has been treating him in custody, and Dr Iliana Hepner, a neuro-psychologist who examined him for these proceedings. I also received evidence from his older sister, Nasiba Sediqi, whom he has believed to be his mother. She had brought him up in her household since he was an infant, apparently because their mother was sick and she had to assume responsibility for him. She regards him as her son. 

31The offender had a difficult upbringing. He was born in Kabul, Afghanistan. His family belonged to the Tajik community, a minority group within the larger Afghani community. He demonstrated learning difficulties at school. Nevertheless he was educated to year 12 and entered university to study journalism. However, he did not fare well at university either.

32In 1993, when he was in his early teens, he set fire to a shop in Kabul. It seems that he later had no memory of having done so, and the matter was treated as a medical problem. He was diagnosed as suffering from epilepsy, and there was a history of seizures from time to time thereafter. 

33He experienced wartime conditions throughout his upbringing in Kabul. There were attacks by rockets and bombs in the area where the family lived, and his sister observed this to affect him badly. In the later 1990s, while he was at university, he was captured by the Taliban. He was held by them until he escaped in 2003. During his incarceration he was tortured. On one occasion, he was put in a room with dead bodies when they thought he had died secondary to the injuries he sustained as part of the torture. One another occasion he was present when two prisoners either side of him were shot dead.

34During this period he lost contact with his family, who had migrated to this country in 1999. Contact was restored after he escaped, when Ms Sediqi found him in Pakistan and set in train arrangements for him to join them in Australia. 

35Here, he obtained some trauma counselling through the NSW Service for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture and Trauma Survivors (STAARTS). He also saw a Centrelink psychologist and was put on a disability support pension. He worked intermittently as a security guard.

36Dr Malik saw the offender when he first came into custody. He described him as ""vague and perplexed"", apparently unable to answer basic questions. He also appeared ""regressed and child-like at times. "" In 2012 he suffered a stroke, which required rehabilitative treatment. There were incidents of self-harming behaviour and what the doctor described as ""obvious levels of psychological distress."" He was transferred to a specialist unit at Bathurst for psychotherapy, from which he has benefited greatly. 

37Dr Malik diagnosed the offender as suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ""due to the war, kidnapping and torture he endured in Afghanistan."" The condition manifests as ""depression, flashbacks, periods of dissociation, and self-harming behaviour, including suicidal thoughts and plans.""

38While noting the benefit of psychotherapy, Dr Malik saw the offender's prognosis as ""poor while he is in gaol due to aspects of his prior imprisonment over many years by the Taliban, and how his current isolation and imprisonment in gaol reminds him of that past traumatic experience.""

39Dr Hepner saw the offender in January of this year. She summarised the results of her testing, conducted across two sessions with the assistance of an interpreter, as follows:

""Findings of neuropsychological assessment reveal evidence of impaired performance relative to age expectations in his intellectual function involving Perceptual Reasoning, attention, speed of information processing, new learning and memory, basic reading and arithmetic skills, and frontal executive functions. His responses on a self-report questionnaire indicate significant problems with global executive functions in his everyday environment, including problems with behavioural regulation, emotional control and higher level problem solving. He also reports elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression. Mr Fazah performed adequately on measures of test taking effort and there was no evidence during the examination to suggest that he was deliberately attempting to present himself in an impaired manner.""

40Dr Hepner referred to the history of the offender's problems with cognition and behavioural/emotional control from his childhood and to his experience of torture at the hands of the Taliban, which included beatings to the head and having his head held under water. She thought it likely that this had caused cumulative brain damage as the result of repeated traumatic brain injury (TBI) and/or hypoxic episodes. She referred to his symptoms of PTSD in similar terms to those described by Dr Malik. She also noted that the 2012 stroke might have had an impact on his current level of cognitive function.

41Dr Hepner concluded:

""Taken together, the cognitive impairments and problems with executive functions in the everyday environment (eg, behavioural regulation, emotional control and higher level problem solving), as detected on current assessment would be explainable in the context of Mr Fazah's complex background history including difficulties with cognition and behavioural/emotional control dating back to childhood, the psychological (PTSD) and physical (repeated TBI and/or hypoxic episodes) effects of being tortured, his psychiatric condition and medullary stroke.

From the history provided, and on balance, the psychological and physical effects of being tortured would have likely compounded any pre-existing problems with cognition and behavioural/emotional control, and likely increased his proneness to impulsivity and poor judgement. The extent to which this may have impacted on his behaviour at the time of the index offence, however, it is not possible to say.""

Sentencing

42The seriousness of the murder of the child, Maria hardly needs emphasis. The gravity with which the murder of children is viewed is reflected in the standard non-parole period for that crime of 25 years rather than the period of 20 years applicable to murders generally. The offender inflicted a number of stab wounds upon an innocent 2 year old child, to whom he stood in the most important position of trust of all. The conclusion that he intended to kill her is irresistible. 

43The offence of wounding his wife with intent to cause her grievous bodily harm is a serious one of its kind. The offender ceased his attack upon her only because of the intervention of the courageous Mr Tran. She suffered significant and enduring physical injuries and, plainly enough, the attack on her has contributed to the serious psychological state which she continues to suffer as a result of the incident as a whole. The effects of that psychological injury are set out in a portion of a notice of determination by the Victims' Compensation Tribunal, part of the Crown bundle, exhibit A. 

44I have referred ([6] above) to an occasion earlier in the relationship when the offender threatened his wife that, in the event of further dissention between them, he would kill her, their child and himself. The Crown prosecutor did not suggest that the present offences were an attempt to carry out that threat. What occurred was spontaneous, not premeditated, and I accept her characterisation of the incident as a very violent outburst by the offender, enraged by behaviour of his wife of which he did not approve, against the background of a controlling and sometimes violent relationship. However, I am troubled by the Crown prosecutor's further submission that his killing of the child was intended as the ""ultimate injury"" to his wife. That is an inference which might be drawn but I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it should. I accept the submission of the offender's counsel, Mr Winch, that he was in a state of ""high arousal and uncontrolled emotions"" during which he went back to the unit, lashed out at the child and then at himself. I am unable to determine beyond reasonable doubt what might have been his motive for his attack on the child.

45Some light is cast upon his behaviour, both at the time of the offences and throughout his relationship with his wife, by his background and, in particular, his distressing experience of war torn Afghanistan and of captivity under the Taliban. It would seem from the report of Dr Hepner that that background has had cognitive effects, although allowance must be made for the fact that she assessed him after the 2012 stroke. More important are its effects on his behavioural and emotional control and his propensity to impulsivity and poor judgment. Dr Hepner did not attempt to assess the extent to which this might have borne upon his behaviour at the time of the offences. I am satisfied that it had some effect. I accept that it bears upon the issues of moral culpability and general deterrence, although not to a marked degree.

46While the offender has not expressed remorse for his crimes, I accept Mr Winch's submission that he demonstrated remorse by the injuries which he inflicted upon himself, which appear to have been a serious attempt at suicide, and by his pleas of guilty. In the earlier stages of these proceedings there was an issue as to his fitness to stand trial, and he entered those pleas promptly after that issue was resolved. The Crown prosecutor very properly acknowledged that he is entitled to the full benefit of their utilitarian value.

47He is entitled to a measure of leniency because of his lack of any criminal history and his deeply troubled background. I also take into account the fact that his psychological state arising from his period as a prisoner of the Taliban will make his experience of prison more distressing. His prospects of rehabilitation are not easy to assess but I think that they are reasonable. He appears to be responding to psychiatric treatment and he enjoys the continuing support of his sister and other members of his family. Clearly, upon his release he would benefit from an extended period of conditional liberty, subject to supervision and the sanction of parole. 

48In relation to each offence regard must be had not only to the maximum sentence prescribed but also the standard non-parole period, which is to be approached in the manner explained by the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39, 244 CLR 120 and now enshrined in the recently amended s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Clearly, there is good reason to fix a significantly lower non-parole period in each case. Although the two offences were part of the same incident, partial accumulation of sentence is necessary to reflect their criminality.

49While the offender is entitled to a reduction of sentence for each offence because of the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty, I do not propose to quantify that reduction as a percentage. For the murder I would have imposed a sentence of the order of 30 years but, in recognition of the plea, I shall reduce that to 24 years. I believe that any greater reduction would result in a sentence inadequate to mark the gravity of the crime. In like manner, for the offence of wounding with intent I shall reduce what would otherwise have been a sentence of 9 years to 7 years. In respect of each offence I shall fix a non-parole period at the statutory proportion (reduced to a round figure in the case of the offence of wounding with intent). Accordingly, the sentence for the murder will be 24 years with a non-parole period of 18 years, and for the wounding with intent a term of 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. 

50I shall accumulate the sentences by 2 years, producing an aggregate sentence of 26 years with an effective non-parole period of 20 years. Those figures preserve the statutory proportion, again in round figures. While there is ample material to establish special circumstances which might justify a departure from that proportion, the offender has the benefit of parole eligibility for 6 years and, here also, any lesser minimum term would be insufficient to reflect his criminality.

51Farden Fazah, for the wounding of your wife with intent to cause her grievous bodily harm you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 5 years, to commence on 1 January 2011 and to expire on 31 December 2015, and a balance of term of 2 years, to commence on 1 January 2016 and to expire on 31 December 2017. For the murder of your daughter, you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 years to commence on 1 January 2013 and to expire on 31 December 2030, and a balance of term of 6 years, to commence on 1 January 2031 and to expire on 31 December 2036. You will be eligible for release on parole on 31 December 2030, and the aggregate sentence will expire on 31 December 2036.

		14 March 2014",2014-03-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705386,NSW Police v Le Platrier [2014] NSWLC 10,"Judgment

1The case before me raises a question which arises regularly in the Local Court about the effect of an application being granted under section 4, Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (""the Appeal Act"").

2Where a person is dealt with in their absence for a driving offence that carries a mandatory period of disqualification from driving, on conviction the disqualification (whether imposed by the court or by operation of law) takes effect. If the person is subsequently detected driving, they are required to attend court for the offence of Drive While Disqualified (now contrary to section 54, Road Transport Act 2013). 

3Not infrequently such a person then lodges a section 4 application under the Appeal Act. Where such an application is granted and the conviction and sentence are set aside, the question arises as to whether the offence of Drive While Disqualified allegedly committed during the period between the court decision on the original offence and the court decision on the section 4 application can be made out as a matter of law (and leaving aside any ""honest and reasonable mistake of fact"" issue that might arise).

4Put simply, does an annulment of a conviction and sentence on a section 4 application take effect ab initio, or only prospectively from the date of the annulment.

5This is the situation in which Mr Le Platrier (or Platrier, both names are used in the court papers) finds himself. His driving record is complicated, and arguably very poor, and I do not propose to try to go further into it than is necessary for this decision. During 2013 he had matters before courts at Balmain, Penrith, Parramatta, Burwood and Waverley for various driving offences.

6On 6 September 2013 he was detected by police driving in Petersham. On that date his licence status was ""Disqualified"". That was because on 26 July 2013 at Balmain Local Court he had been dealt with in his absence for the offence of Drive While Disqualified, allegedly committed on 14 February 2013. The mandatory disqualification period of two years (because Mr Le Platrier had previously been convicted of Drive While Suspended) was imposed, from that date.

7An application under section 4 against the decision of 26 July 2013 was heard and determined at Balmain Local Court on 18 September 2013. The conviction and sentence were quashed. Subsequently, Mr Le Platrier pleaded guilty to the offence and was dealt with, without conviction, by way of a bond under section 10(1)(b), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That happened on 11 October 2013.

8The Drive While Disqualified of 6 September 2013 was adjourned to Waverley Local Court as there were other matters listed here. Prosecutors were asked to consider whether this was an appropriate charge in the circumstances. The matter was adjourned a number of times for that purpose. On 5 February 2014 in proceedings before me in which Mr Le Platrier was unrepresented a plea of guilty was entered to a replacement charge of Drive While Suspended on 6 September 2013 at Petersham. When the driving record was tendered I queried the basis on which the prosecutor alleged that the defendant's licence was in fact suspended on that day (the record suggested that it wasn't, an earlier suspension for demerit points having finished on 8 January 2013 and a later suspension for demerit points having finished on 28 August 2013).

9Having considered the matter further the prosecutor sought to proceed on a re-laid Drive While Disqualified charge, arguing that on the basis of a number of decisions the effect of the order of Balmain Local Court on 18 September 2013 was to annul the disqualification only from that date onward, not retrospectively, and that therefore the offence was made out.

10The decisions to which I was referred include a decision of a fellow magistrate of this court. On 11 October 2011 in Police v Victor Khoury at Ryde Local Court Magistrate Reiss found that the effect of an annulment was prospective only. 

11His Honour placed significant reliance on of Justice James in RTA v Papadopolous [2010] NSWSC 33 in coming to the view that the term ""annul"" in question here should be interpreted in the same way as the word ""quash"" in section 202, Road Transport (General) Act 2005, in respect of a Magistrate's power to quash an habitual offender declaration. Justice James decided that the quashing of an habitual offender declaration (which imposes a five year driver licence disqualification) takes effect prospectively only.

12Uninstructed by other authority, I did not initially agree that this decision assists with the interpretation of the word ""annul"" in the legislation here in question. I took a different view about the effect of quashing of a conviction pursuant to a section 4 application. I reserved my decision in order to consider this issue further.

13Justice James in Papadopoulos placed particular reliance on the fact that the quashing of an habitual offender declaration was different from other cases where annulment took effect ab initio. His reasons for that conclusion appear at [52]-[54]:
52 The context in which the word ""quash"" is used in the present case is different from a context in which the word is frequently used and in which the word has usually been interpreted as meaning annul ab initio. 
53 The context to which I am referring is where there has been a decision by a primary decision-maker and what is quashed is the decision by the primary decision-maker, on the grounds that the decision was erroneous in some way at the time it was made. Examples include the quashing of a criminal conviction or the quashing of an administrative decision on grounds such as denial of procedural fairness or jurisdictional error. 
54 In the present case, on the other hand, there was no decision by a primary decision-maker and hence no erroneous decision by a primary decision-maker. The declaration of Mr Papadopoulos as an habitual traffic offender arose by the operation of s 28 of the General Act 1999 from the convictions he had incurred, without any decision by a judicial officer, and the disqualification of Mr Papadopoulos arose by the operation of s 30 of the General Act 1999 on the habitual traffic offender declaration, without any decision by a judicial officer.

14While a section 4 application does result in a decision by a primary decision maker being annulled, it is not necessarily because of any error in that decision. In some circumstances, that might be the case. So, for example, a section 4 application is equally appropriate to remedy a situation where a person has been convicted of an offence of which they are not in fact or law guilty, as it is to permit a person to set aside a conviction but nevertheless plead guilty to the offence (as was the case here). In this matter I do not have before me anything that would indicate the basis on which the application was granted at Balmain Local Court on 18 September 2013.

15The Appeal Act makes specific provision for the effect of an annulment in section 10, which provides:
(1) On being annulled, a conviction or sentence ceases to have effect and any enforcement action previously taken is to be reversed.
(2) The annulment of a conviction for an offence that has been heard together with another offence for which a conviction has been made does not prejudice the conviction for the other offence.(3) If a fine is annulled, any amount paid towards the fine is repayable to the person by whom it was paid.(4) The Consolidated Fund is appropriated to the extent necessary to give effect to subsection (3).

16A disqualification from driving is a ""sentence"" by reason of the definition in section 3 of the Appeal Act. Of course, most sentences cannot be imposed in a person's absence. If a person is absent, the only penalties that can be imposed by a Local Court are fines or orders under section 10 or 10A, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (see section 25 of that Act). Disqualification from driving, on conviction, follows by operation of law in respect of certain offences, and can also be imposed in a person's absence by a court that imposes a fine or a section 10A order. 

17There are a number of decisions arguably relevant to the interpretation of this provision. However, none directly assists with the meaning of section 10(1), which is critical to a determination of this issue.

18Since I reserved this matter for decision the Court of Appeal has dealt with a somewhat similar matter in Roads and Maritime Services v Porret [2014] NSWCA 30, delivered 28 February 2014. In that case the respondent had been disqualified from driving for a drink driving offence. She subsequently drove during the disqualification period and was convicted in relation to that. Later, she lodged a severity appeal against the original fine and disqualification, and her appeal to the District Court was granted by setting aside the conviction, and making an order under section 10, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, as permitted by section 20 of the Appeal Act when read with the definition of ""varying a sentence"" in section 3(3A) of that Act. Ms Porret then appealed against her sentence on the disqualified driving offence. In the District Court Haesler DCJ set aside her conviction, on the basis that the section 10 order had the effect of setting aside the disqualification for the PCA offence ab initio.

19The Court of Appeal drew a distinction between a case involving jurisdictional error on the part of the original decision maker, and one that did not (at [32]). The court was dealing with an application in relation to a sentence that did not involve a challenge to the conviction, other than for the purpose of making an order under section 10, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In those circumstances, Chief Justice Bathurst determined that the effect of the provisions of the Appeal Act would generally only operate prospectively. Accordingly, Ms Porret was disqualified on the date of the offence even though that disqualification was subsequently set aside following her severity appeal.

20That decision does not assist with the proper interpretation of section 10(1) of the Appeal Act, however it is generally consistent with other decisions on the effect of setting aside, annulling or quashing convictions. The appeal in Porret was a severity appeal. The conviction was only set aside in order to impose a section 10 order.

21In Dreja v State of Western Australia [2012] WASCA 151 the WA Supreme Court considered an appeal against a conviction and fine for an offence of breaching a suspended sentence, where the suspended sentence had subsequently been ""set aside"" on appeal, and a different sentence imposed. Whilst the terminology is different the court found that ""in the absence of any indication that it was intended to be an order setting the sentence aside ab initio, the order takes effect to nullify the sentence only from the date of the setting aside order"": at [15]. However, a distinction was drawn between such cases and cases where a conviction was set aside, where the setting aside would take effect ab initio (at [17] and [18]).

22Lynch v Hargrave [1971] VR 99 was followed in Dreja, on the basis that, in that case, only the sentence had been set aside (on appeal) not the conviction, after the later offences. Lynch v Hargrave is the only higher court decision that appears factually similar to this matter, and the court there decided that the setting aside of the defendant's conviction in his absence had the effect of annulling the conviction ab initio. Commissioner for Railways v Cavanough (1935) 53 CLR 220 was discussed as authority leading to that conclusion. However the legislation governing the setting aside of a conviction in the absence of a defendant in Victoria at the time provided only for the court to ""set aside"" the conviction or order, without more. In addition, the decision in Lynch v Hargrave appears inconsistent with the reasoning of the Court of Appeal in Porret, and it would appear does not now represent the law at least in NSW.

23In another driver licensing appeal, Refshauge J in the ACT Supreme Court followed Lynch v Hargrave in determining that where a conviction and disqualification had been ""set aside"", a subsequent driving while disqualified offence committed during the period before the setting aside was not committed because ""there was no disqualification that he had breached by his driving"": Licciardello v McPherson [2012] ACTSC 31 at [19]. That case was one where the original disqualification was infected with a fundamental error, being that on the facts as alleged the appellant was not at law guilty of the offence for which the disqualification had been imposed. It may be that this conviction could therefore be characterised as having involved a jurisdictional error such that the appellant was entitled as of right to have it set aside, and it could properly be described as a nullity.

24A successful application under section 4 of the Appeal Act results in the annulment of either the conviction or sentence or both. In the absence of statutory provision, the case law would in my view inevitably lead to the conclusion that the annulment of a conviction has effect ab initio, whereas the annulment of the sentence only does not (including cases where a conviction is set aside for the purpose of making a non-conviction order even though the offence has been proved).

25The issue therefore is whether section 10 of the Appeal Act by its terms leads to a different conclusion.

26A statute that affects the liberty of the subject is to be construed strictly: Smith v Corrective Services Commissioner (1980) 33 ALR 25. Generally a provision which is obscure or ambiguous ought be construed so as to enhance the liberty of the subject. A provision that has a potentially penal consequence should point clearly and unmistakably to that conclusion. Section 10 of the Appeal Act in its terms applies the same consequence to annulment of both conviction and sentence, which of itself is in clear contrast with the decisions discussed above.

27In this case there is no issue that the finding the offence proved in the defendant's absence was within jurisdiction and that on the facts alleged Mr Le Platrier was in fact guilty of it - he ultimately pleaded guilty after the annulment had been granted.

28In such a circumstance the argument that the annulment has the effect of quashing the disqualification from the date on which it was imposed has less force than in a case where the offence cannot in fact be made out. However, the effect of section 10 of the Appeal Act cannot be different if a conviction is set aside and the accused subsequently pleads guilty or is found guilty. Such an interpretation would lead to potentially absurd situations in which the effect of the granting of a section 4 application may be unknown for months while the original offence is prosecuted. That cannot be the law, although it may be that there are circumstances where an annulment would be accepted as taking effect ab initio because at the time it is made it is accepted that the original finding that the offence was proved was wrong in law, or without jurisdiction (as in Licciardello, supra). That is not a question necessary to resolve in this matter, although a Local Court does not appear to have jurisdiction to make such an order unless it is granted by the Appeal Act.

29In Police v Khoury Magistrate Reiss said (at p 12):
There is nothing in the specific wording of section 10 of the Act that specifically states or is to the effect that an annulment of a disqualification applies ab initio. On a plain reading of the words of the section the expression ""ceases to have effect"" clearly implies a current and prospective effect.
On a plain reading of the words of the section ""enforcement action"" is a reference to action taken in order to compel compliance or implement the sentence, e.g. action to enforce a fine. ... It may stretch to a resultant cancellation by the RTA but I do not see this expression as extending to action in respect to the Commissioner of a subsequent offence. A charge of driving while disqualified is an action for a new alleged offence and is not an action to compel compliance with the original disqualification.

30Having considered the words of the section together with the distinctions to be drawn between legislative provisions considered in other authorities, I agree with his Honour's interpretation of the provision. His Honour refers to the legislative predecessor of section 10, section 100T of the Justices Act 1902, which made abundantly clear that the effect of annulment was prospective only and used the words ""ceases to have any force and effect from the making of the order of annulment"". The omission of the words ""from the making of the order of annulment"" from section 10 of the provision which replaced section 100T on one interpretation could be seen as showing a legislative intention to vary the effect of the provision. However, no such intention is discernible from the Explanatory Notes or Second Reading speech in respect of the legislation and in my view the change is not such as to lead inevitably, or even reasonably, to that conclusion. 

31Even giving the section the most beneficial interpretation available I do not consider the words ""ceases to have effect"" in section 10 mean other than that the annulment is prospective rather than retrospective. While the decision in Porret is not directly on point, the reasoning of the court in that matter is supportive of such a conclusion. Of course, a defence of ""honest and reasonable mistake of fact"" may be available in a circumstance where a driver did not know their licence had been disqualified (R v Vlahos [1975] 2 NSWLR 580; DPP v Kailahi [2008] NSWSC 752).

32In the circumstances of this matter I find that the annulment of the conviction of Mr Le Platrier for driving while disqualified took effect from the date of the annulment, that is, from 18 September 2013. Accordingly, on 6 September 2013 he was in fact disqualified. I find the offence proved, noting that Mr Le Platrier was prepared to plead guilty to it in the event I found as I have.

2705391,R v Jasper [2014] NSWDC 116,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1Today I have to sentence Darin Jasper who, when he was still only 15 and a half years old, seriously stabbed another boy at his school. It is important for a judge to set out what happened in a crime so that the judge and those listening know exactly how serious an offence was that the judge is imposing the sentence for. I will start with that. Then I will look at the considerations which are personal to the offender and the arguments for the legal representatives. Finally I will impose the sentence. 

2The crime in this case that Darin Jasper has pleaded guilty to is called wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The offence is so serious that Parliament has fixed a maximum of 25 years imprisonment to it. Although this does not apply in this case, Parliament has also fixed a standard non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment to the offence. This shows how serious the crime is that Darin Jasper committed.

3It happened on 5 February 2013 at Darin's school. He had an argument with another boy over the supply of cannabis. They decided that there would be a fight. There was a fight between Darin Jasper and his victim. During the fight Darin Jasper produced a knife and he stabbed the victim a number of times. They were pulled away from each other but despite this Darin Jasper got back to his victim and kicked him in his head and swung at him again with the knife, stabbing him in the buttocks. The agreement between the Prosecution and the defence as to what happened, and contained in exhibit A, goes on to say that Darin Jasper then ""folded the knife away, put the knife up his sleeve, and walked off."" Darin Jasper had been seen earlier in the day with the knife. 

4His victim had to be taken by ambulance to hospital. There were six stab wounds. They were to the victim's abdomen, flank and right buttocks. He had to have surgery, his gall bladder was removed. The stab wound to the abdomen had also penetrated his victim's liver and bile duct. The stab wound to the liver is described in the agreed facts as ""imminently life-threatening"". The victim had to stay in hospital for 10 days. It is said that he will ""suffer permanent scarring due to the stab wounds and the procedures undertaken to preserve his life. There is a potential risk of the common bile duct developing a stricture secondary to the trauma sustained.""

5Darin was arrested and interviewed by the police. He said that he had voices in his head and was on medication but on that day he agreed that the argument was over cannabis. He denied using the knife. 

6There is a report from the doctor, a doctor at the hospital about the victim. She confirmed that the injuries were classified in a way that indicated that ""his condition was considered life threatening and he was in need of immediate care and resuscitation."" As she said, a stab wound to the liver has a potential to cause major blood loss in a very short period of time and was imminently life threatening. She also confirmed that the victim will suffer ""permanent and long lasting sequelae"" including permanent scarring and the potential risk to the bile duct which I referred to. 

7Included in exhibit A are the very graphic photographs of the wounds to Darin Jasper's victim. Included also is a victim impact statement from the victim's mother. She pointed out that he grew up in a very caring and loving indigenous family and that what Darin Jasper did ""destroyed"" her and her son's world. She said that her son has not left the house on his own and cannot finish school despite the fact that he was in year 11. He is afraid of going out. She described her son as ""trapped in our house"" and he ""has nightmares and wakes up in panic. He can't do what normal kids do."" She concludes by saying that ""[Darin Jasper] has ruined [her son's] life, his mental health, his ability to trust, his education, his ability to go out in public. Every part of his life has been affected."" This shows just how serious the crime was that Darin Jasper committed.

8Turning to considerations which are personal to Darin Jasper, he had no criminal convictions up until this offence. There is a detailed and very helpful Juvenile Justice report dated 9 December 2013 from two managers of Juvenile Justice. Two things are immediately apparent from that report and the facts of this case. One is obvious, Darin Jasper was 15 when he committed this offence and is still well under 18. The second is that he has a history of serious psychiatric illness. The report gives attention to that history as well as his family background. It noted Darin Jasper's account that he ""was experiencing auditory command hallucinations to harm the victim at the time of the offence."" It refers to a particular incident which Darin Jasper claimed occurred when he was younger and which prompted him returning to cannabis use. 

9Darin Jasper attended three schools - high schools - for year 7 before settling at the particular high school where this offence occurred. He had extremely high levels of anxiety and school refusal, but settled in and was generally noted ""as a cooperative and respectful student."" The report goes on to say that a ""significant change in his attendance and behaviour were noted after he commenced using Cannabis and to a lesser extent alcohol. His attendance declined markedly, with many partial day attendances."" 

10Darin Jasper is financially supported by his father, who is in court today and who still supports him. When he is released from custody he is likely to live with his father. His brother and sister are also in court today.

11Darin Jasper has been in one form or other of compulsory confinement since his arrest. He is presently in a psychiatric ward of a Forensic Hospital as a non-voluntary patient. His first contact with Mental Health Services was in 2010. He had later admissions to an adolescent mental unit for thoughts relating to suicide as well as auditory hallucinations. He had three separate admissions in 2012. He says that he first had the hallucinations when he was 12 years old. After the earlier particular incident (which I will refer to just in those terms) he had some psychological treatment. He reported commencing cannabis at the age of 11, closely related to that incident. He has experimented as well with ice, ecstasy and alcohol. He was admitted to a residential program in 2012, but discharged himself on 23 October 2012 only a few months before he committed this very serious offence. He is regularly reviewed by the Mental Health Review Tribunal and will be reviewed again a couple of months time. Cannabis is said to be his drug of choice. He is not suitable for a Community Service Order and Juvenile Justice have assessed him as suitable for supervision by them. 

HIS HONOUR: I am just going to pause here. When I finish I am going to invite you both just to check the relevant children's legislation. One thing that occurs to me, which I think is referred to in the prosecution written submissions, is whether I convict him or not? So we will turn to that when I have finished. I return now to my remarks on sentence.

12There are two very helpful psychiatric reports, one from a Dr M on 16 December 2013 and the other from a Dr K on 10 March 2014. Both are psychiatrists who have treated Darin Jasper. Darin Jasper has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, cannabis use disorder (which is in remission in a controlled environment) amphetamine use disorder (again in remission) post-traumatic stress disorder and social anxiety disorder. He is a described as a ""16 year old male of Aboriginal heritage"". He has been in a psychiatric ward of a forensic hospital since 4 April 2014 under the care of Dr K, who is a forensic psychiatrist. 

13There is a history in Dr M's report of his various psychiatric interventions, which I have referred to. It noted that after he self-discharged from the rehabilitation centre he ""remained drug free for a period following this period of rehabilitation"". It noted that he had been prescribed an anti-psychotic medication of 300mg daily, but had reduced it to 100mg by himself. Darin Jasper acknowledged as much in his interview with the police. Dr M said that it is ""possible that [his] psychotic symptoms... at the material time of the offence may have contributed to his heightened perception of fear and of being mortally wounded by the victim."" Dr M noted that he has received ""four prior therapeutic periods of antipsychotic medications. Each medication did not affect a satisfactory resolution of symptoms, particularly his auditory hallucinations."" She was of the opinion that Darin Jasper's schizophrenia ""is considered to be treatment resistant"". Hence he was recently commenced on Clozapine, which she describes as ""an antipsychotic mediation which is reserved for patients that do not respond to at least two different antipsychotic medications at a therapeutic dose"". He still had at December 2013 ""auditory hallucinations that command him harm himself and others."" He is also taking Lithium. Dr M had a guarded prognosis at December 2013, but thought that his prognosis would be ""potentially favourable if he were to respond well to clozapine"". She thought that he needed to remain at the Adolescent Unit in the forensic hospital ""for a minimum of six months whilst his clozapine dose is titrated to an adequate therapeutic dose."" She expressed the ""medical opinion he has presented as remorseful"". She thought there were protective factors ""for reduction in future violence risk"". They included his enthusiasm for prosocial activities and a strong attachment to his father and a commitment to education. Dr M said that continued engagement with treatment of his mental illness and related factors are ""important for his risk management."" She added that were he to ""relapse into substance use or be non-compliant with the psychiatric treatment for his Schizophrenia, his risk prognosis would worsen.""

14Dr K, in his much more recent report, described the Clozapine as having ""good therapeutic effect"". His ""voices have reduced in frequency and intensity."" Dr K thought that his ""prognosis for his mental illness is significantly more favourable given the good clinical response to Clozapine, due to the reduction in his psychotic symptoms since Clozapine."" He has been at a therapeutic level in that dosage in that medication for several weeks. He thought that there is a ""reduction in his likelihood of re-offending when compared to his clinical state at the time of the report by Dr [M]"". 

15I have also read exhibit 1, which is a letter from Darin Jasper to his victim apologising for what he has done and a letter from Darin Jasper's grandmother, who also thought that her grandson ""genuinely regrets what happened"" and is ""truly remorseful."" She pointed out that it was out of character for her grandson to commit such an offence.

16I have been significantly assisted by written submissions prepared by the prosecution representative, Ms K Stanley, and Mr P Winch of counsel for Darin Jasper. 

17Mr Winch emphasises his client's age and psychiatric condition. He emphasises the significance of the psychiatric condition to sentencing, being relevant to a reduction in the moral culpability, because of its effect at the time of the time offending. I accept that submission. It is also relevant to Darin Jasper being an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. I accept that submission. I also accept that custody will be more onerous, although I think in this case that factor is less significant, because his custody is in a hospital which is treating his mental health problem. 

18Both representatives drew my attention to the provisions of s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW) and I have re-read those provisions and I take them into account. 

19Mr Winch said that I should pause and pause again before giving significant weight to a risk of future dangerousness, given his client's young age, and also submitted that there are special circumstances for a very wide differential between the non-parole period and the parole period. He emphasised the difference in outlook between the two medical reports and his client's improvement with treatment and urged me to conclude that the treatment is likely to improve his client's position. 

20Ms Stanley appropriately emphasised the importance of protection for the community. This was, she correctly said, a very serious offence and a member of the community was so seriously injured that his life was put at risk and he will suffer the possible future effects which I have described. She emphasised that Darin Jasper had had psychiatric intervention before but still offended and the issue in the offence were illegal drugs which are related to his psychiatric condition. I have also been assisted by MFI 1, which contains some sentencing statistics but, more significantly, some examples of sentences for this kind of offence committed by persons who are of a young age.

HIS HONOUR: Just before I sentence I just wanted to ask you both - I am looking at the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, and I think the first thing is I deal with him at law. I think, Ms Stanley, your submission is that I have to do that. Is that right? 
STANLEY: Yes, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: And s 17. I will deal - that's right I think, Mr Winch?
WINCH: Yes, that's so, your Honour.

21I will deal with Darin Jasper according to law, because of s 17 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987.

22This offence is so serious that if Darin Jasper were an adult without a psychiatric condition I would regard an appropriate sentence being in the range of 15 or 16 years imprisonment. That is because it carries a maximum of 25 years imprisonment. However in this case the two factors emphasised by Mr Winch and accepted by Ms Stanley as relevant, namely, his mental health and youth, will have a significant impact upon that head sentence. In particular his mental health condition I regard as being related, as I said, to his offence. It reduces his moral culpability and reduces the significance of general deterrence. General deterrence is not rendered completely irrelevant, as Ms Stanley points out, but she also fairly draws my attention to the authorities relating to sentencing young offenders, which remind me that general deterrence should be regarded as of less importance than rehabilitation and the greater interest of the public is that the young person should become a good citizen. But I must not ignore considerations of general deterrence.

23Because of his youth and the psychiatric factors I would regard an appropriate sentence as one of 9 years imprisonment. However, Darin Jasper has pleaded guilty. He pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. I will therefore discount that sentence 25% so that the sentence would be reduced to 6 years and 9 months. 

24I therefore regard an appropriate sentence in this case for Darin Jasper being one of 6 years and 9 months. 

25I must fix a non-parole period for that sentence. I have referred to the competing submissions of Mr Winch and Ms Stanley. Mr Winch emphasises the need for his client to be supervised and supported in the community. Ms Stanley emphasises the need for the protection of the public. 

26This is a case where I am going to fix an extraordinarily short non parole period which will expire a day before Darin Jasper's 18th birthday. It will be about a third of the full sentence. In doing that I have in mind the need for him to spend a significant time in custody for the offence that he committed, but I also bear in mind Mr Winch's submission about the need for his being supported in the community. I also give weight to Ms Stanley's point about the protection of the community.

27This is a case where a young man's proved psychiatric disability has been obviously significantly aggravated by him taking illegal drugs. Whilst he is in a protected and confined environment his condition is controlled and being successfully treated. I think the more important course for the protection of the community is to allow his treatment to continue for sometime, but then to allow him an extended period within the community for him to be supported and treated within the community and, most importantly, monitored so that any breach involving illegal drugs can be dealt with straightaway and he would be returned into custody and out of the community. In other words he should be monitored closely so that as soon as any risk is identified of him re offending then he should be immediately re incarcerated, because of the risks to which Ms Stanley refers. Hopefully this will not happen. Hopefully he will be stabilised by his treatment in custody and on release treated and monitored and grow into a healthy young adult.

HIS HONOUR: Do I convict him or not?
WINCH: Section 14, as I read it, your Honour, leaves your Honour with a discretion. If he was under 16 at this point your Honour would not be entitled to or not have the power to convict him. The section I think says, in mandatory terms, your Honour would not do that, but my understanding of the rest of it that it's a matter for your Honour's discretion whether he is now convicted. He can be, but as I read it he doesn't have to be.
HIS HONOUR: So I could, but - all right, what's your submission?
WINCH: My submission is that in light of the preamble to that section your Honour would not, which is not the preamble, the first words which speak about the interests in--
STANLEY: Non stigmatising.
WINCH: --non stigmatising and so on, but it is a very serious offence.
STANLEY: I'd say it's an extremely serious offence, your Honour, and it's one that unfortunately should remain with the young person for the rest of his life, it's extremely serious and it's something that should remain on his record, in my submission.

28I think given the fact that he was 16 although just, but that he was clearly suffering from a significant psychiatric condition at the time lead me to conclude that I will not record or find a conviction against him for this offence. 

HIS HONOUR: I am going to sentence you Darin Jasper. Darin Jasper, if you would stand up.

29I fix a non-parole period to commence on 5 February 2013 when you were arrested. Remember that? It will conclude on 13 July 2015 the day before your 18th birthday. The balance of your sentence will commence on your 18th birthday 14 July 2015 and will expire on 4 November 2019. So you have been sentenced to 6 years and 9 months for this crime that you committed - 6 years and 9 months. The non-parole period that you must stay in custody - either at the hospital where you are now or in a Juvenile Detention Centre - is about 2 years and 5 months from 5 February 2013 to just before you are 18 on 13 July 2015. 

HIS HONOUR: Do you understand that?
OFFENDER: Yes.
HIS HONOUR: You do. All right have a seat. Is there anything else, Ms Stanley or Mr Winch, that I need to do?
STANLEY: No, your Honour.
WINCH: No, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Darin Jasper, you have heard what I have said. You have got a pretty serious sentence 6 years and 9 months. You have got a pretty serious non-parole period, you have got to remain in custody until the day before you turn an adult. You have got that sentence because of what you did to that boy, a very serious crime, but you have been treated and well looked after in the hospital and they are acting in your best interests. When you are released the day before your 18th birthday you will be on parole. In fact you will not be released unless the Parole Authority says so. Do you understand that? I do not direct your release it's the Parole Authority who decides that, so they will look at how you are going and then make up their mind. Then you will be on parole for some years until 2019 and they will keep an eye on you and make sure that you are complying with your medication and behaving yourself and staying away from drugs, because the problem was caused by your illegal drugs, plus your own personal factors, that got you into the big trouble.

You have heard the prosecutor say how she is very concerned about you being in the community. She is right, because you did a very dangerous thing, nearly killed this boy, you could have been in this Court on a murder charge, but you are not. She is right about that. So that when you get out they will keep an eye on you and make sure that you are doing what you should be doing with the doctors and obeying all the suggestions of Probation and Parole to stay out of trouble so that you do not put the community at risk. 

You are doing very well I should add, and if you keep going the way that you are going then you will be released. You will be released by the sounds of it you are planning to live with your dad again, is that right? And you will go on to hopefully finish your education. You are interested in that?

OFFENDER: Yes.
HIS HONOUR: Then you will want to finish your schooling and get yourself a job and hopefully have just a normal stable life, and I imagine that will happen so good luck.

		25 July 2014",2014-03-13 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705392,R v Greenwood [2014] NSWDC 50,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: In June last year, Michael Francis Greenwood was convicted of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in Waverley Local Court. He appealed against that conviction. He came before me on 1 October 2012. I dismissed his appeal and confirmed his conviction. I have now been asked to state a case for the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

2It is important to note that questions that I can state are limited to those of law. The applicant has submitted what he says are three questions of law. The respondent says that they are not questions of law at all but are merely questions of fact. The questions of law which I am now asked to submit are as follows: One, for the subject offence being an offence contrary to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, can these facts support a finding beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Greenwood was not acting in self defence at the time of the assault in accordance with s 418 of the Crimes Act 1900?; Two, can these facts support a finding that Mr Greenwood was not acting in self defence in accordance with ss 418(1), (2), (2a) and (2b) of the Crimes Act 1900?; Three, on the findings of fact, was the conduct of Mr Greenwood capable of constituting self defence for the purposes of s 418(1), (2), (2a) and (2b) of the Crimes Act 1900?

3It is important to note that it is not suggested that I have made any misstatement of the law in my judgment. Instead, the applicant says that it is only by looking at the facts that I have found that the error can be identified, that is that I have made a latent error. The suggestion is, I gather, that the facts are such that it would only be an unreasonable outcome if, given those facts, the judicial officer did not find that the prosecution had failed to negate self defence beyond reasonable doubt.

4The stated case procedure is of some, by now, antiquity. It has undergone changes from time to time. For example, it used to be that there was an unseemly rush to interrupt a judge in delivering judgment so that the requested stated case could be made before final orders were pronounced. Fortunately the Criminal Appeal Act has now been amended so that is no longer necessary.

5In this case, an application was made to me in chambers. I have ensured that the applicant and the respondent corresponded in an effort to identify common ground as to the case to be stated. When it became apparent that there was a fundamental dispute between the parties as to whether what I had been asked to state is properly a question of law, I listed the matter for hearing in open Court for determination of that issue. It seems to me best that I resolve these matters after hearing oral argument rather than simply deciding such matters in chambers. It is consistent with the procedure I adopted in a case that later went to the Court of Criminal Appeal in which that Court held that I had made an error of law, Robinson v Woolworths Limited [2005] NSWCCA 426. I will return to that case in a little while.

6There is of course an obligation for me to state a case if I am satisfied that questions of law properly arise. A recent example of that obligation is to be found in Elias v DPP [2012] NSWCA 302. In some ways the easiest thing to do for a judge when an application for a stated case is presented to him or her is to simply state the case, but I am familiar enough with the authorities to know that there are many cases in which judges have been criticised for simply acceding too willingly to request that a case be stated. 

7One fundamental needs to be observed. No appeal lies from my decision on a mere question of fact. A stated case procedure is not intended to provide a means of challenging the ultimate determination made by the judge because there is no right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal from that determination. There is, for example, no right of appeal on the basis that my decision was unsafe, unsatisfactory or unreasonable. A question of law must first be stated. 

8What I was satisfied of was that the prosecution had negatived self defence beyond reasonable doubt in that it had proved there was no reasonable possibility that Mr Greenwood believed that his conduct was necessary to defend himself and also proved that his conduct was not a reasonable response to the circumstances as he saw them.

9What I did in making those findings was engage in a fact finding exercise. To adopt the words of Cassell v DPP [2000] NSWCA 226, I was satisfied that self defence was negated beyond reasonable doubt. The questions proposed by Mr Miralis for the applicant go not to a question of law but to a question of fact which is not open to be raised under s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act. 

10The written submissions of the respondent refer to other cases which have stated the principles which I have outlined above. It is not necessary for me to repeat the contents of those written submissions beyond noting that they set out a number of authorities which emphasise that appeals against findings of fact are not encompassed by the stated case procedure.

11In response to those authorities, Mr Miralis refers to two particular cases, Robinson v Woolworths which I have mentioned earlier and Hammond v R [2013] NSWCCA 93. Robinson v Woolworths is illustrative of the point that I have been making. There was no dispute about the facts in that case. There was no dispute that at the encouragement of the prosecutor, two children had purchased cigarettes in circumstances where it was an apparent breach of the law to sell them. The question of law which arose was whether that conduct was capable of constituting improper conduct. What is improper conduct was to be identified under s 138 of the Evidence Act so it can be immediately seen that what was stated in that case was a question of law. That is quite different to the present case where I resolved facts which necessarily meant that self defence had been negated.

12In the other case, Hammond v R a similar issue arose. The issue in that case was not what had been done in terms of the physical actions but whether a seat in a police station had been damaged. The question as to what amounted to damage for the purposes of s 195(1A) of the Crimes Act was a question of law.

13It is always somewhat uncomfortable to be placed in the position of having to determine whether an appeal can be brought against a decision that I have made but my obligation is clear. For the reasons above, I decline to state a case under s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act.

2705393,McKellar v R [2014] NSWCCA 35,"Judgment

1THE COURT: On Monday, 10 March 2014, a trial commenced in the Common Law Division in which there were four accused, one of whom was the applicant, Ethan Wayne McKellar. Before the jury was empanelled, the applicant sought a separate trial. That application was heard and determined by the trial judge, RA Hulme J. 

2The application was made by notice of motion filed on 7 March 2014. (Why the application had not been made at an earlier stage is not known, but the trial judge had received an explanation which he accepted.) The motion was supported by an affidavit filed by the applicant's solicitor, Mr Moustafa Kheir. The application was dealt with on the morning of 10 March (commencing at Tcpt, p 14(10)). The application was dismissed later that morning: Tcpt, p 23(1). The trial judge delivered reasons the following day (Tuesday, 11 March) and the jury was empanelled, the trial then proceeding, on Wednesday, 12 March 2014.

3The present application for leave to appeal from the refusal of a separate trial was brought to this Court under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). There is no dispute that an interlocutory appeal is available under that provision against a decision refusing to order a separate trial: DAO v The Queen [2011] NSWCCA 63; 81 NSWLR 568: [2] (Spigelman CJ); [77] (Allsop P); [125] (Simpson J). Nevertheless, the applicant requires leave: s 5F(3)(a). There is also no doubt that the decision of the trial judge was one involving a matter of discretion, at an interlocutory stage; it was accepted that it invited the principles of restraint applicable to appellate intervention in such matters, as identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499.

4The relevant principles to be applied to the question of separating trials were not in dispute. The circumstance that persons jointly charged with the commission of an offence may each seek to blame the other, to some degree, is by no means novel. It gives rise to conflicting considerations, the proper balancing of which is to be determined on a case by case basis. In Webb v The Queen; Hay v The Queen [1994] HCA 30; 181 CLR 41 (perhaps better known as a case involving apprehended bias arising from the conduct of a juror in presenting a bunch of flowers to the deceased's fiancé to be given to the deceased's mother) was such a case. Toohey J (with whom Mason CJ and McHugh J agreed), adopted principles set out by King CJ in the South Australian Court of Criminal Appeal in the same matter, R v Webb and Hay (1992) 59 SASR 563 at 585. King CJ had noted the ""strong reasons of principle and policy by which persons charged with committing an offence jointly ought to be tried together. That is particularly so where each seeks to cast the blame on the other."" However, as Toohey J noted at 89:

""There are of course dangers for an accused in a joint trial by reason of the admission of evidence which would not be admitted at the trial of one accused. That risk must be obviated by express and careful directions to the jury as to the use they may make of the evidence so far as it concerns each accused.""

5Sometimes the question will arise retrospectively, following a conviction, in which case for an offender to succeed it will be necessary for the appellate court to be satisfied that there was some element of unfairness which caused the trial to miscarry. In other cases, including the present case, the issue arises prior to trial, when one accused seeks a separate trial. In the latter case, the judge will be required to determine, usually on the basis of quite limited evidence, the likelihood that a joint trial can proceed without necessary unfairness or, on the contrary, whether it will run an unacceptable risk of prejudice to the applicant.

6The trial judge set out the principles by reference to an extensive extract from the judgment of Sheller JA (James J and Smart AJ agreeing) in Symss v The Queen [2003] NSWCCA 77 at [68]-[76]. The final paragraph - [76] - was in the following terms:

""For present purposes I regard it as sufficient to emphasise the factors identified by King CJ in Collie and Webb and Hay and adopted by Toohey J in Webb and Hay in the High Court. There are important reasons of principle and policy why persons charged with committing an offence jointly ought to be tried together, particularly where each seeks to cast the blame on the other. The dangers from the admission of evidence which would not have been admitted if the appellant had stood trial alone can be obviated by express and careful directions as were given in this trial.""

7The trial judge continued at [18]:

""I accept that there is an inherent risk of unfair prejudice if the jury were to take into account in their determination of the case concerning Ethan McKellar what the accused Douglas and Elwood told the police. But I consider that this is a risk that can be avoided by appropriate directions.""

(a) first alleged error
8The first alleged mistake arose from a statement by the trial judge as to how the prosecution intended to deal with statements made by the co-accused Dennis and Elwood. The surrounding circumstances, as set out in the statements of the two co-accused, was that the applicant, his brother (Bevan McKellar) and Elwood and Dennis had gone to the home of the victims together. At the end of their respective interviews, each identified the applicant as the person who had stabbed the deceased. That evidence was inadmissible against the applicant. 

9The trial judge summed up his understanding of the prosecution case in the following terms at [8]:

""The Crown case, in a nutshell, is that the four accused were parties to a joint criminal enterprise to attend the home of John Gjedsted, a person known to be a small-time supplier of cannabis, in order to rob him. As I understand it, the Crown will contend that the accused must have anticipated that they would be met with some resistance. After they had arrived, one of them knocked on the door and Mr Gjedsted opened it. He was immediately attacked. Jacob Gjedsted, his son, emerged from his bedroom and saw what was occurring. Events moved out to the front of the home. They involved both father and son being assaulted and stabbed, fatally so in the case of John Gjedsted.""

10The prosecution case also involved evidence suggesting that the applicant's brother, Bevan McKellar, stabbed the deceased. However, as the trial judge further noted, the prosecution case ""appears to be one of a joint assault by four men upon the deceased (and his son) in circumstances where the Crown will argue that they are each criminally liable in respect of the death of the deceased (and the wounding of his son). In those circumstances, it will be unnecessary for the Crown to establish beyond reasonable doubt who it was who was responsible for the stabbings"": at [13]. The trial judge then turned to the question of prejudice based upon the anticipated evidence before the jury from the two co-accused identifying the applicant as the person who stabbed the deceased.

11The trial judge sought to contrast the situation before him with that discussed in R v Pham [2004] NSWCCA 190, an appeal following conviction for an execution-style murder, the appellant having been tried with two co-offenders, one of whom was his brother. The brother had made a statement to the police which implicated the appellant. The brother's confession was before the jury as part of the evidence against the brother, but was not admissible against the appellant. The person who carried out the shooting (one Tran) gave evidence against the appellant, as did another person (Lam) who was present in the vehicle which carried the victim to the place of execution, but was not present when he was shot. The prosecution case relied heavily upon the evidence of Tran and Lam, as against the appellant. However the confession by the appellant's brother did much to support the evidence of Tran and Lam which, particularly in the case of Tran, might have been rejected as unreliable. The jury was entitled to rely on the evidence of Tran and Lam in assessing the credibility of the brother's confession, and also as corroborating aspects of the case against the brother: at [33]. On the other hand, in considering the case against the appellant, the jury was directed to ignore, not only what his brother had said with respect to his role, but also the extent to which the brother's evidence might support the credibility of Tran and Lam. This Court held that, despite emphatic and precise directions as to how to approach the exercise, ""it would have been virtually impossible, as a matter of common sense, for the jury to disregard [the brother's] interview in dealing with the case against the appellant"": at [34]. 

12The trial judge distinguished Pham, noting that in the case before him, ""the Crown will be inviting the jury to reject to the relevant aspect of the claims by Messrs Dennis and Elwood as self-serving and unreliable"": at [20]. 

13The applicant contended that this overstated the position taken by the prosecution with respect to the statements of Dennis and Elwood. In discussing the role which the statements of Dennis and Elwood would play in the prosecution case, the prosecutor, noting various inconsistencies in their accounts had explained, at Tcpt, 10/03/14, p 19(22):

""A reasonable inquiry might be if the Crown is not going to rely on some sort of inculpatory material, why leave them in the interviews? The answer to that question is simply because the representatives for Mr Elwood and Mr Dennis would expect those observations left as simply providing some explanation for why they behaved in a way, feared in a way, once they saw things happen.

So, that is certainly why the prospect of deleting them entirely hasn't been taken any further, as far as the Crown is concerned.

I do emphasise that the Crown is not relying on these witnesses clearly because it is inadmissible. Also, it is not altogether clear that Ethan McKellar was the stabber, in any case, as I have already explained.
...

So, for all those reasons, one can see that the Crown case is certainly not reliant on the help of these two with their untested allegations of Ethan McKellar being responsible.

So, for those reasons, and perhaps especially more so because your Honour can see that this is precisely the sort of joint enterprise where it is really necessary for the jury to hear all of the versions together, where anything is certainly far from being clear-cut in order to best make sense of what happened in this relatively complicated situation.""

14Relying upon these statements, and particularly the penultimate paragraph that the prosecution ""is certainly not reliant on"" the statements of Dennis and Elwood, the applicant submitted that there was no basis for the trial judge's conclusion that the prosecution would be inviting the jury ""to reject"" the allegations implicating the applicant as the person who stabbed the deceased.

15This criticism must be accepted. At no point did the prosecution indicate it would invite rejection of those statements; rather, it eschewed reliance upon them. It explained the inclusion of the statements, implicitly indicating that it would not object to their exclusion if others, particularly counsel for the co-accused Dennis and Elwood, agreed. Thus, the trial judge overstated the position taken by the prosecution.

16The question is whether that overstatement is significant in the context of the application. Two points may be made in that regard. First, the purpose of the comment was to distinguish the case from the factual circumstances of Pham. There could be no criticism of the conclusion: the circumstances were indeed materially different. The overstatement of the difference did not derogate from the correctness of the conclusion.

17Secondly, the trial judge made the comparison because, as he noted at [19], he had been referred to Pham as supporting the application for a separate trial. The comparison with other factual circumstances is usually of limited assistance, as it was in this instance. The overstatement of the prosecution's position, taken in isolation, did not undermine the reasoning to any significant degree.

(b) second alleged error
18The applicant then sought to make good a similar complaint with respect to the prosecution's position in relation to evidence to be given by Mr Jacob Gjedsted, the son of the deceased, who was also assaulted and stabbed in the attack, but survived. At [10], the trial judge stated:

""Police spoke to Jacob Gjedsted on a number of occasions. I was provided with his statements and transcripts of interviews.... In the last of those documents he suggested that it was Ethan McKellar who did the stabbing. However, there is considerable inconsistency and doubt about this in his other accounts. It is little wonder that the Crown does not intend to submit to the jury that they should accept Mr Gjedsted's final assertion on the subject as being irrefutably correct.""

19After noting the statements implicating the appellant in the claims of Messrs Dennis and Elwood, the trial judge returned to consider Mr Gjedsted's evidence in that context. He said at [21]:

""... I have considered whether there is a risk that the jury may impermissibly reason that the claims of the two co-accused to the police that Ethan McKellar was the stabber may bolster evidence that Jacob Gjedsted may give to that effect. Upon reflection I do not believe that this raises a concern of any real significance; particularly with the Crown not advocating that the jury would accept Mr Gjedsted's claim as being irrefutably correct and arguing against the reliability of the co-accused's versions. Again, directions to the jury should suffice to overcome any concern that may be perceived after all of the evidence is in.""

20The allegation of factual error in these passages was somewhat obscure. The trial judge had two applications before him: in addition to the application for a separate trial, he was asked to allow the cross-examination of Mr Jacob Gjedsted on a voir dire, before the jury was empanelled, in accordance with the procedure contemplated in R v Basha (1989) 39 A Crim R 337 at 341-342, in circumstances where either there had been no committal hearing or the impugned witness had not been called at the committal. (In the present case, there had been a committal hearing and Mr Gjedsted had been called, though not cross-examined.) That application was rejected.

21In the course of considering that application, the trial judge asked the prosecutor how he was going to open to the jury with respect to Mr Gjedsted's evidence concerning the role played by the applicant. The prosecutor indicated that he intended in ""fairly neutral"" terms to outline the various versions of events given by Mr Gjedsted: Tcpt, p 10(35)-(48). The trial judge then expressly asked whether it was the prosecution case that the applicant was the person who stabbed the deceased. The response was as follows (Tcpt, p 11(4)):

""CROWN PROSECUTOR: The Crown case is that it is likely that Ethan McKellar was the stabber. Ethan McKellar and the remaining three, I will explain to the jury, were involved in a joint criminal enterprise which had a number of complexions, but, in effect, one of them was the stabber. On the evidence, it was most likely Ethan, but there is also some suggestion that it might have been Bevan who was the stabber ....

HIS HONOUR: So, the Crown is not dependent upon affirmatively establishing the identity of the stabber?

CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, no. ...""

22To describe the prosecution case, in negative terms, as not relying upon Mr Gjedsted's identification of the applicant as the stabber as ""irrefutably correct"" may have involved an element of rhetorical flourish, but it demonstrated no error. To the extent that it accepted (if only by implication) that more reliance might be placed on the evidence of Mr Gjedsted in this regard than appeared likely from the prosecutor's statements, it did not demonstrate a view which was adverse to the applicant's case for a separate trial.

(c) third alleged error
23Finally, factual error was sought to be identified in the proposition set out above from [10], that it was only in ""the last"" of the statements given by Mr Gjedsted to the police that he suggested that it was the applicant who did the stabbing. The submission stated that the prosecution ""may"" argue that Mr Gjedsted had told a uniformed police officer that it may have been the applicant, that is, on an earlier occasion than his last statement.

24The error was identified by reference to a passage in the transcript in which counsel for the applicant explained to the trial judge the content of Mr Gjedsted's last statement (of 25 May 2011). It is convenient to go to the original. The opening paragraphs of the statement set out the background in which the witness had come to know the applicant. He then explained how he had identified the applicant on the night of the attack, even though he had not seen his face, other than his nose. The statement continued:

""12. This person who looked like Ethan is the one who had the knife that night. This person is the one who stabbed me, and also the one who stabbed my Dad. I didn't see anyone else with a knife that night.

13. After the attack and we were back in the house, my friend ... said to me ""Do you know who did it?"" I said, ""I think Ethan MCKELLAR"".

14. Later a uniformed Police Officer said to me ""Did any of them look familiar"" or something like that. I said, ""Yeah, I thought I saw Ethan MCKELLAR"".

25The applicant relied upon the contents of paragraph 14 of the statement as indicating at least a possibility that Mr Gjedsted had identified Ethan McKellar as the person who stabbed him and his father in a conversation with a uniformed police officer on an earlier occasion. The statement contains no such express suggestion. Nor is it apparent why it should be read as stating more than it did. Accordingly, there was no mistake in the way the trial judge described the ""last"" statement as the first in which Mr Gjedsted had identified the applicant as the stabber. On the evidence available to him, that attribution was clearly correct.

Conclusion
26There being no suggestion that the trial judge misapprehended the relevant principles to apply in determining whether to order separate trials, the applicant's case depended upon either a material error of fact or some unexplained error which could be inferred from the refusal of the application. The one matter which might properly be described as a factual error was not shown to be material to the outcome. The refusal of the application in the circumstances available to the trial judge at the time the application was made was unremarkable. It certainly demonstrated no latent error.

27There is a further reason to reject the application. The assessment made at the beginning of the trial will be open to reassessment as the trial proceeds. Decisions will be made as to the admissibility of evidence, the content of final addresses and the way in which the judge leaves the case to the jury. If developments demonstrate that the initial assessment was based on an erroneous expectation of the trial process, the applicant will be able to raise a fresh objection. If convicted he may have a ground of appeal based on what will by then be known events, rather than predictions. This Court will not readily intervene to stop the trial going ahead, unless a clear case of unremediable prejudice is made out. No such threshold has been reached.

28For these reasons, the Court, while granting leave to appeal, dismissed the appeal.

		13 May 2014",2014-03-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705402,R v Farrell [2014] NSWCCA 30,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
2ADAMS J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
3R A HULME J:  This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against a ""sentence"" imposed upon the respondent on 21 November 2013 by his Honour Judge Hanley SC in the District Court at Campbelltown.
4The respondent stood for sentence in relation to a charge of Possess Prohibited Weapon contrary to s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW).  Such an offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 3 years.  A further four charges under the Firearms Act listed on a Form 1 document were before the court to be taken into account on sentence pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
5The judge adjourned the proceedings and granted the respondent bail, pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  His Honour directed the respondent to appear before the Campbelltown District Court on 14 April 2014 when it is anticipated that a sentence date will be fixed.
6The sole ground of appeal is that the ""sentence"" is manifestly inadequate.
7The definition of ""sentence"" in s 2 of the Criminal Appeal Act includes an order made by a court under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  It was confirmed in R v Trindall [2002] NSWCCA 364; 133 A Crim R 119 at [40] that such an order is amenable to an appeal under s 5D.
Facts
8A statement of facts was included in material tendered by the Crown before the primary judge without objection.  It was summarised in the written submissions by Ms Wilson SC who appeared for the Crown in this Court as follows:
""The respondent established and conducted a car audio business, 'Elite Car Audio', from commercial premises at ... Queen Street in Campbelltown.  In November 2012, the business was transferred to the management of the respondent's de facto wife, Amanda Leach.
On 31 January 2013 police executed search warrants upon the premises in Queen Street and upon the respondent's home address at ... Minto.  ...
A search of the showroom and retail section of the respondent's business revealed nothing of interest.  In a workshop located behind the publicly accessible retail section a 'show car' was located.  The car had been partially disassembled, and many of the vehicle's interior panels had been removed, and were stored stacked inside the car.
Inside the wall panel of the rear left passenger door of the car, police located a bundle of cloth which was secured with black electrical tape.  Underneath the first layer of cloth and tape was a second similar layer of cloth secured with tape.  Inside the inner wrapping police located a 9 millimetre Uzi machine pistol, loaded with a magazine which contained fifteen rounds of ammunition.  The serial number on the weapon had been defaced and could not be made out.  With the pistol was a box containing a further forty rounds of live 9mm ammunition.
The respondent was cautioned and asked about the gun.  He asserted that he had no knowledge of it.  He said that the car was not his but had been handed over to him when he acquired the business in October 2012.  He denied that any DNA that may be found on the weapon could be linked to him.
A closed circuit television surveillance system was operational at the Queen Street premises and investigating police seized footage recorded by it covering the period 23 January 2013 to 1 February 2013.
Footage from 23 January 2013 depicted the respondent in conversation with two men near the show car.  The respondent was filmed as he reached inside the car and retrieved a bundle consistent with that concealing the firearm.  He took the bundle to a work station accompanied by the men.  Some minutes later he was recorded manipulating the bundle, apparently wrapping the cloth.  The respondent then returned the cloth bundle to the panel of the rear left passenger door.
The following day the respondent was recorded by the surveillance cameras reaching inside the rear left hand passenger door of the show car, and retrieving an object consistent in appearance with the cloth wrapped firearm.  The respondent left the area filmed by the cameras without the object.  He returned a short time later with a male person and the two men were filmed as they rummaged through the show car.  The respondent left the area a short time later, carrying a bundle similar to that containing the firearm.
Later forensic testing of the Uzi revealed the respondent's fingerprints on the weapon, and DNA consistent with that of the respondent was recovered from a number of areas on the gun and on the box containing the ammunition.
When it was examined by ballistics experts the firearm was found to have been altered to operate in a fully automatic firing mode.  It was found to be a 9 millimetre calibre Luger manufactured select-fire sub-machine gun, with its serial number obliterated.  The firearm was fully functional, and was capable of firing projectiles in rapid succession upon a single depression of the trigger, at a rate of 1700 rounds per minute.  The muzzle velocity was determined to be 345 metres per second, and the effective range one hundred metres.  The gun was determined to be a prohibited pistol.
The search of the respondent's home turned up nothing of interest other than the engine of the show car, which was located in the garage.
The respondent did not participate in any interview with police.
The respondent was not authorised to possess any firearm, or ammunition.""
The sentence proceedings
9The respondent was arrested on 6 February 2013 and refused bail. He entered a plea of guilty on 1 July 2013 and was committed for sentence from the Local Court.  He appeared in the District Court at Campbelltown on 2 August 2013 when a date for sentence of 10 October 2013 was fixed.  On that date the sentence hearing was adjourned on the respondent's application and the matter was listed on 21 November 2013 for sentence.
10The respondent adhered to his plea of guilty to the primary offence.  The Form 1 offences the judge was invited to take into account were:
""Possess ammunition without authorisation, s 65(3) Firearms Act 1996, maximum penalty 50 penalty units ($5500);
Possess unregistered firearm (the Uzi), s 36(1) Firearms Act 1996, maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment;
Not keep pistol safely (the Uzi), s 39(1)(a) Firearms Act 1996, maximum penalty 50 penalty units or 2 years imprisonment, or both; and
Possess firearm with identification defaced (the Uzi), s 66(b) Firearms Act 1996, maximum penalty 5 years imprisonment.""
11The appellant and respondent presented their respective cases which each comprised documentary material supplemented by some oral evidence.  The evidence for the appellant included an officer from the Firearms and Organised Crime Squad informing the judge that the respondent was a member of the outlaw motorcycle gang, the Rebels.  Nothing, however, was sought to be made of this in submissions (although it must be noted that the Crown's submissions were truncated by the turn of events that I will come to).
12Brief reference should be made to some of the subjective issues.  The respondent had a criminal history that was not insignificant, but it was not lengthy and did not involve any prior full-time custody.  His early guilty plea would ordinarily attract a reduction of sentence of 25 per cent. He had been assessed by a psychologist as suffering a number of psychiatric disorders: ""Somatic Symptom Disorder, with Predominant Pain, severe"", ""Major Depressive Episode with Melancholic Features, Recurrent and Severe"" and ""Substance Use Disorders (various substances) with behavioural dysregulation; (in remission whilst held in a controlled environment)"".
13Two aspects of the respondent's subjective case were of some significance.  He suffered serious injuries in a motorcycle accident in September 2011.  Injuries to his hands and shoulders were the most severe.  He subsequently suffered from chronic pain and came to abuse prescription medication.  He also became reliant upon a variety of illicit drugs including crystal methamphetamine and cannabis.  The injuries and subsequent drug abuse affected his life in a variety of ways including that he could no longer work in his chosen employment as a gyprocker and he disengaged from family life to the point where his wife was contemplating leaving him.  At the time of his arrest he was due to undergo further surgery on his left hand.  Admission to hospital for that purpose had been arranged for 12 March 2013.  
14The psychologist's report included that the time in which the respondent had been in custody had been useful in terms of enabling him to commence rehabilitation with regard to his substance abuse problems.  However there was controversy about the issue of the necessary surgery to the respondent's hand.  The procedure was not carried out on 12 March 2013 as planned.  The Crown tendered information to the judge to the effect that the Justice Health and Forensic Mental Health Network were able to arrange for necessary surgery for inmates.  It became clear at the hearing of the appeal that there was no material before the sentencing judge as to whether any approach had been made, either by the respondent or on his behalf, to Justice Health to seek to have the surgery arranged.  The respondent had told the psychologist that he was fearful of a lengthy delay in undergoing the surgery because he otherwise might suffer a serious permanent disability.  
Submissions on sentence
15The submissions by Mr James QC on behalf of the respondent covered the following topics:
The seriousness of the offence is certainly ""in very much the lower range, much lower than mid-range""
The Form 1 offences should not have an aggravating effect on sentence
The respondent is not a ""good vehicle for specific or general deterrence""
There should be a 25 per cent discount for the plea of guilty
Imprisonment whilst on remand has been ""somewhat more onerous""
No arrangements have been made by Justice Health for the surgery required in relation to the respondent's left hand
16The submissions culminated with Mr James submitting that there were two possible dispositions - backdating the sentence and setting a non-parole period at the equivalent of the time served or commencing a sentence from the date of the hearing involving a period of supervision into the future.  At this point the learned judge interrupted counsel with the following proposition:
""HIS HONOUR:  I can deal with him under s 11"".
17His Honour indicated in the course of the ensuing discussion that this would give the respondent an opportunity to have the surgery and also to demonstrate whether he was capable of rehabilitating himself.  His Honour added, ""but it would also not be a promise that he would not go back to gaol"". 
18The solicitor appearing for the Crown had not had an opportunity to make any submissions on the subject but at this point the judge turned to him and said:
""Well Mr Crown I propose to deal with him pursuant to s 11"".
19The solicitor responded by submitting that doing so would involve appellable error.  The following ensued:
""HIS HONOUR:  You can appeal me then if you want to do that, that's the way I am going to deal with it.
[CROWN]:  Does your Honour wish to hear from the Crown at all?
HIS HONOUR:  Well I'll hear from you, yes.""
20It was then submitted for the Crown that the offence was not relatively minor as sought to be characterised on the respondent's behalf but that it was one that was objectively grave in that the weapon was a machine-gun pistol capable of discharging 1700 rounds per minute, which was found loaded in an entirely unsecured state and with additional ammunition packed with it.  The court was also referred to the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and it was submitted that an order made under s 11 incorrectly gave priority to rehabilitation at the expense of all other purposes of sentencing.  The submissions also incorporated reference to the maximum penalty for the offence as a measure of its seriousness.
Reasons for judgment
21The judge adjourned the proceedings until later in the day when he delivered short reasons before disposing of the matter pursuant to s 11.  The first matter his Honour referred to was that Smart AJ observed in R v Trindall [2002] NSWCCA 364; 133 A Crim R 199 at [58], [61] that the provision in s 11(1)(c) may be availed of ""for any other purpose the court considers appropriate in the circumstances"" and was wide enough to extend to a situation where a court may make an order ""to enable recommended and important surgery to take place"".  Smart AJ also referred to the more usual situation where an order is made to allow for an offender to pursue and demonstrate rehabilitation in order that that may be assessed when sentence is ultimately determined.
22The balance of his Honour's reasoning was as follows:
""I am satisfied that the material before me is that important surgery should take place and part of the granting of the Griffith Remand under s 11 is pursuant to subs(1)(c) of the Act to allow the surgery on the offender's hand to take place.  I note that there is evidence before me that suggests that if it is not done at some stage in the near future the damage could be permanent and debilitating to him.
Additionally I also have material before me that suggests that it would be appropriate to give him the opportunity to undertake further supervised rehabilitation outside of that available in the correctional services.  It has been my experience, particularly since my very short time on the Bench that there is little or no availability of drug rehabilitation programs in custody prior to sentencing.  There [are] no appropriate programs for people on remand when one would think this is the most appropriate time for them to be available.  Those people suffer an unfair disadvantage to those who have been granted bail and on remand who can undertake rehabilitation and therefore present a far more favourable picture to the Court in sentencing.
The circumstances of the history of Mr Farrell's difficulty with injuries [have] caused a turning by him to excessive use of prescribed medications as well as illegal drugs.  In view of the evidence and extensive reports of Dr Woods I propose to rely on that aspect of granting a Griffith Remand as an additional factor.""
23Finally the judge indicated that the respondent should not have any ""raised expectations"" as to what may be the final sentence that would be imposed.  In that context he mentioned his view that the offence was ""a serious one"".
24The conditions of bail granted pursuant to s 11 included that the respondent report once a week to police; reside at a nominated address; not associate with anyone belonging to an illegal motorcycle gang; make all feasible arrangements to undergo the surgery; submit to the assessment and supervision of the Probation and Parole Service; and submit to assessment and treatment by the author of the psychological report in respect of mental conditions and for drug rehabilitation.
Material tendered by the respondent on the hearing of the appeal
25An affidavit affirmed by the respondent's solicitor was read.  It included that the surgery had been carried out on 3 February 2014.  A letter under the hand of Associate Professor Gumley confirmed this and indicates that the surgery was thought to have been successful but that was something that would need to be assessed through a lengthy healing process.  Also tendered was a short report by the psychologist who had confirmed that the respondent had been making progress in terms of drug rehabilitation, rebuilding his familial relationships and avoiding contact with outlaw motorcycle gang associates.
26The Crown read an affidavit in which it was indicated that there had been an administrative breakdown within the Probation and Parole Service, not through any fault of the respondent, but that arrangements for assessment and supervision had recently been instituted. 
Crown submissions 
27Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that the judge had failed to make any assessment of the objective gravity of the offence.  Reliance was placed upon R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381; 134 A Crim R 174 at [38] where Howie J, with the concurrence of Levine and Hidden JJ, said:
""In my opinion the submission that it was unnecessary for his Honour to make findings of facts before making an order under s 11 should be emphatically rejected.  How can a court know whether an order adjourning the matter under [s 11] is necessary unless the court knows the objective seriousness of the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced?""
28It was submitted that there was a basis to infer from various statements made by the sentencing judge during bench and bar exchanges that he appeared to accept the submission of the respondent's counsel as to the offence being at a low level of objective seriousness and that it may well be the case that the time the respondent had served on remand would suffice.  I would reject this submission immediately.  What was said by his Honour could not be taken as an expression of a concluded view.  His comments were more in the nature of being ""off the cuff"" without having taken the time to reflect and fully consider the seriousness of the offence.
29It was the Crown's submission that the objective seriousness was such that a sentence with a non-parole period in excess of ten months was clearly called for.  This was particularly so given the ""frighteningly lethal weapon"" the respondent possessed, which was loaded and for which he had additional ammunition.  Reference was also made to the respondent being drug affected and having impaired judgment throughout the period of his possession of the item.  General and specific deterrence were required to be factored into the assessment of sentence and regard had to the statutory guideposts of the maximum penalty of 14 years and the standard non-parole period of 3 years.  Reliance in this regard was placed upon Thalari v R [2009] NSWCCA 170; 75 NSWLR 307 where the seriousness of a similar offence and factors relevant to the assessment of sentence were discussed in the judgment of Johnson J.
30It was submitted that it was not necessary for the sentencing of the respondent to be deferred so as to ascertain what his response might be to rehabilitation so as to enable a more informed assessment of this aspect in the ultimate sentencing exercise. There was sufficient evidence before the court for this assessment to be made.  For example, the psychologist's evidence was to the effect that the respondent had made substantial progress in relation to his drug addiction, managing his pain and adopting a healthy lifestyle since being in custody.  His earlier history demonstrated a capacity to rehabilitate as well. 
31A further issue raised by the Crown was the judge relying upon his personal experience about the availability of rehabilitation programs for inmates on remand.  Questions were raised about the reliability and accuracy of his Honour's experience when compared to the respondent's actual conditions in custody and it was also contended to have been unfair for his Honour not to raise this issue prior to giving judgment so as to afford the parties an opportunity to address it.
32This issue may be immediately put aside.  There was an opportunity for the Crown in this Court to establish that what his Honour said was incorrect.  The Crown did not seek to do so and I infer that this was because it could not.  Moreover, in my own experience, concerns being raised about the inability of remand inmates accessing rehabilitation programs are not novel.  (The extent to which such concerns are soundly based I do not know.)  There is, however, some force in the submission that it would have been better for his Honour to have ventilated the matter in order to give the parties an opportunity to address on it if they had wished.  There is also some force in the suggestion that if rehabilitation programs are more readily available to sentenced prisoners, then there was less reason to defer sentencing.
33Another aspect of the Crown's complaint was that deferral of sentencing so as to facilitate the respondent undergoing the surgery to his hand was unnecessary.  There was material before the judge to the effect that necessary surgery would be arranged by Justice Health.  The finding of the judge that the respondent's need for surgery supported disposition under s 11 was simply one that was not open to be made.
34Finally, the Crown submitted that delay in sentencing the respondent was not called for.  All the information that was required for there to be a proper assessment of sentence was already before the Court.  The respondent had made some progress in terms of rehabilitation and there was material to enable an evaluation of his future prospects in that respect and there was no need for the respondent to be at liberty for him to undergo surgery.
35The Crown contended that this Court would not exercise its residual discretion but would intervene on the basis that an injustice has been done.  It was submitted that the Court should quash the s 11 order and remit the matter to be re-listed before Hanley DCJ at the earliest opportunity.  The matter is presently listed to come back before his Honour on 14 April 2014 but that is only for mention in order to fix a date for the continuation of the sentence proceedings.  It was submitted that there was utility in bringing the matter on for resolution at a much earlier time.
Respondent's submissions 
36It was submitted that it was inapt for the Crown to appeal on a ground asserting manifest inadequacy when no sentence has been passed at all.  That submission may be rejected immediately.  Failing to impose a sentence if it is demonstrably obvious that a sentence was called for is clearly a manifestly inadequate exercise of the sentencing discretion.
37It was observed that no indication has been given by the judge as to what the ultimate sentence might be.  Reference was made to his Honour informing the respondent that he should not have any ""raised expectations"" as to the final sentence. 
38It was also submitted that an appeal such as this simply serves to fragment the sentencing process.  No more needs to be said about that submission apart from observing that the process has already been fragmented by the recourse to s 11.  The appeal has not served to provide any further interruption or delay.
39Counsel for the respondent asserted that it is the judgment that must be construed and this Court should not seek to draw conclusions from anything that his Honour said during the course of the submissions on sentence.  I accept that submission.
40It was asserted that the judgment is ""unimpeachable"" and no error can be discerned in a House v The King sense (House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499). His Honour demonstrated an awareness of relevant principles concerning s 11 by his reference to authority on the subject.
41There could have been no doubt as to the nature and seriousness of the respondent's offending conduct.  The matter proceeded by way of agreed facts so there was no dispute calling for his Honour's resolution.  His remark that the offence was ""a serious one"" demonstrated his awareness of the objective seriousness of the offence.
42The need for surgery was said to be a proper basis, in part, for the s 11 adjournment.  There was nothing said in Trindall about surgery not being available in the custodial environment.  The utility of the s 11 adjournment had been vindicated in the sense that the surgery had been carried out.  
43It was asserted that at the time the matter was before Hanley DCJ, ""the respondent had not been permitted to undergo the surgery"".  That submission should be rejected.  There was no evidence that the surgery had not been ""permitted"".  In fact, there was no evidence that the respondent had done anything to draw to the attention of Justice Health any need for surgery.  He bore the onus of proof of persuading the judge that this was a relevant matter to be taken account in his favour.
44As to the other basis for the judge's decision to defer sentencing, it was submitted that ""affording an offender an opportunity to demonstrate his ability to rehabilitate himself is a classical reason for deferring the imposition of sentence"". 
45It was submitted that even if a sentence that would involve a longer non-parole period than the time already spent on remand was called for, that was not a bar to a judge deferring sentence under s 11.  Reliance in this respect was placed upon R v Brown [2009] NSWCCA 6; 193 A Crim R 574 at 577-8 [22] (James J) and R v Rayment [2010] NSWCCA 85; 200 A Crim R 48 at 53 [22] (Tobias JA) and 80 [160] (Rothman J).
46Finally it was submitted that the appeal should be dismissed at least in the exercise of the Court's residual discretion.  The sentence proceedings were due to come back before the judge in the relatively near future.  Bringing the date forward by a small margin would simply amount to ""tinkering"". Principles 47Principles relating to Crown appeals against sentence are well-established and do not requirement restatement:  see, for example, Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462.
48As to s 11, it is in the following terms:
11   Deferral of sentencing for rehabilitation, participation in an intervention program or other purposes
(1)  A court that finds a person guilty of an offence (whether or not it proceeds to conviction) may make an order adjourning proceedings against the offender to a specified date, and granting bail to the offender in accordance with the Bail Act 1978: 
(a)  for the purpose of assessing the offender's capacity and prospects for rehabilitation, or
(b)  for the purpose of allowing the offender to demonstrate that rehabilitation has taken place, or
(b1)  for the purpose of assessing the offender's capacity and prospects for participation in an intervention program, or
(b2)  for the purpose of allowing the offender to participate in an intervention program, or
(c)  for any other purpose the court considers appropriate in the circumstances.
(2)  The maximum period for which proceedings may be adjourned under this section is 12 months from the date of the finding of guilt.
(2A)  An order referred to in subsection (1) (b2) may be made if the court is satisfied that it would reduce the likelihood of the person committing further offences by promoting the treatment or rehabilitation of the person. 
Note. Section 36A of the Bail Act 1978 enables a court to grant bail to a person on either or both of the following conditions: (a)  that the person enter into an agreement to subject himself or herself to an assessment of the person's capacity and prospects for participation in an intervention program or other program for treatment or rehabilitation,
(b)  that the person enter into an agreement to: 
(i)  participate in an intervention program and to comply with any intervention plan arising out of the program, or
(ii)  participate in any other program for treatment or rehabilitation.
(3)  This section does not limit any power that a court has, apart from this section, to adjourn proceedings or to grant bail in relation to any period of adjournment.
(4)  Subsection (1) (b1) and (b2) do not limit the kinds of purposes for which an order may be made under subsection (1), so that an order may be made under that subsection for the purpose of allowing an offender to participate in a program for treatment or rehabilitation that is not an intervention program, or to be assessed for participation in such a program.
49It would appear (I say that because it was not explicitly stated) that the judge had in mind the provisions of s 11(1)(a) and (c) in determining to order the s 11 remand.
50In Trindall, supra, Smart AJ referred to the rehabilitation issue in a s 11 remand:
[60]  Often a Court experiences difficulty when sentencing an offender in determining the offender's prospects of rehabilitation and whether the foreshadowed rehabilitation will occur.  In many instances it will be of great assistance to the sentencing judge if there is an adjournment to enable the offender to demonstrate that rehabilitation has taken place or is well on the way.
51However, his Honour later added:
[64]  The granting of a Griffiths [i.e. a s 11] remand is likely to arise for consideration in a relatively small number of cases.  Generally, such a remand should not be granted unless there are good reasons for concluding that it is likely to assist the court in determining whether an offender should be sent to gaol or in fixing the length of the sentence or the non-parole period.
52I referred earlier to what was said by Howie J in Palu about the need for there to be some assessment of the objective gravity of the offence before consideration can properly be given to making an order under s 11. I have referred to the judge having commented that the offence was ""a serious one"".  But it does not appear that he had formed any concluded view of just how serious it was.  In saying that the respondent should not have any ""raised expectations of what maybe the final sentence"", his Honour immediately added:
""That will be a sentence determined by me in accordance with an assessment of the offence which is a serious one and all the other factors that will be taken into account including what you do in the meantime."" (Emphasis added)
53Howie J also spoke in Palu of a concern about delaying sentencing proceedings:
[30]  The exercise of the power given under s 11 will inevitably result in delay in the finalisation of the prosecution of the offender.  On many occasions, as in the present case, that delay will be substantial.  Unless the further delaying of the sentencing of the offender is wholly justified in order to ensure that the sentencing discretion is properly exercised, there will be a miscarriage of justice.  ... Delay unavoidably results in unfairness: unnecessary delay results in injustice.  Steps have been taken throughout the criminal justice process to eliminate unnecessary delay wherever possible.  Unless delay in the sentencing of the offender is essential in order to ensure a just result, the court has failed in its duty both to the offender and the community. (Emphasis added)
54It was held in Palu that the sentencing judge had all the information before him that he needed in order to determine an appropriate sentence to imposed upon the respondent.  The appeal was upheld and the matter remitted for re-listing at the earliest opportunity. 
55One of the concerns ventilated by the Crown on this appeal was that by making an order under s 11 the judge must have it in mind that a sentence will be imposed that will not involve any further incarceration.  I am not satisfied that this is so.  I have mentioned what the judge said about the offender not holding out any false hope and he has referred to the offence as being ""a serious one"".  Further, a s 11 remand is not confined to cases where something other than a full-time custodial sentence is contemplated by a sentencing judge if rehabilitation is successful: Trindall at [64] (Smart AJ); R v Brown, supra, at [22] (James J).
56R v Rayment, supra, involved the first judgment being written by Johnson J in which his Honour held that a sentencing judge's discretion had miscarried by ordering a s 11 remand.  The respondent in that case had pleaded guilty to two very serious crimes of considerable violence.  By the time of sentence he had, as part of his bail conditions, completed a 12-month drug rehabilitation program and was about to embark on a training program to act as a mentor in that program.  There was some issue about whether the judge had ordered the remand pursuant to s 11(1)(a) ""for the purpose of assessing the offender's capacity and prospects for rehabilitation"" or pursuant to s 11(1)(b) ""for the purpose of allowing the offender to demonstrate that rehabilitation has taken place"".  Nothing turns on that for present purposes. 
57Johnson J favoured upholding the Crown appeal on the basis that further delay was not called for and that the matter should have proceeded to the imposition of final sentences.  Rothman J was of the view that the sentencing discretion had not miscarried.  Tobias JA, with the casting vote as it were, agreed with Rothman J that the appeal should be dismissed.
58One unifying aspect of the three judgments, notwithstanding the dissent of Johnson J, is the unanimity to the effect that the exercise of the discretion to make an order under s 11 was appropriate where an adjournment would ""be of assistance to [the judge] in determining the appropriate sentence to impose"": Tobias JA at [18], [25].  Rothman J put it in these terms:
[159] ... But s 11 of the Act is intended to aid in the final determination of an appropriate sentence, which reflects the intuitive synthesis of those conflicting goals.  The fundamental issue posed by an exercise of the discretion in s 11 is whether the adjournment of the imposition of the final sentence to be imposed, assuming satisfaction of the jurisdictional preconditions, assists in the proper determination of that final sentence. (Emphasis added)
59Johnson J adopted the same reasoning in dealing with facts of the case:
[114]  ... Any adjournment of the hearing by way of s 11 order could not bear properly upon the form of sentence which the law required to be passed in this case.  Nor, in my view, could the proper exercise of sentencing discretion involve the setting of the length of the non-parole period being affected by such additional steps which the respondent may take between [the date of the adjournment and the scheduled resumption of the hearing]. 
60Their Honours were expressing themselves consistently with what had been said by Smart AJ in Trindall at [60] and [64] which I have extracted above.  This is also consistent with what had been said by Howie J in Palu.
61The rationale of deferring sentence in order to gain assistance in the proper formulation of the appropriate sentence must be understood as bearing upon the exercise of the discretion afforded by s 11 in the relation to the question of rehabilitation (s 11(1)(a) and (b)).  Smart AJ gave examples in Trindall of situations in which s 11(1)(c) might apply:  where there is a ""significant risk of suicide if the offender remained in custody, for example, arising from severe depression"" (at [58]) and ""to enable recommended and important surgery to take place"" (at [61]). Such matters would not necessarily require deferral to enable a proper determination of the final sentence.
Determination
62In some of the cases there is discussion of what the ultimate sentence might be; a non-custodial sentence if an offender's progress towards rehabilitation is successful or an inevitable full-time custodial sentence with the length of it, and/or the non-parole component, being assessed in the light of such progress.  In this case, as I have observed, the judge has given no clear indication of what he contemplated was the possible final outcome.  (I do not suggest that this is necessarily required before disposition under s 11.)  Moreover, aside from the remark about the offence being ""a serious one"" he has given no indication of just how serious it was.
63Relevant matters to take into account in an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence will include the nature of the weapon; the circumstances attending the respondent's possession of it; the fact that it was loaded and its identification information had been defaced; and that further ammunition was found with it.  Obviously relevant as well is the seriousness with which Parliament has indicated that such offences are, given the prescription of a 14 year maximum penalty and a 3 year standard non-parole period. 
64I deliberately refrain from saying anything about the gravity of the respondent's offence or about what sentence might be imposed upon the final hearing.  These are matters that do not fall to this Court to determine and remain in the purview of the District Court.  Nothing in this judgment should be interpreted as indicating what the final sentence should be.  It will be necessary for the primary judge to determine these matters.
65I am persuaded that his Honour was wrong to have concluded that deferral of sentence and granting the respondent bail was necessary to enable the surgery to be performed.  All that that was before the court was that (a) the surgery had not been carried out and (b) that Justice Health would attend to arranging any necessary surgery for an inmate.  The only conclusion available upon that material was that no-one, the respondent or anyone on his behalf, had asked Justice Health to take steps to arrange the surgery.  It fell to the respondent to establish otherwise and he has not sought to do so, either in the District Court or this Court.  The implicit suggestion in the submissions of Mr James QC of reversing the onus should be rejected.
66I accept the submissions for the Crown that there was no real benefit in deferring sentencing to enable the respondent ""to undertake further supervised rehabilitation outside of that available in the correctional services"" (ROS 2).  There was ample evidence before the District Court last November to enable an informed assessment of the respondent's rehabilitation prospects.  Indeed, the sentencing judge did not suggest that monitoring the respondent's progress with respect to rehabilitation was necessary to enable him to determine the appropriate sentence to impose.
67The sentencing discretion clearly miscarried in this case.  With unfeigned respect, it appears that the judge too hastily arrived at a conclusion before giving measured consideration to the level of gravity of the respondent's crime (and the additional offences he asked to be taken into account); failed to properly assess the evidence relating to the surgery aspect; and overlooked the principles relating to s 11 disposition that I have referred to above.
The residual discretion
68Error having been established, it remains open to the Court to refrain from intervention in the exercise of its discretion.  In this case, practical considerations arise.  The order in question was made on 21 November 2013.  The Crown's notice of appeal was filed and served promptly.  Unfortunately, the listing of the hearing had to be deferred for longer than would ordinarily have been the case because of the Court's summer listing arrangements. This judgment will be handed down in March 2014.  The matter is due to come back before Hanley DCJ on 14 April 2014.  There is simply nothing practical to be achieved by making the orders the Crown seeks; that is, it seems inconceivable that the final determination of the sentence proceedings will occur at any time appreciably earlier than presently scheduled.
69It is only for the foregoing reason that I propose that the Crown appeal be dismissed.
Proposed order
70I propose the following order:
Crown appeal dismissed.

		14 March 2014",2014-03-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705406,DW v R [2014] NSWCCA 28,"Judgment

1WARD JA: On 2 December 2010, the appellant was found guilty by a jury on all but one of 16 counts with which he had been charged. The charges related to acts of aggravated indecent assault, incitement to aggravated acts of indecency, use of a child for pornographic purposes (in contravention of ss 61M(1), 61O(1) and 91G(1)(a) and 2(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), respectively) and possession of child pornography (in contravention of s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act). 

2Other than the last (16th) count (possession of child pornography in contravention of s 91H(2)), the charges related to conduct by the appellant from 2006 in respect of his natural daughter, who was between 12 and 14 years old at the time of the various offences. The 16th count related to images found in the appellant's possession when he was arrested. Relied upon as tendency evidence on that count only, and admitted without objection by the defence, were the pornographic images found on the appellant's computer of his daughter.

3The offences that related to the complainant involved the appellant's conduct in touching her breasts, demanding that she show him her naked body, and demanding that she pose nude for him to take photographs of a sexual and pornographic nature. The count on which the appellant was found not guilty (count 1) was a count of incite aggravated act of indecency in contravention of s 61O(1) of the Crimes Act relating to an alleged instruction by the appellant to his daughter to sunbake topless during a trip to the beach.

4The appellant was sentenced on 29 April 2011 on the fifteen counts on which he had been convicted and four domestic violence offences that were placed on a s 166 certificate, those being one count of common assault in contravention of s 61 of the Crimes Act (relating to conduct against his wife, the complainant's step-mother) and three counts of contravention of a prohibition or restriction in an apprehended violence order in contravention of s 14(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW). The appellant was later sentenced for an additional s 166 certificate offence of failure to appear.

5The overall sentence imposed was a term of imprisonment of 8 years, commencing on 1 December 2009 and expiring on 30 November 2017, with a total non-parole period of five years, commencing on 1 December 2009 and expiring on 30 November 2014. The earliest release date is 30 November 2014.

6The appellant now appeals against his convictions. Although not clear from the papers before this Court, the parties conceded that leave had been granted by the Registrar for an extension of time for the filing of the Notice of Appeal and no issue was taken by the Crown as to the competency of the appeal. The Court has proceeded on that basis.

Background

7The appellant's daughter first complained to police about the appellant's conduct when police officers attended the family home on 18 January 2009 in response to a domestic violence dispute involving the complainant's step-mother (that being the incident the subject of the common assault count that was ultimately taken into account on the first s 166 certificate). 

8Officers from the Department of Community Services (DOCS) had, however, previously spoken with the complainant (in February 2007 and June 2008) in relation to allegations received by the DOCS that she was at risk of sexual harm from the appellant. The precise circumstances in which those allegations were received by the DOCS was not made clear. There was, however, evidence at the trial from the child protection caseworker who interviewed the complainant in June 2008 to the effect that the complainant had said to her in that interview that ""In primary school there was a rumour and my teacher heard and spoke to DOCS about it"" and, when asked what had happened at that time, the complainant said ""People just came to talk to me like this"". This suggests that the reports of harm the subject of the DOCS enquiries were not the result of direct contact by the complainant with them. Certainly, when pressed on this point, there was no suggestion by Counsel for the appellant that it was the complainant herself who had contacted the DOCS. 

9The enquiries made by the DOCS did not lead to any action on its part in relation to the allegations. The evidence of the caseworker who had interviewed the complainant in 2007, referring to notes of that interview, was that the complainant had made reference to an incident where her father had rubbed cream on her and that she thought he was trying to touch her but that her father had sworn he did not mean it in a sexual way and that her step-mother had sorted it out. The caseworker who had interviewed the complainant in 2008 said that the complainant had denied that her father was touching her and raping her; and had also denied an allegation about photographs or that she and her friends had viewed pictures of naked girls on the internet. The trial judge found that the complainant had denied the allegations because she was frightened of her father, who had threatened her. 

10After the appellant was arrested and charged with common assault in relation to the January 2009 incident, and while he was on bail, the appellant left his employment and went to Western Australia. While there, the appellant contacted his wife by telephone and voice mail on a number of occasions, in which left messages saying, among other things, that it was not unlawful for him to take nude photos of his daughter.

11After the complainant's allegations against the appellant were made to the police, the police seized two computers and two cameras (with the step-mother's consent) from the family home. Later, the complainant's brother found a USB stick in the family garage and that was given to the police. The photographs of the complainant were found on those computers/USB stick. When the appellant was ultimately arrested in Western Australia, police seized a laptop computer and USB thumb drive which contained the pornographic images the subject of count 16.

12The Crown relied on evidence from the complainant; material from computers belonging to the appellant when the police attended the home shared by the appellant with his wife and family; the USB thumb drive found by the appellant's son in the family garage (containing nude images of the complainant); complaint evidence from the complainant's sister, her friend, and her step-mother; evidence from the sister and friend that they saw the appellant touching the complainant's breasts on numerous occasions; and a recorded message left by the appellant on his wife's answering machine claiming that it was not unlawful to take naked photos of his daughter. 

13Prior to the trial, the appellant had participated in an electronic record of interview with the police on 3 December 2009 (the record of which was Exhibit P at the trial), in which he admitted taking photographs of the complainant since she was aged 12; said that it was at her insistence; said that the complainant used to do this to extort money from him and threatened to go to the police if he did not take more photographs and pay more money to her; admitted to having paid the complainant lump sum payments of up to $300; denied assaulting the complainant; and denied having anything to do with the pornographic images of the complainant found on his computer. The appellant gave similar evidence at the trial. He claimed that the only photographs he had taken were of the complainant's breasts; that he had done so at her request and because she had body image issues; that the photographs were immediately saved onto a disc, which was then given directly to the complainant; and that his daughter had demanded money on each occasion and had threatened to make trouble for him if he did not comply with her request.

14Relevantly, for the purposes of this appeal, the Crown also relied at the trial on a recording made by the complainant on her mobile telephone of a conversation that she said she had with the appellant (Exhibit G at the trial). There is no dispute that the recording was taken without the appellant's knowledge. The recording was made during a face to face conversation between the two (relevant when taking into account the appellant's evidence that he recognised the bird in the background of the recording). The complainant said that she had made it by taking her mobile phone, putting it on ""record"" and placing it in her pocket.

15The text of the recorded conversation was as follows: 

Appellant: Hi sweetie pie.
Appellant: You can do a better effort than that ok.
Complainant: Whatty, what, what, what do I have to do all up, can you explain it?
Appellant: Photos need to get done ok. Try your bikini on for me. A couple of weeks down the track (untranscribable). 
Appellant: I want you to show me these regularly over the next week or so without me asking you ok?
Complainant: Uh huh.
Appellant: Alright and things are going to change ok.
Complainant: Uh huh.
Appellant: You have to be coming to me ok, if you want extra things and you want money ok. I'm not going to be constantly harassing you to come and show me alright.
Complainant: Um hum. 

16The complainant's evidence was that when the appellant said ""I want you to show me these regularly over the next week or so without me asking you, okay"" he pointed to her breasts.

Appeal

17The sole ground of appeal relates to the admission into evidence by the trial judge (over the objection of the appellant) of the recorded telephone conversation made by the complainant and the instructions given by the trial judge to the jury of the use that could (and could not) be made of that recording.

Ground 1(a) Admission of the recorded conversation into evidence

18The appellant contends that his Honour erred in admitting the recorded conversation into evidence on the basis that the recording was in breach of the prohibition contained in s 7(1)(b) of the Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NSW) (""the Act"") which provides, relevantly, that:

7(1) A person must not knowingly install, use or cause to be used or maintain a listening device:
...
(b) to record a private conversation to which the person is a party.

19Section 7(3) of the Act provides that s 7(1)(b) does not apply to the use of a listening device by a party to a private conversation if, relevantly:

(b) a principal party to the conversation consents to the listening device being so used and the recording of the conversation:
(i) is reasonably necessary for the protection of the lawful interests of that principal party, ...

20His Honour ruled on the Crown's application to adduce this evidence on 25 November 2010. His Honour found that the above exclusion applied, as this was a recording made by a principal party to the conversation (the complainant) and was reasonably necessary for the protection of the lawful interests of the complainant. The lawful interest of the complainant that was identified by his Honour was ""to protect herself from being the victim of the alleged criminal offences perpetrated by the accused"".

21His Honour went on to say that, even if he was incorrect as to the construction and applicability of the Act, the evidence was admissible pursuant to s 138(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) on the basis that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighed the undesirability of so doing. His Honour found the evidence to be highly probative, noting that Counsel for the appellant had fairly conceded that the evidence was both probative and important. 

22As to the probative value of the evidence, his Honour considered that a fair inference to be drawn from the recording was that it was the accused who was insisting on taking the photographs and that he would pay money in exchange for the photographs. His Honour noted that such evidence supported the complainant's evidence and was contrary to the assertions made by the appellant on the recorded message he had left on his wife's telephone (that was to be tendered without objection) to the effect that the complainant was extorting money from him and had both requested and agreed that the photographs be taken.

23His Honour acknowledged that the complainant's contravention of the Act (assuming for this purpose that, contrary to his findings, there had been a contravention) in the making of the recording, was deliberate but he did not accept the appellant's submission that it was grave. His Honour said that it had to be assessed against the background that ""it was the accused's fourteen year old daughter, recording the conversation in circumstances where it is alleged that she was the victim of being indecently assaulted and used for pornographic purposes"".


Did his Honour err in finding that the exception in s 7(3) applied?

24The circumstances in which the recording came to be made by the complainant, shortly before the police attended the family home in response to the domestic violence dispute in January 2009, were that she had disclosed the appellant's misconduct to her friend and her friend suggested that the complainant tell her ""real"" (i.e., natural) mother. When the complainant had responded that her mother ""won't believe me"", the friend says that she suggested that the complainant record the appellant. The complainant confirmed in an electronic record of interview to the police that her friend had suggested the recording. She said that she had put the phone on record in her pocket and ""then asked my dad what I had to do"".

25The complainant was 14 years old when the conversation was recorded and was living at the family home with the appellant and his wife. His Honour noted, by way of background, that the complainant was frightened of the appellant as a result of his violent behaviour; and that the appellant had convinced his wife (the complainant's stepmother) that the complainant was lying. His Honour accepted that it was as a consequence of the complainant's fear of the appellant that she had earlier denied any knowledge of the offences when interviewed by officers from DOCS.

26The appellant submits that it was not open to his Honour to find that the recording was reasonably necessary for the protection of the lawful interests of the complainant.

""Lawful interest""

27As to what is sufficient for a ""lawful interest"" within the meaning of s 7(3), there is some uncertainty in the authorities.

28In the present case, the Crown did not advance a particular definition of ""lawful interests"" but submitted that it must extend at least as far as the interests of the claimant in the present case not to be sexually abused and not to be sexually exploited for pornographic purposes. 

29No assistance can be gleaned from the Explanatory Notes to either the Surveillance Devices Bill 2007 or its predecessor the Listening Devices BiIl 1984 when construing ""lawful interests"" in the relevant legislation. 

30In Crafter v Kelly [1941] SASR 237 Napier J, at 243, noted that the natural meaning of ""lawful"" will depend on the context in which the word is used, contrasting use in the sense of ""permitted"" - i.e., something that can be done without any infraction of the law; use in the sense of being supported by the law; and use in the sense of being ""legally enforceable"".

31In R v Le [2004] NSWCCA 82; 60 NSWLR 108; 146 A Crim R 179, Adams J (with whom RS Hulme J agreed, Giles JA dissenting on this issue) held (at [83]) that the desire of a witness to protect her credibility generally; to support her credibility if she had to give evidence in a court proceeding about the matter; and to protect herself against exposure to being charged with making false allegations against other people about matters of considerable seriousness, did constitute a ""lawful interest"" for the purpose of that phrase as used in the predecessor to s 7(3)(b)(i) of the Act (s 5(3)(b)(i) of the Listening Devices Act 1984).

32In Sepulveda v R [2006] NSWCCA 379; 167 A Crim R 108, Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hislop J agreed) did not express a concluded view as to the meaning of ""lawful interests"", though suggesting that it might not extend as broadly as suggested by Branson J in Violi v Berrivale Orchards Ltd [2000] FCA 791; 99 FCR 580 at [28], where her Honour considered it would encompass ""legitimate interests"" or ""interests conforming to law"", i.e., interests that are not unlawful as opposed to ""legal interests"" ([126]).

33In Thomas v Nash [2010] SASC 153; 107 SASR 338, Doyle CJ, considering the phrase ""lawful interests"" in an analogous provision to s 7 of the Act, expressed the view that it would not be satisfied merely by a desire to have a reliable record of a conversation [48] but went on to observe from his review of the cases that in several of the cases where the conversation related to a serious crime or an allegation of a serious crime, or to resisting such an allegation, the court was more likely to find that the recording of a conversation relating to the crime could be made in the protection of the person's ""lawful interests"". (Reference was made to Thomas in Alliance Craton Explorer Pty Ltd v Quasar Resources Pty Ltd [2010] SASC 266; R v Coutts [2013] SADC 50)).

34 In Georgiou Building Pty Ltd v Perrinepod Pty Ltd [2012] WASC 72; 261 FLR 211; at [16], Allanson J, considering the phrase ""reasonably necessary for the protection of a lawful interest"" in the context of the comparable s 5 of the Surveillance Devices Act 1988 (WA), distinguished ""lawful interests"" from ""legal interests"", citing Violi at [28], and said that it was not necessary that there be a legal interest in the sense of a legal right, duty or liability, noting that in Chao v Chao [2008] NSWSC 584 at [8], a recording made where a serious dispute had erupted and it was anticipated there would be a dispute as to different versions of an arrangement might give rise to a lawful interest.

35In R v Coutts, the South Australian District Court considered a recording of a conversation by the complainant to be ""for the protection of the lawful interests of that person"" in circumstances where the accused was charged with numerous counts of sexual assault and assault against his former partner. The complainant alleged that the accused had said to her that he had previously been charged with rape based on the complaint of another woman but that it had been his word against hers and that even if he was recorded it could not be used in court. The recording was described as a graphic account of threats, belittlement and sounds of forced sex while the complainant was crying and in distress and pain. A separate recording was made of a conversation in which the accused told the complainant how he knew how to choke her without leaving any marks. 

36His Honour identified the complainant's lawful interests as being her interest in defending against the ""extreme levels of harm and danger"" she faced (at [26]). 

37In the present case, I see no error on the part of the trial judge in finding that the interest of the complainant (a child) not to be the victim of the serious criminal offences that were alleged is a ""lawful interest"" for the purposes of s 7(3) of the Act. Such an interest is recognised in international law (see Article 34 of the Convention on the Rights of a Child, ratified by Australia in December 1990, which refers to the protection of children from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse). 

""Reasonably necessary""

38Insofar as the discussion in Sepulveda (to which I refer below) points to the need not to adopt a construction of the Act that would undermine its primary purpose, a construction of ""lawful interests"" to encompass a child's interest in not being sexually exploited cannot be said to do so since the relevant question in each case will be whether the making of the recording is ""reasonably necessary"" for the protection of such an interest. 

39In that regard, the appellant contends that it was not open to his Honour to find that the recording was ""reasonably necessary"" for the protection of the complainant's lawful interests, since it was open to the complainant to have gone directly to the police. Reliance is placed in this regard on what was said in Sepulveda (at [139]).

40In Sepulveda, the recording in question was made when the complainant was 29 years old. The offences with which the accused had been charged related to sexual misconduct against the complainant when he was aged between about 9-14 years old. The complainant said that his purpose in recording the conversation (in which general admissions were made by the accused of sexual behaviour and relationships with the complainant and his brothers during the period in question) was to ""get justice for everyone"" (at [48]). The accused did not deny a sexual relationship with the brothers but maintained that it was only after they were old enough to consent thereto.

41It was argued at trial that it was reasonably necessary for the recording to be made to assist in bringing the accused to justice and to create a reliable and independent record of his admissions. The defence case was that the complainant had been motivated to extort money from the accused and that the accused had made the admissions because he feared that otherwise the complainant would harm him. There was evidence that the complainant had accepted money in exchange for the tape of the conversation (but had not given the accused the correct tape).

42In Sepulveda (at [117]), Johnson J accepted the proposition that it was sufficient (for the purposes of the predecessor provision to s 7 of the Act) that the recording of a conversation be reasonably appropriate, rather than essential, for the protection of the lawful interests of the principal party. 

43Having noted (at [138]) that there was no impediment to the complainant approaching police with a complaint as to the alleged sexual assault of him and his brothers, and that a consequence of such a complaint may have been an application by the police for a warrant to be issued pursuant to which the conversation would have been lawfully obtained, at [139] Johnson J said:

Having regard to this statutory context, and allowing for a construction that attributes to the words ""reasonably necessary"" the meaning ""reasonably appropriate"", it is difficult to see how the factual findings in this case are capable of satisfying the statutory requirement for reasonable necessity. The test, of course, is an objective one. Reasonable necessity is to be judged objectively upon bases or grounds that exist at the time of the recording. The ability of [the complainant] to approach police with his complaints, rather than move directly to himself record the conversation, stands in the way of a finding of reasonable necessity in this case. ...

44His Honour found that error of law had been demonstrated on the part of the trial judge in that, on the findings of fact and conclusions reached by the trial judge, it was not open to the trial judge to find that the recording of the conversation was ""reasonably necessary"" so as to fall within the statutory exemption from the prohibition against such recordings ([144]).

45Johnson J noted (at [142]) that the purpose of the legislation there under consideration (the Listening Devices Act) was to protect privacy, by prohibiting the covert recording of a conversation other than (usually) by way of a warrant under the statute; expressed the opinion that the lawful interests there identified by the trial judge were of a ""somewhat nebulous kind""; and said that the construction of the trial judge would leave open the covert recording of a conversation by any person who alleged that he or she was a victim of crime and spoke to the alleged offender for the purpose of obtaining admissions of offences. His Honour emphasised that it was important that a construction of the legislation not be adopted that would serve to undermine, in a significant respect, a primary purpose of the legislation. 

46In the present case, the appellant submits that the same reasoning as that employed in Sepulveda applies in that it was open to the complainant to have complained to the police. The appellant submitted that children make complaints to the police and to persons in authority on a daily basis (something of which I infer this Court was invited to take judicial note). Emphasis was placed on the fact that the complainant had previously been in contact with DOCS and that she had her own mobile phone from which she could have contacted DOCS or the police directly if she so desired. 
47As to this submission, there is no evidence that the complainant had instigated the earlier complaints to DOCS (though complaints by her to others as to her father's conduct may well have been the source of the rumours that led to the risk of harm reports to DOCS) or that she knew how to go about contacting DOCS for the purposes of making a complaint (the evidence being that the previous contact was when DOCS caseworkers came to her school to interview her). The fact that the complainant had her own mobile phone does not mean that, as a 14 year old, she should be expected to have understood the legal avenues that she could take in order to have her complaints investigated.

48There was no evidence from the complainant as to her purpose in making the recording, nor was she cross-examined as to her motive in so doing. She did not immediately take it to the police (or to any authority figure). Rather, her evidence was that she hid the recording by renaming it in a different file so that her father could not access it. Nor did she, as was the case in Sepulveda, seek to obtain money in exchange for the recording. Given the relatively short period of time between the making of the recording and the occasion on which the complaint was made to the police (about a month), there is no reason to infer that the recording was not made for the purpose of the complainant having some evidence which she could use to convince others to believe her or to corroborate her word (as was the context in which it was suggested that she make the recording in the first place) or to protect herself from further assaults. The fact that, unlike R v Coutts (at [26]), the recording was not made on the ""spur of the moment"" during the course of an assault does not change my conclusion on this.

49In my opinion, it was open to the trial judge to infer that the recording was made for the purpose of the protection of the complainant's lawful interest in protecting herself from continuing abuse and exploitation. As to whether it was reasonably necessary for that purpose for the recording to be made, there is a clear distinction between the position in Sepulveda and that in the present case. 
50In Sepulveda, the recording was made by an adult, some years after the alleged assaults. Here, it was made by a child and it was made while the assaults were ongoing. The recording was made prior to any investigation by the police of allegations of sexual misconduct by the appellant. His Honour accepted that the complainant was frightened of the appellant, with whom she was living, as a result of his violent behaviour and that the only other adult in the house had been convinced by the appellant that she was lying. Further, his Honour accepted that the response by the complainant when interviewed by DOCS as to the allegations of harm was as a result of her father's violence. 

51The Crown submitted, and I accept, that it was not practicable in the circumstances of this case for the complainant to contact police in order to seek to arrange a warrant to record conversations with her father. 

52I note that in R v Coutts, the Court at [26] (in obiter insofar as the legislation did not there require that the recording be ""reasonably necessary"" for the relevant purpose) considered that it was not a realistic option for an adult complainant, who was trapped in a violent and abusive relationship, to report her predicament to the police. Here, the findings of his Honour point even more strongly to such a conclusion where the complainant was a child.

53In my opinion, given the complainant's age and the family circumstances, his Honour did not err in concluding that the making of the recording was reasonably necessary for the protection of the complainant's lawful interest in protecting herself from being indecently assaulted and photographed for the purposes of child pornography, within the meaning of s 7(3)(b)(i) of the Act. I do not consider that such a conclusion subverts or undermines the privacy objectives of the legislation. 

54That disposes of ground 1(a) of the appeal. However, issue was also taken with the contingent finding by his Honour to the effect that, even if the recording contravened s 7 of the Act (because, contrary to his Honour's conclusion, the exclusion did not apply), the evidence would be admissible in the exercise of his discretion under s 138 of the Evidence Act. I turn to that issue.


Did his Honour err in the exercise of discretion under s 138?

55The appellant accepts that in order to succeed in the contention that his Honour erred in concluding that the evidence should not be excluded pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act, he must demonstrate that his Honour erred in the exercise of his discretion in accordance with the principles described in House v The King [1936] HCA 40, 55 CLR 499.

56The basis on which the appellant submits that the exercise of his Honour's discretion miscarried is the contention that the probative value of the recorded conversation was weak and hence his Honour should have concluded that it was outweighed by the prejudice to the appellant of the admission of the evidence.

57Two issues were raised on appeal in this regard. First, it was submitted that there was a doubt as to whether it was the appellant's voice on the recording. Second, it was submitted that to the extent that there was a plausible and competing inference favourable to the appellant's case which could be drawn from the contents of the recorded conversation, this undermined the probative value of the evidence. 

58As to the first, it was submitted that the appellant's evidence was ambiguous as to whether he conceded that it was his voice that had been recorded. In cross-examination there was the following exchange (AB 601.3-46):

Q. You see you now know that she recorded a conversation between you and her?
A. Yes, I do know that now.

... 

A. [After agreeing that he had heard the recording played to the jury and had seen a transcript of it; and had been taken to certain statements that it was put to him he had been recorded as saying] No recollection of that conversation at all.

Q. Well, you recognised the bird in the background the bird in the background and you have recognised your own voice saying: ""Hi Sweetie pie""?
A. My own voice, I recognised the bird in the background, which most likely would be our house. But I can't be sure of that. I have no recollection of that conversation at all. (my emphasis)

Q. So you have no explanation for what you would have been taking about, saying if you want money?
A. I have no recollection of that. I have no - I don't know what she was talking about and I don't know even 100% if that was me.

Q. Somebody else?
A. I have no idea. I have no recollection of that conversation. For a start, I never called [the complainant], ""Sweetie pie"", it's always cutie pie. So I have no recollection of that conversation.

Q. Are you just telling the jury that because you can't think of an excuse?
A. No. I am telling the absolute truth. I have no recollection of that conversation ever taking place. 

59It is submitted for the appellant that the statement italicised above is ambiguous as to whether the appellant accepted that the voice on the recording was his own or was simply repeating the question. Even accepting that the answer in question does not, as recorded on the transcript, appear to be an unqualified acceptance by the appellant that it was his voice on the recording, and that he did not know ""even 100%"" that it was him, there was an initial acceptance that the recorded conversation was at his home (since he said he recognised the bird in the background). No application was made at trial by Counsel for the defence to exclude the evidence under s 137 of the Evidence Act (the recording having been admitted, following the ruling on a voir dire, prior to the appellant's cross-examination).
60As the Crown submits, the trial judge cannot be said to have erred in not taking this evidence into account, when weighing the probative value of the evidence against any unfair prejudice to the appellant at the time that the recording was admitted into evidence, since there was no suggestion at that stage that the appellant challenged that it was a recording of his voice. 

61As to the second matter, Counsel for the appellant accepted that the far more likely inference to be drawn from the conversation was one that was consistent with the Crown's case. Further, it was conceded by Counsel for the appellant that any alternative inference available from the conversation (the Crown contending that there was none) was one that would have been favourable to the appellant (unlike the position in R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121, to which the appellant referred in support of his submission). 

62His Honour found that the probative value of the tape recording was high because it supported the complainant's evidence that it was the appellant who had instructed the complainant to show him her breasts and who had insisted on taking photographs for which he paid her money, contradicting the recorded message left by the appellant on his wife's answering machine to the effect that the complainant was extorting money from him.

63At trial, Counsel for the defence had conceded that a fair inference to be drawn from the recorded conversation was that demands were being made by the accused to the complainant about photographs to be taken rather than the other way around. That must be correct, given the statements in the recording that the speaker was ""not going to be constantly harassing"" the complainant to come and show him (her breasts) and that if she wanted money she had to do so. Statements of that kind are wholly inconsistent with the appellant's defence that he had taken photographs of the complainant's breasts (albeit denying that he had taken the photographs showing the complainant in erotic poses) at her request and that she was extorting money from him.

64The probative value of the recording was clearly high. The Crown further notes that no argument was put to his Honour at trial as to any particular unfair prejudice to the appellant from the admission of the evidence. 

65In my opinion, the trial judge has not been shown to have erred in the conclusion reached that, if the tape recording was prohibited by the Act, in the exercise of his discretion it should nevertheless be admitted into evidence as its probative value outweighed any prejudice to the appellant. 

66A similar conclusion was reached in ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266, where complaint was made as to the admission into evidence of a recording made, without the knowledge of the accused by the complainant, of a conversation in which general statements were made by the accused that could be characterised as general admissions; the Court accepted that there had been a contravention of the legislation; but the evidence was nevertheless held to have been admissible pursuant to the exercise of discretion under s 138. There, the complainant was 16 years old at the time the recording was made; the offences related to conduct when the complainant was aged between 11 and 16; the investigation was in the hands of the police when the recording was made and the trial judge had noted that the means by which such a recording could be obtained by warrant were available upon proper application. On appeal, the challenge to his Honour's exercise of discretion was unsuccessful.

67Even if the recording was made in breach of the Act, his Honour did not err in concluding that it would have been admissible in the exercise of his discretion. Ground 1(a) is therefore not made out.

Ground 1(b) Failure properly to direct the jury regarding the recorded conversation

68The second limb of the sole ground of appeal relates to the adequacy of the direction given to the jury as to the recorded conversation.

69The trial judge, in summing up to the jury, noted that the Crown case depended largely on the evidence of the complainant and directed the jury that it must exercise caution before it could convict the accused ""because the Crown case largely depends upon you accepting the reliability of the evidence of a single witness"". The trial judge emphasised this again in what was accepted by the appellant to be a standard Murray direction (R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12).

70His Honour addressed the jury on the relevance of evidence of other uncharged acts (evidence of the complainant that the accused would regularly make her show him her body, touch her breasts and make her pose for pictures for him, other than the matters charged in the indictment; and evidence from the sister and friend that they observed conduct other than that with which the accused was charged), namely, as matters placing in a wider context the particular acts with which the appellant was charged. 

71His Honour then went on to give what the appellant accepts was an appropriate general anti-tendency direction. The evidence to which his Honour referred in the course of that general anti-tendency direction included the evidence that the appellant would repeatedly make the complainant pose for photographs for him.

72The trial judge then went on to address the tendency evidence. In his summing up, the trial judge clearly distinguished the tendency evidence from the context evidence the subject of the previous general anti-tendency direction.

73The tendency evidence to which his Honour referred was the evidence of child pornography found on the computer seized in Western Australia, the images found on the computer seized from the appellant's home in New South Wales and the evidence in the complainant's interview that he had previously touched her on the vagina; made her shave her vagina; and repeatedly took photographs of her when naked. There was no reference by his Honour in this context to the recorded conversation (nor had it been the subject of a tendency notice by the Crown). Counsel for the appellant points out, however, that the content of the recorded conversation went to the repeated taking of photographs of the complainant.

74The trial judge gave the jury a direction that this evidence (i.e., the tendency evidence) could only be used if the jury was first satisfied of the evidence beyond reasonable doubt and then only for the limited purpose of showing that the accused had the tendency claimed by the Crown: namely, the tendency to act in a particular way, which the trial judge described as being ""indecently [to] assault his daughter, store child pornography on his computer or flash drive; and [incite] her to commit acts of indecency"". 

75Insofar as Counsel for the appellant, in submissions on the appeal, queried what were the counts to which evidence of the complainant's police interview could be taken into account as tendency, the direction of the trial judge had thus indicated that the interview could be relied upon as tendency in relation to each of the counts involving conduct against the complainant. 

76The first reference to the recorded conversation was in the trial judge's summing up in relation to counts 6-15 (which related to the pornographic images of the complainant). The trial judge said:

The Crown puts particular emphasis in its submission to you on the recorded conversations [sic] between the complainant and the accused which is exhibit G.

The Crown says in effect that you can draw the inference that it was the accused and not the complainant who was making the request for photographs and for the complainant to show the accused her breasts.

The Crown says to you that you would not accept the accused's evidence that he was the victim of a conspiracy set up by his wife and daughter and his brother or the inference that it was his son ...or friend ... or any of the other persons that came to the house as being responsible for taking the clearly pornographic photographs of the complainant.

77The appellant contends that the general anti-tendency direction given by the trial judge was not sufficient where the evidence to which his Honour had there referred was capable of being construed as a general admission of all counts (submissions T 9.26), including the counts that did not involve the taking of photographs. More particularly, it was submitted that where there was a risk that the recorded conversation could be relied upon as tendency evidence the jury should have been given a specific anti-tendency direction in relation to this evidence. 

78The Crown contends that the evidence of the recorded conversation was not sought to be, and was not, used as evidence of tendency and that the jury was not invited to engage in tendency reasoning in relation to that evidence. 

79In ARS, the scope of the direction required to be given to the jury in relation to evidence similar to that in the present case was considered. There, it was noted that the Crown had adduced the evidence of the taped conversation not on the basis of tendency evidence but on the basis of a general admission. The trial judge directed the jury that if it found that the recording amounted to a general admission by the accused of sexual conduct towards the complainant then whilst that might not refer to any particular episode that evidence of admission could properly support the occurrence of the conduct charged and described in the indictment. There was no error found in the approach adopted by the trial judge in that regard.

80As to the risk that the evidence could be used as tendency evidence, the Court found that the trial judge's anti-tendency direction adequately indicated to the jury the issue to which the evidence could be put and the matters of which they had to be satisfied before they made use of it.

81The appellant relies, however, upon what was said in Christian v R [2012] NSWCCA 34; 223 A Crim R 370, where more than a general anti-tendency direction was required. In Christian, McClellan CJ at CL, with whom Latham and Harrison JJ agreed, considered the directions that should have been given as to the use that could be made of recorded conversations (referred to as the pretext conversations) which the prosecution submitted were capable of being admissions of guilt by assent or concurrence in what the complainant had put to the accused in the course of that conversation. There, the accused had admitted to a sexual relationship with the complainant but denied that this had occurred when the complainant was a child. The accused had denied in a police interview ever having had oral or anal sex with the complainant. 

82McClellan CJ at CL held that the trial judge was required to approach the issue as to the use of the evidence in the manner endorsed in R v MMJ [2006] VSCA 226, 166 A Crim R 501. This required the trial judge to give directions which identified the particular aspects of the pretext conversations that were relied upon by the Crown as constituting ""admission of guilt"" of any of the counts; which directed the jury to consider those particular parts of the conversation in the context of the whole conversation; and which reminded the jury of available alternative explanations for the accused's answers and to consider whether or not those responses were in the context of a mature relationship rather than one in breach of the law and, accordingly, whether they supported the complainant's evidence with respect to any particular alleged offence (at [83]).

83At [84], his Honour went on to refer to the separate risk that the jury would engage in tendency reasoning, noting that it was not in dispute that there had been sexual activity, although the precise nature of that activity and the occasions on which it occurred were disputed, and that what the jury had to decide was whether the activity alleged had taken place before the complainant turned 10, or 16, years. His Honour noted that the nature of the assertions and the significance of the response and its relationship to any of the particular charges was not considered. 

84As to whether the Crown was seeking to rely on the recorded conversation as tendency evidence, the appellant points to the submission made by the prosecutor at the time of the voir dire to the effect that the recorded conversation demonstrated that the appellant was doing exactly what the complainant said that he was doing. That indicates that reliance was sought to be placed on the conversation as corroboration of the complainant's evidence.

85The references made by the prosecutor to the recorded conversation in closing address were consistent with this.

86The Crown noted that what was said in the recorded conversation (""show me these regularly over the next week or so without me asking you okay"") was in keeping with the evidence of the complainant's sister as to what the complainant told her the appellant had said (that the complainant should have known that he wanted to look at her breasts and that things were going to change). 

87The Crown referred to the statement in the recorded conversation to the effect that ""you have to be coming to me okay if you want extra things and you want money okay; I'm not going to be constantly harassing you to come and show me, all right"" and said:

What's the explanation for that - there is only one, the complainant says, ""I recorded that to show as an example of what it was that he would repeatedly require of me"". What does he say, ""I don't remember it"".

Ladies and gentlemen, I suggest that that alone is extremely damning but the accused has given a version.

88Pausing there, on my reading of the address what the prosecutor suggested was extremely damning was the statement by the appellant that he was not going to be constantly harassing the complainant for her to come to him to show him (her breasts) and that if she wanted extra things or money she had to come to him - statements inconsistent with the defence case that his daughter was the one requesting the photographs be taken and demanding or extorting money from him (not the appellant's professed inability to remember the conversation). 

89After an adjournment, the prosecutor continued as follows:

Ladies and gentlemen, we got to the stage where I had just suggested to you that some of the reasons why you'd believe that the complainant was telling you the truth because the accused did take photos of her naked on his own admission; that he did used to look at her very often naked; that [the sister] in fact observed count 4 take place as well as other things; that [the friend] observed him possibly hundreds of times touching her breasts but perhaps the most damning thing is that phone message - that phone recording of the complainant, ""photos need to get done. I want you to show me these regularly over the next week without me asking you and you have to be coming to me, okay, if you want extra things and you want money, okay. I am not going to be continually harassing you"".

There's another part of that too that I neglected to points [sic] out to you that he is also reported as saying, ""All right and things are going to change, okay"". Now, you'll remember repeated references by the complainant that the accused considered her to have a bad attitude and things were going to change there ladies and gentlemen is a recording of him doing just that.

90Finally, when referring to Count 5, the prosecutor referred to the complainant's evidence that when the appellant said ""do you want to show me your boobs?"" and she asked him why the appellant had said ""[b]ecause we've got to get rid of your attitude"", the prosecutor said:

... exactly in keeping I suggest with the recording that she made - that's a different incident but it is exactly in accordance with the recording that she made on her phone.

Those are the reasons I suggest you would believe the complainant. All of the corroborated stuff ...

91The appellant submits that in the present case the jury was actively encouraged by the Crown to engage in tendency reasoning and there was an absence of directions as to how this evidence could be used by the jury and for which particular offence or offences. The Crown submits that the recorded conversation was relied upon as a general admission and as corroboration, not as tendency evidence, and that there was not a real risk that the jury would engage in tendency reasoning in relation to this evidence.

92It is submitted by the Crown that the context direction given earlier on the same topic (the appellant's request to see the complainant's breasts) sufficiently alerted the jury to the danger of impermissible tendency reasoning in relation to evidence on that topic such that no tendency warning was required in relation to it (referring to Toalepai v R [2009] NSWCCA 270 at [47]).

93It is clear from the transcript that the use sought to be made by the Crown of the recorded conversation was primarily to corroborate the evidence given by the complainant as to the circumstances in which the appellant had taken photos of her breasts and had required her to show him her breasts. This was in the context that the appellant did not deny having taken photos of his daughter's breasts (though he did deny taking the photographs of more erotic poses by his daughter) and did not deny having seen her naked. The recorded conversation was thus not relevant to the fact that he had done those things on repeated occasions; its significance was that it was inconsistent with the appellant's assertion that he was doing so at the complainant's request and that she was extorting money from him as a result. 

94There was not a real possibility that the jury might use the recorded conversation as manifesting a tendency of the appellant to touch his daughter's breasts (the subject of counts 2 and 5); nor could it have realistically been used as conduct that was relevant to the possession of child pornography charge relating to images of other children (count 16). The conduct of taking photographs and viewing his daughter's breasts was, relevantly, admitted. The recorded conversation went relevantly to the question of at whose instigation the admitted conduct was engaged in. Insofar as the recorded conversation related to showing the appellant the complainant's breasts, it did not go to any tendency of the appellant to take other pornographic photographs of the complainant and this was not suggested by the Crown.

95I am not satisfied that there was a real risk in the present case that the jury would misuse the recorded conversation. Its significance was in contradicting the appellant's version as to why the photographs were taken. The general anti-tendency direction was in my opinion adequate in the present case. 

96It is also submitted by the appellant that the jury should have been specifically directed that if there was a reasonable possibility that the recording did not involve the appellant they should not have regard to its contents. As to this, no such direction was sought at trial and the Crown submits that rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. I consider that below.

Application of Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules and the proviso in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912

97The Crown submits that even if the recorded conversation should not have been admitted in evidence, the Court should apply the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act and, similarly, that if there was a failure to give a specific anti-tendency direction (or a direction to the jury as to the possibility that it was not the appellant's voice on the recorded conversation) then rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules and/or the proviso to s 6(1) should be applied. It was submitted that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred, reliance being placed on the overwhelming nature of the case against the accused.

98Reference was made to the explanation of the rationale for rule 4 in Papakosmas v R [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 (at [72]) per McHugh J and to the observation of Bathurst CJ in ARS at [148] that the requirements of the rule are not mere technicalities.

99The Crown points to the fact that no objection was taken, no any request for a redirection as to the matters in respect of which complaint is made in relation to the trial judge's summing up as a reasonably reliable indicator of its fairness and adequacy (referring to Tekely v R; Nagle v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [89]; R v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174 at [90]; 139 A Crim R 340 at 354; and FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182 at [72]).

100Emphasis is placed by the appellant on the fact that the case against him was substantially based on the evidence of the complainant, noting that the trial judge directed the jury to exercise caution before convicting the appellant because the Crown case largely depended upon acceptance of the reliability of the evidence of a single witness (the complainant).

101The question, when considering rule 4 is whether there has been a miscarriage of justice in that the appellant has lost a real chance of acquittal; for the purposes of the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act the question is whether the Court is satisfied that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred. The task for an appellate court, when considering the application of the proviso, was outlined in Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300 (at [41]) and emphasised again in Cooper v The Queen [2012] HCA 50 at [20]-[21].

102The Crown points to the remarks on sentence by the trial judge and, in particular, his Honour's description of the Crown case as ""quite overwhelming"". Relevantly, his Honour made this observation on the basis that the complainant was a convincing witness ""supported as she was by the evidence of complaint, and the admissions of the accused that he did take photographs of the complainant when naked"". Earlier in his remarks on sentence, the trial judge described the complainant as ""an impressive witness who gave her account of events frankly and without embellishment"". His Honour also referred to ""[t]he recording made by the complainant, [the appellant's] ownership of the laptop, [the appellant's] lack of credibility in his explanations to the interviewing police and his flight from New South Wales to Perth which no doubt affected his credibility"", earlier having referred to the evidence as to the appellant's exclusive use of the laptop. 

103The complainant's evidence was supported by contemporaneous complaints made to her friend and to her sister; and by evidence of the friend's mother as to the complainant's response when her friend told her friend's mother about the allegations and that there had been about four occasions when there had been discussion in her presence of what the appellant had been doing. There was evidence from both her friend and her sister who witnessed the appellant touching the complainant's breasts. 

104The Crown also points to the appellant's admissions that he took some but not all of the naked photographs of the complainant; his evidence that he thought there was nothing wrong with taking naked photographs of his 13 or 14 year old daughter; and his admission that he had paid the complainant for the photographs he took of her (although he claimed that he was being blackmailed). The appellant also admitted that he had rubbed moisturising cream on his daughter's body but denied rubbing it on her breasts; that he talked to the complainant about the size of her breasts and the fact that she had stretch marks on her breasts; and that she regularly showed him her breasts and he did not need to ask her to show him her body (because she was his daughter). 

105The trial judge, who had the advantage of seeing both the complainant and the appellant give evidence, said in the course of his remarks on sentence that the appellant had been ""exposed in the course of the trial on a number of occasions as being untruthful"" (there, in the course of accepting without hesitation the wife's evidence of events) and that he suffered a ""lack of credibility in his explanation to interviewing police"".
106In relation to count 16 (the possession of child pornography not relating to images of the complainant), there was admitted in evidence without objection the pornographic images of the complainant (as tendency evidence). 

107The trial judge considered it not surprising that the appellant's explanation as to the explicit pornographic images of the complainant (that they must have been taken by his son or his son's friends) was rejected by the jury.

108It is submitted that in those circumstances, even if the recorded conversation was wrongly admitted, or the trial judge failed to give the proper direction in relation to that evidence, it cannot be said that the appellant lost a real chance of being acquitted or that there was a substantial miscarriage of justice.

109The appellant contends that the evidence of the complainant's sister and friend was not cogent evidence in support of the complainant (the former, because she said that she was ""not sure"" when asked if the incident she had seen could have been ""an accidental sort of touching""; the latter, because of her answer that she had seen the appellant touch the complainant's breast some 500 or 600 times). The appellant's submission was therefore that this case remained a case of the kind considered in Christian, where the case was almost entirely confined to the evidence of the complainant. 

110The jury had the benefit, which this Court does not have, of seeing not only the complainant but also those supporting her version of events give evidence; as well as the advantage of seeing the appellant give evidence. The recorded conversation was relevant in corroborating the complainant's evidence but there was ample corroboration elsewhere of that evidence. It was also relevant in putting the lie to the appellant's claim that he was being blackmailed to take the photographs that he admitted taking but this was a far-fetched explanation in any event. Some of the voicemail messages left on the wife's answering machine (to which there was no objection) support the view that the appellant's claim of extortion was not credible. Further, the recorded conversation could not have been used to convict in relation to count 16 and had limited if any relevance to the indecent touching counts.

111Having read the transcript of proceedings and the material put before this Court on appeal, I am satisfied that even if (contrary to the conclusion I have reached) the recorded conversation should have been excluded or that there should have been a specific anti-tendency or other direction as to the use of the recorded conversation, the appellant was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of each of the offences on which the jury found him guilty and therefore there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice and the appellant has not lost a real chance of acquittal. 

Conclusion

112The appeal should be dismissed.

113HARRISON J: I agree with Ward JA.

114R A HULME J: I agree with Ward JA.

		14 March 2014",2014-03-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705407,R v Wei [2014] NSWDC 33,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: As Mr Jones, who appears for the offender Vincent Lim Chee Wei, recognises, the Courts deal with quite a few offences of the type I am about to describe. It seems now relatively commonplace for uneducated Asians illegally in Australia to be approached by those involved in what must be fairly large scale cannabis supply, to look after their hydroponic cannabis growing operations.

2In this case police went to a four bedroom house in Epping on Thursday 18 July 2013. They had spent the previous two days watching those premises and observed the offender coming and going. Once they got inside after knocking at the door and receiving no response, they saw a number of things. In particular they found that the entirety of the premises, except for the rear living room and kitchen, were devoted to the growing of cannabis plants. The other thing of importance they found was the offender lying on a single bed in the rear living room. He was arrested and taken to the police station where he was later interviewed.

3Police located 135 growing cannabis plants, 78 lamp shades, 151 light globes and 82 transformers. This was a significantly large scale operation. They also found a number of bags containing what proved to be cannabis leaf; 833.9 grams in fact. Not surprisingly it was discovered that the electricity metre had been bypassed.

4The supply of that cannabis and the unauthorised use of the electricity are charges on a Form 1 which I will take into account when sentencing the offender for the charge to which he pleaded guilty in the Local Court, cultivating by enhanced indoor means more than the commercial quantity of cannabis plants. That is an offence carrying a maximum penalty of fifteen years imprisonment. It does not have a standard non-parole period attached to it.

5I mentioned before that the offender was interviewed by police. He told police that he had lived at the premises for several weeks and his job was to water the plants every morning and to mix fertiliser into the water. He said that he was paid $200 a week for this work and had been promised a ticket to Malaysia at the end of the operation. He told police that he had received between $600 and $800 for his work which would suggest, if accurate, that he had been committing this offence for something in the order of three to four weeks.

6I will sentence the offender on the basis that his involvement was as he described to the police. There is no evidence that he was any higher up the drug cultivation and supply operation. There is no evidence that he was involved in setting up the premises. He appears to have been simply a labourer who looked after the plants and received money and the promise of an air ticket in return.

7The offender was born and raised in Malaysia. He told the author of pre-sentence report that he has family in Malaysia, and that he came to Australia on two occasions. On the first he was deported. When he got back to Malaysia he changed his name and came again arriving in April 2012. He worked for someone whom he had worked for when he was in Australia on the first occasion, before being deported, for a few months before leaving that employment in order to look after the cannabis the subject of this charge.

8The pre-sentence report includes this, 

""He was reticent to discuss information regarding how he knew any other people involved in the cultivation of the cannabis"". 


9The offender appears willing to take the blame for his misconduct without assisting the authorities to identify anyone else involved. He, of course, is not to be punished for this but questions of remorse have to be examined in the light of the attitude expressed by the offender. There is no real evidence of remorse. The plea of guilty was recognition of the inevitable; he was found sleeping in the premises. There is no evidence that he regrets his actions apart of course from being disappointed at being arrested and sent to gaol.

10The offender went into this clearly with his eyes wide open. He was fully aware of the illegal nature of his actions but went ahead anyway because of financial rewards it would bring him.

11He will be serving his sentence of imprisonment, it being conceded that fulltime custody is required, in Australia where he has no family and friends. The use to which this circumstance can be put as a mitigating factor is limited given that it was the offender's decision to commit this offence knowing full well that if he was detected his sentence would be served in a foreign country. Also whilst he has not received any visits in custody he does maintain regular telephone contact with family back in Malaysia. 

12His time in custody will be harder than would ordinarily be the case because of what was said to be his poor English skills; he is assisted by an interpreter in Court today.

13 He has no prior convictions and was clearly used by cleverer people to do the work which carried the risk of detection. He took the risk that he would be found out by police. Others used him so that they could go undetected. 

14Mr Jones says that there are special circumstances. He spoke about two things; that this was the offender's first time in custody and that he had been unable to access rehabilitative programs whilst in custody. If it ever was a special circumstance, authority has recently made it clear that going to gaol for the first time does not necessarily mean that there are special circumstances and it is to be expected that once he becomes a sentenced prisoner access to courses involving rehabilitation and the like will be made easier for him. On the other hand his poor English skills will be an impediment in that regard. I will make a finding of special circumstances but there will only be a relatively small adjustment from the statutory ratio.

15 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years to date from 18 July 2013 and a head sentence of three and a half years. The non-parole period will expire on 17 July 2015 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.
