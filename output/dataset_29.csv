Appellant;

and

Her Majesty The
Queen (Defendant) Respondent.

1962: March 13, 14, 26.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Forgery—Forged endorsement of
cheque—Intent to prejudice—Defence of authorization—Admissibility of
evidence—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 309(1)(a).

The accused, a solicitor, acted for
Mrs. F in an expropriation proceeding and for that purpose retained the
services of O, a real estate consultant. O submitted an account of $300 to the
accused who forwarded it to Mrs. F. The latter caused her daughter to
deliver to the accused a cheque payable to O in that amount. The accused
endorsed the name of O on the back of the cheque and cashed it. A letter from
Mrs. F, dated some months later, addressed to O, in which she expressed
her surprise to learn that he had not been paid by the accused, was admitted in
evidence. Subsequent to this letter the accused sent his cheque to O, but it
was not honoured. Mrs. F testified, in cross-examination, that her
daughter had reported to her some two weeks after the delivery of the cheque
that she had told the accused at that time that he was free to do as he wished
with the cheque.

[Page 477]

The defence was that the accused was
authorized to endorse the cheque and that O was eventually paid at a later
date. The accused was convicted of forgery, and his appeal was dismissed. He
was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held (Cartwright
and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Taschereau,
Fauteux and Judson JJ.: There was no admissible evidence in the record to
support the defence of authorization and the facts indicated that that defence
was ill‑founded and was an afterthought. Even if the hearsay evidence
given by Mrs. F concerning the authorization to deal with the cheque was
properly before the jury, it provided no answer to the charge. Nothing that
went on between the accused and Mrs. F’s daughter could authorize the
accused to sign O’s name on the back of the cheque. When the accused signed O’s
name as endorser, he did so to the prejudice of O and the offence was proved.
The accused made a false document knowing it to be false with the intent that it
should be acted upon as genuine to the prejudice of O. It made no difference
that O was eventually paid and that if things had been done another way the
accused might have had a defence. Nor did it matter that when this cheque was
in the accused’s hands with instructions for delivery countermanded, if they
were, O could not have successfully sued for its delivery.

Per Taschereau
and Fauteux JJ.: The only material in the record to support the defence of
authorization was that conversation between Mrs. F and her daughter and
that evidence was inadmissible as hearsay evidence. The fact that there was no
objection to it was entirely immaterial, because the absence of objection did
not give it any probative value. There was consequently no evidence whatever in
the record to support this alleged defence. It could not be said that the
accused, in the circumstances of this case, could honestly have thought that
the admission of that hearsay evidence made it unnecessary for him to testify
or to call Mrs. F’s daughter to give evidence. As to the letter by
Mrs. F to O, it was inadmissible. However, it became immaterial as it
could not be held to contradict a fact which was not proved.

Per Cartwright
and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: The trial judge improperly admitted in evidence
the letter from Mrs. F to O and this resulted in a substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice.

This appeal should be dealt with on the basis
that the hearsay evidence given by Mrs. F concerning the accused’s
authority to deal with the cheque was properly before the jury. That evidence
was put in without objection and was treated by the trial judge and by both
counsel at the trial as being properly before the jury. Had it not been so
treated it was possible that the daughter would have been called as a witness
and that the accused would have given evidence. It was open to the jury on that
evidence to find that Mrs. F had in fact given the accused authority to
cash the cheque or to deal with it as he saw fit, and that on that view it was
open to them to find that an intent to prejudice O had not been established;
and that was the real defence which the trial judge failed to put to the jury.
But the inadmissible letter of Mrs. F, which was objected to by defence
counsel, would almost certainly prevent the jury from taking that view of the
evidence.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], affirming the
conviction of the accused on a charge of forgery. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright
and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.

E.P. Hartt, for the appellant.

John J. Freeman, for the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. was
delivered by

FAUTEUX J.:—I agree with my brother Judson and
only wish to express my views as to one particular aspect which, with
deference, is fatal to this appeal.

The defence raised by the appellant is that
Mrs. Finlay expressly authorized him to deal as he saw fit with the cheque
made by her to the order of Outram. The only material in the record that can
possibly be referred to, in an attempt to support the fact that such authority
was ever given to or received by appellant, is that part of Mrs. Finlay’s
testimony where, in cross‑examination by counsel for the accused, she
relates a conversation she had with her daughter Mary some two weeks after
remittance of this cheque by the latter to the appellant:

Q. Would you tell his honour and the
gentlemen of the jury what that conversation was.

A. She came home and she said that Fred
needed money, and she said: “Mother, I told him to go ahead and cash the
cheque. Is that all right?”, and I said: “I guess it is” because we owed him
money too.

Admittedly such evidence is inadmissible as
hearsay evidence. The fact that there was no objection to it is entirely
immaterial: Schmidt v. The King[2]. The
absence of objection does not give this hearsay evidence any probative value.
This part of Mrs. Finlay’s testimony is no evidence of the truth of what
her daughter told her and a fortiori of what her daughter reported as
having been told by appellant. There is consequently no evidence whatever in
the record to support this alleged defence advanced on behalf of appellant.

It is said, however, that this inadmissible
evidence having been admitted and dealt with at trial as if it were admissible,
the accused, for that reason, may well have honestly

[Page 479]

considered that there was no need for him to
testify or call Mrs. Finlay’s daughter to give evidence supporting this
alleged defence of authorization. Assuming that such an argument could be put
forward in a proper case, in my opinion, it cannot be said that the accused
could honestly have thought that the admission of that hearsay evidence made it
unnecessary for him to testify or to call Mrs. Finlay’s daughter to give
evidence. For, at the close of the case for the prosecution, the record
contained evidence elicited by cross-examination of Mrs. Finlay by his own
counsel, which clearly indicated that she never gave such an authorization. The
evidence shows that after several attempts to obtain payment of his account,
Outram received this letter dated July 13, 1959, from the appellant:

FREDERICK
JAMES COWAN

Supreme
Court and Parliamentary Agent

July 13, 1959.

Mr. A.A. Outram,

175 Rumsey Road,

Toronto, Ontario.

Re: Cora
Finlay Expropriation

Dear Sir:

I enclose herewith my cheque in the amount
of $300.00 in payment for your services in regard to the above matter.

I apologize for the delay in this matter
and I was under the impression that you had been paid.

Perhaps the mix-up was due to my change in
offices as I am unable to find the above client’s file. In any event I
apologize for any embarrassment that may have been caused to you in the above
entanglement.

Sincerely
yours,

ss/fc                                                                               Frederick
J. Cowan

Attached to this letter was a cheque for $300
dated July 10, 1959, drawn on the Toronto‑Dominion Bank in Ottawa-South,
payable to the order of A.A. Outram and signed Ronco Auto Parts Reg’d, per:
Frederick Cowan. On this cheque appeared the notation: “Re: Finlay”. Having
been endorsed and deposited by Outram, it was returned marked

[Page 480]

“Not sufficient funds”. When cross-examined on
this matter by counsel for the accused, Outram gave the following evidence:

Q. Did you telephone Mrs. Finlay and
advise her of that fact—that is, Mrs. Cora Finlay?

A. Yes, I advised her after the cheque was
returned N.S.F.

Q. In that telephone conversation you had
with her do you recollect whether or not you told her that she was dealing with
crooks, and you were going to retain your own lawyer when he came back from his
holidays?

A. I don’t remember the first part because
I think perhaps she knew it and told me, because she started telling me
immediately: “Well, I have paid him long enough ago the money to give you”, but
as nearly as I can remember I said: “I am…”—yes: “If I am not paid very soon I
will take it up with my lawyer”, who was Mr. John Arnup of Mason, Foulds,
Arnup, Walter and Weir, and I think I said I would take it up with the Bar
Association if I did not get it in due course.

Q. Your recollection is that you intimated
to her that you were going to take it up with your own solicitor?

A. Yes.

Q. But you have no recollection of saying
she was dealing with crooks?

A. No, I think she brought that point out
instead of me when she said she had given him the money long ago.

Subsequent to this testimony and again in
cross-examination by counsel for the appellant, Mrs. Finlay was referred
to this telephone conversation related by Outram and gave the following
testimony:

Q. Mrs. Finlay, Mr. Outram, a
prior witness, has testified that he made a telephone call to you after a
certain cheque forwarded to him was returned N.S.F. In that telephone call did
you refer to anybody as a crook?

A. Oh, no, I don’t think so.

This answer is a clear admission that she had
that telephone conversation with Outram and that the only part thereof which
remained open to question was whether she had referred to anybody as a crook,
to which she answered she did not think so. This telephone conversation is
evidence that Mrs. Finlay never gave the authorization contended for and,
with deference, it cannot be contended that the accused could sincerely and
honestly have thought that there was no need for him to give or call evidence
to show that he had received from Mrs. Finlay the alleged authorization.

[Page 481]

With respect to the letter written on the 7th of July 1959 by Mrs. Finlay to
Outram, wherein the former expressed to the latter her surprise to learn that
he had not been paid by Cowan, I agree that it was inadmissible. However,
holding the view that there was no evidence at all to establish that appellant
had received authority to deal with this cheque as he saw fit, this letter
became immaterial as it could not be held to contradict a fact which was not
proved.

For the reasons of my brother Judson and those
here given, I would say that there is no substance in this appeal from the
unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and that it should be dismissed.

The judgment of Taschereau and Judson JJ. was
delivered by

JUDSON J.:—The appellant was convicted of
forgery under s. 309(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code  and his
conviction was affirmed on appeal. The precise form of the count in the
indictment on which he was convicted was that he did

forge an endorsement on a certain document,
to wit, a cheque drawn on the Royal Bank of Canada, Perth Ontario Branch, dated
Perth, January 23rd, 1959, to the order of A.A. Outram, for $300.00, with
intent that the same should be used or acted upon as genuine, to the prejudice
of the said A.A. Outram, contrary to Section 310(1)  of the Criminal Code .

The defence was that the Crown failed to prove
that the accused had the necessary intent required by s. 309(1) (a) of
the Code, which reads:

309. (1) Every one commits forgery who
makes a false document, knowing it to be false, with intent

(a) that it should in any way be
used or acted upon as genuine, to the prejudice of any one whether within
Canada or not.

Cowan was a solicitor practising in the City of Ottawa. He acted for Mrs. Finlay in an
expropriation proceeding and for that purpose retained the services of one
Outram as an expert witness. On completion of his work, Outram sent to Cowan
his account for $300. Mrs. Finlay then drew a cheque payable to Outram for
$300 for payment of this account. She had her daughter take the cheque to
Cowan’s office. Cowan signed Outram’s name on the back of the cheque and
obtained cash from the Plaza Hotel. The hotel endorsed the cheque and it was
duly paid by the bank on which it was drawn.

[Page 482]

The defence is founded on the fact that
Mrs. Finlay was in some doubt between Outram and Cowan as the proper payee
of the cheque; that her daughter had reported to her, some time after the
delivery of the cheque to Cowan, that she had told Cowan, at the time of
delivery, that he was free to do as he wished with it. Mrs. Finlay
acquiesced in what her daughter had done because she owed Cowan money for his
account, not yet rendered, in the expropriation proceedings.

This evidence came out in a very peculiar way.
Neither Cowan nor the daughter gave evidence and therefore there was no
admissible evidence that any such conversation ever took place between the
daughter and Cowan. The trial judge might well have ruled out this evidence of
the mother. It is indeed very doubtful whether any such authority was given to
Cowan, for many months later when Mrs. Finlay received a letter from
Outram stating that his bill still remained unpaid, she replied that she
thought it had already been paid and that she had sent a cheque to
Mr. Cowan a long time ago. This indicates that the defence of an
authorization was ill-founded and was an afterthought. Why would
Mrs. Finlay say that she had sent a cheque to Cowan to pay this bill if
she had authorized Cowan to use the cheque for his own purposes? But this
letter from Mrs. Finlay to Outram was also inadmissible.

I would, however, deal with this appeal on the
basis that the hearsay evidence given by Mrs. Finlay concerning Cowan’s
authority to deal with the cheque was properly before the jury. In my opinion
it provides no answer to the charge. There was an existing indebtedness between
Mrs. Finlay and Outram and the cheque, in the first place, was given to
pay that indebtedness. As it was issued this cheque could only be negotiated by
Outram and it was not so negotiated. Nothing that went on between Cowan and
Mrs. Finlay’s daughter could authorize Cowan to sign Outram’s name on the
back of the cheque. If the cheque was to be used at all in the form in which it
was drawn, there could be only one endorser, namely, Outram. When Cowan signed
Outram’s name as endorser, he did it to the prejudice of Outram and the offence
is proved. Cowan made a false document knowing it to be false with the intent that
it should be acted upon as genuine to the prejudice of Outram. If there was
error in the direction of the learned trial judge to

[Page 483]

the jury on this point, it was error in favour
of Cowan when he told the jury that if Cowan had reasonable grounds to believe
that he was authorized to act as he did, then they must acquit. The proper
instruction would have been that there was no evidence before the jury that
Cowan had any ground for belief that he was authorized to deal with the cheque
as he actually did, that this authority could not come from Mrs. Finlay,
and that it was quite clear that it did not come from Outram.

It makes no difference that Outram was
eventually paid and that if things had been done another way Cowan might have
had a defence. If, in fact, Mrs. Finlay’s instructions to deliver the
cheque to Outram were countermanded and Cowan was authorized to deal with the
cheque as he chose, he might have inserted his own name as payee and crossed
out Outram’s name or he might have made the cheque payable to bearer or he
might have destroyed it.

Nor does it matter that when this cheque was in
Cowan’s hands with instructions for delivery countermanded, if they ever were,
Outram could not have successfully sued for delivery of the cheque. This cheque
was an unconditional order in writing drawn by Mrs. Finlay and addressed
to the bank to pay to the order of Outram, who was her creditor. It was not
made payable to a fictitious or non-existing person. In the form in which it
was drawn it could only be endorsed by Outram. Outranks signature was endorsed
by Cowan and this act, as the Court of Appeal has held, was to the prejudice of
Outram.

The appeal should be dismissed.

The judgment of Cartwright and Ritchie JJ. was
delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—The facts out
of which this appeal arises are stated in the reasons of my brother Judson
which I have had the advantage of reading. I think it desirable, however, to
set out the words in which Mrs. Finlay related the circumstances
surrounding the drawing of the cheque and its delivery to the appellant.

Mrs. Finlay was called by the Crown. In her
examination in chief, she stated that her daughter Mary was present when she
drew and signed the cheque, that she had not

[Page 484]

received a bill from Cowan for his services but
understood his charges would be in the neighbourhood of $500. Her evidence in
chief continues as follows:

The WITNESS: I didn’t really owe
Mr. Outram money. It was Mr. Cowan. Mr. Outram never really
billed me, but we owed him money, and I had a little discussion with my
daughter as to who I should make the cheque out to, and she said: “Mother, we
owe both of them money”, and she said: “Make it out to Mr. Outram, and if
Fred wants it he can have it”. He had a power of attorney.

* * *

Q. Coming back to the cheque in question,
Mrs. Finlay, the name “A.A. Outram” is written very legibly on this
cheque. When you made it out to whom did you make it out at that time on
January 23, 1959?

A. I made it out to that name;
Mr. Outram.

Q. Then what did you do with the cheque?

A. I gave it to my daughter and she brought
it into Ottawa.

Q. Did you give her certain instructions
when you gave it to her?

A. I said: “Give that to Mr. Cowan,
and he will do with it as he sees fit”.

Q. As he sees fit?

A. Yes.

* * *

In cross-examination, Mrs. Finlay gave the
following evidence:

Q. And to make it abundantly clear,
Mrs. Finlay, in the first instance you would have had no objection at all
to making the cheque for $300, Exhibit No. 5, payable to Mr. Cowan, or to
Mr. Cowan using it?

A. No; how could I have?

Q. Because you owed him money?

A. Yes, because I owed him money.

Q. And in the second instance, even though
you made the cheque payable to A.A. Outram, and it was given to Mary to
give to Mr. Cowan, you had no objection, and still have no objection, to
Mr. Cowan’s having negotiated it by putting down Mr. Outram’s name?

A. No, neither has Mr. Outram.

Q. You were not done out of it, and
Mr. Outram has been paid?

A. That is right. I cannot see the point of
it.

* * *

Q. You told us that about two weeks later
Mary came back to Perth?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you have a conversation with her
over this cheque, Exhibit No. 5?

A. Yes.

Q. Would you tell his honour and the
gentlemen of the jury what that conversation was?

[Page 485]

A. She came home and she said that Fred
needed the money, and she said: “Mother, I told him to go ahead and cash the
cheque. Is that all right”?, and I said: “I guess it is” because we owed him
money too.

Q. That was the conversation?

A. Yes.

Q. So two or three weeks after you gave the
cheque to Mary you knew Mr. Cowan had gone ahead and cashed the cheque?

A. That is correct.

Q. Did Mary look after most of your
business interests in Ottawa?

A. Yes, she did.

Q. And did she have general authority to
look after your business interests in Ottawa?

A. Yes.

Q. And as far as you were concerned did
Mary have the authority to authorize Mr. Cowan to negotiate the cheque?

A. Well, as I told her so I guess she had.

While some of this evidence may have been
admissible to prove the extent of the authority which Mrs. Finlay had
given to her daughter, Mary, it was not admissible to prove the conversation
between Mary and Cowan alleged to have taken place at the time the cheque was
delivered to him. However, in the peculiar circumstances of this case, I think
that we should deal with this appeal on the basis, set out in the reasons of my
brother Judson, that the hearsay evidence given by Mrs. Finlay concerning
Cowan’s authority to deal with the cheque was properly before the jury.

I reach this conclusion for the following
reasons. Mrs. Finlay’s evidence quoted above was put in without objection
and was treated by the learned trial judge and by both counsel at the trial as
being properly before the jury. Had it not been so treated it is possible that
the defence would have called Mary as a witness and that the appellant would
have given evidence. It would be contrary to the manner in which the trials of
criminal cases are conducted to tacitly treat evidence favourable to an accused
as being properly before the court and later to reject it after the opportunity
to supply admissible evidence of the same facts has passed.

On the other hand, the admission of the letter
dated July 7, 1959, written by
Mrs. Finlay to Outram was objected to by defence counsel and, after some
discussion in the absence of the jury, was admitted notwithstanding his
objection.

[Page 486]

In my view, it was open to the jury on the
evidence quoted above to find that when, through the agency of her daughter,
Mrs. Finlay handed the cheque to Cowan she, through the same agency, not
only refrained from instructing him to deliver it to Outram but expressly
authorized him to cash it or deal with it in such other manner as he saw fit.

Of course such an authorization given by the
drawer of the cheque would not have given Cowan the right to sign the name of
Outram as endorser but it would have given him the right to make the cheque
payable to bearer and to cash it, or the right to destroy it or to return it to
Mrs. Finlay and ask her to send him another cheque payable to himself. On
the suggested view of the facts, which it was open to the jury to take, Outram
had no property interest in the cheque and no right to require Cowan to deliver
it to him. He was no more delayed or prejudiced in fact by Cowan having
endorsed his name than he would have been if Cowan had adopted any of the other
permissible courses suggested above.

With the greatest respect, it appears to me that
the learned trial judge failed to put the real theory of the defence adequately
to the jury. The case was put to them as if the main question was whether Cowan
believed on reasonable grounds that he had the right to endorse Outram’s name
on the cheque, whereas the theory of the defence was that although Cowan, of course,
had no right to sign Outram’s name and did in fact sign it, he did so without
any intent to prejudice Outram.

I have already expressed my opinion that it was
open to the jury on the evidence to find that Mrs. Finlay had in fact
given Cowan authority to cash the cheque or to deal with it as he saw fit and
that on that view it was open to them to find that an intent to prejudice
Outram had not been established; but the inadmissible letter of
Mrs. Finlay of July 7, 1959, would almost certainly prevent the jury
taking the view of the evidence which I have just suggested.

The Court of Appeal rightly held that the letter
was clearly inadmissible but concluded that its admission did not result in any
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. With respect, I cannot share that
view. The letter would tend to make the jury reject the only view of the
evidence upon which the appellant might have been acquitted.

[Page 487]

I do not intend to suggest that the jury should
have drawn from the evidence the view of the facts favourable to the appellant
which I have outlined above but it was open to them to do so, and they may have
regarded the inadmissible letter as decisive against this view.

I find it necessary to base my judgment on only
one of the grounds on which leave to appeal was granted, that is ground number
5 which reads:

That the Learned Trial Judge erred in
directing the Jury that they were entitled to rely on the truth of the contents
of Exhibit 10 (the letter of July 7, 1959) when in fact it was not properly in
evidence at the trial for that or any other purpose.

For the above reasons, I would allow the appeal
and quash the conviction. As it is the view of the majority of the Court that
the appeal fails nothing would be gained by considering what further order
should have been made had the appeal succeeded.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Stealing from the mail—Decoy
letter—Post Office investigators inserting money in decoy letter—Employee
stealing same—Verdict of ordinary theft substituted by Court of Appeal—Whether
letters “sent by post”—Whether intention of sender a determining
factor—Activities conducted under direction of Postmaster General—Criminal
Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 298(1)(a).

Appeals—Leave to appeal to Supreme Court of
Canada—Question of law—No dissent—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 597,
as amended by 1960-61, c. 43, s. 27 .

In order to secure evidence against the
accused, a post office mail sorter suspected of stealing from mail passing
through her hands, the post office investigators prepared three decoy letters
in which they placed some money and which, after being addressed, stamped and
the stamps cancelled, were put in a tray with other letters for the accused to
sort. Subsequently the three letters were discovered to have been opened and
the accused was found in possession of the money. She was convicted of stealing
“anything sent by post, after it is deposited at a post office and before it is
delivered” contrary to s. 298(1)  (a) (i) of the Criminal Code . The
Court of Appeal substituted a conviction of simple theft and varied the
sentence. The Crown appealed to this Court to have the conviction at trial
restored, and at the hearing the accused was allowed to apply for leave to
appeal against the substituted conviction.

Held (Taschereau
and Cartwright JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the conviction
for the offence as charged restored.

Per Fauteux,
Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The letters were sent through and by means of
activities conducted under the direction of the Postmaster General, and as such
were sent by post within the meaning of s. 298(1) (a). The intention of
the sender could not be a determining factor in deciding whether or not these
letters were “sent by post” within the meaning of the section, and as the
expression “post letter” has been dropped from the Criminal Code , the question
of whether or not a “post letter” is necessarily a letter “sent by post” could
not affect the interpretation to be placed on the section. It is true that the
intention was to have them taken out of the mail, but if they had been missed,
and had gone as addressed, they undoubtedly would have been sent “by post” in
the colloquial sense of these words as well as in the special meaning assigned
to them by the Post Office Act. Whether the intention to have them
removed from the post had been carried out or not could not alter the fact that
when they were opened and their contents stolen, they were passing through the
hands of a person who was then engaged in the activities of the Canada Post
Office and they were so passing because the investigator had sent them by that
route.

[Page 508]

Per Taschereau
and Cartwright JJ., dissenting: It is only after it has been established that
something has been “sent” that the question can arise whether it was “sent by
post”. In the case at bar nothing has been “sent”. Three requisites are
required to render the use of that word appropriate: (i) a sender, (ii) an
object to be sent, and (iii) a destination to which the object is to be sent.
In this case although there was an object to be sent, it would be a distortion
of the meaning of a plain English word to say that the letters were sent by
anyone or were sent anywhere.

Per Curiam: As
to the appeal against the substituted charge, it did not lie without leave
since it did not raise any question of law on which a judge of the Court of
Appeal had dissented, and leave to appeal ought not to be granted.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—The facts out
of which this appeal arises are set out in the reasons of my brother Ritchie.

I have reached the conclusion that the appeal
fails. I am in full agreement with the reasons of the majority in the Court of
Appeal1, delivered by Roach J.A. and concurred in by the learned
Chief Justice of Ontario, but, in view of the differences of opinion in the
Court of Appeal and in this Court, I propose to add a few words.

The wording of the information on which the
respondent was convicted is as follows:

that Cora Cumming on the 25th day of
January in the year 1961 at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, in the
County of York, unlawfully did steal the contents of three letters, to wit:
three one dollar bills, the property of the Post Master General of Canada, the
letters having been sent by post, and after they had been deposited at a post
office and before they were delivered.

There is no doubt that the respondent stole the
three one dollar bills. The question is whether the letters from which she took
them had been sent by post. If they were sent by

[Page 509]

post there is no doubt that the theft occurred
before they were delivered; they were never delivered and there was no
intention that they should be.

In the case at bar the question is of importance
because if the contents of the letters were sent by post the respondent, upon
conviction, was, under s. 298(1)  of the Criminal Code , liable to
imprisonment for a maximum term of ten years and to a compulsory minimum term
of six months, whereas if they were not sent by post she was, under s. 280 (b),
liable to a maximum term of two years and no minimum term was prescribed.

The only rule of construction to which reference
need be made is that stated by Baron Parke in Perry v. Skinner[2]:

The rule by which we are to be guided in
construing Acts of Parliament is to look at the precise words, and to construe
them in their ordinary sense, unless it would lead to any absurdity or manifest
injustice; and if it should, so to vary and modify them as to avoid that which
it certainly could not have been the intention of the legislature should be
done.

The word of crucial importance in the
information and in s. 298(1)  (a) (i) is “sent”. The transitive verb
“send” of which it is the past participle is a word the plain and ordinary
meaning of which is so well known that there is no need to refer to
dictionaries, but it may be observed that the meaning given in the Concise
Oxford Dictionary is “secure conveyance of to some destination (destination
given by to or other preposition or by indirect object, or merely
implied)”. To render the use of the word appropriate there are three
requisites, (i) a sender, (ii) an object to be sent, and (iii) a destination to
which the object is to be sent. In the case at bar we have the second of these,
the contents of the three letters, but the first and the third are lacking. In
my respectful opinion, it is a distortion of the meaning of a plain English
word to say that the letters were sent by anyone or were sent anywhere. Suppose
the facts of the case were recited and the question were put: “By whom and to
what destination were the three letters sent?” Can it be doubted that the same
answer would be made by the man in the street as by the meticulous philologist:
“No one sent them anywhere; they were placed in the tray to test the honesty of
the sorter.” It is only after it has been

[Page 510]

established that something has been sent that
the question can arise whether it was sent by post; and, in the case at bar,
nothing has been sent.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Counsel for the respondent in addition to
arguing that the appeal should be dismissed sought to appeal from the judgment
of the Court of Appeal in so far as it ordered that a conviction on a charge of
theft be substituted for the conviction of an offence under s. 298(1)  (a)
(i) of the Criminal Code . On this branch of the matter I agree with my
brother Ritchie that the proposed appeal does not lie without leave and that
leave to appeal ought not to be granted.

The judgment of Fauteux, Judson and Ritchie JJ.
was delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal of Ontario[3] from which
Mr. Justice MacKay dissented, which allowed the appeal of the respondent
from a conviction for stealing the contents of three letters,

…the property of the Post Master General of
Canada, the letters having been
sent by post, and after they had been deposited at a post office and before
they were delivered…

The judgment now appealed from substituted a
conviction on “a charge of theft” and varied the sentence imposed by the
magistrate from a period of six months to one of three months’ imprisonment.

The evidence, which is uncontradicted, discloses
that the respondent was on duty in her capacity as a sorter of mail in the city
delivery branch of the Toronto Post Office on the evening of January 25, 1961,
when three envelopes bearing cancelled stamps, addressed to the Canadian
National Telegraphs and each containing some coins and a $1 bill were
introduced, on instructions from Post Office investigators, amongst other
letters placed before her for sorting. These envelopes which had been prepared
by the investigators, who had inserted the $1 bills after making a note of
their serial numbers, were taken to the supervisor of the sortation unit in
which the respondent worked by investigator Allen who gave certain instructions
as a result of which the supervisor placed the envelopes in a tray of ordinary

[Page 511]

mail to be sorted and then saw to it that this
tray was placed in front of the respondent who was kept under supervision while
she sorted it, after which it was taken directly to the supervisor’s office
where the same investigator, Allen, extracted the three envelopes and found
that they had been opened and the $1 bills removed. The bills were later found
in the respondent’s possession and there is no doubt that they were removed
from the envelopes by her.

It is apparent from the evidence that these
envelopes were prepared and mingled with the mail for the sole purpose of
testing the honesty of the respondent, and that the investigators did not
intend that they would ever leave the Post Office building. The only question
to be determined is whether, under these circumstances, it can be said that the
envelopes were letters “sent by post” within the meaning of s. 298(1)  of the Criminal
Code , the relevant portions of which read:

298. (1) Every one who

(a) steals

(i) anything sent by post, after it is
deposited at a post office and before it is delivered,

* *
*

is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for ten years and, where the offence is committed under
paragraph (a), to imprisonment for not less than six months.

The point at issue is stated in the factum of
the appellant in the following terms:

Whether a letter is sent by post within the
meaning of section 298(1)  (a) (i) when the sender does not intend
the letter to be delivered to the addressee and the letter is handed by the
sender to the supervisor of sorters to be placed in the course of post.

The history of legislation having to do with
theft of letters or their contents from the mails in Canada discloses that from
the enactment of the Criminal Code  in 1892 (s. 327 ) until the coming
into force of the present Criminal Code  in 1955 the offence was
described as stealing “a post letter” or “from or out of a post letter”, and
the definition of “post letter” in the Post Office Act was originally
limited to letters “to be transmitted or delivered through the post”.
Similarly, under the English Post Office Act (1837), 1 Vict., c. 36, a
“post letter” was confined to any letter or packet

[Page 512]

“transmitted by the post under the authority of
the Postmaster General”, and in the cases of Regina v. Rathbone[4] and Regina v. Shepherd[5], decoy letters employed in much the same
manner as they were in the present case were held not to be “post letters”
within the meaning of this definition because they were not introduced into the
mail in the ordinary way for transmission by post.

The definition of “post letter” in the Canadian Post
Office Act was broadened by c. 19 of the Statutes of Canada (1901) whereby
it was enacted that the expression meant, inter alia, “any letter.
deposited in any post office…whether it is intended for transmission by post or
delivery through the post or not.” It was under this statute that the Ontario
Court of Appeal decided in the case of Rex v. Ryan[6] that a decoy letter intended for the
testing of a postman’s honesty was a “post letter”.

However, when all reference to “post letter” was
omitted from the present Code, the offence became stealing “anything
sent by post after it is deposited in a post office and before it is
delivered”, and it is contended on behalf of the respondent that the expression
“sent by post” as used in this context cannot apply to the envelopes in
question on the ground that, like the letters in Regina v. Rathbone, supra, and
Regina v. Shepherd, supra, they were not introduced into the Post Office
in the ordinary way for the purpose of transmission by post.

This latter reasoning appears to me to leave out
of account the definitions of “send by post” and “Canada Post Office” which
were introduced in to the Post Office Act by c. 57 of the Statutes of
Canada (1951) and which control the meaning of the words “sent by post” as used
in s. 298(1)  of the Criminal Code  (see s. 3(5)  of the Criminal Code ).
Subsection 2(1) (o) and 2(1) (a) of the Post Office Act now
read as follows:

2. (1) (o) “send by post” or
“transmit by post” means to send by, through or by means of the Canada Post
Office;

2. (1) (a) “Canada Post Office”
means the activities conducted under the direction and control of the
Postmaster General;

[Page 513]

It is to be noted that under the Post Office
Act the Postmaster General is required to operate, and empowered to regulate
the operation of, a “post office” which term includes, inter alia, any
room or building for “sortation, handling or despatch of mail” (see ss. 5(1)(a),
6(h) and 2(1) (i) of the Post Office Act).

The basis of the judgment of the Court of Appeal
in respect of the question here at issue appears to me to be epitomized in the
following paragraph of the decision rendered by Roach J.A. on behalf of
the majority of that Court:

I can say at once also that, in my
respectful opinion, while every letter that is “sent by post” is a “post
letter”, the converse is not true, that is to say, every post letter is not
necessarily a letter “sent by post”. In my respectful opinion, a letter is
“sent by post” when the sender deposits it in a “post office” as defined in
sec. 2(1) (i) of the Post Office Act, with the intention that it shall be
conveyed or transported by means of the Canada Post Office to the person to
whom it is being sent. It is not “sent by post” when, as here, it is placed
somewhere in the post office by a post office official under such circumstances
that he has it in his power and intends to intercept it so that it shall not be
delivered to the person to whom it is addressed. In those circumstances it
seems clear to me that the letter is not being sent to anyone; it is being
retained under the control of the person who deposited it. In the instant case,
the investigators did not send these three letters to the Canadian National
Telegraph Company. They were decoy letters which they pretended had been “sent
by post”. If they had been “sent by post” within the meaning of the Act the
inspectors would have had no right to interfere with or prevent their
transmission; Section 41 Post Office Act. The fact that they did retrieve
them shows that they did not regard them as being in the course of post, that
is “sent by post”.

With the greatest respect, I am unable to adopt
the view that the intention of the sender can be a determining factor in
deciding whether or not these envelopes were “sent by post” within the meaning of
s. 298(1)  (a), and as the expression “post letter” had been dropped from
the Criminal Code  I do not think that the question of whether or not a
“post letter” is necessarily a letter “sent by post” can affect the
interpretation to be placed on that section.

Speaking of the envelopes in question, one of
the Post Office investigators, in the course of his evidence, after having
agreed that the intention was to have them taken out of the mail in any event,
went on to say, “but if they had missed them, they would go as addressed.” If
these envelopes had been “missed” and had gone “as addressed”, it appears to me
that they would undoubtedly have been

[Page 514]

sent “by post” in the colloquial sense of these
words as well as in the special meaning assigned to them by the Post Office
Act irrespective of the fact that the sender had never intended the
addressee to receive them. I am unable to see how the fact that they were not
“missed” can change their character in this regard.

These envelopes were sent by a Post Office
investigator through a sortation unit of the Toronto Post Office for the
purpose of testing the honesty of one of the sorters, and whether his intention
to have them removed from the post before they reached the addressee had been
carried out or not could not alter the fact that when they were opened and
their contents stolen they were passing through the hands of a person who was
then engaged in the activities of the Canada Post Office and that they were so
passing because the investigator had sent them by that route. In my opinion,
therefore, the envelopes were sent through and by means of activities conducted
under the direction of the Postmaster General, and as such they were sent by
post within the meaning of s. 298(1)  (a).

The respondent also entered an appeal which
raised questions based on the contention that there was no evidence that the
envelopes in question were “the property of the Postmaster General of Canada”
from whom the Information alleges that they were stolen. In my opinion, however,
the appeal so entered must be quashed as it does not raise any question of law
on which a judge of the Court of Appeal has dissented (see s. 597  of the Criminal
Code ). At the hearing of this appeal counsel on behalf of the respondent
was allowed to apply for leave so to appeal, but there does not appear to me to
be any ground for granting that application.

For the above reasons, I would allow this appeal
and restore the conviction for the offence as charged in the Information.

ON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA

Criminal law—Conspiracy to limit facilities
for transporting articles—Conspiracy to prevent or lessen competition in the
transportation of articles—Amendment to indictment—Combines Investigation Act,
R.S.C. 1952, c. 314, as amended by 1960 (Can.), c. 45, s. 13.

The appellants, who are freight forwarders,
were found guilty, after a trial before a judge of the Exchequer Court of
Canada, on each of the two following counts of an indictment laid under the Combines
Investigation Act: (1) Conspiracy to limit unduly the facilities for
transporting or dealing in articles or commodities that may be the subject of trade
or commerce, contrary to s. 32(1) (a) of the Act, and (2)
conspiracy to prevent or lessen, unduly, competition in the transportation of
articles or commodities that may be the subject of trade or commerce, contrary
to s. 32(1) (c) of the Act. The activities of the appellants as
import pool car operators consisted in effecting the consolidation of different
kinds of imported goods at west coast ports and in arranging for their
transportation by rail carriers in mixed pool cars to their destination in eastern
Canada, thus obtaining for their importer clients the advantage of the
consolidation rate for pool cars of mixed goods.

The appellants argue that they provide simply
a service unrelated to articles which are the subject of transportation or of
facilities therefor. They also contend that only physical means of transport
came within the term “facilities” in s. 32(1) (a) and that their
service operations had nothing to do with the

[Page 64]

availability of rail service for those who
required it. In this Court neither the fact of conspiracy nor the element of
undueness is contested.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed and the conviction on both counts affirmed.

As to the second count, the accused were
clearly within s. 32(1)(c) of the Act in preventing or lessening
unduly “competition in the transportation” of the imported articles by rail.
This provision is not limited in its application to persons who are themselves
in the transportation business or who control means of transportation. It
extends to those who are in a position to use or command transportation
services for the carriage of goods in transit.

As to the first count, the operations of the
accused, to which the rail carriage was integral, are comprehended by the term
“facilities for transporting” goods. The physical means of transport were
intimately involved and were enough to bring the accused within the bite of the
statute. It cannot be said therefore that there were no physical means of
transportation involved in the operations of the accused.

APPEAL from a judgment of Gibson J. of the
Exchequer Court of Canada[1],
convicting the appellants on an indictment laid under the Combines
Investigation Act. Appeal dismissed.

Raymond Lette, Q.C., and J. Rousseau, for
the first two appellants.

J.G. Alley, for the other appellant.

S.F. Sommerfeld, Q.C., and D.Q.
Patterson, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LASKIN J.—The three appellants before this Court
are freight forwarders who were found guilty, after a trial before Gibson J. of
the Exchequer Court of Canada1, on each of two counts of an indictment laid
under paras, (a) and (c) respectively of s. 32(1) of the Combines
Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 314, as amended by 1960, c. 45,
s. 13.

[Page 65]

The indictment (which also included two other
firms from whose acquittal there is no appeal) charged two illegal conspiracies
in the following words:

(1) … to limit unduly the facilities for
transporting or dealing in articles or commodities that may be the subject of
trade or commerce, to wit, articles or commodities, imported from designated
areas in the orient into the Province of British Columbia and transported by
railway in railway cars, the railway cars each ordinarily containing a pool
shipment of two or more different kinds of the said articles or commodities, at
east bound import freight rates, to points in Canada, east of the
Manitoba-Ontario boundary, to the City of Toronto and elsewhere in the Province
of Ontario and to the City of Montreal and elsewhere in the Province of Quebec
and did thereby commit an indictable offence contrary to section 32(1) (a)
of the Combines Investigation Act.

(2) … to prevent, or lessen, unduly,
competition in the transportation of articles or commodities that may be the
subject of trade or commerce, to wit, articles or commodities imported from
designated areas in the orient into the Province of British Columbia and
transported by railway in railway cars, the railway cars each ordinarily
containing a pool shipment of two or more different kinds of the said articles
or commodities at east bound import freight rates, to points in Canada, east of
the Manitoba-Ontario boundary, to the City of Toronto, and elsewhere in the
Province of Ontario, and to the City of Montreal and elsewhere in the Province
of Quebec and did thereby commit an indictable offence contrary to
section 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act.

Admissions were made by the Crown as well as by
the accused, pursuant to s. 562  of the Criminal Code . Among those
made by the accused were the following:

1. That during the period described in the
Indictment eighty (80%) per cent—ninety-five (95%) percent of all import pool
car traffic coming within the terms of Canadian Freight Association tariffs
70A, 70B and 70C was carried by the Canadian National Railway and the Canadian
Pacific Railway.

2. That during the period described in the
Indictment approximately eighty-five (85%) percent of all import pool car
traffic referred to in Paragraph 1

[Page 66]

was handled by the accused corporations, but the
portion of the traffic handled by the defendant, Johnston Terminals Limited,
was less than three (3%) to five (5%) percent of the total traffic handled by
the accused corporations.

Counsel for the accused characterized these as
“a straight market admission”, and as designed to support a defence to the
charges that the market specified in the indictment was too narrow. After all
the evidence was in, and, indeed, after counsel for the accused had addressed
the Court, Crown counsel successfully moved to amend the indictment to
introduce the words “which could be” after the words “the Province of British
Columbia and” and before the words “transported by railway” in each count of
the indictment. Objection was taken to the proposed amendment as going to
destroy a defence at a time when other evidence to meet the amendment could no
longer be introduced. Alternatively, it was contended that as a term of
allowing the amendment the accused should be allowed to withdraw the admissions
previously quoted. These contentions were rejected on the ground that there was
no prejudice to the accused.

The propriety of allowing the amendment was one
of the grounds of appeal. Although conceding that the matter was within the
trial judge’s discretion, counsel for the accused submitted that it was
unfairly, that is, not judicially, exercised. This Court did not deem it
necessary to hear Crown counsel on the point, being of the view unanimously
that not only was the trial judge entitled in the circumstances to allow the amendment,
but also that on the merits of the market factor the evidence that was
addressed to the charges as originally laid would not have raised a successful
defence on that issue.

The nub of this appeal is whether the impugned
activities of the accused relate merely to services or to work and labour,
unconnected with “facilities for transporting any article” or with “competition
in the transportation of an article”. Neither the fact of conspiracy nor the
element of undueness is contested; and, apart from the rejected argument on the
amendment of the indictment, there is no issue here on the relevant

[Page 67]

market, either as to the range of imported goods
or as to their source or destination.

The activities of the accused as import pool car
operators, around which their conspiracy developed, became possible with the
amendment of Eastbound Import Tariff 70A, effective July 1, 1955. (Subsequent
amendments through Tariffs 70B and 70C need no elaboration because they did not
alter the situation brought about by the amendment to Tariff 70A.) The tariffs
mentioned covered a wide range of goods imported from countries in the Orient
and brought by ship to west coast ports, and thence carried by rail to points
in Canada east of the Manitoba-Ontario border. Substantially, the importers
were Toronto and Montreal business firms who had their imported goods shipped
to the port of Vancouver.

Prior to the amendment of Tariff 70A in 1955,
these importers could not mix different goods for rail carriage in a single car
in order to get a carload rate; they had to endure the higher less than carload
rate, unless they had a sufficient quantity of the same goods to make up a full
carload of at least 30,000 pounds. As a result of the amendment (and I need not
expatiate on its competitive feature, as against water and truck
transportation, to attract eastern Canada consignees), consolidation of
different kinds of imported goods into carload lots at carload rates became
permissible. The rail carriers themselves, the Canadian National Railways and
the Canadian Pacific Railway, were precluded by a promulgated rule from
themselves effecting a consolidation of goods into a mixed pool car, but would
do so on proper authorization of importers or their agents. In this respect
their services included (1) sorting the goods to be consolidated after they
were unloaded from the ship; (2) loading the goods into the pool car or cars;
and (3) carrying them to their destination, Toronto or Montreal, where they
would be collected by the consignees.

[Page 68]

Since the rail carriers (apparently to avoid the
possibility of discrimination or of charges thereof) could not do the mixing to
make up a carload of goods, eastern Canada importers had the choice of either
banding together to get the advantage of the pool car consolidation rate (which
would mean, in any event, having some representatives at least at Vancouver if
not also in Toronto or Montreal) or of using freight forwarders such as the
accused. The latter, indeed, actively pursued this business and it was admitted
that over 80 per cent of the import pool car traffic during the period January
1, 1956 to August 1, 1966, specified in the indictment, was handled by the
accused, and that not more than 20 per cent of the goods imported from the
Orient and covered by Tariffs 70A, 70B and 70C was carried by truck transport
during this period.

The freight forwarders operated by obtaining
general authorizations from the importers, addressed to shipping line agents,
to secure release of goods consigned to the importers at Vancouver. By an
examination of the ship manifest, the cargo of the authorizing importers was
identified, and thereafter so-called rider sheets, describing the goods, were
made up for presentation to the rail carrier with instructions thereon as to
car loading. The rail carrier, as already noted, did the sorting and loading,
but only according to these directions. The freight forwarder paid the rail
carrier the applicable carriage rate, and, of course, its bill to its importer
clients included these payments in the composite charge for its services. This
overall charge was not a regulated one.

It is, of course, the case that the accused
freight forwarders neither own the imported goods nor have any beneficial
interest in them, nor do they ever come into possession of them. They are not
consignees of the goods but they do control their movement from shipside, at
least so long as their authorizations from importer clients remain in effect.
Again, they own no physical means of transportation and have no control over
the rail carriers, save as rail carrier services are by law available to and
must be provided for those who wish to use them.

On the foregoing facts, the accused mount the
argument that they provide simply a service un-

[Page 69]

related to articles which are the subject of
transportation or of facilities therefor, and that they can no more be found
guilty than could the importers themselves in making use of rail carriers to
get the consolidation rate for pool cars of mixed goods. In so far as this
contention invites this Court to apply agency law as an exonerating feature in
the application and administration of s. 32(1) (a) and (c)
of the Combines Investigation Act, I would reject it. The accused are no
less entrepreneurs in their own right in acting for others. The analogy of the
travel agent purchasing group or charter rate air tickets is misconceived if
there is no article of commerce involved but only passenger travel. Moreover,
no issue of criminality is raised under s. 32(1) (a) and (c)
in the absence of a forbidden conspiracy merely because a freight forwarder
acts as an import pool car operator for a group of importers.

In my opinion, the accused are clearly within
s. 32(1)(c) in preventing or lessening unduly “competition in the
transportation” of the imported articles by rail. This provision is not limited
in its application to persons who are themselves in the transportation business
or who control means of transportation. It extends to those who are in a
position to use or command transportation services for the carriage of goods in
transit, and who combine in the forbidden manner to restrict others from making
use of such services for the carriage of such goods, not because the rail
carrier cannot provide the service but because of the control of goods in
transit for which rail carriage is required. Utilization of rail transportation
is at the very heart of the business of the accused, and it is immaterial that
they neither own nor possess the goods that they send on by rail, or that they
neither own nor control the rail service. I would, therefore, affirm the
conviction on the second count.

[Page 70]

In addressing himself to the two counts of the
indictment, the learned trial judge saw the main issues in the case as turning
on the question of the market and on the question of undueness, neither of
which is of concern here. In addition, he referred to the concept of
competition as being central both to paras, (a) and (c) of
s. 32(1). His reasons do not disclose any consideration of the key phrase
“facilities for transporting any article” in s. 32(1) (a) other
than in his references to the conspiracy as involving “control of the channels
of distribution”.

In a broad sense, it may be said that
s. 32(1) (a), which does not refer to any limitation of
competition, is concerned with maintaining competitive access to “facilities
for transporting” goods. But it was the contention of the accused that only
physical means of transport came within the term “facilities”, and that their
service operations (even if it brought them within the ban of s. 32(1) (c))
had nothing to do with the availability of rail service for those who required
it.

I do not find at all helpful judicial
interpretations of the word “facilities” in cases arising under different
statutes, and especially when the word does not have the contextual connection
in which it appears in the Combines Investigation Act.

I agree with the trial judge that (whatever be
the meaning of “facilities”) conspiring persons may be guilty under s. 32(1)
(a) without owning or controlling “facilities” for transporting goods as
they may be under s. 32(1)(c) without owning or possessing or being
associated with any transportation operation as agents thereof. If, as is
uncontested, the accused dominated the channels of distribution to eastern
Canada of the imported goods laid down at Vancouver, the Court cannot ignore
the centrality of rail carriage in that distribution. It is no answer to a
charge under s. 32(1) (a) to say that this hold on rail
carriage was simply a consequence of the elimination of competition (in
obtaining the authorizations of importers to see to the effective movement of
their goods at the favourable mixed carload rate), and that therefore it was
not itself culpable. In my opinion, the operations of the

[Page 71]

accused, to which the rail carriage was
integral, are comprehended by the term “facilities for transporting” goods. The
physical means of transport were intimately involved, and even if they did not
represent the entirety of the activities of the accused in their particular
business, they are enough to bring the accused within the bite of the statute.
It is evident that these accused limited to themselves (and unduly) facilities
for transporting to eastern Canada the categories of imported goods covered by
the relevant tariffs. I do not agree, therefore, with counsel for the accused
that there were no physical means of transport involved in the operations of
the accused.

It is unnecessary to go beyond this conclusion
in the present case in respect of the meaning of the phrase “facilities for
transporting… any article”. I would add that the fact that the same conduct may
bring the accused within both paras. (a) and (c) of
s. 32(1) is a matter for those laying the charges. The trial juge
reflected his appreciation of the matter by imposing one fine in respect of
both convictions.

I would, therefore, affirm the conviction on the
first count as well, and in the result I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Evidence—Confession—Statement
by accused ruled inadmissible-—Admissibility of facts discovered as result of
statement—Admissibility of part of statement—Discretion to exclude admissible
evidence-—New trial directed.

The respondent was charged with non-capital
murder. The trial judge ruled that a statement signed by the respondent was
inadmissible as it was not voluntary. In the statement, the respondent told that
he threw the murder weapon in a swamp. Later the police were directed by the
respondent to the locality where, as a result of what he told them, they found
the rifle the following day. The trial judge refused to allow the Crown to
adduce evidence as to the part taken by the respondent in the finding of the
murder weapon. At the conclusion of the trial, he directed a verdict of not
guilty. The Court of Appeal affirmed the acquittal on the ground that a trial
judge in a criminal case has a discretion to reject evidence, even if legally
admissible and of substantial weight, if he considers that its admission would
be unjust or unfair to the accused or calculated to bring the administration of
justice into disrepute. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court on
the question as to whether the trial judge had a discretion to reject the
evidence relating to the involvement of the accused in the locating of the
murder weapon.

Held (Cartwright
C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and a
new trial directed.

Per Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.: There is no judicial authority in
this country or in England
which supports the proposition that a trial judge has a discretion to exclude
admissible evidence because, in his opinion, its

[Page 273]

admission would be calculated to bring the
administration of justice into disrepute. The test of admissibility of evidence
is whether the evidence is relevant to the matters in issue.

The trial judge has no general discretion to
exclude admissible evidence because, in his opinion, its admission would be
unjust or unfair to the accused. The exercise of a discretion by him arises
only if the admission of the evidence, would operate unfairly. The allowance of
admissible evidence relevant to the issue before the Court and of substantial
probative value may operate unfortunately for the accused, but not unfairly. It
is only the allowance of evidence gravely prejudicial to the accused, and whose
probative force in relation to the main issue before the Court is trifling,
which can be said to operate unfairly.

The trial judge’s discretion to exclude
admissible evidence does not extend beyond his duty to ensure that the minds of
the jury will not be prejudiced by evidence of little probative value, but of
great prejudicial effect. Exclusion of evidence on the ground that, although
its probative value was unquestionable, it was obtained by methods which the
judge considers to be unfair, has nothing to do with his duty to secure a fair
trial for the accused. The trial judge erred in law in excluding evidence as to
the facts leading to the finding of the rifle.

Where the discovery of the fact confirms the
confession—that is, where the confession must be taken to be true by reason of
the discovery of the fact—then that part of the confession that is confirmed by
the discovery of the fact is admissible, but further than that no part of the
confession is admissible. The trial judge erred in law in excluding such parts
of the confession as were confirmed as true by the discovery of such facts.

Per Fauteux,
Abbott and Judson JJ.: There are dicta as to the exclusion of evidence which is
admissible and relevant but of such slight probative value that it should be
rejected because of its prejudicial tendency in the eyes of the jury. But this
principle is not in issue in this appeal. Those dicta cannot support the broad
exclusionary discretion which was exercised by the trial judge in this case and
affirmed and extended by the Court of Appeal. There is no judicial discretion
permitting the exclusion of relevant evidence, on the ground of unfairness to
the accused. Judicial discretion in this field is a concept which involves
great uncertainty of application. The task of a judge in the conduct

[Page 274]

of a trial is to apply the law and to admit
all evidence that is logically probative unless it is ruled out by some
exclusionary rule. If this course is followed, an accused person has had a fair
trial. Deferring to the ruling in R. v. St. Lawrence, [1949]
O.R. 215, the evidence should be confined to the fact of finding under the
direction of the accused.

Per Cartwright
C.J., dissenting: The confession of the respondent was improperly
obtained and was rightly excluded as being involuntary. However, evidence of
the fact that the respondent told the police where the murder weapon could be
found was legally admissible under the rule in R. v. St. Lawrence,
supra, but not evidence that he said he had thrown it there. But, because
the manner in which the respondent was induced to indicate the location of the
weapon was as objectionable as that in which he was induced to make the
confession, it was open to the trial judge to hold that the admission of
evidence of that fact would be so unjust and unfair to the respondent and so
calculated to bring the administration of justice into disrepute as to warrant
his rejecting the evidence in the exercise of his discretion. There being
evidence on which it was open to the trial judge to exercise his discretion in
the way he did, the propriety of that exercise is not open to review on an
appeal by the Crown.

Per Hall J., dissenting:
A trial judge has, by law, a measure of discretion to reject admissible
evidence under certain circumstances. The only test applied in respect of statements
admitted or rejected after a voir dire however damaging they may be to
an accused or however their exclusion may benefit an accused, is that the
discretion be exercised judicially. If the discretion has been judicially
exercised by the judge, it is not subject to review or to being weighed on
appeal.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: It is the duty of every judge to guard against bringing the
administration of justice into disrepute. The proper discharge of this duty is
one which is of paramount importance to the continued life of the state; In the
present case, the confession or statement of the accused and also the
information given by him as to where the weapon could be found were procured by
trickery, duress and improper inducements and they were clearly inadmissible.
Had the trial judge permitted the Crown to adduce all the evidence as to the
part taken by the accused in the finding of the murder weapon, it would not
only have brought the

[Page 275]

administration of justice into disrepute but
it would have been a startling disregard of the principle that no one should be
made to testify against himself.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the
acquittal of the respondent on a charge of non capital murder. Appeal allowed,
Cartwright C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting.

Clay M. Powell, for the appellant.

Robert Carter and W.B. Gordon, for the
respondent.

CARTWRIGHT C.J. (dissenting)—This appeal
is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court on November 19, 1969, from
a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 pronounced
on October 20, 1969, dismissing an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent
on October 31, 1968, following his trial before Henderson J. and a jury at
Peterborough. The verdict of not guilty was directed by Henderson J. at the
conclusion of the trial. The charge against the respondent was that at the Township of Otonabee in the County of Peterborough on March 23, 1968, he unlawfully did kill Donald Comrie and thereby
did commit non-capital murder.

At approximately 12.10 p.m. on Saturday, March 23, 1968,
Donald Comrie was shot through the heart in the front office of Knoll’s Service
Station. Fifty-five dollars, all the bills which had been in the cash register,
were missing. There was no eye-witness of the shooting but John Frish, a boy 12
years of age, a nephew of the owner of the Service Station, heard “a crack” and
going to investigate found the deceased lying face down and, through the front
window, saw a man carrying a rifle running away from the scene. The bullet
which had caused Comrie’s death was recovered from his body and there was
expert evidence that it had been fired from a rifle which was found by the
police on June 5, 1968, in a swampy wooded area adjoining the Fyfe Road about
15 miles from the place where Comrie had been killed. This rifle was identified

[Page 276]

as belonging to James Albert Wray, a brother of
the respondent, who testified that he had first noticed that the rifle was
missing on the Tuesday following March 23, 1968. He had not reported its disappearance to the police or to the
Insurance Company in which the Wray family had insurance on the contents of
their home.

Nothing would be gained by setting out in detail
the facts recited at the trial. It is sufficient to say that the evidence
against the respondent which was admitted was all circumstantial and was not
sufficient to warrant leaving the case to the jury. The question before us
arises out of the exclusion by the learned trial judge of certain evidence
tendered by the Crown.

On June 4, 1968, shortly after 10.00 a.m., Inspector Lidstone of the Ontario
Provincial Police drove up to the respondent’s home and asked the respondent to
accompany him to the Police Headquarters in Peterborough. From then until 7.18 p.m. on the same day the respondent was
continuously with the police and one Jurems, a private investigator, who, as
the learned trial judge found, was acting for and with the police and was as
regards the respondent a person in authority. At 7.18 p.m. the respondent
signed a statement in the form of questions and answers written by Inspector
Lidstone. If admitted it would have been evidence on which the jury could have
convicted the respondent of the charge against him. It ended as follows:

Q. What happened to the gun?

A. I threw it in the swamp.

Q. Where?

A. Near Omomee.

Q. Will you try and show us the spot?

A. Yes.

Q. Is there anything else you wish to add
to this John?

A. Not now thank you.

                                                                                                                   (signed)
John Wray

7.18 p.m.

At 7.25 p.m. the police set out with the
respondent in their car, followed by Jurems in

[Page 277]

another car, and were directed by the respondent
to the locality where, as a result of what he told them, they found the rifle
the following day. During the afternoon of June 4, 1968, Mr. Gordon, a lawyer
retained by the respondent’s family, attempted to get in touch with the police
by telephone but the police did not return his calls. Asked why they had not
done so, Inspector Lidstone said in cross-examination:

we did not want to take a chance that
Mr. Wray as a result of speaking to Mr. Gordon wouldn’t take the
police out to where the gun was found.

Following a lengthy voir dire, the learned trial
judge ruled that the statement signed by the respondent was legally inadmissible
as it was not voluntary. This ruling was not challenged. It was supported by
the evidence.

For the appellant it is submitted that the
learned trial judge erred in law in refusing to allow the Crown to adduce
evidence as to the part taken by the respondent in the finding of the murder
weapon.

The question on which leave to appeal to this
Court was granted is as follows:

Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in holding that the
learned trial Judge had a discretion to reject the evidence relating to the
involvement of the accused in the locating of the murder weapon?

It is first necessary to decide whether the
evidence which the Crown sought to adduce was legally admissible. The appeal
was argued, and rightly so, on the basis that the respondent’s confession was
inadmissible; the submission of the Crown is that, in spite of this, it was
entitled to prove not only the finding of the rifle but also the fact that its
location was pointed out to the police by the respondent and to give in
evidence so much of the confession as was verified by the fact of the finding.

It is impossible to reconcile the numerous
decisions as to what follows when an inadmissible

[Page 278]

confession or some part of it is verified by
subsequently discovered evidence. In a most helpful article by A. Gotlieb,
entitled “Confirmation by subsequent facts”, in (1956) 72 L.Q.R. 209, a number
of cases are collected and discussed. The learned author points out that
authorities exist to support each of the following five views:

(1) Subsequent facts are admissible but
they cannot in any way be connected with the confession.

(2) Evidence can be given of subsequent
facts and that they were discovered as a result of a statement made by the
accused.

(3) Evidence may be given of subsequent
facts and so much of the confession as strictly relates to them.

(4) Subsequent facts and the whole
confession that led to their discovery are admissible.

(5) Subsequent facts are not admissible.

In my opinion the third view is that which
prevails in Canada. It is
founded on the full and careful judgment of McRuer C.J.H.C. in Rex v.
St. Lawrence[2]. At
p. 391 the learned Chief Justice states the rule succinctly as follows:

Where the discovery of the fact confirms
the confession—that is, where the confession must be taken to be true by reason
of the discovery of the fact—then that part of the confession that is confirmed
by the discovery of the fact is admissible, but further than that no part of
the confession is admissible.

In R. v. Haase[3], the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia applied the rule enunciated in R. v. St. Lawrence but
Davey J.A., as he then was, who gave the judgment of the majority, stated at p.
328 that the appellant did not question the admissibility of certain evidence
under “the St. Lawrence rule” and that therefore “it would be
inappropriate to examine the rationale of that

[Page 279]

rule and its scope”. The judgment of the Court
of Appeal was affirmed by this Court in a short oral judgment delivered without
calling on counsel for the respondent, which is reported at (1964) 50 W.W.R.
386. In view of this it appears to me that the rule rests on the judgment of
McRuer C.J.H.C. and cannot be said to have the added authority of the Court of
Appeal for British Columbia or of this Court. On the other hand, as Haase was
a case of capital murder, the affirmation of the conviction indicates that
neither the Court of Appeal nor this Court disagreed with “the
St. Lawrence rule”.

It is my opinion that, applying the reasoning of
McRuer C.J.H.C. to the facts of the case at bar, evidence that the respondent
told the police where the murder weapon was to be found was legally admissible
but that evidence that he said he had thrown it there was not.

However, before leaving this phase of the matter
it is necessary to consider the effect of the judgment of this Court in DeClercq
v. The Queen[4]. My
brother Martland, who gave the reasons of the majority, said at p. 911:

While it is settled law that an inculpatory
statement by an accused is not admissible against him unless it is voluntary,
and while the inquiry on a voir dire is directed to that issue, and not to the
truth or falsity of the statement it does not follow that the truth or falsity
of the statement must be irrelevant to such an inquiry.

The great weight of authority indicates that the
underlying reason for the rule that an involuntary confession shall not be
admitted is the supposed danger that it may be untrue. If this is the only
reason for the rule it is logical that so much of an involuntary confession as
is shown by subsequently discovered evidence to be true should be admitted: but
why, it may be asked, should an involuntary statement which the accused
subsequently admits on his oath to be true be excluded? The anomaly of so
holding is

[Page 280]

pointed out in the dictum of Robertson C.J.O.
giving the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Rex v. Mazerall[5]:

It would be a strange application of a rule
designed to exclude confessions the truth of which is doubtful, to use it to
exclude statements that the accused, giving evidence upon this trial, has sworn
to be true.

While in my view this observation was obiter,
it is difficult to reject its reasoning if the only ground for excluding an
involuntary confession is the danger of its being untrue. If, on the other
hand, the exclusion of an involuntary confession is based also on the maxim nemo
tenetur seipsum accusare the truth or falsity of the confession does become
logically irrelevant. It would indeed be a strange result if, it being the law
that no accused is bound to incriminate himself and that he is to be protected
from having to testify at an inquest, a preliminary hearing or a trial, he
could none the less be forced by the police or others in authority to make a
statement which could then be given in evidence against him. The result which
would seem to follow if the exclusion is based on the maxim would be that the
involuntary confession even if verified by subsequently discovered evidence
could not be referred to in any way.

I have reached the conclusion that we ought not
to over-rule R. v. St. Lawrence, which has stood for twenty years,
and that consequently it should be held that the evidence which the Crown
sought to introduce at the trial was legally admissible. This was the view taken
in the courts below and was the basis on which the appeal was argued before us.

The question then is as stated in the order
granting leave to appeal which has been quoted above. It is a question of law
whether the learned trial judge had power, in his discretion, to exclude the
evidence as he did. If he had that power then, subject to a qualification to be
stated hereafter, it is not, in my opinion, a pure question of law whether he
ought to have exercised his discretion in the way he did.

[Page 281]

The discretionary power, if it exists, is not
created by any statute but rests upon judicial decisions. Those chiefly relied
on by the respondent are the following:

Noor Mohamed v. the King[6],
in which dealing with the admissibility of evidence of similar acts, Lord
Du Parcq said at p. 192:

It is right to add, however, that in all
such cases the judge ought to consider whether the evidence which it is
proposed to adduce is sufficiently substantial, having regard to the purpose to
which it is professedly directed, to make it desirable in the interests of
justice that it should be admitted. If, so far as that purpose is concerned, it
can in the circumstances of the case have only trifling weight, the judge will
be right to exclude it. To say this is not to confuse weight with
admissibility. The distinction is plain, but cases must occur in which it would
be unjust, to admit evidence of a character gravely prejudicial to the accused
even though there may be some tenuous ground for holding it technically
admissible. The decision must then be left to the discretion and the sense of
fairness of the judge.

Kuruma v. the Queen[7], in which
Lord Goddard said at p. 204:

…No doubt in a criminal case the judge
always has a discretion to disallow evidence if the strict rules of
admissibility would operate unfairly against an accused. This was emphasized in
the case before this Board of Noor Mohamed v. The King, and in the
recent case in the House of Lords, Harris v. Director of Public
Prosecutions. If, for instance, some admission of some piece of evidence,
e.g., a document, had been obtained from a defendant by a trick, no doubt the
judge might properly rule it out. It was this discretion that lay at the root
of the ruling of Lord Guthrie in H.M. Advocate v. Turnbull.

Callis v. Gunn[8], in which
Lord Parker said at p. 501:

That is dealing with admissibility in law,
and as Lord Goddard, C.J. points out, and indeed as is well known, in every
criminal case a judge has a discretion to disallow evidence, even if in law
relevant and therefore admissible, if admissibility would operate unfairly
against a defendant. I would

[Page 282]

add that in considering whether
admissibility would operate unfairly against a defendant one would certainly
consider whether it had been obtained in an oppressive manner by force or
against the wishes of an accused person. That is the general principle.

It will be observed that the nature of the
discretionary power asserted in the two latter cases appears to differ in kind
from that asserted in the first. Under the rule in Noor Mohamed the
judge excludes the evidence because of the danger of the jury attaching undue
weight to it or using it for the inadmissible purpose of showing that the
accused is the sort of person who is likely to commit the offence for which he
is on trial. It does not furnish support for the assertion of a discretionary
power to exclude legally admissible evidence relevant to the issue before the
jury and objectionable only on the ground that it was obtained in an improper
or unlawful manner.

In the case at bar Aylesworth J.A., giving the
unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal, after quoting the passage from Noor
Mohamed v. the Queen which I have set out above, continued as follows:

We think that to be only a partial
statement of the rule involved in the case at bar, and it was couched in the
language which I have read as being relevant only to the particular subject
matter which the learned Law Lords were there considering.

and then, having quoted the passage from Kuruma
v. The Queen set out above, continued:

In our view, a trial judge has a discretion
to reject evidence, even of substantial weight, if he considers that its
admission would be unjust or unfair to the accused or calculated to bring the
administration of justice into disrepute, the exercise of such discretion, of
course, to depend upon the particular facts before him. Cases where to admit
certain evidence would be calculated to bring the administration of justice
into disrepute will be rare, but we think the discretion of a trial Judge
extends to such cases.

He went on to hold that the circumstances
present in the case were such as to have warranted the learned trial judge’s
rejection of the proffered evidence respecting the accused’s involvement in

[Page 283]

the discovery of the murder weapon upon both of
the grounds stated, namely that to receive it would be (i) unjust or unfair to
the accused and (ii) calculated to bring the administration of justice into
disrepute.

A contrary view as to the scope of the
discretionary power is expressed by Davey C.J.B.C. giving the unanimous
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia in Regina v. Sigmund et al[9].
After a consideration of the authorities including Noor Mohamed v. R.,
Kuruma v. R. and Callis v. Gunn he says at pp. 102 and 103:

It is to be observed as Lords Goddard and
Parker stated, and as Kerwin, C.J.C., mentioned in A.-G. Que. v. Begin (1955)
S.C.R. 593 that this principle is altogether apart from the rules governing the
admission of confessions.

In Kuruma v. The Queen, supra, Lord
Goddard used quite general language, but founded it upon Noor Mohamed v. The
King, and Harris v. Director of Public Prosecutions, supra. In my
respectful opinion, it is quite plain that his language was only a reference to
the principle laid down in those cases, and not an attempt to restate or expand
it. I am not sure that Lord Parker intended to do more, although he did state
some of the circumstances a Judge ought to consider in deciding whether the
admission of evidence would operate unfairly against a prisoner, namely,
‘whether it had been obtained in an oppressive manner by force or against the
wishes of an accused person.’

If Lord Parker meant to lay down a principle
that a Judge has discretion to exclude any relevant evidence that would operate
unfairly against an accused, or that has been obtained in an oppressive manner
by force or against the wishes of the prisoner, I must respectfully disagree. I
know of no other authority that goes so far, yet it is upon that principle said
to have been laid down by Lord Parker that the exclusion of Sigmund’s
exculpatory statement must rest.

It appears from what has been said above that
the Courts of Appeal in British Columbia and in Ontario have
taken opposite views on the question which we have to decide. The difficulty

[Page 284]

and importance of the question is aptly
described by the words used by Lord Cooper in Lawrie v. Muir[10]:

The law must strive to reconcile two highly
important interests which are liable to come into conflict—(a) the interest
of the citizen to be protected from illegal or irregular invasions of his
liberties by the authorities, and (b) the interest of the state
to secure that evidence bearing upon the commission of a crime and necessary to
enable justice to be done shall not be withheld from courts of law on any mere
formal or technical ground. Neither of these objects can be insisted upon to
the uttermost. The protection for the citizen is primarily protection for the
innocent citizen against unwarranted, wrongful and perhaps high-handed
interference, and the common sanction is an action for damages. The protection
is not intended as a protection for the guilty citizen against the efforts of
the public prosecutor to vindicate the law. On the other hand the interest of
the state cannot be magnified to the point of causing all the safeguards for
the protection of the citizen to vanish, and of offering a positive inducement
to the authorities to proceed by irregular methods.

The relevant circumstances in the case at bar
differ widely from those suggested in the passage from Noor Mohamed v. R. quoted
above. The evidence which the Crown sought to adduce, far from having only
trifling weight, might well have been found by the jury to be decisive; it is
implicit in the reasons of the Court of Appeal that they regarded it as of
substantial weight. I have difficulty in defining the conditions which would
render a trial conducted strictly according to law “unjust or unfair” to an
accused but the difficulty of defining the circumstances which call for its
exercise does not necessarily negative the existence of the discretion which we
are considering. In R. v. Murphy[11],
Lord Macdermott said:

Unfairness in this context cannot be
closely defined. It must be judged in the light of all the material facts and
findings and all the surrounding circumstances. The position of the accused,
the nature of the investigation, and the gravity or otherwise of the suspected
offence may all be relevant.

[Page 285]

If the views expressed by Lord Goddard in Kuruma
v. R. and by Lord Parker in Callis v. Gunn are accepted they uphold
the view of the Court of Appeal in the case at bar. Further support for that
view is to be found in Cross on Evidence, 3rd ed. (1967) which contains an
illuminating discussion of the problem and related questions at pp. 23 to 27;
262 to 270; and 445 to 448. In Myers v. Director of Public Prosecutions[12], Lord Reid said:

It is true that a judge has a discretion to
exclude legally admissible evidence if justice so requires, but it is a very different
thing to say that he has a discretion to admit legally inadmissible evidence.

The learned author of Cross on Evidence (op,
cit.) points out at p. 269 that there must be a limit to the doctrine that a
fact such as the disclosure by the accused of the whereabouts of the murder
weapon can be given in evidence even although his confession is inadmissible
and asks the question: “What if the whereabouts… were ascertained by prolonged
torture of the accused?”

Once it has been decided that the confession is
inadmissible because of the manner in which it was obtained but that part of it
becomes admissible in law because it is verified by the discovery of the murder
weapon in the place in which the accused in the course of the confession stated
it to be, the court is faced with a choice of deciding either that because it
is relevant, of great weight and admissible in law it must be received or that
because it was obtained or extorted by such means that to admit it would bring
the administration of justice into disrepute in the minds of right-thinking men
the presiding judge may in his discretion exclude it. The choice is a difficult
one; but, not without hesitation, occasioned by the reasons of Davey C.J.B.C.
quoted above and by the consideration that a murder should not go unpunished, I
have reached the conclusion that the Court of Appeal were right in holding that
the learned trial judge had a discretion to reject the evidence, relating to
the involvement of the accused in locating the murder weapon,

[Page 286]

which he did reject, and consequently that the
question of law on which leave to appeal was granted should be answered in the
negative.

Earlier in these reasons I expressed the opinion
that if the learned trial judge had power in his discretion to exclude the
evidence it is not a pure question of law whether he ought to have exercised
his discretion as he did. This is, I think, subject to the qualification that
it would be a question of law whether there was any, as distinguished from
sufficient, evidence to warrant his rejection of the proffered evidence. In my
opinion there was such evidence in the case at bar. The suspected offence is
non-capital murder, there is no need to enlarge upon its gravity; on the other
hand, the nature of the investigation as a result of which the respondent
disclosed the whereabouts of the murder weapon was such as to reflect no credit
on the authorities concerned. The Court of Appeal were not guilty of
overstatement when they said:

Admittedly the confession or statement by the
accused was procured by trickery, duress and improper inducements and it was
clearly inadmissible.

Added to this was the circumstance that the
police failed to let the lawyer retained by the respondent’s family get in
touch with him and did so for the stated reason that this might prevent the
accused taking the police to the place where the murder weapon was located.

There being evidence to warrant the decision of
the learned trial judge nothing would be gained by my expressing an opinion as
to how he should have exercised his discretion.

Before parting with the matter, since the above
reasons are somewhat discursive, I will endeavour to state in summary form my
grounds for thinking that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be upheld.
The confession of the accused was improperly obtained and was rightly excluded
as being involuntary. In spite of this, evidence of the fact that the accused
told the police where the murder weapon could be found was legally admissible
under the rule in Rex v. St. Lawrence; but, because the manner in
which he was induced

[Page 287]

to indicate the location of the weapon was as
objectionable as that in which he was induced to make the confession, it was
open to the learned trial judge to hold that the admission of evidence of that
fact would be so unjust and unfair to the accused and so calculated to bring
the administration of justice into disrepute as to warrant his rejecting the
evidence in the exercise of his discretion; and, finally, there being evidence
on which it was open to the learned trial judge to exercise his discretion in
the way he did, the propriety of that exercise is not open to review on an
appeal by the Crown.

I would dismiss the appeal. In view of the terms
of the order granting leave to appeal the appellant will pay the costs of the
respondent as set out in that order.

Fauteux, Abbott, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. agreed
with the reasons of Martland J.

MARTLAND J.—The facts in this case have been
outlined by Cartwright C.J.C. The issue of law before this Court is as to the
validity of the principle stated in the reasons of the Court of Appeal of
Ontario[13] that a
trial judge in a criminal case has a discretion to reject evidence, even of
substantial weight, if he considers that its admission would be unjust or unfair
to the accused or calculated to bring the administration of justice into
disrepute.

I will deal with the latter part of this
proposition first. I am not aware of any judicial authority in this country or
in England which supports the
proposition that a trial judge has a discretion to exclude admissible evidence
because, in his opinion, its admission would be calculated to bring the
administration of justice into disrepute. The test of admissibility of evidence
was stated by Lord Goddard in Kuruma v. The Queen[14], as follows:

In their Lordships’ opinion the test to be
applied in considering whether evidence is admissible is whether it is relevant
to the matters in issue. If it is, it is admissible and the court is not
concerned with how the evidence was obtained.

[Page 288]

The extent to which a discretion exists to
disallow evidence if the strict rules of admissibility would operate unfairly
against an accused, which was referred to by Lord Goddard in that case, will be
considered later in these reasons. The exercise of a discretion of that kind is
a part of the function of the court to ensure that the accused has a fair
trial. But other than that, in my opinion, under our law, the function of the
court is to determine the issue before it, on the evidence admissible in law,
and it does not extend to the exclusion of admissible evidence for any other
reason.

I turn next to the statement that a trial judge
in a criminal case has a discretion to reject evidence, even of substantial
weight, if its admission would be unjust or unfair to the accused. The origin
of this proposition is to be found in the Kuruma case, cited above. In
that case the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that illegally
obtained evidence was nevertheless legally admissible against an accused, and
affirmed the conviction of the accused based upon such evidence. Lord Goddard
did, however, say, in the course of his reasons, at p. 204:

No doubt in a criminal case the judge
always has a discretion to disallow evidence if the strict rules of evidence
would operate unfairly against the accused.

He supported his statement by reference to the
judgment of the Privy Council in Noor Mohamed v. The King[15], and that of the House of Lords in Harris
v. Director of Public Prosecutions[16],
In both those cases the matter in issue was as to the admissibility of
evidence of other prior offences, and it was in relation to the use of that
kind of evidence that the frequently quoted dictum of Lord Du Parcq, in the Noor
Mohamed case, was stated. He had been dealing with a passage from the
judgment of Lord Sumner in the case of Thompson v. The King[17] which had recognized the
admissibility, in that case, of evidence tending to show the predisposition of

[Page 289]

the accused to commit an offence of the kind
with which he was charged. Lord Sumner said this, at p. 232:

Before an issue can be said to be raised,
which would permit the introduction of such evidence so obviously prejudicial
to the accused, it must have been raised in substance if not in so many words,
and the issue so raised must be one to which the prejudicial evidence is
relevant. The mere theory that a plea of not guilty puts everything material in
issue is not enough for this purpose. The prosecution cannot credit the accused
with fancy defences in order to rebut them at the outset with some damning
piece of prejudice.

Lord Du Parcq, in his reasons in the Noor
Mohamed case, after referring to this passage, said, at pp. 191 and 192:

Their Lordships respectfully agree with
what they conceive to be the spirit and intention of Lord Sumner’s words, and
wish to say nothing to detract from their value. On principle, however, and
with due regard to subsequent authority, their Lordships think that one
qualification of the rule laid down by Lord Sumner must be admitted. An accused
person need set up no defence other than a general denial of the crime alleged.
The plea of not guilty may be equivalent to saying “Let the prosecution prove
its case, if it can,” and having said so much the accused may take refuge in silence.
In such a case it may appear (for instance) that the facts and circumstances of
the particular offence charged are consistent with innocent intention, whereas
further evidence, which incidentally shows that the accused has committed one
or more other offences, may tend to prove that they are consistent only with a
guilty intent. The prosecution could not be said, in their Lordships’ opinion,
to be “crediting the accused with a fancy defence” if they sought to adduce
such evidence. It is right to add, however, that in all such cases the judge
ought to consider whether the evidence which it is proposed to adduce is
sufficiently substantial, having regard to the purpose to which it is
professedly directed, to make it desirable in the interest of justice that it
should be admitted. If, so far as that purpose is concerned, it can in the
circumstances of the case have only trifling weight, the judge will be right to
exclude it. To say this is not to confuse weight with admissibility. The
distinction is plain, but cases must occur in which it would be unjust to admit
evidence of a character gravely prejudicial to the accused even though there
may be some tenuous ground for

[Page 290]

holding it technically admissible. The
decision must then be left to the discretion and the sense of fairness of the
judge.

In Harris v. Director of Public Prosecutions,
after citing the latter part of the passage just quoted, Lord Simon said,
at p. 707:

This second proposition flows from the duty
of the judge when trying a charge of crime to set the essentials of justice
above the technical rule if the strict application of the latter would operate
unfairly against the accused. If such a case arose, the judge may intimate to
the prosecution that evidence of “similar facts” affecting the accused, though
admissible, should not be pressed because its probable effect “would be out of
proportion to its true evidential value” (per Lord Moulton in Director
of Public Prosecutions v. Christie, (1914) 24 Cox C.C. 249, 257). Such an
intimation rests entirely within the discretion of the judge.

It is of interest that the phrase “operate
unfairly against the accused”, used by Lord Simon in this passage, which
clearly is dealing only with the admission of evidence of “similar facts”, is
used by Lord Goddard in the Kuruma case.

In Callis v. Gunn[18], the question in issue arose on a
case stated by the Oxfordshire Justices as to whether they had properly
excluded evidence as to fingerprints. The accused, after being charged with
larceny, and while still in custody, was asked to give fingerprints, which he
did, without objection. He had not been cautioned that he might refuse, and
that, if he did give them, they might be used in evidence against him.

The Court held that the evidence ought to have
been admitted, but Lord Parker C.J., after citing the Kuruma case as
authority for the proposition that in considering whether evidence is
admissible the test is whether it is relevant to the matter in issue, and that,
if admissible, the court is not concerned with how the evidence is obtained,
went on to say at p. 501:

That is dealing with admissibility in law,
and as Lord Goddard C.J. points out, and indeed as is

[Page 291]

well known, in every criminal case a judge
has a discretion to disallow evidence, even if in law relevant and therefore
admissible, if admissibility would operate unfairly against a defendant. I
would add that in considering whether admissibility would operate unfairly
against a defendant one would certainly consider whether it had been obtained
in an oppressive manner by force or against the wishes of an accused person.
That is the general principle.

In two subsequent cases, R. v. Court[19], and R. v. Payne[20], Lord Parker held that the trial
judge should have exercised his discretion to exclude admissible evidence. Both
cases involved charges of driving while unfit, through drink. The evidence in
issue in each case was that of a doctor who had examined the accused at the
police station as to the extent to which the accused was under the influence of
drink. The circumstances are described by Lord Parker, in the Payne case,
at p. 638, as follows:

In both Court’s case, (1962) Crim.
L.R. 697, C.C.A., and this case the defendants were asked when they went to the
police station if they were willing to be examined by a doctor, and it was made
clear to them in each case that the purpose of that was in order that the
doctor should see whether they were suffering from any illness or disability.
In both cases the defendants were told it was no part of the doctor’s duty to
examine the respective defendants in order to give an opinion as to their
unfitness to drive. Those statements to the defendants were made at that time
pursuant to a definite policy which was that the doctor called would not
examine a defendant in order to ascertain whether he was unfit to drive, but
would merely examine him in order to see whether he was suffering from any
other illness or physical disability, and, in particular, whether he was fit to
leave the police station.

On the other hand, in The Queen v. Murphy[21], Lord MacDermott L.C.J., presiding
in the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, while accepting the proposition that a
court has a discretion to reject admissible evidence if it might operate
unfairly against the accused, held that the Court‑Martial had properly
exercised its discretion when, in

[Page 292]

considering a charge of disclosing information
useful to the enemy, it admitted the evidence of police officers who had posed
as members of a subversive organization to which the accused was suspected of
being sympathetic, and, in that manner, had elicited from him the information,
the subject of the charge, by asking questions about the security of his
barracks.

In King v. The Queen[22], The Privy Council refused to
interfere with the discretion of the trial court, which, on a charge of
possession of a dangerous drug, had admitted evidence of a search of the person
of the accused. A provision of the Jamaican Constitution gave protection to
persons against search of persons on property without consent. The relevant
statute law did not authorize the search, and the search was effected without
furnishing him the opportunity of being searched in front of a justice of the
peace, which was his legal right.

I have considered the authorities, previously
cited, because they indicate that the proposition of law as to judicial
discretion which, at the outset, was stated, in very limited terms, in respect
of evidence of similar facts, by Lord Du Parcq in the Noor Mohamed case,
i.e.:

It is right to add, however, that in all
such cases the judge ought to consider whether the evidence which it is
proposed to adduce is sufficiently substantial, having regard to the purpose to
which it is professedly directed, to make it desirable in the interest of
justice that it should be admitted. If, so far as that purpose is concerned, it
can in the circumstances of the case have only trifling weight, the
judge will be right to exclude it.

(The emphasis is my own.)

has emerged, full blown, into a statement, such
as that made by Ashworth J. in Rumping v. Director of Prosecutions[23]:

There is of course ample authority for the
proposition that a judge has an overriding discretion to exclude evidence even
if such evidence is in law admissible.

[Page 293]

In support of this he cites only the Kuruma
case.

This development of the idea of a general
discretion to exclude admissible evidence is not warranted by the authority on
which it purports to be based. The dictum of Lord Goddard, in the Kuruma case,
appears to be founded on Noor Mohamed, and it has, I think, been unduly
extended in some of the subsequent cases. It recognized a discretion to
disallow evidence if the strict rules of admissibility would operate unfairly
against the accused. Even if this statement be accepted, in the way in which it
is phrased, the exercise of a discretion by the trial judge arises only if the
admission of the evidence would operate unfairly. The allowance of admissible
evidence relevant to the issue before the court and of substantial probative
value may operate unfortunately for the accused, but not unfairly. It is only
the allowance of evidence gravely prejudicial to the accused, the admissibility
of which is tenuous, and whose probative force in relation to the main issue
before the court is trifling, which can be said to operate unfairly.

I am in agreement with what was said, in
relation to this point, by Davey C.J.B.C. in The Queen v. Sigmund et al.,[24] in the passage cited in the reasons of
Cartwright C.J.C.

Lord Goddard’s own view as to the scope of the
proposition which he was stating can be determined, to some extent, by his
failure to apply it to the rather unusual facts of the Kuruma case. The
appellant Kuruma was an African employee of a European farmer in Kenya. On his “day off” he cycled from the
farm to his reservation along a route he knew to be regularly patrolled by the Kenya police. He could have reached his
home by another route which was not patrolled, but chose not to do so.
Regulation 29 of the Emergency Regulations of Kenya stated:

Any police officer of or above the rank of
assistant inspector may… with or without assistance and using force if
necessary… (b) stop and search…

[Page 294]

any individual, whether in a public place
or not, if he suspects that any evidence of the commission of an offence
against these regulations is likely to be found on such… individual, and he may
seize any evidence so found.

While cycling, the accused was stopped by a
police road-block. He dismounted, and was stripped and searched by two
constables, both of them below the rank of assistant inspector. Testifying on
behalf of the Crown, they reported finding two rounds of ammunition and a
pocketknife in the possession of Kuruma. On the strength of this testimony and
in accordance with the emergency laws of Kenya (Reg. 8a(1) (b), Emergency Regulations 1952), the
accused was sentenced to death for being in unlawful possession of ammunition.
He denied having been in possession of either the ammunition or the
pocketknife, and based his appeal on the ground that the only evidence against
him was the fruit of an unlawful search and ought to have been excluded.

The pocketknife was never presented in evidence.
The police claimed that it was returned to the accused after his arrest. The
constables also contended that the search and discovery of the ammunition on
the person of the accused were witnessed by three other persons. Yet no such
witnesses were called by the Crown and the conviction was obtained on the sole
testimony of the constables. The accused was not entitled under Kenya law to a jury trial (ss. 258, 259,
318(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code). Instead, his case was heard by a
magistrate and three assessors. The magistrate, in reaching his decision,
ignored the unanimous advice of the assessors.

If Lord Goddard intended that the discretion
which he defined was applicable if the trial judge felt that the proposed
evidence had been obtained in an unfair manner, it is difficult to see how he
could avoid saying that the discretion should have been exercised in Kuruma’s
favour. If, however, he meant that the discretion arose where the admission of
evidence, though legally admissible, would operate unfairly, because, as stated
in Noor Mohamed, it had trivial probative value, but was

[Page 295]

highly prejudicial, then the course followed in
the disposition of the Kuruma case is quite understandable.

In cases such as R. v. Court and R. v.
Payne, I think confusion has arisen between “unfairness” in the method of
obtaining evidence, and “unfairness” in the actual trial of the accused by
reason of its admission. The result of those two cases was, in effect, to
render inadmissible evidence which the ratio decidendi of the Kuruma case
had held to be admissible. The view which they express would replace the Noor
Mohamed test, based on the duty of a trial judge to ensure that the minds
of the jury be not prejudiced by evidence of little probative value, but of
great prejudicial effect, by the test as to whether evidence, the probative
value of which is unimpeachable, was obtained by methods which the trial judge,
in his own discretion, considers to be unfair. Exclusion of evidence on this
ground has nothing whatever to do with the duty of a trial judge to secure a
fair trial for the accused.

The difficulty of achieving any sort of uniformity
in the application of the law if a broad discretion of this kind is recognized
is clearly illustrated in the cases which I have considered. What is the
standard of “unfairness” which excludes the medical opinions in the cases of Court
and Payne, in which the accused had been misled as to the purpose of
the medical examinations, and yet permits the admission of evidence obtained by
an illegal search of the person in the Kuruma case and in the King case,
and evidence obtained through deception by agents provocateurs in the Murphy
case?

In my opinion, the recognition of a discretion
to exclude admissible evidence, beyond the limited scope recognized in the Noor
Mohamed case, is not warranted by authority, and would be undesirable. The
admission of relevant admissible evidence of probative value should not be
prevented, except within the very limited sphere recognized in that case. My
view is that the trial judge’s discretion does not extend beyond those limits,
and, accordingly, I think, with respect,

[Page 296]

that the definition of that discretion by the
Court of Appeal in this case was wrong in law.

I am in agreement with Cartwright C.J.C. and
with my brother Judson that, on the issue of the admissibility of the evidence
sought to be introduced by the Crown in this case, notwithstanding the
exclusion of the confession, the law in Canada is correctly stated by McRuer C.J.H.C. in The King v. St. Lawrence[25]:

Where the discovery of the fact confirms
the confession—that is, where the confession must be taken to be true by reason
of the discovery of the fact—then that part of the confession that is confirmed
by the discovery of the fact is admissible, but further than that no part of
the confession is admissible.

Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the learned
trial judge erred in law in excluding evidence as to the facts leading up to
the finding of the rifle, and in excluding such parts of the confession as were
confirmed as true by the discovery of such facts.

I would allow the appeal and direct a new trial.

Fauteux and Abbott JJ. agreed with the reasons
of Judson J.

JUDSON J.—I agree with the conclusion of
Cartwright C.J.C. that we ought not to overrule Rex v. St. Lawrence[26]. This case reviews the law which
has stood since Rex v. Warwickshall[27],
to the effect that even if a confession is inadmissible in evidence,
nevertheless facts which become known by means of this confession may be proved
on behalf of the prosecution. The use that has been made of this principle has
usually had to do with the finding of articles connected with the crime. The
finding of the articles may be proved even though the confession is
inadmissible.

The theory for the rejection of confessions is
that if they are obtained under certain conditions, they are untrusworthy. This
theory has no appli-

[Page 297]

cation whatever to incontrovertible facts, such
as the finding of articles. It is now being suggested that this evidence should
be excluded even though it is relevant and admissible and of great probative
value on the ground that its reception would operate unfairly against the
accused and, according to the Court of Appeal, bring the administration of
justice into disrepute. I am not concerned at this stage with the exclusion of
evidence which is admissible and relevant but of such slight probative value
that it should be rejected because of its prejudicial tendency in the eyes of
the jury. There are plenty of dicta to this effect:

Maxwell v. Director of Public
Prosecutions[28]; Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecutions[29]; R. v. Cook[30]; Noor Mohamed v. The King[31].

The principle is also stated in 7 C.E.D., 2nd
ed., p. 105, that matters of slight probative value may be excluded in the
discretion of the judge when likely to cause undue prejudice, unfair surprise
or confusion of issues. This principle, I repeat, is not in issue in this
appeal. We are concerned here with a matter of great probative value, the
finding of the weapon which was used to shoot Donald Comrie in the service
station during the course of the holdup.

The dicta which have been quoted from Noor
Mohamed v. The King, Kuruma v. The Queen[32],
Callis v. Gunn[33], cannot,
in my opinion, support the broad exclusionary discretion which was exercised by
the trial judge in this case and affirmed and extended by the Court of Appeal.

ln Noor Mohamed, the
accused was charged with the murder of his mistress by the administration of
potassium cyanide. The evidence excluded related to the death of the accused’s
wife two years before, also as a result of potassium cyanide. It was excluded
on the principle laid down in Makin v. Attorney General for New South Wales[34], because it plainly tended to
show that the accused had been guilty of the murder of his wife two years
before and this, for the

[Page 298]

purpose of persuading the jury that he was the kind
of person who, two years later, would murder his mistress by the same means.
Then followed the statement concerning judicial discretion to exclude evidence
of “trifling” weight even though there might be “some tenuous ground for
holding it technically admissible.” I do not think that Noor Mohamed is
of any assistance in the case before us.

In Kuruma, the accused was charged with
the possession of ammunition contrary to the Emergency Regulations of 1952 of Kenya. It was submitted that the evidence
of possession was secured as a result of an unlawful search. The evidence was
admitted and the principle stated that both in civil and criminal cases the
test of the admissibility of evidence was relevancy to the matters in issue. If
it is relevant, it is admissible, and the court is not concerned with how it
was obtained.

That was the ratio of the case and, in my
opinion, it is correct. The statement that the court has a discretion to
disallow evidence if the strict rules of admissibility would operate unfairly
against an accused person is obiter and it cannot be supported by the
authorities quoted.

Callis v. Gunn was
concerned with the admissibility of fingerprints. The accused had declined to
make any statement but he did allow his fingerprints to be taken. He was not
warned that he was under no compulsion. At trial the fingerprint evidence was
rejected. On appeal it was held that it should have been admitted; that a
caution was unnecessary before fingerprints were taken, and that there was
nothing that would justify the justices in excluding the evidence. Then
followed the statement that there is an over-riding discretion in a trial court
to disallow evidence if its admission would operate unfairly against the
defendant, and that the discretion should be exercised if the evidence was
obtained oppressively or by false representations or a trick, threat or bribe.

If this statement is read as supporting a
judicial discretion to exclude any relevant evidence for the reasons given, I
would not accept

[Page 299]

it. In this I agree with Davey C.J.B.C., in Regina v. Sigmund et a/[35], when
he said:

If Lord Parker meant to lay down a
principle that a Judge has discretion to exclude any relevant evidence that
would operate unfairly against an accused, or that has been obtained in an
oppressive manner by force or against the wishes of the prisoner, I must
respectfully disagree. I know of no other authority that goes so far, yet it is
upon that principle said to have been laid down by Lord Parker that the
exclusion of Sigmund’s exculpatory statement must rest.

In this appeal we are clearly faced with the
question whether we should make new law and give a trial judge a discretion to
exclude relevant and admissible evidence if he thinks that it will operate
unfairly against the accused or, according to his opinion, bring the
administration of justice into disrepute. The reason given for the unfairness
here is that the weapon was discovered partly as a result of an inadmissible
confession and partly as a result of the accused going with the police officers
and pointing out the place where the weapon was concealed. In my opinion, there
is no justification for recognizing the existence of this discretion in these
circumstances. This type of evidence has been admissible for almost 200 years.
There is no judicial discretion permitting the exclusion of relevant evidence,
in this case highly relevant evidence, on the ground of unfairness to the
accused.

If this law is to be changed, a simple amendment
to the Canada Evidence Act  would be sufficient—an amendment to the
effect that no fact discovered as a result of an inadmissible confession shall
be provable in evidence against an accused person. Such a change should not be
effected by turning to a theory of judicial discretion to admit or reject
relevant evidence based upon the unsubstantial dicta to which I have
referred in these reasons. Judicial discretion in this field is a concept which
involves great uncertainty of application. The task of a judge in the conduct
of a trial is to apply the law and to admit all evidence that is logically
probative

[Page 300]

unless it is ruled out by some exclusionary
rule, if this course is followed, an accused person has had a fair trial. The
exclusionary rule applied in this case is one that should not be accepted.

How are the facts relating to the discovery of
the weapon to be put before the jury? The minimum in this case is the account
of Wray’s trip from Toronto in the company of police officers to a swamp 15
miles west of the scene of the crime and the search for and the discovery of
the weapon under the direction of the accused. This was late in the day of June
4, 1968. The police searched until it was dark and found the weapon the next
morning.

The next question is whether any part of the
inadmissible confession may be put in. The cases and the commentators differ on
this point. The choice is between restricting the evidence to proof of the fact
of finding on the direction of the accused, or admitting, in addition, that
part of the confession that is confirmed by the fact of finding.

The cases, both English and Canadian, and they
are many, were all reviewed in Rex v. St. Lawrence[36]. McRuer C.J.H.C. states his
conclusion at pp. 228-9 and I would adopt this conclusion:

After the most earnest consideration that I
have been able to give the whole matter in the time at my disposal, I have come
to the conclusion that my decision must rest on this fundamental principle:

Where the discovery of the fact confirms
the confessions—that is, where the confession must be taken to be true by
reason of the discovery of the fact—then that part of the confession that is
confirmed by the discovery of the fact is admissible, but further than that no
part of the confession is admissible. Of all the authorities referred to, Taylor most nearly agrees with this view of
the law.

It is therefore permissible to prove in this
case the facts discovered as a result of the inadmissible confession, but not
any accompanying statement which the discovery of the facts does not confirm.
Anything done by the accused which indicates that he knew where the articles in
question were is admissible to prove the fact that he knew the articles were
there when that fact is confirmed by

[Page 301]

the finding of the articles; that is, the
knowledge of the accused is a fact, the place where the articles were found is
a fact. If he does or says something that indicates his knowledge of where the
articles are located, and that is confirmed by the finding of the articles,
then the fact of his knowledge is established. On the other hand, it is not
admissible to show that the accused said he put the articles where they were
found, as the finding of them does not confirm this statement. The finding of
them is equally consistent with the accused’s knowledge that some other person
may have put them in the place where they were found.

After stating the principle, he then reviewed
the evidence in detail and ruled out the admission in the confession that the
accused had thrown the object of the search over the fence into the place where
it was found. He confined the evidence to the finding.

In the case before us, although there is much to
be said for the inference that knowledge of the gun and its broken condition in
this obscure hiding place and its disclosure to the police does confirm the
confession of the accused that he threw it where it was found, I would defer to
the ruling in St. Lawrence and confine the evidence to the fact of
finding under the direction of the accused.

I would allow the appeal and direct a new trial.

HALL J. (dissenting)—Save as to what I
say later respecting Rex v. St. Lawrence[37], I am in agreement with the reasons
of Cartwright C.J.C. and would dismiss the appeal.

It must be conceded that a trial judge has, by
law, a measure of discretion to reject admissible evidence under certain
circumstances. Lord Du Parcq stated the principle in relation to the facts of
that case in Noor Mohamed v. The King[38]
as follows:

It is right to add, however, that in all
such cases the judge ought to consider whether the evidence which it is
proposed to adduce is sufficiently substantial, having regard to the purpose to
which it is profes-

[Page 302]

sedly directed, to make it desirable in the
interests of justice that it should be admitted. If, so far as that purpose is
concerned, it can in the circumstances of the case have only trifling weight,
the judge will be right to exclude it. To say this is not to confuse weight
with admissibility. The distinction is plain, but cases must occur in which it
would be unjust, to admit evidence of a character gravely prejudicial to the
accused even though there may be some tenuous ground for holding it technically
admissible. The decision must then be left to the discretion and the sense of
fairness of the judge.

It was developed as to other circumstances in Kuruma
v. The Queen[39], where
Lord Goddard said:

…No doubt in a criminal case the judge
always has a discretion to disallow evidence if the strict rules of
admissibility would operate unfairly against an accused. This was emphasized in
the case before this Board of Noor Mohamed v. The King, and in
the recent case in the House of Lords, Harris v. Director of Public
Prosecutions. If, for instance, some admission of some piece of evidence,
e.g., a document, had been obtained from a defendant by a trick, no doubt the
judge might properly rule it out. It was this discretion that lay at the root
of the ruling of Lord Guthrie in H.M. Advocate v. Turnbull

and in Callis v. Gunn[40], in which Lord Parker said:

That is dealing with admissibility in law,
and as Lord Goddard, C.J. points out, and indeed as is well known, in every
criminal case a judge has a “discretion to disallow evidence, even if in law
relevant and therefore admissible, if admissibility would operate unfairly
against a defendant. I would add that in considering whether admissibility
would operate unfairly against a defendant one would certainly consider whether
it had been obtained in an oppressive manner by force or against the wishes of
an accused person. That is the general principle.

and by Spence J. in Colpitts v. The Queen[41]. With respect, I am unable to
accept the view that what was said by the distinguished jurists in

[Page 303]

the foregoing quotations was obiter. Each
was recognizing in his own way relative to the facts of the particular case a
facet of the centuries-old broad principle developed in the administration of
British criminal justice that an accused has a constitutional right to a fair
trial.

This being so, what standard is available to
courts of appeal to measure the degree of discretion to be lawfully exercised
in any given case other than that the discretion be exercised judicially? That
is the only test applied in respect of statements admitted or rejected after a voir
dire however damaging they may be to an accused or however their exclusion
may benefit an accused.

Are courts of appeal going to claim an unlimited
discretion to interfere with the discretion lawfully possessed and judicially
applied by trial judges and is this Court going to claim an ultimate discretion
to weigh and, if necessary, find wanting that measure of discretion which
reposes initially in the trial judge or in the Court of Appeal?

Are we to set up some standard by which the
discretion of the trial judge is to be weighed on some imaginary scale
calibrated to meet the circumstances of each individual case? Surely the
established rule is that if the discretion has been judicially exercised by the
trial judge, it is not subject to review or to being weighed on appeal. It is a
rule of very general application in civil as well as in criminal matters and
ought not to be breached because in a particular instance it may have
contributed to a result which an appeal court considers undesirable.

Other parts of Wray’s statement were much more
damaging to him than the portion relating to the finding of the rifle taken by
itself, but the jurisdiction of the learned trial judge to exclude the
statement because it was not a voluntary one is unchallengeable. The rifle was
admissible in evidence as an exhibit apart altogether from the statement
because the ballistic expert testified that it was from that rifle that the
bullet which killed Donald Comrie came. No part of the

[Page 304]

statement was, therefore, necessary to identify
the rifle as the murder weapon. I express no opinion at this time on the
acceptance of St. Lawrence as a definitive statement of the
relevant law in Canada. The
practice based on St. Lawrence of blotting out or cutting out
portions of an accused’s statement and of giving to the jury the statement
edited and mutilated in this way is one which this Court in a proper case may
wish to review.

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—I have had the
opportunity of reading the reasons of Cartwright C.J.C. and also those of
Judson J. and Hall J. As did Hall J., I have come to the conclusion that I
agree with Cartwright C.J.C. I am of the opinion, however, that I should add
some short remarks.

As the Chief Justice pointed out, Aylesworth
J.A., in giving judgment for the Court of Appeal for Ontario[42] dismissing the appeal of the Crown to that
Court, assigned not only one but a second reason for the exercise of the
discretion by the learned trial judge in refusing to permit the evidence as to
the accused’s indication of the place where the weapon could be found saying:

In our view, a trial judge has a discretion
to reject evidence, even of considerable weight, if he considers that its
admission would be unjust or unfair to the accused or calculated to
bring the administration of justice into disrepute,…

(The underlining is my own.)

I am most strongly of the opinion that it is the
duty of every judge to guard against bringing the administration of justice
into disrepute. That is a duty which lies upon him constantly and that is a
duty which he must always keep firmly in mind. The proper discharge of this
duty is one which, in the present day of almost riotous disregard for the
administration of justice, is of paramount importance to the continued life of
the state.

In the present case, the confession or statement
of the accused and also the information given by the accused as to where the
weapon

[Page 305]

could be found, as Aylesworth J.A. pointed out,
were procured by trickery, duress and improper inducements and they were
clearly inadmissible. Moreover, as the Chief Justice of this Court has
indicated in his reasons the purpose of exercise of such trickery was stated by
the Inspector of the Provincial Police to avoid taking a chance that the
accused, as the result of speaking to his lawyer, would not take the police to
the place where the gun was found.

Under these circumstances, I am in agreement
with the Chief Justice when he characterized the description of the situation
by the Court of Appeal as not any overstatement.

I am of the opinion that were the trial judge to
have, as he very properly did, excluded as inadmissible the statement of the
accused and yet have permitted the Crown to have adduced all the evidence as to
the accused’s accompanying the police officers and pointing out to them the
place where the weapon had been thrown away, in accordance with the information
which he had given to them in the excluding statement, it would not only have
brought the administration of justice into disrepute but it would have been a
startling disregard of the principle of British criminal law, nemo tenetur
seipsum accusare. Surely no authority need be stated to establish that as
the most basic principle in our criminal law.

For these reasons, therefore, I also would
dismiss the appeal.

1970: June 12, 26.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Trial—Nonsuit—Inciting to
perjury—Trial without a jury—Acquittal at close of case for prosecution—Appeal
by Crown—Corroboration—Proof of falsity of facts to be stated under
oath—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 115, 407.

The respondent was acquitted by a judge
sitting without a jury on a charge of inciting to perjury. The evidence
established that a prisoner at the penitentiary handed over to a police officer
a letter written by the respondent, containing suggestions with regard to
testimony which the prisoner had been summoned to give in a criminal case.
After the close of the evidence for the prosecution, the defence counsel asked
the Court to order a nonsuit on the ground, inter alia, that sufficient
evidence to support a conviction had not been presented. By a majority
judgment, the Court of Appeal affirmed the acquittal. The Crown appealed to
this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.

[Page 954]

The record of the case shows that the trial
judge did order a nonsuit. This was therefore a decision on a question of law
on which the prosecution had a right of appeal.

Corroboration is not required to constitute
proof of incitement to perjury.

The letter was evidence against the
respondent in its entirety since the writer was the respondent himself. It is
difficult to see why the document could not be at the same time evidence of the
falsity of the facts which the third party was incited to state under oath, and
evidence of the inciting itself. The document did not give rise merely to a
suspicion but to an inference.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Queen’s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the acquittal of the respondent. Appeal allowed.

Louis Guy Robichaud, Q.C., and Bernard
Fournier, for the appellant.

Ivan Sabourin, Q.C., and André Régnier,
Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux C.J. and of Abbott and
Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—Being in substantial agreement
with the reasons for judgment of my brother Pigeon, I would dispose of the
appeal as he proposes.

The judgment of Martland and Pigeon JJ. was
delivered by

PIGEON J.—This appeal by the Crown is from a
majority decision whereby the Court of Queen’s Bench of the Province of Quebec[2] dismissed the appeal of the Crown from a
judgment acquitting the respondent on a charge of inciting to perjury. With the
consent of the accused, the trial was held before a judge sitting without a
jury. After the close of the evidence for the prosecution, the defence counsel
asked the Court to order a non-suit on the grounds that sufficient evidence to
support a conviction had not been presented. In fact, all that the evidence had

[Page 955]

established was that a prisoner at the
penitentiary had handed over to a police officer a letter written by the
accused, containing suggestions with regard to testimony which the prisoner had
been summoned to give in a criminal case. The contention that this does not
constitute proof of incitement to perjury rests on two propositions:

(1) corroboration was required;

(2) the suggested statements had to be proved
false, i.e. in conflict with the facts.

The first reason given by the majority for
dismissing the appeal was that the decision of the trial court was not really a
nonsuit, but rather an acquittal on the merits, for an insufficiency, not an
absence, of evidence. It was rightly pointed out that whereas the absence of
any evidence is a question of law, the insufficiency of the evidence is essentially
a question of fact. The right of appeal by the prosecution, however, is only on
a question of law.

With respect, I must observe that the record of
the case shows that the trial judge did order a nonsuit. He stated this
explicitly in his judgment and in his report to the Court of Appeal; this is
also borne out by the transcript. It is true that at the close of the argument,
after stating that he would reserve judgment on the motion, the judge told the
defence counsel: [TRANSLATION] “if you would rather offer a defence
nevertheless, you can be heard this afternoon, if that is convenient to you.”
The immediate reply to this suggestion was, as related by Casey J.:
[TRANSLATION] “I am so convinced, your lordship. I will not press the matter
further at this stage.” But counsel for the defence then proceeded to elaborate
on his answer, and concluded it by saying: [TRANSLATION] “And with respect, I
feel duty bound to ask for an acquittal because there is no evidence, not a
shred of evidence.” In view of this last statement, and of the fact that, after
it, the judge stated that he would reserve judgment on the motion for nonsuit
and subsequently rendered judgment accordingly, it is impossible to hold that
the nature of the proceeding was altered in the course of the argument. In my
opinion, the

[Page 956]

same must be said of what Hyde J. relates
concerning the exchange between the trial judge and the Crown prosecutor,
before the decision to reserve judgment was announced. Regarding the contents
of the judge’s report, I must respectfully point out that an absence, not an
insufficiency, of evidence is meant in the following reason: [TRANSLATION] “the
Crown did not adduce the evidence necessary to show that the charge is well
founded”.

In The King v. Morabito[3], this Court held that a nonsuit
pronounced on a motion by the defence after the close of the case for the Crown
is a decision on a question of law, namely the absence of evidence. This rule
was also held applicable to summary proceedings by the judgment in Feeley et
al. v. The Queen[4]. I
have found nothing in the 1955 Criminal Code  that might imply a change
in the principles underlying these judgments, nor has anything to this effect
been brought to our attention.

Turning now to the two grounds urged by counsel
for the respondent on the merits of the nonsuit, it must be said, first, that
nothing shows that corroboration is required. Section 115  of the Criminal
Code  has reference only to the offences mentioned in ss. 113  and 114 , i.e.
perjury and a false solemn declaration. Obviously, it also applies to
subornation of perjury, seeing that under s. 21  the suborner is a party to
the perjury; but here there was no perjury, and the charge is not one of
subornation, which implies that perjury was committed, but of inciting to
commit a perjury that was not in fact committed. This is, in other words, a
lesser offence created by s. 407  and punishable as an attempt to commit
the offence, not as the offence itself.

Counsel for the respondent has not succeeded in
showing a valid reason for extending the requirement for corroboration beyond
the specific provisions of the Criminal Code  in this respect. No such
rule is to be found in the law prior to codification. Taylor on Evidence (11th ed.,

[Page 957]

1920, para. 959), dealing with this
requirement before the adoption of the Perjury Act of 1911 (1-2 Geo. V,
c. 6) refers to perjury only. Of course, like other authors, he points out that
the Perjury Act laid down this requirement for all offences contemplated
in that Act, including that of inciting to perjury, but this is not what
our Code enacts.

As regards the proof of the falsity of the facts
which the letter incited the prisoner to state under oath, it must be pointed
out that the writer in this case was the accused himself: thus the document is
evidence against him in its entirety. Under our present system, an accused may
admit any fact alleged against him (Criminal Code , s. 562 ). It is
difficult to see why the document could not be at the same time evidence of the
falsity of the facts which the third party was incited to state under oath, and
as evidence of the inciting itself. This document does not give rise merely to
a suspicion, as the learned trial judge seems to have thought, but to an
inference. Since I must hold that a new trial is necessary, I refrain from
further comment.

For the foregoing reasons, I am of the opinion
that the judgment of the Court of Appeal and the verdict of acquittal should be
set aside, and a new trial of the respondent as charged should be directed.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal
law—Evidence—Confession—Admissibility—No statement, inculpatory or exculpatory,
admissible without voir dire.

The appellant was tried and acquitted on a
charge of non capital murder. The trial judge rejected a statement made by the
appellant to the police when

[Page 24]

she was questioned shortly after the
discovery of the victim’s body. After a lengthy voir dire, he held that
the statement was inculpatory and had not been made voluntarily. In her
testimony at the trial, the appellant told a totally different story than the
one contained in the statement which was not received in evidence. The Court of
Appeal directed a new trial, being of the opinion that the statement was
exculpatory and that it was not subject to the rules relating to confessions.
The accused appealed to this Court.

Held (Fauteux
and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Abbott, Martland, Ritchie, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.: There is no
distinction to be drawn between inculpatory and exculpatory statements as such
in so far as their admissibility in evidence when tendered by the Crown is
concerned. The admission in evidence of all statements made by an accused to
persons in authority, whether inculpatory or exculpatory, is governed by the
same rule. If the statement was given voluntarily, it will be admitted; if not
given voluntarily and the trial judge so rules, it will not be admitted.

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Spence J.: The supposed rule that an involuntary statement relative to
the offence with which an accused is charged is admissible against him if on
its face it is exculpatory is an anomaly which should be rejected from our law.
The right of an accused to remain silent is equally violated whether, when he
is coerced into making a statement against his will, what he says is on its
face inculpatory or exculpatory. It is difficult to see how the prosecution can
consistently urge that a statement forced from an accused is in reality
exculpatory while at the same time asserting that its exclusion has resulted in
the acquittal of the accused and that its admission might well have resulted in
conviction.

Per Fauteux
and Judson JJ., dissenting: The statement in question was exculpatory.
It denied guilt. It was an assertion by the accused that she had not shot the
man. A statement denying guilt cannot be a confession and is not therefore
subject to the rules relating to confessions. If a person chooses to give the
police an innocent explanation of his conduct and then at the trial goes into
the witness box and gives another innocent explanation incon-

[Page 25]

sistent with the first, it is entirely
appropriate for Crown counsel to cross-examine on this discrepancy and the
reasons for it. There should be no recognition of any right on the part of an
accused to tell the police one innocent story and then tell another innocent
story in the witness box without the jury knowing anything about the conflict
between the two.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Manitoba[1],
quashing a verdict of acquittal and directing a new trial. Appeal allowed,
Fauteux and Judson JJ. dissenting.

S.M. Froomkin, for the appellant.

H.E. Wolch, for the respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright C.J. and Spence J.
was delivered by

CARTWRIGHT C.J.—The relevant facts and the
course of the proceedings in the courts below are set out in the reasons of my
brothers Judson and Hall which I have had the advantage of reading.

I agree with the conclusion of my brother Hall
that we are free to say and should say that no statement made by an accused to
persons in authority should be admitted in evidence against him unless it is
shewn by the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement in the sense stated
by Lord Sumner in the passage from his reasons in Ibrahim v. Rex[2], quoted by my brother Hall, and that
this rule applies whether the statement sought to be admitted is inculpatory or
exculpatory.

I agree with the reasons of my brother Hall but
wish to add a few words as to why, in principle, an involuntary exculpatory
statement should be inadmissible.

The main reason assigned for the rule that an
involuntary confession is to be excluded is the danger that it may be untrue
but, as has been

[Page 26]

recently reasserted by this Court in DeClerq
v. The Queen[3], the
answer to the question whether such a confession should be admitted depends on
whether or not it was voluntary not on whether or not it was true.

It appears to me to involve a strange method of
reasoning to say that an involuntary statement harmful to the accused’s defence
shall be excluded because of the danger of its being untrue but that a harmful
involuntary statement, of which there is not merely a danger of its being false
but which the prosecution asserts to be false, should be admitted merely
because, considered in isolation, it is on its face exculpatory.

If, on the other hand, one regards the rule
against the admission of an involuntary statement as being based in part on the
maxim, nemo tenetur seipsum accusare, the right of an accused to remain
silent is equally violated whether, when he is coerced into making a statement
against his will, what he says is on its face inculpatory or exculpatory. I
find it difficult to see how the prosecution can consistently urge that a
statement forced from an accused is in reality exculpatory while at the same
time asserting that its exclusion has resulted in the acquittal of the accused
and that its admission might well have resulted in conviction.

In Best v. Samuel
Fox & Co. Ltd.[4], Lord
Porter said, at page 727:

The common law is a historical development
rather than a logical whole, and the fact that a particular doctrine does not
logically accord with another or others is no ground for its rejection.

In the same case, at page 733, Lord Goddard, who
agreed in the result, said:

…but English law is free neither of some
anomalies nor of everything illogical, but there is no reason for extending
them.

In my view, the supposed rule that an
involuntary statement relative to the offence with which an

[Page 27]

accused is charged is admissible against him if
on its face it is exculpatory is an anomaly which should be rejected from our
law.

While somewhat different considerations enter
into some of the decisions of the courts of the United States, in my opinion,
the law of Canada is correctly stated in the following passage from the reasons
of Traynor J., as he then was, in People of the State of California v.
Atchley[5],
quoted by Freedman J.A. in the case at bar:

Accordingly any statement by an accused
relative to the offence charged is inadmissible against him if made
involuntarily.

I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my
brother Hall.

The judgment of Fauteux and Judson JJ. was
delivered by

JUDSON J. (dissenting)—The appellant,
Ruth Thelma Piche, was charged with the non-capital murder of Leslie Pascoe in
the early morning of November 1, 1968. She had been living with Pascoe since
1964. The two had had an evening of drinking on October 31, 1968, along with
others. They returned home about midnight. There was evidence of quarrelling
during the evening and also on their return home, and of more and heavier
drinking, particularly on the part of Pascoe. At 2.30 a.m. on November 1, 1968,
the appellant called a taxi, which took her and her infant child to her
mother’s apartment. At 10.30 a.m. on November 1, Pascoe’s body was found in his
apartment. He had been shot by a gun which was found on a gunrack in the
bathroom. The police interviewed the appellant on the morning of November 2.
She was tried and acquitted on the charge of non-capital murder in February of
1969. In April 1969, the full Court of Appeal[6],
with one dissent, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial on the ground
that there was error in law in the ruling of the trial judge that a certain
statement was inculpatory and had not been proved to be free and voluntary
within the rules prescribed

[Page 28]

in Boudreau v. The King[7]. The majority in the Court of Appeal
was clearly of the opinion that the statement was exculpatory and that it was
not subject to these rules. On appeal to this Court, the same point is in
issue.

The statement in question was given to the
police by the appellant on November 2, 1968. It describes the events of the
evening—the drinking, the quarrelling, the return home and more drinking and
quarrelling after the return home. Then she says that she decided to go to her
mother’s apartment with the child. She puts the time of the call for the taxi
at 1.50 a.m. She says that when she left the apartment at 1.50 a.m., Pascoe was
asleep on the chesterfield.

I agree with the majority opinion of the Court
of Appeal that this statement is exculpatory and that no admission of guilt or
of any essential element in the charge of non-capital murder can be found in
it, and that the ruling of the trial judge was erroneous when he made it
subject to the rules relating to confessions. His reason for finding that the
statement was inculpatory was that it contained statements which went to the
questions of both opportunity and motive.

At the trial, the accused gave evidence that she
took the rifle from the rack with the intention of committing suicide, that it
accidentally discharged, with the bullet striking the deceased, and that she
then left the apartment.

I cannot accept the trial judge’s reasoning in
this case that the statement was inculpatory because it went to the question of
both opportunity and motive. This particular statement denied guilt. It was an
assertion by the accused that she had not shot the man. A statement denying
guilt cannot be a confession. As Wigmore said: “This ought to be plain enough
if legal terms are to have any meaning and if the spirit of the general
principle is to be obeyed.”

[Page 29]

The problem we have here has been repeatedly
before the courts since 1913, beginning with Rex v. Hurd[8], in the Alberta Court of Appeal. The
cases are all reviewed by Monnin J.A., in the present case and by MacKay J.A.
in Regina v. Black and Mackie[9].

The Courts of Appeal in Alberta, British Columbia,
Manitoba and Ontario have all held that a statement denying guilt is not
subject to the confession rule. The only possible exception to this line of
authority is to be found in the judgment of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in
Rex v. Scory[10]. The
British Columbia Court of Appeal refused to follow this decision. In so doing I
think they were right. Rex v. Scory is out of line with all other
authority in this country. In that case the charge was “rape” and the defence
at trial was “consent”. The accused was asked on cross-examination whether when
questioned by the police he had not given another innocent explanation, namely,
that he was not there at all. This line of cross-examination to me is clearly
permissible but it was stopped. It may well be that the foundation for the
decision in Scory was an adherence to what was thought to be the
principle in Gach v. The King[11] to
the effect that incriminating statements made by a person under detention as a
result of questions put to him by a person in authority were not admissible in
evidence unless a proper warning had been given him. It was stated in Boudreau
v. The King, supra, that this dictum in Gach was obiter.
Boudreau expresses the true rule in this country, that the test for the
admissibility of a confession is voluntariness.

Two statements were involved in Boudreau. The
first was the result of questioning before a

[Page 30]

warning had been given. The first statement was
essentially an alibi. The second statement after the warning had been given admitted
the murder. With one exception all the members of the court held that the
statements were voluntary. As to the first statement, the majority held that it
was incriminating and not exculpatory. Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau J. dissented
on this point. They would have held that in any event the confession rule did
not apply.

The dissenting reasons in the Manitoba Court of
Appeal in the present case refer to recent developments in the United States
which indicate that there is no difference between a confession and an
exculpatory statement. The matter seems to be summed up on this point in an
article entitled “Development in the Law of Confessions”, 79 Harvard Law Review
(1965‑66) pp. 1032-33, as follows:

Since Bram v. United States, 168
U.S. 532 (1897), the federal courts have generally applied the rules for
confessions to admissions and exculpatory statements, although there have been
occasional dicta to the contrary. In Bram, the defendant had been told
that another suspect had seen him commit the crime, to which he replied “he
could not see me from there.” Although the statement was intended as a denial
of the accusation, the prosecution offered it on the theory that the accused
had tacitly admitted that the suspect might have seen the crime from some other
place. The Supreme Court, in requiring the application of voluntariness rules,
seemed unconcerned by the exculpatory nature of the statement.

There is a certain trend in recent years to
adopt this liberal viewpoint. In People v. Atchley, the Supreme
Court of California ruled that “any statement by an accused relative to the
offense charged is inadmissible against him if made involuntarily.” In doing
so, the court that had once been so quick to distinguish between confessions
and admissions in the application of the voluntariness rules pointed out that
the rationale for exclusion was equally persuasive for both kinds of statement.
In Oregon, a 1957 amendment to the Criminal Code  extended the rules for
confessions to cover admissions. And Rule 63(6) of the Uniform Rules of
Evidence, which is in effect in Kansas, requires a showing of voluntariness for
any statement “relative to the

[Page 31]

offence charged.” But in spite of this
trend, probably most states still accept Wigmore’s view that admissions are not
subject to the rules of voluntariness.

The test which has led to this development seems
to be that a confession must be the result of a free and reasoned choice, and
that no distinctions among the categories of out-of-court statements can
constitutionally be made, and that the test for admissibility must be the same
for confessions, admissions and exculpatory statements.

Turning now to the position in England, the
starting point must be Ibrahim v. The King[12]. Ibrahim was concerned with a
confession. The statement was brief. It was this: In answer to the question why
he had done such a senseless act, the accused said: “Some three or four days he
had been abusing me; without a doubt I killed him.” The case was not concerned
with an admission falling short of a confession. Nothing, in my opinion, turns
upon the use of the word “statement” rather than “confession”. Nor did it in Boudreau
v. The King, which adopted Ibrahim as the standard to be
followed in this country.

Commissioners of Customs and Excise v. Harz and Power[13] involves
what are called admissions which were the result of prolonged questioning. The
accused were charged with defrauding the revenue. Customs officers seized
whatever books were available and then began to ask questions. One of the
accused, Harz, said “We are not talking”, but the officers told him that he
would be prosecuted if he did not answer and he did give certain answers on
that occasion. On subsequent occasions there was further questioning and he
made certain incriminating admissions. The conclusion of the House of Lords was
that these admissions would not have been made unless there had been a threat
of prosecution for refusal to answer, that there was no right to require Harz
to submit to this prolonged interrogation and that he could not have been pro-

[Page 32]

secuted for refusal to answer. These are the
facts of the case and I do not think that the case is authority for anything
more than this, that there is no distinction in principle between a man being
induced by a threat to make a full confession and a man similarly induced
making merely one or more incriminating admissions. This is the extent of the
case and it is so stated in Phipson on Evidence, 11th ed., (1970),
para. 791. It can have no application to a case where there is a complete
denial of commission of the crime as there is here.

The practical importance of the case under
review is obvious. It is an essential part of work of the police to ask
questions of suspects. It is only when the stage of confession is reached that
the confession rules apply. If a person chooses to give the police an innocent
explanation of his conduct and then at the trial goes into the witness box and
gives another innocent explanation inconsistent with the first, it is entirely
appropriate for Crown counsel to cross‑examine on this discrepancy and
the reasons for it. This is particularly needed when an alibi is set up as a
defence. There is no legislation in this country corresponding to the English
legislation, s. 11 of the Criminal Justice Act of 1967, which
requires the early and complete disclosure of the evidence in support of an
alibi. There should be no recognition of any right on the part of an accused
person to tell the police one innocent story and then tell another innocent
story in the witness box without the jury knowing anything about the conflict
between the two.

I would adopt the review of the problem
contained in the reasons of Monnin J.A. in this case and of MacKay J.A. in Regina
v. Black and Mackie, supra. I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Abbott, Martland, Ritchie, Hall,
Spence and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

HALL J.—The appellant was tried before Hunt J.
and a jury on an indictment charging:

That she the said Ruth Thelma Piche on or
about the 1st day of November, A.D. 1968 at the City of

[Page 33]

St. Vital in the Eastern Judicial District
in the Province of Manitoba did unlawfully murder Leslie Harrison Pascoe and
thereby committed non-capital murder.

She was acquitted. The Crown appealed to the
Court of Appeal for Manitoba[14] which
Court (Freedman J.A. dissenting) quashed the verdict of acquittal and directed
a new trial.

The issue in the Court of Appeal involved the
rejection by the learned trial judge of a statement made by the appellant to
the police when she was questioned shortly after the discovery of Pascoe’s body
whose death was said to have occurred between 1:22 A.M. and 4:22 A.M. on the
1st day of November, 1968. The appellant had been cohabiting with the deceased
for some considerable time prior to his death. After a lengthy voir dire, Hunt
J. held that the statement had not been made voluntarily and did not receive it
in evidence.

The Court of Appeal was asked to decide whether
or not the statement was ‘inculpatory’ or ‘exculpatory’. The Crown’s position
was and is that if the statement was inculpatory, the ruling by Hunt J. was
not, in the circumstances of this case, subject to review; if exculpatory, the voir
dire was unnecessary and the statement should have been admitted when
tendered by the Crown.

In the statement given to the police the
appellant said that she had not heard of Pascoe’s death until after she arrived
at her mother’s home, having left the deceased fast asleep in the apartment
they both occupied at or about 1:50 A.M. the same morning. The important
portion of the statement read:

I lay there about five or ten minutes and
couldn’t go to sleep so I got up and telephoned my mother, she was home so I
told her I was coming over to her place. I then ’phoned for a taxi, Duffy’s,
then went and dressed Lisa. I put a coat, a sweater, shoes and socks on her and
I too got dressed. Les was still asleep. I left the house at 1.50 in the
morning I think. After I arrived at my mother’s I slept on

[Page 34]

the chesterfield with Lisa. When I got
there my mother was up and so was her boarder Maurice Laliberty. I told them
we’d had a fight and that I wanted to stay with my mom.

In her testimony at the trial the appellant told
a totally different story, claiming that the killing of Pascoe was accidental,
that following a series of fights and unpleasant incidents between the deceased
and herself she had made up her mind to commit suicide; that in furtherance of
this state of mind she took a rifle from a weapon rack in the bathroom and upon
seeing the deceased asleep on the living room couch decided to go and kiss him
once more: that upon proceeding to do this the weapon accidentally discharged.
In her statement to the police she had admitted that she knew where the rifles
and the pistol were kept in the bathroom and that she knew how to open them and
had taken them from the rack a week before.

In dealing with the opposite contentions, Monnin
J.A., for the majority, said:

The only point in issue, as far as I am
able to see, is whether this statement was exculpatory or inculpatory. The
matter is not free from doubt; it has caused great difficulty to the profession
and the bench over the years. With respect, the conflicting decisions have
added to the confusion rather than helped to solve the problem. Clear and
easily understandable guide lines are necessary.

(Emphasis added)

He proceeded to a full review of the relevant
authorities as he saw them, and concluded:

Without difficulty I hold that in this case
the statement was exculpatory and that consequently the rule as to confessions
does not apply. It ought to have been ruled admissible without a voir dire. With
respect for those who hold a contrary view, I have no hesitation in concluding
that the learned trial Judge was in error in proceeding with a trial within a
trial and in ruling that the statement was inculpatory.

[Page 35]

Freedman J.A. in his dissent said:

We should be clear on what the Crown’s
submission involves. The Crown asks for the introduction in evidence of a
statement which the learned trial Judge has, with justification, found to have
been induced by persons in authority and which therefore could not qualify as
voluntary. The finding of the Court against voluntariness makes no difference,
says the Crown. Voluntary or involuntary, the statement was admissible, because
it was exculpatory. So we are being invited to set aside the jury’s verdict of
acquittal in order that on a new trial this involuntary, induced statement
should be placed before the jury. Unless clearly obliged by law to do so a
court in my view should be slow to accede to such a course.

and concluded on this aspect of the case that
the Court was without jurisdiction to hear the Crown’s appeal, being of the
view that the appeal did not raise a question of law in the strict sense.
However, having so expressed himself, he continued:

This lends weight to the conclusion I have
reached that the present appeal goes beyond a mere question of law. In the
light of that conclusion I could end here by dismissing this appeal for lack of
jurisdiction. But if I should be wrong in this—and the fact that the other
members of the Court take an opposing view makes this a distinct possibility—it
might be desirable for me to add some observations on issues that become
applicable if jurisdiction to hear this appeal exists.

and came to the conclusion that in his opinion
Hunt J. was right in holding the statement to be inculpatory. He then
continued:

I move to another issue. Assuming, contrary
to the learned Judge’s ruling, that the statement was wholly exculpatory, is it
then outside the rule? Does it become admissible without any proof that it was
voluntary? Yes, say most Canadian judges. No, say a few dissenters. The
jurisprudence on the subject is referred to in the judgment of my brother
Monnin. But, somewhat surprisingly, till now there has been no express majority
opinion on the point by the Supreme Court of Canada. Hence the question may
still be regarded as open. That certainly appeared to be the view of the Court
of Appeal of Ontario when,

[Page 36]

in the relatively recent case of Reg.
vs. Black and Mackie (1966) 1 O.R. 683, the majority could write thus:

It is quite clear that the rules which
govern the admission of the confession relate generally to what may be called
inculpatory statements; if the statement is totally exculpatory in its nature
other considerations may or may not apply. The cases are in conflict on this
point.

Having researched all the relevant decisions of
this Court on the subject of inculpatory vis‑a‑vis exculpatory
statements, I have concluded that Freedman J.A. was right when he said:

But, somewhat surprisingly, till now
there has been no express majority opinion on the point by the Supreme Court of
Canada. Hence the question may still be regarded as open.

(Emphasis added)

The leading authority in this Court is Boudreau
v. The King[15]. This
case was heard by Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand, Kellock, Estey and
Locke JJ. Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau J. (as he then was) expressly drew a
distinction between inculpatory and exculpatory statements while Kerwin J. (as
he then was) and Kellock J. implicitly accepted such a distinction. The other
three members of the Court did not discuss the issue of inculpatory versus
exculpatory statements.

In my view the time is opportune for this Court
to say that the admission in evidence of all statements made by an accused to
persons in authority, whether inculpatory or exculpatory, is governed by the
same rule and thus put to an end the continuing controversy and necessary
evaluation by trial judges of every such statement which the Crown proposes to
use in chief or on cross-examination as either being inculpatory or
exculpatory. The rule respecting the admission of statements is a judge-made
rule and does not depend

[Page 37]

upon any legislative foundation and I see no
impediment to making the rule clear and beyond dispute.

The classic case upon which virtually all recent
decisions on the subject are based is Ibrahim v. Rex[16], in which Lord Sumner said at pp.
609-610:

It has long been established as a positive
rule of English criminal law, that no statement by an accused is
admissible in evidence against him unless it is shewn by the
prosecution to have been a voluntary statement, in the sense that it has
not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage
exercised or held out by a person in authority. The principle is as old as Lord
Hale. The burden of proof in the matter has been decided by high authority in
recent times in Reg. v. Thompson, (1893) 2 Q.B. 12… (Emphasis
added)

It is of importance to note that in this passage
Lord Sumner does not qualify the word ‘statement’ in any way, but says that no
statement by an accused is admissible. In Boudreau, Rand J. said at
pp. 269-270:

The cases of Ibrahim v. Rex, (1914)
A.C. 599, Rex v. Voisin, (1918) 1 K.B. 531 and Rex v. Prosko, 63
S.C.R. 226, lay it down that the fundamental question is whether the statement
is voluntary. No doubt arrest and the presence of officers tend to arouse
apprehension which a warning may or may not suffice to remove, and the rule is
directed against the danger of improperly instigated or induced or coerced
admissions. It is the doubt cast on the truth of the statement arising from the
circumstances in which it is made that gives rise to the rule. What the statement
should be is that of a man free in volition from the compulsions or inducements
of authority and what is sought is assurance that that is the case. The
underlying and controlling question then remains: is the statement freely and
voluntarily made?

(Emphasis added)

A rule that exculpatory statements made to a
person in authority by an accused shall be subject on a voir dire to the
same requirements as inculpatory statements will not handicap the

[Page 38]

Crown. If the statement was given voluntarily,
it will be admitted: if not given voluntarily and the trial judge so rules, it
will not be admitted. The confusion which appears to have plagued trial judges
and appeal courts on the issue of inculpatory or exculpatory statements being
admissible with or without a voir dire appears to stem from a passage in
Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd ed. Wigmore concludes his discussion of the
matter by saying at p. 243:

Confessions are thus only one species of
admissions; and all other admissions than those which directly touch the fact
of guilt are without the scope of the peculiar rules affecting the use of
confessions.

Although Wigmore is an American author, the
courts of the United States have not followed his view on this important aspect
of the law of evidence. In Opper v. United States[17], Mr. Justice Reed, delivering
the judgment of the Supreme Court, after referring to the passage from Wigmore,
said:

It is urged by the Government, however,
that such requirement should not apply to exculpatory statements, that is,
those that explain actions rather than admit guilt. It is thought that
exculpatory statements do not have behind them the pressure of coercion or the
inducement of escaping the consequences of crime. This accords with Professor
Wigmore’s view. See note 7, supra. The statements here are exculpatory. See
summary, supra. There is no opinion of this Court declaring or declining such
an exception. We conclude that exculpatory statements, however, may not differ
from other admissions of incriminating facts. Given when the accused is under
suspicion, they become questionable just as testimony by witnesses to other
extrajudicial statements of the accused.

The same position was taken by Mr. Justice
Brennan in the Supreme Court in Wong Sun v. United States[18], when he said:

The Government also contends that Toy’s
declarations should be admissible because they were

[Page 39]

ostensibly exculpatory rather than
incriminating. There are two answers to this argument. First, the statements
soon turned out to be incriminating, for they led directly to the evidence
which implicated Toy. Second, when circumstances are shown such as those which
induced these declarations, it is immaterial whether the declarations be termed
‘exculpatory’. Thus we find no substantial reason to omit Toy’s declarations
from the protection of the exclusionary rule.

Of greater significance is the very recent
decision in the House of Lords in Commissioners of Customs and Excise v.
Harz et al.[19] In
that case, Harz was the central figure of an alleged conspiracy involving an
agreement to defraud the Department of Revenue by covering up the real amount
of trading in goods which were subject to purchase tax. The Crown wished to put
in as evidence statements made to customs officers as well as data extracted
from their books. The House of Lords held that under the statute involved the
officers had no right to submit the trader to interrogation. However, there
were very strong dicta concerning the common law position. Lord Reid at pp.
817-818 said:

Then it was argued that there is a
difference between confessions and admissions which fall short of a full
confession… But there appears to be no English case for more than a century in
which an admission induced by a threat or promise has been admitted in evidence
where a full confession would have been excluded… I can see no justification in
principle for the distinction. In similar circumstances one man induced by a
threat makes a full confession and another induced by the same threat makes one
or more incriminating admissions. Unless the law is to be reduced to a mere
collection of unrelated rules, I see no distinction between these cases. And it
is noteworthy that the new Judges’ Rules published in 1964 (Home Office
Circular No. 31/1964, p. 5) make no such distinction. They are clear and
emphatic:

…(e) That it is a fundamental condition of
the admissibility in evidence against any person, equally of any oral answer
given by that person

[Page 40]

to a question put by a police officer, or
of any statement (my italics) made by that person that it shall have
been voluntary in the sense that it has not been obtained from him by fear of
prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority
or by oppression. The principle set out in paragraph (e) above is overriding
and applicable in all cases.

The above paragraph “(e)” taken from the Judges’
Rules is quoted verbatim in Phipson on Evidence, 11th ed., 1970,
para. 791, p. 349, and the learned author continues by saying:

The classic formulation of the principle
applicable to the admissibility of confessions appears in Lord Sumner’s speech
in Ibrahim v. R. (1914) A.C. 599 at pp. 609-10. “It has long been
established as a positive rule of English criminal law that no statement by an
accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it is shown by the
prosecution to have been a voluntary statement in the sense that it had not
been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage
exercised or held out by a person in authority. The principle is as old as
Hale.”

Lord Reid also discussed the landmark case of Ibrahim
v. The King and noted that it made no distinction between
confessions and admissions. That case held that no statement is
admissible unless made voluntarily. Phipson emphasizes this fact in footnote 5
on p. 349 where he says: “Note, too, the principle formulated by Lord
Sumner commences with the words ‘no statement’…”

On the basis that there is no distinction to be
drawn between inculpatory and exculpatory statements as such in so far as their
admissibility in evidence when tendered by the Crown is concerned, I would
allow the appeal and restore the verdict of acquittal rendered by the jury.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA,
APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Non-capital
murder—Defences—Provocation—Drunkenness—Finding that legal tests of defences
not met—Finding that there was a loss of self-control—Conviction of manslaughter
not justified—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 201, 203, 417.

The appellant was charged with the
non-capital murder of his common law wife, by strangulation. Provocation and
drunkenness were the basic defences raised. The trial judge, who dealt with the
charge without a jury, rejected the defence of provocation, as he found that
the words attributed to the victim and relied on by the accused were not of
such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary

[Page 197]

person of the power of self-control. He also
rejected the defence of drunkenness, as he found that it did not render the
appellant incapable of forming the specific intent to kill. However, he
convicted him of the lesser offence of manslaughter because he found that the
combination of the two factors was sufficient to make the appellant lose his
self-control. On an appeal by the Crown, the Court of Appeal substituted a
verdict of non-capital murder. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held (Hall,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.: The Court of Appeal
has rightly held that the trial judge made an error in law in holding that the
combination of the defence of provocation and the defence of drunkenness,
neither of which he found to be a defence in itself on the facts of the case,
constituted a defence to the charge of non-capital murder. When the trial judge
found that the words attributed to the victim and relied on by the appellant
were not of such a nature as to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control, that was the end of the matter so far as the defence of
provocation was concerned. Any further inquiry with respect to provocation
became of no moment. When the trial judge also found that the appellant was not
incapacitated by drunkenness to form the intent to kill, the fact that the mind
of the appellant was found to be affected by drink so that he lost control and
more readily gave way to some violent passion, did not rebut the presumption
that, by applying pressure on the throat of the victim to the point of leaving
marks on her neck, he had intended to kill her. The error of the trial judge,
as was pointed out in the Court of Appeal, permeated and governed what he said
as to intent. In this error of law lies the ratio decidendi of his
verdict. In the circumstances of this case, there is no justification to
disturb the verdict entered by the Court of Appeal pursuant to s. 592(4)
of the Code.

Per Hall,
Spence and Laskin JJ., dissenting: The trial judge clearly rejected
provocation and drunkenness as defences. But he came to the conclusion that the
appellant was not guilty of non-capital murder because of his finding of lack
of intent. Having said that there was a loss of self-control, he went on to
consider whether there was the requisite intent to underpin a conviction of
non-capital murder. How-

[Page 198]

ever, he misdirected himself on the law on
this issue, when he ignored the prescription of intent, sufficient to support a
charge of murder, as including an intent to cause bodily harm that the accused
knows is likely to cause death and he is reckless whether death ensues or not.
There should be a new trial for non-capital murder.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of Alberta, Appellate Division, setting aside a conviction of manslaughter and
substituting thereto a verdict of non-capital murder. Appeal dismissed, Hall,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting.

Oskar H. Kruger, for the appellant.

B.A. Crane, for the respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux C.J. and of Abbott,
Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The appellant was charged with
having, on or about the 30th day of July 1968, at the City of Edmonton, in the
province of Alberta, unlawfully killed and slain Eileen Perrault, his
common-law wife, thereby committing the offence of non-capital murder. On the
9th of March 1969, he was convicted of the lesser offence of manslaughter by
Déchêne J., sitting without a jury as permitted by s. 417  of the Criminal
Code .

On the appeal of the Attorney-General of the
province, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, by a
unanimous judgment, set aside this conviction and substituted thereto a verdict
of non-capital murder.

Perrault now appeals from this decision,
pursuant to s. 597(2)(a) Cr. Code. Under this section, the appeal, from
the judgment a quo, is strictly limited to pure questions of law.

The issue is a simple one. The facts relevant
thereto may be briefly stated.

The appellant and Eileen Perrault lived
together, as man and wife, at the apartment of the latter, for nearly two
years. The appellant wanted to marry her and build a home. Some few weeks

[Page 199]

prior to Tuesday the 30th of July 1968, the day
of the fatal occurrence, they separated but, nonetheless, continued to consort
with one another. On Monday, the 29th, after having visited the mother of the
victim from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., they went to the Dover Hotel until 8 p.m. and
then to the Bonaventure Hotel, until closing time. At both places, they played
a few games of shuffleboard and each one consumed several glasses of beer. At
midnight, they arrived at the apartment. They then had a conversation during
which slightly less than two bottles of beer were consumed. The relevant parts
of this conversation which was brought to an end by the death of the woman,
appear in the following quotations from two statements made the same day by
Perrault to the police and from the evidence he gave at the trial.

In the first statement:

I recall Eileen asking me to go and get
some cigarettes and I said ‘what am I some kind of slave or something’ and then
she was on the floor and my hands were around her neck. After that I used the
belt.

In the second statement:

We had a couple of bottles of beer at home…
I am not too sure how many… but I recall sitting on the foot-stool arguing with
Eileen and the next thing I remember I had the belt around her neck. In the
three weeks that we’ve been separated I have felt that if I can’t have her
nobody else will.

In his evidence at trial:

A. Well at one point during our
conversation I recall telling Eileen that the previous weekend I had taken the
car and said I was going to kill myself and use the car to do it. I said if I
couldn’t live with her I didn’t want to live.

Q. Yes, any further conversation that you
recall?

A. She said something about if you want to
kill somebody why don’t you go to Vietnam where they have got a war on, she
said you haven’t got the guts to kill anybody.

Q. What happened then Mr. Perrault?

A. I don’t remember.

[Page 200]

Q. What is your next recollection of the
events of that evening.

A. I remember taking a belt from around
Eileen’s neck.

He testified that he then endeavoured to
resuscitate the woman by mouth-to-mouth respiration, that he awoke Délia
Cousineau, a room-mate of the deceased, telephoned the police, told them what
he had done and asked them for an ambulance.

The learned trial judge found that appellant
killed Eileen Perrault by strangulation. It is not disputed that appellant
first applied his hands to the throat of his victim, then took off the belt he
was wearing, wound it around her neck and applied a pressure which left marks
of ligature and resulted in death.

Provocation and drunkenness were the basic defences
raised by the accused.

With respect to provocation, the trial judge
held:

The test is not whether this (the words
attributed to the victim and relied on by the accused, at trial) deprived this
accused of his self-control, but whether it is sufficient to deprive an
ordinary person of the power of self-control. We must go further and must show
that the accused acted upon it on the sudden and before there was time for his
passion to cool. That by itself, in my view, does not in this case constitute a
defence because I don’t think the provocation was of that type.

With respect to drunkenness, the trial judge
found that:

…his state of intoxication, which, while
not slight, was far from an extreme case…

As to both defences, he concluded:

In the view that I take, it is my opinion
that neither of these defences by itself is available to the accused on the
facts of this case.

Thus, on the facts of the case, the trial judge
found that the legal test of validity of a defence of provocation, stated in
s. 203 Cr. C., had not been met, in that, particularly, the words
attributed to the victim and relied on by the accused were not of such a nature
as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control.
Thus, also, on the facts of the case, the

[Page 201]

trial judge found that the legal test of a valid
defence of drunkenness had not been met. The test is embodied in the two
well-known propositions of Lord Birkenhead, in Director of Public
Prosecutions v. Beard[1]:

That evidence of drunkenness which renders
the accused incapable of forming the specific intent essential to constitute
the crime should be taken into consideration with the other facts proved in
order to determine whether or not he had this intent.

That evidence of drunkenness falling short
of a proved incapacity in the accused to form the intent necessary to
constitute the crime, and merely establishing that his mind was affected by
drink so that he more readily gave way to some violent passion, does not rebut
the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his acts.

However, having so found on the facts, the
learned trial judge went on to say:

In my view, the combination of that
provocation however slight, and his consumption of alcohol, his state of
intoxication, while not slight, was far from an extreme case, those two factors
were sufficient that he lost his self-control. That he did not intend to cause
the death I think is shown by his actions immediately after. He woke Delia and
said: ‘Come and see what I have done to Eileen’. He phoned the police and told
them that there was a strangled woman there and that he had done it, he wanted
an ambulance and the police. His statement to Constable Hollinshead when that
constable arrived and he says: ‘I am the bastard that did it’. His action in
endeavouring to resuscitate her with mouth-to-mouth respiration, in my view all
indicate that he suddenly realized the enormity of his act and lead me to
believe that he did not intend the result which ensued.

* *
*

and the trial judge concluded his reasons by
saying:

Looking at the case therefor in its entirety I
have come to the conclusion that the Crown have failed

[Page 202]

to satisfy me beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused intended the death of the deceased and I therefore do not find him
guilty of non-capital murder as charged. However, it appears clear that the
culpable homicide which he has committed is within the definition of
manslaughter and I find him guilty of that offence.

(The italics are mine.)

In the view of the Court of Appeal, the trial
judge made an error in law in thus holding that the combination of the defence
of provocation and the defence of drunkenness, neither of which he found to be
a defence in itself on the facts of the case, constituted a defence to the charge
of non-capital murder. With this view of the Court of Appeal, I am in
respectful agreement.

The trial judge having found, particularly, that
the words attributed to the victim and relied on by the accused were not of
such a nature as to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control,
that was the end of the matter so far as the defence of provocation was
concerned; for, under s. 203 Cr. C., the words of provocation are to be
assessed according to the effect they would have on a reasonable man and when
this objective test is found not to have been met on the facts of the case, any
further enquiry with respect to provocation becomes of no moment.

The trial judge having also found that the
accused was not incapacitated by drunkenness to form the intent to kill the
woman, the fact that the mind of the accused was found to be affected by drink
so that he lost control and more readily gave way to some violent passion, did
not rebut the presumption that, by applying pressure, first with his hands and
then with his belt, on the throat of the victim, to the point of leaving on her
neck marks of ligature, he intended to kill her or, to say the least,—a point
which the trial judge failed to consider though, had he done so, the result
must be expected to have been the same,—he intended to cause her bodily harm
known to him to be likely to cause death and being reckless whether death
ensued or not.

[Page 203]

In Attorney General for Northern Ireland v.
Gallagher[2], the
law on drunkenness as a defence to a crime is restated in these terms by Lord
Denning, at pp. 380 and 381:

(a) It may impair a man’s
powers of perception so that he may not be able to foresee or measure the
consequences of his actions as he would if he were sober. Nevertheless he is
not allowed to set up his self-induced want of perception as a defence. Even if
he did not himself appreciate that what he was doing was dangerous,
nevertheless if a reasonable man in his place, who was not befuddled with
drink, would have appreciated it, he is guilty: see Rex v. Meade (1909) 1 K.B.
895, as explained in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard (supra).

(b) It may impair a man’s power to
judge between right or wrong, so that he may do a thing when drunk which he
would not dream of doing while sober. He does not realize he is doing wrong.
Nevertheless he is not allowed to set up his self-induced want of moral sense
as a defence. In Beard’s case (supra) Lord Birkenhead L.C. distinctly ruled
that it was not a defence for a drunken man to say he did not know he was doing
wrong.

(c) It may impair a man’s power of
self-control so that he may more readily give way to provocation than if he
were sober. Nevertheless he is not allowed to set up his self‑induced
want of control as a defence. The acts of provocation are to be assessed, not
according to their effect on him personally, but according to the effect they
would have on a reasonable man in his place. The law on this point was
previously in doubt (see the cases considered in Beard’s case), but it has
since been resolved by Reg. v. McCarthy (1954) 38 C.A.R. 74, Bedder v. Director
of Public Prosecutions (1954) 38 C.A.R. 133, and section 3 of the Homicide
Act, 1957.

Lord Denning then indicated that the general
principle of English law as to drunkenners, illustrated as above in (a),
(b) and (c), is subject to two exceptions which, in my
opinion, in view of the finding of facts in this case, have no application in
this instance.

[Page 204]

I cannot convince myself that the error of the
trial judge, which was pointed out in the Court of Appeal, does not permeate
and govern what, as above indicated, he said, as to intent, either in the
reasons he gave to render a verdict of manslaughter or in what he said
thereafter in proceeding to sentence the accused. In this error of law lies the
ratio decidendi of the verdict of the trial judge.

Section 592(4)  of the Criminal Code  provides
that

(4) Where an appeal is from an acquittal
the court of appeal may

(a) dismiss the appeal; or

(b) allow the appeal, set aside the
verdict and

(i) enter a verdict of guilty with respect
to the offence of which, in its opinion, the accused should have been found
guilty but for the error in law, and pass a sentence that is warranted in law,
or

(ii) order a new trial.

Pursuant to that section, the Court of Appeal
allowed the appeal, set aside the verdict and entered a verdict of guilty with
respect to the offence of non-capital murder of which, in its opinion, the
accused should have been found guilty but for the above error in law.

Under all the circumstances of this case, I am
unable to find any justification to disturb the unanimous conclusion arrived at
in the Court of Appeal. I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Hall, Spence and Laskin JJ. was
delivered by

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—In allowing the
Crown’s appeal against the acquittal of the accused of non-capital murder, and
in itself entering a conviction on that charge (in place of the conviction at
trial of manslaughter), the Alberta Appellate Division founded itself on an
alleged error of law by the trial judge which, even if it occurred, was not, in
my view, at the heart of his ruling of acquittal. There was a proper ground
upon which the acquittal should have been set aside, but it was a ground not
taken by the

[Page 205]

Appellate Division and, moreover, it was one
which called for a new trial and not for a conviction on the original charge.

I am confirmed in this appraisal by the Crown’s
notice of appeal to the Alberta Appellate Division as well as by the reasons of
the trial judge. Only two grounds of appeal were taken by the Crown in
challenging the acquittal of non-capital murder, and they were as follows:

The learned trial Judge erred in law in
misdirecting himself, to the effect that the Respondent’s loss of self control
was a factor, when it did not amount to provocation.

The learned trial Judge erred in law in
failing to direct himself to consider the question whether the Respondent meant
to cause bodily harm to the deceased that he knew was likely to cause her
death, and was reckless whether death ensued or not.

The reasons of the Appellate Division were, I am
bound to say, unusually brief. They consisted of six sentences of which three
were what might properly be called formal. The substance of the reasons was in
the remaining three sentences which were these:

The learned trial judge found that neither
the defence of provocation nor of drunkenness taken by itself was available to
the accused on the facts of the case.

Notwithstanding these findings, he held
there was a combination of provocation and drunkenness and accordingly found
the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.

In our view, he made an error in law in
holding that a combination of these two defences, neither of which was a
defence in itself, constituted a defence to the charge of non-capital murder.

The trial judge who dealt with the charge of
non-capital murder without a jury (pursuant to the election or consent of the
accused as permitted in Alberta under s. 417  of the Criminal Code )
did clearly reject provocation and drunkenness as defences. To this extent, the
Appellate

[Page 206]

Division was correct. But just as clearly the
trial judge came to the conclusion that he did because of his finding of lack
of intent. I think the Appellate Division took too great a liberty of
construction of the single sentence in the trial judge’s reasons where he said
that the facts upon which the defences of provocation and drunkenness were
posited were sufficient to show a loss of self-control. Earlier in his reasons
he had adverted to the question of intent as the distinguishing element between
murder and manslaughter. Having said that there was a loss of self-control, he
went on to consider whether there was the requisite intent to underpin a
conviction of non-capital murder.

I think that he misdirected himself on the law
on this issue, as the Crown in its notice of appeal to the Appellate Division
pointed out. But on his assessment of the facts he concluded that there was no
intent to cause death. He summed up his review of the evidence in these words:

Looking at the case therefore in its
entirety I have come to the conclusion that the Crown have failed to
satisfy me beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended the death of the
deceased… (The underlining is mine.)

In the result, he acquitted of non-capital
murder and convicted of manslaughter.

Were it not for the error of law on the question
of intent, the finding of the trial judge on this issue would not alone have
given the Crown a right of appeal: see Criminal Code , s. 584 (1)  (a).
The reasons at the trial also disclose a serious error against the accused in
the statement that “in law everyone is presumed to intend the natural and
reasonable consequences of his act”, but in view of the trial judge’s verdict,
this misdirection had no adverse effect.

Nothing said by the trial judge appears to me to
justify the Appellate Division’s assertion that “notwithstanding these findings
[against the defences of provocation or drunkenness], he held there was a
combination of provocation and

[Page 207]

drunkenness and accordingly found the
accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter”. (The underlining is
mine.) This is a far too selective piece of interpretation which ignores the
considerable portion of the reasons that concentrated on the issue of intent.
The evidence may very well have supported a finding of the requisite intent,
but I do not think that it was open to the Appellate Division on the record in
this case to make that finding on the appeal that was before it. Indeed, I am
of the opinion that the Appellate Division ought to have treated the verdict
rendered by the trial judge alone with at least as much respect as it would
accord to the verdict of a jury in a like case. Had it done so, it could not
have substituted another verdict of its own for that of the trial judge on what
is essentially a matter of fact.

It is necessary, of course, in cases where
drunkenness is raised as a defence, or where on the evidence it may be a
defence, to a charge of murder, to avoid confusing the effect of drunkenness on
the capacity to form the requisite intent with the question whether there was
such intent in fact. The rejection of the one (that is, as a defence) does not
automatically result in the establishment of the other. The distinction is
evident in the opposing views taken in the judgments of this Court in The
Queen v. Lupien[3], where
the issue revolved around the admissibility of certain psychiatric evidence,
and turned on whether, on one view of the evidence, it went to show that the
accused was mentally incapable of forming the intent to commit a homosexual
offence or whether, on another view, it was offered to show that he did form
the intent in that case.

In the present case, the trial judge left
drunkenness (as referable to capacity to form the requisite intent) behind when
he rejected it as a defence; and, in going on to deal with intent in fact, he
was concerned with a different issue. It may be that his literary expression
was deficient, but there can be no mistaking the burden of his remarks. Crown
counsel certainly did not mistake

[Page 208]

them if regard is had to the formulation of his
notice of appeal to the Appellate Division. He was, I may note, counsel for the
Crown at the trial.

I referred earlier to the trial judge’s error of
law on the question of intent, an error which removed a possible prop of the
Crown’s case. What he said on the matter was this (and I may say here that the
same appreciation of intent was repeated in other portions of the reasons):

If the acts of the accused which caused the
death were done with the intention of causing that death or were done
recklessly without any regard as to whether death followed or not, then it is
murder.

It is evident from this that the trial judge
ignored the prescription of intent, sufficient to support a charge of murder,
as including an intent to cause bodily harm that the accused knows is likely to
cause death and he is reckless whether death ensues or not: see
s. 201 (a)(ii) of the Criminal Code . If it be said that despite the
inapt formulation he must undoubtedly have had the correct principles in mind,
we are left with a finding of fact which, on the view of the matter I have
taken, would deprive the Appellate Division of the power to interfere. I think I
should in this case take the trial judge at his word.

For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the
appeal and direct a new trial for non-capital murder.

Present: Cartwright C.J. and Fauteux,

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Summary conviction—Criminal
negligence in operation of motor vehicle—Conviction of dangerous driving—Appeal
by accused by way of trial de novo—Conviction for criminal negligence in
operation of motor vehicle—Conviction not proper—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.),
c. 51, ss. 221(1), (4), 569(4), 720(a), 727(1).

The appellant was charged with criminal
negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle, contrary to s. 221(1)  of the Criminal
Code , and was tried by way of summary conviction. He was convicted of the
included offence of driving in a manner that was dangerous to the public,
contrary to s. 221(4) of the Code. On appeal by way of a trial de novo pursuant
to s. 720 of the Code, the County Court judge convicted him of the offence of
criminal negligence as originally charged. The main argument raised in the
Court of Appeal, as well as in this Court, is that the appeal by way of a trial
de novo was concerned only with the lesser offence of which he was
convicted and not with the major offence of criminal negligence with which he
was charged. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and held that the Court,
on an appeal by way of a trial de novo is required to try the accused on
the charge as originally laid. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held (Fauteux
and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Abbott, Martland, Ritchie, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.: The only issue
which the County Court judge was authorized and required to hear and determine
on the holding of a trial de novo in the present case was the issue of
the guilt or innocence of the accused on the charge of which he was convicted
and from which he had appealed. The trial de novo for which provision is
made under s. 727(1) takes the form of an entirely new trial of

[Page 1023]

any issue raised by the notice of appeal. The
County Court judge purported to register a conviction against the appellant
under s. 221(1)  in the absence of any appeal whatever from the magistrate’s
finding that the evidence did not prove that offence. Any construction of
s. 727(1) which would result in a retrial of the charge alleged in the
original information when that charge has been dismissed by the magistrate and
there is no appeal from his dismissal, would be inconsistent with the appeal
provisions of Part XXIV. Sections 720(a)(i) and 727(1) make
provision for an appeal by the defendant on his “conviction” as distinct from
the “charge” described in the information upon which he was arraigned before
the magistrate.

Section 569(4) applies to the charges
either in an information or an indictment and therefore authorized the
magistrate to convict as he did under s. 221(4).

Per Fauteux
and Judson JJ., dissenting: The appeal by way of a trial de novo is
not a new trial ordered by the Court as may be the case in an appeal under Part
XVIII, but a statutory right given to a defendant to have his trial recommenced
before another judge and another jurisdiction. Once an appeal is taken by an
accused under s. 720, the Court appealed to is required by s. 727(1) to try the
accused on the charge as laid. This was the law prior to the coming into force
of the new Code in 1955. The law has not been changed in this respect under the
new Code. The argument that ss. 720(a)(i) and 727(1) make provision for
an appeal by the defendant on a “conviction” as distinct from the “charge”
described in the information upon which he was arraigned before the magistrate
and that these provisions have been invoked by the appellant in the present
case through filing and service of notice of appeal in accordance with s. 722,
must be rejected. The word “conviction” in ss. 720(a)(i), 722(1)(a)(i)
and 727(1) is not used “as distinct from the charge” but as distinct from an
order made or the sentence passed upon a defendant.

The provisions of s. 569(4) of the Code are
applicable to summary conviction proceedings.

[Page 1024]

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], affirming the
appellant’s conviction for criminal negligence in the operation of a motor
vehicle. Appeal allowed, Fauteux and Judson JJ. dissenting.

Austin M. Cooper, Q.C., and G.H. Marsden,
Q.C., for the appellant.

Ian Cartwright, for the respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Abbott,
Martland, Ritchie, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—The appellant was initially charged
before Magistrate Andrews by way of Information with criminal negligence in the
operation of his motor vehicle contrary to s. 221(1)  of the Criminal Code , but
at trial the Magistrate convicted him only of the lesser offence of driving in
a manner that was dangerous to the public contrary to s. 221(4) . In making this
conviction the learned Magistrate was, in my opinion, acting under the
authority of s. 569(4) of the Code which reads as follows:

569. (4) Where a count charges an
offence…under subsection (1)  of section 221, and the evidence does
not prove such offence but does prove an offence under subsection (4) of
section 221 or subsection (1) of section 226A, the accused may
be convicted of an offence under subsection (4) of section 221 or
subsection (1) of section 226A, as the case may be.

It is thus apparent that the conviction entered
by the Magistrate under s. 221(4) involved a finding that the evidence did not
prove an offence under s. 221(1)  and there was no appeal from that finding.

It has been suggested that the provisions of s.
569(4) do not apply to summary conviction offences and that although the
offences defined in ss. 221(1)  and 221(4)  are punishable both as indictable
offences and as offences punishable on summary conviction, the reference to
these sec-

[Page 1025]

tions in s. 569(4) must be taken to refer
exclusively to charges by way of indictment and can therefore have no
application in the present case.

This argument is based on the fact that s. 569
occurs in Part XVII of the Code which Part bears the heading “Procedure by
Indictment”. If this argument were valid it would mean that a great many
sections which are to be found in Part XVII and which are universally
applied in the trial of summary conviction offences, have no application at all
at such trials. I refer by way of example to the provisions for the accused
being present in Court during his trial, (s. 557), the requirement for the
corroboration of the evidence of children (s. 566), and the procedure whereby
an accused may be convicted of an attempt to commit the offence charged (s.
567).

It will be noted that the cases in which the provisions
of Part XVII are made referable to indictable offences only and where this does
not plainly appear from the context, the relevant provisions of the Code
specifically state that they are referable only to indictable offences by using
such words as “An accused who is charged with an indictable offence...” (s.
525) or “Where an indictment charges...” (s. 519(1)) or “Where an accused is on
trial for an indictable offence...” (s. 562).

In the case of s. 569(4), the opening words of
the section are “Where a count charges an offence…”. In this regard
reference may usefully be had to s. 2 (8) of the Code which provides:

2. In this Act,

(8) ‘count’ means a charge in an
information or indictment;…

In my opinion s. 569(4) applies to charges
either in an Information or an indictment and therefore applies to the present
case so as to authorize the Magistrate to convict as he did under subs. (4) of
s. 221.

In the present case the only appeal was that of
the appellant from his conviction for dangerous driving and this appeal was
taken to the County

[Page 1026]

Court of the County of Peel in accordance with the provisions of s. 720 (a) of
the Criminal Code .

After hearing a trial de novo held
pursuant to s. 727(1) of the Code, His Honour Judge E.W. Grant convicted
the appellant of the offence of criminal negligence contrary to s. 221(1)  and
from that conviction the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal of Ontario
alleging that the County Court Judge had exceeded his jurisdiction which was
limited to the determination of the appellant’s guilt or innocence of the
offence of which he was convicted and that the issue to be determined at the
trial de novo was limited by the terms of the Notice of Appeal to the
County Court. In a unanimous judgment delivered by Gale C.J.O., the Court of
Appeal[2]
dismissed this appeal and it is from this decision that the appellant now
appeals.

At all times material hereto, the relevant
portions of the Criminal Code  applicable to appeals under Part XXIV as
they relate to this case read as follows:

720. Except where otherwise provided by
law,

(a) the defendant in
proceedings under this Part may appeal to the appeal court

(i) from a conviction or order made against
him, or

(ii) against a sentence passed upon him;
and

(b) the informant, the Attorney
General or his agent in proceedings under this Part may appeal to the appeal
court

(i) from an order dismissing an information
or 

(ii) against a sentence passed upon a
defendant.

722. (1) Where an appeal is taken under
section 720 , the appellant shall

(a) prepare a notice of
appeal in writing setting forth

(i) with reasonable certainty the
conviction or order appealed from or the sentence appealed against, and

(ii) the grounds of appeal;

(b) cause the notice of
appeal to be served upon

(i) the summary conviction court that made
the conviction or order or imposed the sentence or

[Page 1027]

such other person as a judge of the appeal
court directs, and

(ii) the respondent or, where the
respondent is the informant or complainant, such other person as a judge of the
appeal court directs,

within thirty days after the conviction or
order was made or the sentence was imposed, whichever is the later; and

(c) file in the office of the clerk
of the appeal court

(i) the notice of appeal referred to in
paragraph (a), and

(ii) an affidavit of service of the notice
of appeal,

not later than seven days after the last
day for service of the notice of appeal upon the respondent and the summary
conviction court.

Section 723 reads:

723. (1) Where an appellant has complied with
section 722, the appeal court or a judge thereof shall set down the appeal
for hearing at a regular or special sittings thereof and the clerk of the
appeal…

Section 726(1) provides that:

726. (1) Where a summary conviction court
is served with a copy of the notice referred to in paragraph (b) of
subsection (1) of section 722, that court shall transmit the
conviction, order or order of dismissal and all other material in its
possession in connection with the proceedings to the appeal court before the time
when the appeal is to be heard, or within such further time as the appeal court
may direct, and the material shall be kept by the clerk of the court with the
records of the appeal court.

Section 727 contains the general provisions
providing for the hearing of the appeals in such cases. That
section reads, in part:

727. (1) Where an appeal has been lodged in
accordance with this Part from a conviction or order made against a defendant,
or from an order dismissing an information, the appeal court shall hear and
determine the appeal by holding a trial de novo, and for this purpose
the provisions of sections 701 to 716, insofar as they are not
inconsistent with sections 720  to 732 , apply, mutatis mutandis.

[Page 1028]

It has been held more than once in this Court, (Dennis
v. The Queen[3]), (The
Queen v. Dennis[4]), that
the existence of a valid Notice of Appeal filed and served in accordance with
s. 722 is a condition precedent to the exercise of the jurisdiction vested
in the Court of Appeal under s. 727(1) and it follows, in my opinion, that a
County Court Judge acting under the latter section is only authorized and
required “to hear and determine the appeal by holding a trial de novo” in
respect of the issues raised in a Notice of Appeal which has been so filed and
served. In the present case the learned County Court Judge purported to
register a conviction against the appellant under s. 221(1)  in the absence of
any appeal whatever from the Magistrate’s finding that the evidence did not
prove that offence. I do not find it necessary to decide whether an appeal in
fact lies by the informant or the Attorney General from such a finding because
I take the view that the controlling factor in this case is that no such appeal
was taken.

In my view the trial de novo for which
provision is made under s. 727(1) takes the form of an entirely new trial of
any issue raised by the Notice of Appeal. At the hearing under that
section the issue is to be determined without any reference, except for
the purpose of cross-examination, to the evidence called in the court appealed
from and upon a fresh determination based upon evidence called anew and perhaps
accompanied by entirely new evidence (See The Queen v. Dennis, supra).

In my opinion, the only issue which the County
Court Judge was authorized and required to hear and determine on the holding of
a trial de novo in the present case was the issue of the guilt or
innocence of the accused on the charge of which he was convicted and from which
he had appealed.

Counsel for the respondent stressed the fact
that in the last two lines of s. 727(1) it is provided that for the purpose of
a trial de novo “the provisions of sections 701 to 716 insofar as
they are not inconsistent with sections 720  to 732 ,

[Page 1029]

apply mutatis mutandis”, and it was
argued that these words have the effect of making s. 711 of the Code apply in
the case of a trial de novo.

Section 711 reads as follows:

711. When the summary conviction court has
heard the prosecutor, defendant and witnesses it shall, after considering the
matter, convict the defendant or make an order against him or dismiss the
information, as the case may be.

It was contended that applying this section, mutatis
mutandis to a trial de novo under s. 727(1) necessarily
involves placing the original information in issue at such a trial. It is to be
remembered, however, that the provisions of s. 711 are only made applicable to
appeals under Part XXIV of the Code “insofar as they are not inconsistent with
sections 720  to 732 ...”, and in my view any construction of s. 727(1)
which would result in a retrial of the charge alleged in the original
information when that charge has been dismissed by the Magistrate and there is
no appeal from his dismissal, would be inconsistent with the appeal provisions
of Part XXIV.

The words “mutatis mutandis” as they
occur in s. 727(1) are, in my opinion, to be taken as meaning “with the
necessary changes in points of detail” (see Regina v. Ferris[5], per Williams C.J.), and I do not
think that they in any way assist the matter when the application of the
provisions of one of the sections to which they relate is “inconsistent
with sections 720  to 732 ...”.

The argument has been advanced in support of the
position taken by the respondent that the trial de novo for which
provision is made in s. 727(1) is intended to be the same as the appeal
described in s. 754 of the old Criminal Code . That section read, in
part, as follows:

In every case of appeal from any summary
conviction or order had or made before any justice, the court to which such
appeal is made shall, notwithstanding any defect in such conviction or order,
and notwithstanding that the punishment imposed or the order made may be in
excess of that which might

[Page 1030]

lawfully have been imposed or made, hear
and determine the charge or complaint on which such conviction or order has
been had or made, upon the merits, and may confirm, reverse or modify the
decision of such justice, or may make such other conviction or order in the
matter as the court thinks just, and may by such order exercise any power which
the justice whose decision is appealed from might have exercised, and may make
such order as to costs to be paid by either party as it thinks fit.

In commenting on this section the Courts,
in a substantial number of cases, have referred to the appeal therein described
as “a hearing de novo” and it is contended that when the words “trial de
novo” were adopted in drafting s. 727(1) it was against the background of
legal decisions which interpreted these words as meaning the appeal for which
provision was made in s. 754. On this basis it is suggested that the trial de
novo described in s. 721(1) gives the County Court Judge the power to “hear
and determine the charge or complaint on which” a “conviction or
order had been had or made upon the merits...”. (The italics are my own). If
this were the case the County Court Judge would have jurisdiction to hear and
determine the charge as originally laid before the magistrate and would thus
have had authority to convict the accused under s. 221(1) of the Code.

I am, however, of opinion that ss. 720 (a)(i)
and 727(1) make provision for an appeal by the defendant on his “conviction” as
distinct from the “charge” described in the information upon which he was
arraigned before the magistrate and that these provisions have been invoked by
the appellant in the present case through the filing and service of a Notice of
Appeal in accordance with s. 722. With the greatest respect for those who hold
a different opinion, I take the view that the meaning of the provisions for
appeal under Part XXIV of the Code, which was in force at the relevant times,
carry this meaning.

It should perhaps be observed that these reasons
are limited to a case in which a magistrate has found that the charge alleged in
the

[Page 1031]

original information has not been proved and has
therefore entered a conviction for an included offence, and where there has
been no appeal from the dismissal of the more serious charge.

In a case where an accused is appealing from a
conviction of the charge as laid in an information, I have no doubt that the
County Court Judge would have jurisdiction to convict of an included offence,
but the situation here is that it has been found that the evidence called
before the magistrate does not prove the offence of criminal negligence and
there is no appeal from this finding.

For all these reasons I would allow this appeal,
set aside the conviction under s. 221(1)  made by His Honour Judge Grant and
restore the conviction under s. 221(4) which was made by Magistrate Andrews.

The judgment of Fauteux and Judson JJ. was
delivered by

FAUTEUX J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[6].

Originally charged with criminal negligence, (s.
221(1)  Cr. C.) in the operation of a motor vehicle on September 10, 1967, the
appellant was tried by way of summary conviction and found guilty by Magistrate
H.T.J. Andrews of the included offence of dangerous driving (s. 221(4) Cr.
C), pursuant to s. 569(4) of the Code. He then appealed by way of a trial de
novo to the County Court pursuant to s. 720  of the Criminal Code . At
the end of the trial de novo, Judge E.W. Grant who had heard and
considered anew all the evidence and argument, convicted the accused of
criminal negligence as charged. Hence the appeals of Rickard to the Court of
Appeal for Ontario and,
thereafter, to this Court.

The main argument raised in the Court of Appeal,
as well as in this Court, is that the appellant having been found guilty, by
the Magistrate, of the lesser offence, under s. 221(4), his appeal by way of a trial
de novo before the County

[Page 1032]

Court Judge was concerned only with that offence
and not with the major offence of criminal negligence under s. 221(1)  with
which he was charged. The Court of Appeal rejected that submission as
ill-founded and stated that once an appeal is taken by an accused under
s. 720 , the Court appealed to is required by s. 727(1) to try the accused
on the charge as laid.

That such was the law, prior to the coming into
force of the new Code on the 1st of April 1955, is made clear by ss. 752 and 754 of the former Code. Indeed, s.
752 provided that “the Court appealed to shall try and shall be the absolute
judge of the facts in respect to such conviction or order”; and s. 754 provided
that the Court to which the appeal was made “shall hear and determine the
charge or complaint on which such conviction or order has been had or made,
upon the merits” and could confirm, revise or modify the decision appealed
from. In these provisions of ss. 752 and 754, setting out the special manner in
which such appeals were to be heard and determined, the term trial de novo did
not appear. Nevertheless, such mode of appeal was consistently referred to by
the provincial courts of appeal, in an abridged form, as trial de novo. In
borrowing this term from judicial decisions, made under the former Code, and in
using it in the provisions of s. 727 of the new Code, Parliament, in my view,
manifested an intention not to alter but to maintain this previous state of the
law in the matter. The words of a statute are generally understood in the sense
which they bore when it was passed (Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 9th
ed., p. 62) and it is not to be presumed that a legislature would depart from
the general system of the law without expressing its intention with
irresistible clearness (Maxwell, supra, pp. 85 and 86).

That under the new Code, the law has not been
changed in this respect, has been decided, not only in the present case by the
Court of Appeal for Ontario, but by other courts.

In Regina v. Hieland[7], Mr. Justice Sheppard,
delivering the judgment for the Court of Appeal of British
 Columbia, had this to say at page 138:

The appeal to the County Court is from the
conviction—sec. 72(a)(i) of the Summary Convictions

[Page 1033]

Act, 1955,
ch. 71. Moreover the procedure on the appeal is by a trial de novo (sec. 79(1))
on the original information (sec. 43 made applicable by sec. 79(1);
to which information the accused is to plead (sec. 43(1) made applicable
by sec. 79(1)). The intention is manifest that the appeal to the County
Court is not a mere review of the previous conviction but is a new trial on the
original information and consequently the accused on that appeal may be found
to have committed the offence charged in the information in any manner capable
of being raised on that information and to the same extent as if there had been
no previous adjudication.

It will be noted that ss. 72(a)(i) and
(ii), 74(1)(a) and 79(1) of the British Columbia Summary Convictions
Act, 1955, ch. 71, are respectively in terms similar to ss. 720 (a)
(i) and (ii), 722(1)  (a) and 727(1)  of the Criminal Code , except
that in the latter section, the sections referred to bear numbers
different than those referred to in s. 79(1) of the British Columbia Summary
Convictions Act. Section 79(1) reads as follows:

79. (1) Where an appeal has been lodged in
accordance with this Act from a conviction or order made against a defendant,
or from an order dismissing an information, the Appeal Court shall hear and
determine the appeal by holding a trial de novo, and for this purpose
the provisions of section 7 of sections 41 to 45, 49 to 54, and 66 to
69, in so far as they are not inconsistent with sections 72 to 84, apply mutatis
mutandis.

In Connolly v. The Queen[8], Chief Justice Campbell, Supreme
Court of Prince Edward Island, said, at page 244:

The appellant, by appealing, has asked for,
and obtained, a trial de novo. There is no provision, and apparently no
necessity, for a cross-appeal by the Crown. If the Crown did cross-appeal, the
order would be the same—a trial de novo. At the beginning of the trial de
novo, the appellant “stands...in exactly the same position procedurally as
he stood before the magistrate after having made his plea” (subject to his
being allowed to change his plea, e.g. from guilty to not guilty, upon showing
proper grounds)—per Ritchie J., for the Supreme Court of

[Page 1034]

Canada in Regina v. Dennis, (1960) S.C.R. 286, 32 C.R. 210, 30 W.W.R. 545, 125
C.C.C. 321 at 327.

It would be anomalous if an appellate
court, being obliged by s. 727(1)  to hear and determine the appeal by holding
an untrammelled trial de novo, were precluded from pronouncing that
decision which the evidence warrants in respect of the offence or offences
charged. In fact, if the appellant’s preliminary contentions were both correct,
the Court would be powerless to pronounce any conviction at the conclusion of
the new trial, no matter how convincing the evidence.

It may be noted that while Chief Justice
Campbell refers, in his reasons, to the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Regina v. Fischer[9], this decision is explained by the
Court of Appeal for Ontario in
the present case.

In Droit pénal canadien, I. Lagarde
expressed, in the following terms, at page 1283, the opinion that an appeal by
way of a trial de novo is an appeal based on the information:

[TRANSLATION] Section 727(1)  states
that sections 701 to 716 are applicable, mutatis mutandis, to the
extent that they are not inconsistent with the provisions governing appeals
(720-732); but because the appeal is brought by way of a trial de novo, it
must not be forgotten that in fact it is an appeal based on the information.
Consequently, the defendant must not be called on to plead on this appeal (R.
v. Dennis, 1960, S.C.R. 286, 32 C.R. 210, 125 C.C.C. 321).

As I understand it, the essence of the argument
made in the present case on behalf of the appellant, is that ss. 720 (a)(i)
and 727(1)  make provision for an appeal by the defendant “on a ‘conviction’ as
distinct from the ‘charge’ described in the information upon which he was
arraigned before the magistrate and that these provisions have been invoked by
the appellant in the present case through filing and service of notice of
appeal in accordance with section 722”. With the greatest respect for
those who hold a different opinion, I am unable to agree with this view.

[Page 1035]

The relevant parts of s. 720 , i.e. 720(a)(i)
and (ii), and of s. 727(1)  respectively read as follows:

720. Except where otherwise provided by
law,

(a) the defendant in
proceedings under this Part may appeal to the appeal court

(i) from a conviction or order made against
him, or

(ii) against a sentence passed upon him;
and

727. (1) Where an appeal has been lodged in
a accordance with this Part from a conviction or order made against a
defendant, or from an order dismissing an information, the appeal court shall
hear and determine the appeal by holding a trial de novo, and for this
purpose the provisions of sections 701 to 716, insofar as they are not
inconsistent with sections 720  to 732 , apply mutatis mutandis.

It will be observed that in both sections,
Parliament does not refer to an appeal “on a conviction” but “from a
conviction”. The same remark applies to an appeal by way of a stated case
where, under s. 734(1), the appeal may be “against a conviction, order,
determination or other proceedings of a Summary
 Conviction Court...”. Whether an appeal is taken under
Part XXIV dealing with summary convictions or under Part XVIII dealing with
indictable offences, an appeal is either against a conviction or a sentence.
What differs, however, is the mode or the manner in which the appeal is heard
and determined. In my view, the word ‘conviction’ in ss. 720 (a)(i),
722(1) (a)(i) and 727(1)  is not used “as distinct from the charge” but as
distinct from an order made or the sentence passed upon a defendant. One may
also note that s. 727(1)  provides that the provisions of ss. 701 to
716,—thus including s. 711—insofar as they are not inconsistent with ss. 720  to
732 , apply mutatis mutandis in the case of a trial de novo. Section 711
enacts that:

711. When the summary conviction court has
heard the prosecutor, defendant and witnesses it shall, after considering the
matter, convict the defendant or make an order against him or dismiss the
information, as the case may be. (The italics are mine.)

[Page 1036]

I can, for my part, find no inconsistency
between the provisions of that section and the provisions of ss. 720  to 732 .

In my opinion, the appeal by way of a trial
de novo is not a new trial ordered by the Court as may be the case in an
appeal under Part XVIII, but a statutory right given to a defendant to have his
trial recommenced before another judge and another jurisdiction. The judge
seized with this special form of appeal begins the hearing as if he was at the
stage immediately following a plea of not guilty. Such a plea, already
registered in first instance against the charge as laid, need not be repeated.

It was also argued by appellant that Magistrate
Andrews had no jurisdiction to convict him of the offence of dangerous driving
at his trial for criminal negligence on the ground that the Crown having
elected to try the said offence as an offence punishable on summary conviction
as provided in s. 221(1) (b) Cr. C, the provision of s. 569(4) of
the Code was not applicable to summary conviction proceedings. In Connolly
v. The Queen, supra, a similar argument was made by the appellant
but was rejected by Chief Justice Campbell who concluded that the provisions of
s. 569(4) amount to a declaratory statement of fundamental law. With this
conclusion, I am in respectful agreement.

For all these reasons, I would dismiss the
appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Joint
trial—Evidence—Admissibility—Accused not calling evidence—Co‑accused
testifying and implicating accused—Admissibility against accused of that
evidence.

The two appellants were tried jointly with E
on counts of breaking and entering and of being in possession of stolen
property. At the close of the case for the prosecution, counsel for the
appellants moved for a dismissal on the ground that there was no evidence. The
magistrate denied the motion. Thereupon counsel for the appellants moved for
acquittal on the ground that there was insufficient evidence and announced that
no evidence would be called on behalf of these two appellants. The magistrate
reserved decision on this motion, stating that he would deal with it when he
had heard all the evidence. The case proceeded. Counsel for the appellants took
no further part in the trial except in the argument at the close of the case. E
gave evidence tending to exonerate himself, but which im-

[Page 261]

plicated the appellants. He was acquitted on
the ground that his explanation had raised a reasonable doubt. The magistrate
ruled that E’s evidence implicating the appellants was not receivable as
against them as they had elected to call no evidence, and he acquitted them. On
an appeal by the Crown, the Court of Appeal ordered a new trial. The accused
appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.: The
situation at the close of the case for the prosecution was that there was ample
evidence upon which the magistrate could have convicted all. three accused. In
such a situation, where two or more accused are jointly indicted, the case is
not concluded until all the evidence is in. All the testimony heard throughout
the trial is evidence for or against each accused. R. v. MacDonald (1962),
38 C.R. 104, was wrongly decided.

Per Laskin J.:
A joint trial, once properly in course, is not terminable by any one of the
accused at the close of the Crown’s case in chief when he thinks it to be to
his advantage not to run the risk of having damaging testimony given by his
co-accused. If any co-accused gives evidence, it takes effect under the tests
ordinarily applicable to the evidence of a witness. There is no rule of its
legal inadmissibility against an accused who has himself decided not to put in
a defence. The fact that he closes his case after the Crown’s evidence in chief
does not mean that he can thereby convert a joint trial into a trial of himself
alone. A co-accused may not limit the effect of relevant and admissible
evidence which his co-accused volunteers as a witness in making his defence.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[1],
ordering a new trial on charges of breaking and entering and unlawful
possession of stolen goods. Appeal dismissed.

[Page 262]

The judgment of Fauteux C.J. and of Abbott,
Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

HALL J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia1 whereby the acquittal of the
appellants who were tried jointly with one Ellsworth by Magistrate Bewley in
Vancouver on counts of breaking and entering and of being in possession of
stolen property, knowing that the same had been stolen, was set aside and a new
trial ordered.

The evidence adduced by the Crown showed that
sometime after 10:00 p.m. on October 10, 1968, and prior to 1:00 a.m., October
11, 1968, the premises of Ornamental Bronze Company Limited in Vancouver had
been broken into and entered and a quantity of bronze ingots, tools and an
adding machine had been stolen from the premises. At approximately 1:30 a.m. on
October 11th police officers on patrol noticed a motor vehicle proceeding along
a street in Vancouver with its lights out. The rear end of the vehicle appeared
to be heavily weighted down. The officers stopped the vehicle which was being
driven by Ellsworth. The appellants were passengers in the vehicle, both
sitting in the front seat and to the right of Ellsworth. An adding machine was
found on the back seat of the vehicle and a tool chest, some tools and a
quantity of bronze ingots were found in the trunk. These were identified as the
property which had been stolen from the Ornamental Bronze Company Limited
premises after 10:00 p.m. the preceding evening. The appellants offered no
explanation when found with Ellsworth in possession of the stolen property.

The trial proceeded against the three accused
jointly. At the close of the case for the prosecution counsel for the
appellants moved for a dismissal of the charges and for acquittal of the
appellants on the ground that there was no evidence before the Court upon which
the two appellants could be convicted. The learned magistrate denied the
motion. Thereupon counsel for the appellants moved for acquittal on the ground

[Page 263]

that there was insufficient evidence on which
the appellants could be convicted and announced to the Court that no evidence
would be called on behalf of these two appellants. The learned magistrate
reserved decision on this motion, stating he would deal with it when he had
heard all the evidence. The case proceeded. Counsel for the appellants took no
further part in the trial except in the argument at the close of the case.
Ellsworth gave evidence tending to exonerate himself, but which implicated the
appellants. The learned magistrate acquitted Ellsworth on the ground that his
explanation had raised a reasonable doubt. He ruled that Ellsworth’s evidence
implicating the appellants was not receivable as against the appellants who had
earlier elected to call no evidence, and he acquitted the appellants on the
grounds that the Crown had not led sufficient evidence, excluding that of
Ellsworth, on which guilt could be established beyond a reasonable doubt. He
considered himself bound by the judgment of Schultz Co. Ct.J. in Regina v.
MacDonald et al.[2].

The appeal from the order for a new trial cannot
succeed. Regina v. MacDonald was wrongly decided. Here the situation at
the close of the case for the prosecution was that there was ample evidence upon
which the learned magistrate could have convicted all three accused. The
circumstances given in evidence of the three accused being in possession of the
stolen property were such that some explanation by the appellants was called
for. Ellsworth offered an explanation. The appellants said nothing. The vehicle
they were in was loaded with stolen property, the adding machine being in plain
view on the rear seat. Any ruling by the magistrate that there was no evidence
before him upon which he might convict would have been erroneous in law.
Counsel for the appellants accepts this in his submission. This being so there
could be no basis for a directed verdict of acquittal at that stage of the
trial.

The appellants relied on the case of Rex v.
Power[3],
but the case is of no assistance to them. Darling J. who spoke for the
Court in Power,

[Page 264]

referring to that case in R. v. Hogan[4], said at p. 183:
“I did not say that whenever a defendant submitted that there was no case and
took no further part in the trial the judge must withdraw the case from the
jury.” The appellants also relied on Regina v. Abbott[5], but that case has no
application to the present appeal. In Abbott there was at the close of
the case for the prosecution no evidence upon which Abbott, one of two
co-accused charged with forgery, could be convicted, and, in fact, the evidence
for the prosecution negatived his participation in the crime. The trial judge
on an application to withdraw the case from the jury for want of any evidence
implicating Abbott refused to do so. The trial proceeded and the co-accused
gave evidence implicating Abbott. The jury convicted. The Court of Criminal
Appeal set aside Abbott’s conviction. That is a different situation from the
present one. Here there was at the close of the case for the prosecution
evidence upon which the learned magistrate could have convicted. In such a
situation, where two or more accused are jointly indicted, the case is not
concluded until all the evidence is in. All the testimony heard throughout the
trial is evidence for or against each accused.

The appeal should accordingly be dismissed.

LASKIN J.—I agree with my brother Hall that the
appeal fails. The principle invoked by the appellants is that whether an
accused be tried alone or jointly with others, he has the same right in the
latter case as in the former, once he elects not to put in a defence, to have
his guilt or innocence determined on the sufficiency of the Crown’s case
against him in chief, and he may therefore insist that the trier of fact
dispose of the charge against him without regard to any implicating evidence
subsequently given by a co-accused.

[Page 265]

The principle is misconceived in respect of a
joint trial, especially where, as here, no question is in issue as to the
propriety of the joinder. Section 4(1)  of the Canada Evidence Act  declares
that an accused person is a competent witness whether charged solely or jointly
with any other witness. A joint trial, once properly in course, is not
terminable by any one of the accused at the close of the Crown’s case in chief
when he thinks it to be to his advantage not to run the risk of having damaging
testimony given by his co-accused. On the contrary, if any co-accused gives
evidence, it takes effect under the tests ordinarily applicable to the evidence
of a witness. There is no rule of its legal inadmissibility against an accused
who has himself decided not to put in a defence.

The fact that he closes his case after the
Crown’s evidence in chief does not mean that he can thereby convert a joint
trial into a trial of himself alone. This view, adverse to the appellants, goes
to the very considerations that make a joint trial proper. If proper, it must
run its course as to all who are involved in it, so far as concerns the issues
and the evidence touching any of the co-accused, each of whom is, by his
choice, a competent witness in the joint trial.

Although the Crown cannot compel an accused to
testify at his trial, this does not mean that a co-accused may limit the effect
of relevant and admissible evidence which that accused volunteers as a witness
in making his defence.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Trials—Abuse of
process—Oppression—Charge of possession of cheques adapted and intended to be
used to commit forgery—Acquittal—Subsequent charge of conspiring to utter same
cheques—Plea of “autrefois acquit” disallowed—Discretion to stay second
indictment.

The respondent was indicted on a charge of
having had in his possession seven cheques and other papers that were adapted
and intended to be used to commit forgery. In September 1966, he was acquitted
on a directed verdict. The basis for the directed verdict was that the
forgeries were complete so that the cheques could not be held to be adapted or
intended to be used to commit forgery. An appeal by the Crown was dismissed. In
May 1967, the respondent was indicted on a charge of conspiring with a person
or persons unknown to commit the indictable offence of uttering the same seven
forged cheques. At the opening of this second trial, a plea of “autrefois
acquit” was entered. Counsel for the respondent also urged upon the trial judge
that he had a discretion to stay the indictment on the ground that the
proceedings were oppressive and an abuse of the process of the Court. The trial
judge disallowed the special plea and convicted the respondent. The Court of
Appeal directed a verdict of acquittal to be entered on the ground that the
trial judge should have exercised his discretion by staying the second
indictment because it was so oppressive as to constitute an abuse of the process
of the Court. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.

Per Fauteux
J.: The appeal should be allowed.

Per Martland,
Judson and Pigeon JJ.: There does not exist in our criminal law a rule that in
the case of a multiplicity of charges successively made on

[Page 185]

the same facts, a trial judge has discretion
to stay an indictment when, on all the facts of the case, laying it is
considered as an injustice amounting to oppression. The duty of the Courts is
to apply the law as it exists. There is no legal basis for holding that
criminal remedies are subject to the rule that they are to be refused whenever
in its discretion, a Court considers the prosecution oppressive. In our legal
system, it is not considered unfair or oppressive to have an accused undergo
several trials on the same charge when his conviction is quashed even if this
happens repeatedly. A different view should not be taken if the error consists
in not laying the correct charge so that instead of being irregularly convicted
and then ordered to stand a new trial, the accused is acquitted of the
incorrect charge and then brought to second trial on a fresh indictment for the
correct charge.

Per Ritchie,
Hall and Spence JJ.: The question of whether or not the Court has jurisdiction
to intervene to prevent an abuse of its process does not fall to be decided
because there was here no evidence to support the conclusion of the Court of
Appeal that there was oppression. The Court of Appeal placed undue weight on
the long delay and the Crown’s intervening appeal. The exercise of its right to
appeal cannot be considered as oppression on the part of the Crown. It is a
right given by statute. In respect of the delay, the record clearly shows that
such delays as did occur were principally attributable to the accused and not
to the Crown. The Court of Appeal was therefore wrong in concluding that the
trial judge should have stayed the proceedings and was also wrong in
interfering with the discretion he exercised in that regard.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], acquitting the
respondent of a charge of conspiring to utter forged cheques. Appeal allowed.

C.M. Powell and Archie Campbell, for the
appellant.

C.G. Stewart McKeown and David R.G.
Griner, for the respondent.

[Page 186]

FAUTEUX J.—I agree that the appeal should be
allowed.

The judgment of Martland, Judson and Pigeon JJ.
was delivered by

PIGEON J.—The facts of this case are stated as
follows in the reasons of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1.

On November 23rd, 1965, the appellant, Frederick
John Osborn, while being followed by an officer, was seen to throw an envelope
from the window of an automobile. In the envelope were found seven forged
cheques fully made out to various payees and endorsed. The cheques were
complete save as to the dates on them. Also in the envelope were two pieces of
paper giving the names of payees, together with the addresses of certain banks
and some account numbers. At his trial, the appellant testified that he was
directed to the envelope in a cache by one “Frank” who instructed him to cash
the cheques in return for one third of the proceeds but that, after only
glancing at the contents of the envelope, he had resolved not to cash any of
the cheques. There was no other evidence connecting the appellant with the
forgery of the cheques.

In November, 1965, the appellant was indicted on
a charge that, knowingly and without lawful authority or excuse, he had in his
possession certain writings, to wit: seven cheques and two pieces of paper that
were adapted and intended to be used to commit forgery, contrary to the
Criminal Code , Section 312 (b).

After a two day trial with a jury in September,
1966, the appellant was acquitted on a directed verdict. It would appear the
basis for the directed verdict was that the forgeries were complete so that the
cheques could not be held to be adapted or intended to be used to commit
forgery.

An appeal by the Crown was dismissed.

In May, 1967, the appellant was indicted on a
charge of conspiring with a person or persons unknown to commit the indictable
offence of uttering seven forged cheques.

At the opening of the second trial in January,
1968, the special defence of autrefois acquit was disallowed by the trial
judge. Counsel for the appellant also urged upon the trial judge that he had a
discretion to stay the indictment on the ground that the proceedings were
oppressive and an abuse of

[Page 187]

the process of the Court. No express ruling was
made by the trial judge as to whether he considered he had such a discretionary
power and, after disallowing the plea of autrefois, he simply directed the
trial to proceed. The appellant was convicted.

Appeal is taken to this Court on the sole ground
that the trial judge had a discretion to stay or dismiss the indictment on the
ground that it was so oppressive and vexatious as to amount to an abuse of the
process of the Court and that such discretion should have been exercised in
favour of the appellant.

After referring especially to speeches in Connelly
v. Director of Public Prosecutions[2], Jessup
J.A., speaking for the Court, said:

In civil law the doctrine of res
judicata occupies the same place as the plea of autrefois does in
the criminal law. But apart from res judicata and Rule 126 the Courts of
this Province have from earliest times invoked an inherent jurisdiction to
prevent the abuse of their process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings.
The principle on which they have acted is stated by Lord Watson in Haggard
v. Pelicier Frères, (1892) A.C. 61…

* * *

I am unable to recognize any basis or
principle on which such inherent jurisdiction is confined to the civil side of
the Courts or why it cannot be invoked to abate oppression caused by a
multiplicity of charges successively made on the same facts by a private or
Crown prosecutor…

I am not prepared to hold that in the
absence of special circumstances the laying of a second indictment upon the
same facts is simpliciter and in all cases productive of such injustice as to
invoke the Court’s inherent jurisdiction. Everything depends on all the facts
of the case. The discretion is to be exercised in favour of an accused only
where a real injustice will otherwise result and such a case should be rare. It
should always be invoked before arraignment on the indictment alleged to be
oppressive and cannot be raised after trial on such indictment. Here, however,
I think that the long delay coupled with the Crown’s intervening appeal results
in unjust oppressiveness from the second indictment.

With deference, this reasoning is erroneous. The
starting point appears to be that in civil mat-

[Page 188]

ters there is admittedly an inherent
jurisdiction to prevent the abuse of the process of the Court through
oppressive or vexatious proceedings. The case cited to support that assertion, Haggard
v. Pelicier Frères[3], is
indeed concerned with a question of jurisdiction, the matter under
consideration being the contention that the defendant had incurred liability
towards the plaintiff in summarily dismissing a case as vexatious because in so
doing he had allegedly acted without jurisdiction.

In the instant case, it does not appear to me
that I need consider whether the trial judge had jurisdiction to make the order
that the Court of Appeal held he should have made. The real problem, in my
view, is whether there exists in our criminal law a rule that in the case of a
multiplicity of charges successively made on the same facts, a trial judge has
discretion to stay an indictment when, on all the facts of the case, laying it
is considered as an injustice amounting to oppression. In this Court as in the
Court of Appeal, counsel have been unable to cite any case in Canada where such a discretionary rule has
been recognized or acted upon other than the obiter dictum of Mackay
J.A. in Regina v. LeClair[4].

Concerning the opinions expressed in Connelly
v. Director of Public Prosecutions, it is essential to observe that the
basis of the difficulty in that case was a most important difference between
our criminal law and the criminal law of England in force at that time. Lord Reid said (at p. 1295):

Ever since the passing of the Criminal
Appeal Act, 1908, Parliament has persistently refused to permit a retrial in
respect of the same offence after a verdict of guilty has been quashed on any
ground by the Court of Criminal Appeal. Refusal to allow a new trial has always
been put on the ground of fairness to the accused and I cannot see why, if it
is unfair to allow a retrial for the same offence, it is fair to allow a fresh
trial on the same facts merely because the offence now charged is different.

[Page 189]

In this country, Parliament’s conception of
fairness has always been, on the contrary, that when a conviction is quashed
(Cr. Code, sec. 592(2)) a new trial can be ordered instead of an acquittal
and such is always the order made except in special circumstances.

It is clear that the new “rule of practice”
requiring the inclusion in a single indictment of all charges arising out of
the same facts, that was proposed in Connelly by Lord Devlin and agreed
to by Lord Pearce and Lord Reid, was motivated exclusively by the desire of
avoiding in the future the anomalous result noted by the latter in the passage
above quoted. Everyone, including Lord Devlin, agreed that this new rule, being
a “rule of practice”, should not be applied to the case at hand. Consequently,
it was unanimously decided that there had been no unfairness to the appellant
in trying and convicting him of robbery after his conviction for a murder
committed in the robbery had been quashed for misdirection, the charges of
murder and of robbery having been preferred in separate indictments in
accordance with the practice followed at the time. In thus upholding a strict
application of autrefois acquit in spite of the fact that in reality it
deprived the accused of the benefit of the statutory rule against retrials, the
majority who expressed themselves in favor of a new rule for future cases, did
not in effect differ from the view of the others as to the proper conclusion in
the absence of such a rule. The statutory principle motivating that rule in England having no counterpart in our
criminal law, the views expressed as to the state of the law apart from the
existence of such a rule appear properly applicable to our circumstances. Lord
Morris said (at pp. 1301-1302 and 1304):

The power (which is inherent in a court’s
jurisdiction) to prevent abuses of its process and to control its own procedure
must in a criminal court include a power to safeguard an accused person from
oppression or prejudice. That power, as is demonstrated by a stream of
authority to which I will refer, has, however, never been regarded as endowing
a court with a power to say that evidence given in reference to one charge may
not be repeated in reference to another and different charge. Nor does it
enable a court to order that a prosecution be dropped merely because of some
rather imprecise regret that an accused should have to face another charge…

[Page 190]

It would, in my judgment, be an unfortunate
innovation if it were held that the power of a court to prevent any abuse of
its process or to ensure compliance with correct procedure enabled a judge to
suppress a prosecution merely because he regretted that it was taking place.
There is no abuse of process if to a charge which is properly brought before
the court and which is framed in an indictment to which no objection can in any
way be taken there is no plea such as that of autrefois acquit or convict which
can successfully be made.

Lord Hodson said (at pp. 1336 and 1337):

The inherent power of the court to control
its own process, civil or criminal, should not prevent access to the courts
when a lawful claim is presented. So to hold would involve grave interference
with the liberty of the subject to have access to the courts, which I should be
surprised to find to be warranted by authority…

I accept that the history of the
development of our law justifies the contention that all rules of common law
which emanate from the breast of the judges may in a sense be said to be
discretionary in origin, but I cannot concede that there ought to be given to
the judge a discretion, which, in my opinion, he has not hitherto been allowed,
to interfere with anything that he personally thinks is unfair. If one
disclaims such a proposal but seeks to substitute a discretion to determine, in
accordance with principle, whether or not a prosecution should be stopped, I do
not know what principle can be applied.

It is basic in our jurisprudence that the duty
of the courts is to apply the law as it exists, not to enforce it or not in
their discretion. As a general rule, legal remedies are available in an
absolute way ex debito justitiae. Some are discretionary but this does
not destroy the general rule. I can see no legal basis for holding that
criminal remedies are subject to the rule that they are to be refused whenever
in its discretion, a court considers the prosecution oppressive.

In our legal system, it is not considered unfair
or oppressive to have an accused undergo several trials on the same charge when
his conviction is quashed even if this happens repeatedly. In other words, it
is not considered desirable that a criminal should escape punishment for a
misdeed

[Page 191]

because an error was committed in his trial that
requires his conviction to be quashed. I fail to see why a totally different
view should be taken if the error consists in not laying the correct charge so
that instead of being irregularly convicted and then ordered to stand a new
trial, he is acquitted of the incorrect charge and then brought to second trial
on a fresh indictment for the correct charge.

For those reasons I would allow the appeal,
reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and restore the conviction and sentence.

The judgment of Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was
delivered by

HALL J.—On November 23, 1965, the respondent was seen
by Detective Douglas Baker of the Metropolitan Police Force seated behind the
wheel of a 1964 Pontiac
automobile, the car being parked on Bloor Street in the City of Toronto. While the car was under observation one Joseph Sullivan approached
the respondent, at which time Detective Baker went to the car and identified
himself as a police officer. He asked for the respondent’s driver’s license
which was not forthcoming. He then questioned the respondent about the car, and
being concerned that the car may have been stolen, said that they would have to
go to No. 11 Police Station. Detective Baker had Sullivan get in the back seat
and he sat in the front seat to the right of the respondent. While proceeding
to No. 11 Police Station, the respondent had to drive through a subway on Dupont Street. While in the subway he was
observed by Detective Baker to reach down to the car floor, pick up what
appeared to be a piece of white paper and throw it out the window on the
driver’s side. The paper was seen by Detective Baker to land close to the north
curb approximately in the centre of the subway. Detective Baker asked what the
paper was and the respondent replied, “Just junk, the car is full of old
paper”. On emerging from the tunnel Detective Baker had the respondent make a
U-turn and go back in the east-bound lane then make another U-turn and into the
subway again. The car was stopped and

[Page 192]

Detective Baker retrieved the paper which he
found to be an envelope containing seven cheques and two pieces of paper. On
showing them to the respondent, saying “What about these?” the respondent
replied: “I don’t know anything about them.” The respondent was directed to
continue to No. 11 Police Station. At the police station, after being
cautioned, he gave a statement which was ruled admissible after a voir dire to
the effect that he had a telephone call from one “Frank” and had been directed to
the envelope which was cached in a toilet paper receptacle in the washroom of
the Brown Derby tavern. He was to get the envelope, cash what cheques he could,
retain one-third of the proceeds and place the balance of the proceeds with any
uncashed cheques back in the place where he had found the envelope. He later
testified to the same effect at his trial.

The respondent was charged:

that he did, on or about the 23rd day of
November, in the year 1965, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, in the
County of York, knowingly and without lawful authority or excuse, had in his
possession certain writings, to wit, seven cheques and two pieces of paper,
that were adapted and intended to be used to commit forgery, contrary to the
Criminal Code .

The case was heard by His Honour Judge Deyman
and a jury in September 1966. At the conclusion of the case for the Crown,
Judge Deyman, holding that there was no case to go to the jury, directed the
jury to bring in a verdict of acquittal on the ground that the cheques were
complete and there was no evidence connecting the respondent with the actual
forgery of the cheques.

The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario which dismissed the appeal in
January 1967. In May 1967 the respondent was indicted on a charge of conspiring
with a person or persons unknown to commit an indictable offence, to wit,
uttering of seven forged cheques contrary to the Criminal Code . He was
remanded for trial and eventually came on for trial on January 22, 1968, before
His Honour E.L. Weaver and a jury.

[Page 193]

At the opening of the trial, counsel for the
respondent, before plea was taken, entered the special plea of autrefois
acquit pursuant to the provisions of ss. 516  to 518  of the Criminal
Code . In his submission in support of the plea of autrefois acquit, counsel
for the respondent discussed what would be in effect a defence of res
judicata. The learned trial judge disallowed the special plea of autrefois
acquit. He was right in so doing. His ruling was as follows:

THE COURT: I have come to the conclusion,
from a consideration of the law, that the offence as charged here, of
conspiring, is a completely different offence to the substantive offence either
of possession of forged documents or even of using documents known to be forged.
It is a completely different offence and therefore the plea of autrefois
acquit, or even of res judicata, does not apply, and I will dismiss your
application.

He mentioned res judicata but did not
make any reference to the suggestion that the Court should stay the proceedings
on the ground that they were oppressive. It is clear from the record that the
discussion as to the proceedings being res judicata or being oppressive
were incidental to the submission being made on behalf of the respondent in
respect of his plea of autrefois acquit. Res judicata is not a special
plea within s. 516  of the Criminal Code  but is a substantive defence
which may, in proper circumstances, be raised during the trial.

Following the learned trial judge’s ruling, the
respondent entered a plea of “Not Guilty”, and after a trial on the merits to
which no objection has been taken, he was found “Guilty” and sentenced to 18
months in the reformatory.

Following his conviction, the respondent
appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario by Notice of Appeal dated February 28, 1968, on the grounds:

1. The conviction was contrary to law.

2. The conviction was contrary to the
evidence and to the weight of evidence.

3. Upon such further and other grounds as
are revealed upon a reading of the transcript of evidence.

[Page 194]

On October 18, 1968, the Notice of Appeal was
amended to read:

The learned trial judge erred in the
exercise of his judicial discretion in failing to stop a prosecution which on
the facts created abuse of process and injustice.

In the Court of Appeal, Jessup J.A. for the
Court[5] said:

Here, however, I think that the long delay
coupled with the Crown’s intervening appeal results in unjust oppressiveness
from the second indictment. In my view, the learned trial judge would have
properly exercised his jurisdiction by staying the proceedings before him.

He prefaced his conclusion by saying:

In my opinion, therefore, the learned trial
judge should have exercised his discretion as to whether or not he should stay
the second indictment on the ground that it was so oppressive as to constitute
an abuse of the process of the court. Since he failed to address himself to
that decision this Court must do so. I am not prepared to hold that in the
absence of special circumstances the laying of a second indictment upon the
same facts is simpliciter and in all cases productive of such injustice as to
invoke the Court’s inherent jurisdiction. Everything depends on all the facts
of the case. The discretion is to be exercised in favour of an accused only
where a real injustice will otherwise result and such a case should be rare. It
should always be invoked before arraignment on the indictment alleged to be
oppressive and cannot be raised after trial on such indictment. (Emphasis
added)

I do not think that the question of whether or
not the Court has jurisdiction to intervene to prevent an abuse of its process
falls to be decided in the instant case because in my view there was here no
evidence to support the conclusion of the learned Justice of Appeal that there
was oppression. The circumstances which I have outlined in greater detail than
might otherwise have been necessary negative any oppressive conduct on the part
of the Crown. Jessup J.A. appears to have placed undue weight on what he calls
“the long delay”. He accepts the proposition that

[Page 195]

in the absence of special circumstances the
laying of a second indictment upon the same facts is not in all cases
productive of injustice or oppression. He mentions only two factors: the long
delay and the Crown’s intervening appeal. The exercise of its right to appeal
cannot be considered as oppression on the part of the Crown. It is a right
given by statute and the exercise of that right by the Crown cannot of itself
be oppression. Accordingly it would appear that having eliminated the mere
preferring of the second indictment as being decisive, Jessup J.A. appears to
have been unduly impressed by the delay. Now, in respect of the delay, the
record shows that the appeal from the acquittal on the first indictment was
disposed of in January 1967. The indictment for conspiracy was preferred to the
General Sessions of the Peace for the County of York on May 1, 1967, and the respondent
appeared for arraignment on May 12. He was remanded in custody until trial but
soon released on bail to appear for trial on September 18, 1967. He did not appear on
that date and a bench warrant was issued by His Honour Judge MacRae. An
explanation was given that he was in hospital on the morning of September 18
and he was again released on bail to appear for trial on December 1. He did not
appear and a bench warrant was issued and the case remanded to December 18 and
he was ordered to remain in custody. He was granted bail on an appeal to a
judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario and the case remanded peremptorily for
trial on January 22, 1968, on which date the trial began.

Then, in regard to the delay between the time of
his conviction and his appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, I pointed out previously that the
original Notice of Appeal was dated February 28, 1968, and amended some eight
months later on October 18, 1968, and judgment given on November 25, 1968. It is, therefore, clear that
such delays as did occur were principally attributable to the respondent and
not to the Crown.

I am of the view that the learned trial judge
was right in ruling that the charge of conspiracy should be proceeded with and
the Court of Appeal was wrong in concluding that he should

[Page 196]

have stayed the proceedings and also wrong in
interfering with the discretion he exercised in that regard.

I would, accordingly, allow the appeal and
restore the conviction. Leave to appeal was granted on the terms that the
appellant would pay to the respondent his costs in this Court, including the
costs of the motion for leave to appeal, the whole on a solicitor and client
basis in any event of the cause. The order allowing the appeal should,
therefore, provide for payment of the respondent’s costs in accordance with the
order giving leave.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Fraud—Deceit—Purchase of apartment
house—Vendors’ representations as to income and expenses—Alleged
misrepresentations as to certain disbursements—Failure to prove necessary
ingredients in action for deceit.

The personal respondents, who owned and
controlled the respondent company, offered to sell to the appellants (AP and
his wife) an apartment house, which the company had built in 1965. The asking
price was $255,000. The respondents furnished to AP a document which purported
to be a statement as to receipts and disbursements for the year 1966.
Subsequently, the appellants made an offer in writing to purchase the building
for $251,000. Attached to the offer and forming part thereof was a Schedule “A”
setting out the details of income and expenses as shown in the statement given
to AP. The offer contained a provision that it was subject to satisfactory
evidence being provided as to the accuracy of the representations as regards
income and expenses.

AP’s solicitor requisitioned an auditor’s
report supporting the amounts set forth in Schedule “A”. He received a reply
that such a report was not available but that he could satisfy himself as to
the income and expenses. On the day set for closing the personal respondents
made a statutory declaration that Schedule “A” was a financial statement
setting out to the best of their knowledge and ability an accurate and fair
estimate of the yearly revenue and yearly expenditure of the corporate
respondent. The appellants accepted the statutory declaration “as a substitute”
and closed the transaction.

[Page 307]

Two weeks later AP attended his solicitor to
illustrate that the representations made in the first statement, repeated in
Schedule “A”, and confirmed in the statutory declaration were false. Shortly
thereafter the appellants brought an action claiming damages in the amount of
$35,000 because of false and fraudulent representations as to three disbursements,
i.e., the cost of fuel, light and water.

The trial judge found in favour of the
appellants and awarded damages in the amount of $24,790. On appeal, the Court
of Appal varied the trial judgment by reducing the damages to $4,000. The
appellants then appealed and the respondents cross-appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed dismissing the action.

In order to sustain an action of deceit,
there must be proof of fraud, and nothing short of that will suffice. Fraud is
“a false representation of fact, made with a knowledge of its falsehood, or
recklessly, without belief in its truth, with the intention that it should be
acted upon by the complaining party, and actually inducing him to act upon it.”
Here the appellants failed to prove false representation of fact made with a
knowledge of its falsehood or recklessly, without belief in its truth, and that
they actually were induced by any such representation.

AP failed to prove, and the burden of proof
was upon him, that the statement was not to the best of the knowledge and
ability of the personal respondents an accurate and fair estimate. AP was not
misled in any way by the representations even if they had been false to the
knowledge of the respondents. As a shrewd and intelligent apartment house
operator, he figured he could pay $251,000 for the property in question and
obtain a satisfactory percentage of net profit.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], allowing in part

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

SPENCE J.—This appeal concerns an action for
damages for fraud instituted under the following circumstances.

The plaintiff August Parna was an Estonian by
birth who came to Canada in
1948. The plaintiff Reta Parna is the wife of the plaintiff August Parna but
took no active part in any of the negotiations in reference to this
transaction. I shall use the word “plaintiff” hereafter to refer to August
Parna.

August Parna was by no means an uneducated man.
He had a university education in Estonia; in addition, he had attended a law course in Heidelberg, Germany,
but because of the intervention of the war he had not a university degree nor
was he a graduate lawyer. However, only four years after he arrived in Canada
he purchased his first apartment house and up to the date of the offer to
purchase the apartment house with which this action is concerned he had purchased
four other apartment houses and later sold some of them and he had been for the
year previous operating a 29-suite apartment house.

It would appear from these facts as well as from
the manner in which Mr. Parna carried on his appeal in this Court, appearing
in person, that he was a shrewd and intelligent business man.

The apartment house in question consisted of 24
suites and was built by the defendant G. & S. Properties Limited
in the year 1965. G. & S. Properties Limited, a respondent, is a company owned
and controlled by the other respondents, Frank Albert and William Harvie, who
were, respectively, its president and secretary. Before the apartment house was
completed, the plaintiff

[Page 309]

approached the latter respondents and attempted
to buy the property but these respondents informed the plaintiff that it was
their intention to retain ownership and operate the apartment as a business,
although they had not previously owned or operated apartment buildings. The two
respondents, Frank Albert and William Harvie, who conducted a plumbing
business, during the course of the next year determined that too much of their
capital was tied up in the apartment building and therefore they decided to
sell it.

The respondents first offered the apartment
through a realtor for the sum of $262,500. The only offer which materialized
was one for the sum of $262,000 which, however, provided for a small amount of
cash to be paid on closing. The respondents desired to have the whole balance
between the two mortgages of $180,000 and $19,000 respectively, and the
purchase price paid in cash upon closing and they, therefore, approached the
appellant Parna and offered to sell the property to him. The respondents then
were asking the price of $255,000. The respondents at this time furnished to
the appellant Parna a document produced at trial as ex. 6 which purported to be
a statement as to receipts and disbursements for the year 1966. The appellant
examined the figures set out in this statement and took the position that some
of the disbursements were at an amount too low to reflect the true operating
costs. The respondents Albert and Harvie offered to produce for the appellant
Parna’s inspection any of the vouchers he desired to see but Parna asked only
for the voucher for the cost of fuel for the month of January 1967, and he was
shown an invoice for the amount of $345.53. The appellant Parna still insisted
that the operating costs as set out in the statement (ex. 6) were too low, and
he took the position that the property could not justify a price of more than
$241,000.

Very shortly after the appellant Parna was given
ex. 6, he was given also another statement (ex. 7) purporting to be applicable
to the year

[Page 310]

1967. This statement, although it did not vary
the amounts as to the expenses for fuel, light and water, did have significant
changes from its predecessor. The rental revenue was increased from $36,564 to
$39,444, an increase of $2,880, representing $10 per apartment per month. The
respondents Albert and Harvie informed the appellant Parna that notice of an
intention to increase the rental of each apartment by $10 per month had already
been sent to tenants and that these increases would take effect as soon as the
lease dates permitted. The taxes shown in ex. 6 at $8,250 were shown in ex. 7
at $8,450.

The appellant Parna attended his solicitor,
Mr. John S. Miller, and gave to him ex. 6. Mr. Miller, who testified
on behalf of the appellant Parna at the trial, did not remember having seen ex.
7 prior to the closing of the transaction although the appellant Parna
testified that he had received it very shortly after he received ex. 6.

The appellant Parna testified that although the
respondents were asking a price of $255,000 and although it was his opinion
that the property, in order to obtain a net income prior to mortgage payments
of 10 per cent, could only be worth $241,000, he surmised that the vendors
would sell for $252,000 and he therefore instructed his solicitor to draw an
offer for an amount slightly less, i.e., $251,000.

Throughout his testimony, the appellant Parna
insisted that his sole gauge as to the price he would pay for an apartment
building was that the property had to return about 10 per cent, prior to
payment of mortgages, upon the purchase price. The testimony which I have
outlined above would seem to indicate that the appellant Parna did not engage
in any such accurate calculations at all but simply entered into the usual
buyer and seller bargaining. The proposed vendors asked $255,000. The proposed
purchaser thought he should offer up to $241,000 but that the proposed vendors
would sell for $252,000 and so he instructed his solicitor to offer $251,000.
The procedure is one which occurs on practically every occasion when real
property is sold.

[Page 311]

The solicitor drafted the offer to purchase,
which was produced at trial as ex. 1. One provision in that offer was as
follows:

…and it is further subject to satisfactory
evidence being provided as to the accuracy of representations as regards income
and expenses as contained in Schedule “A” attached hereto. Upon the
non-fulfilment or non-performance of any or all of the conditions
aforementioned, this offer shall be null and void and the deposit moneys
returned to the purchasers. Schedule “A” attached hereto is to be part of this
contract of purchase and sale.

Schedule “A” was attached. I set it out in full:

[Page 312]

It is to be noted that that schedule used the
figures set out in the statement of receipts and disbursements as to 1966 (ex.
6) and did not make or use any reference to the altered situation as shown in
ex. 7, although the appellant Parna had ex. 7 in his possession shortly after
he received ex. 6 and some time before he instructed his solicitor to prepare
and present the offer to purchase (ex. 1). The offer to purchase was presented
to the respondents and was accepted by the respondents; the date of acceptance
is not completed on ex. 1 but it would appear to have been on February 17,
1967, at which time the offer, by its terms, expired. The date for closing as
set out in the offer was April 1, 1967.

The appellant Parna’s solicitor,
Mr. Miller, testified that about March 15, 1967, he wrote to the vendor’s
solicitor with the usual requirements on title including a requisition reading
as follows:

6. REQUIRED auditor’s report for the period
of ownership of your clients supporting the rental income and operating
expenses as set forth in Schedule “A” of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale.

and that he received in reply a letter from the
vendor’s solicitor dated March 28, 1967, which read in reference to that requisition:

6. We do not have an auditor’s report but
you can satisfy yourself as to income and expenses.

The learned trial judge characterized that
answer as “one of those brush-off answers”.

In his testimony, Mr. Miller testified that
upon receipt of the latter letter he immediately telephoned to his client, the
appellant Parna, and told the appellant that he was not prepared to close the
transaction on that basis requesting that the appellant attend him.
Mr. Miller testified that he then telephoned the vendors’ solicitor
informing him that many of the answers to the requisitions were unsatisfactory
and that he would not be closing the transaction unless very much more material
was forthcoming, “particularly as regards the support for Schedule ‘A’ attached
to the offer,

[Page 313]

that I would not be closing unless some
satisfactory evidence were produced to support the schedule”.

On the morning of March 31st, which date the
solicitors had fixed for closing as April 1st was a Saturday, the vendors’
solicitor attended Mr. Miller and presented to him a statutory declaration
produced at trial as ex. 4. The declaration is brief and I quote it in full:

I, Frank Albert

of the Town of Dundas in the County of

Wentworth

DO SOLEMNLY DECLARE THAT:

1. I am the President of G. & S.
Properties Limited and have knowledge of the facts

hereinafter declared.

2. Schedule “A” to the Offer to Purchase is
a Financial Statement setting out to the best of my knowledge and ability an
accurate and fair estimate of the yearly revenue and yearly expenditures of G.
& S. Properties bearing in mind the increase in rentals from time to time
and the increase in expenditures such as taxes from time to time.

3. No actual sources of revenue and no
actual disbursements have been omitted in arriving at the estimates.

4. New one year leases have been given to
some of the tenants with the approval of the purchasers.

AND I make this solemn Declaration
conscientiously believing it to be true, and knowing that it is of the same
force and effect as if made under oath, and by virtue of “The Canada Evidence
Act ”.


 
  
  DECLARED before
  me at the City of Hamilton in
  the County of Wentworth this
  31st day of March A.D. 1967

[Page 314]

Within an hour after receipt of that document,
Mr. Miller testified, the appellants August and Reta Parna attended him.
He showed them this statutory declaration and they discussed the matter. It
must be noted that under the exact terms of the offer for sale if the vendor
did not produce

satisfactory evidence... as to the accuracy
of the representations as regards income and expenses as contained in Schedule
“A” attached hereto the offer should be considered null and void and the
deposit returned.

Yet Mr. Miller testified that the
appellants August and Reta Parna having inspected the statutory declaration
elected to accept it “as a substitute” and closed the transaction. It would
appear, in fact, from Mr. Miller’s testimony that he stressed the
additional values of having a statutory declaration. Mr. Miller was not
asked to explain what additional values he found in that form of evidence but
it would certainly occur to one that what the appellants were then concerned
with was to obtain evidence to support just such an action as they subsequently
instituted. The transaction was closed on that same day, March 31, 1967, and
within two weeks the appellant Parna attended Mr. Miller to illustrate to
Mr. Miller that the representations made in the first statement (ex. 6),
repeated in Schedule “A” to the offer to purchase, and confirmed in the
statutory declaration given on closing were false.

On May 18, 1967, the appellants issued a writ
in this action claiming damages in the amount of $35,000 because of false and
fraudulent representations as to three disbursements, i.e., the cost of fuel,
light and water. The action proceeded to trial before Ferguson J. The appellant
sought to add other alleged misrepresentations both at trial and before this
Court but the consideration of this action has always been confined to the
representation as to these three items. The learned trial judge found in favour
of the plaintiffs (appellants in this Court) and awarded to them damages in the
amount of $24,790. He calculated these damages in this fashion: he accepted the
evidence of the appellant August

[Page 315]

Parna that he only made the offer to purchase on
the basis that the net annual profits from the property before payment of
interest or principal on the mortgages would yield 9.64 per cent on the
purchase price. He found that such net profits instead of amounting to $24,193
per annum amounted only to $21,807 and since that amount would represent 9.64
per cent of only $226,910, the learned trial judge found the difference between
that sum and the actual purchase price of $251,000, i.e., $24,790, to be
the damages suffered by the plaintiffs in the action, the present appellants.

The defendants, here respondents, appealed to
the Court of Appeal and the judgment of that Court was given by Evans J.A.[2] at the conclusion of the argument. One
paragraph of that judgment reads as follows:

The learned trial judge found that the
defendants knowlingly made a false representation as to the operating expenses
with the intention that the plaintiffs should act upon such false
representation; he further found that the plaintiffs did in fact act upon the
false representation to their detriment. There is ample evidence to support
such findings, and the appeal in so far as it affects them must be dismissed.

That paragraph contained the whole of the
reasons given in the Court of Appeal on the issue of liability. The Court of
Appeal differed from the assessment of damages made by the learned trial judge.
That assessment, as would appear from the above, was upon the basis of damages
for loss of a bargain. The Court of Appeal was of the opinion that by the award
of damages the plaintiffs, here appellants, were entitled to be put in the same
position they would have been if the representations had not been made but not
in the same position they would have been if the representations had been true.
Evans J.A. continued:

The evidence as to actual value led at
trial is rather fragile; proceeding as he did, the learned trial judge made no
finding as to the actual value of the property as at 1st April 1967. In my
opinion

[Page 316]

the evidence does support an assessment of
damages, on the proper basis I have outlined above, at $4,000.

The Court of Appeal, therefore, varied the
judgment given at trial by reducing the damages awarded to the plaintiffs to
$4,000.

The appellants appealed to this Court and in
their factum asked that damages be awarded in the amount of $48,163 and other
damages designated as “continuous damages” and interest at the rate of 15 per
cent and large amounts for costs. As I have stated, the statement of claim asked
only for $35,000 damages.

The respondents cross-appealed asking that the
judgment as given by the learned trial judge be vacated and that the action
should be dismissed with costs throughout.

Although it would appear that a great deal of
the argument in the Court of Appeal, and certainly in this Court, was devoted
to the interesting question as to the proper measure for damages, I am of the
opinion that the appeal must be disposed of upon the question of liability. The
learned trial judge cited two brief passages; the first, from the judgment of
Lord Herschell in Derry v. Peek[3],
at p. 374, reads as follows:

I think the authorities establish the
following propositions.: First, in order to sustain an action of deceit, there
must be proof of fraud, and nothing short of that will suffice…

The second, from Anson on Contract, where
“fraud” has been defined, reads:

Fraud is a false representation of fact,
made with a knowledge of its falsehood, or recklessly, without belief in its
truth, with the intention that it should be acted upon by the complaining
party, and actually inducing him to act upon it.

I am content to adopt these two short passages
as being sufficient to dispose of this appeal. I am of the opinion that,
firstly, the plaintiffs failed to prove false representation of fact made with
a

[Page 317]

knowledge of its falsehood or recklessly,
without belief in its truth and, secondly, that the plaintiffs actually were
induced by any such representation. It must be remembered that the appellant
Parna was, as I have said, a shrewd and experienced apartment house operator,
having engaged in the business continuously from 1952 until 1967, and at the
time he made the offer to purchase he had been for a full year operating a very
similar apartment house in the same Metropolitan Hamilton area. It must also be
remembered that the personal respondents Albert and Harvie were not apartment
house operators but were plumbers, the property in question here having been
the only apartment house which they had built or owned. In my view, the
appellant Parna knew much more about the apartment house operating business
than did the personal respondents. The appellant Parna, as I have pointed out,
had sought to buy the building even before it was completed and knew the exact
state of the progress of construction and the progress of the renting. The
appellant knew that on February 16, 1967, when he submitted the offer to
purchase, the building had not been fully rented for a year and, in fact, that
the first tenants had moved in only about eight months before. The appellant,
therefore, knew that the amounts set out in ex. 6, and taken from that document
into the schedule to the offer to purchase, were mere estimates and that they
were not accurate statements as to either receipts or disbursements. As to the
disbursements, the appellant had pointed out that those estimates, and he
admitted at the trial that he knew they were estimates, had to be low and the
appellant very shrewdly picked the month in which the highest amount for heat costs
would be incurred, i.e., January 1967, to illustrate that the estimated
disbursements were low. Upon inspecting the invoice for $345.50 for that month,
the appellant must have known that the annual heating costs would be in excess
of the $1,500 set out in ex. 6. If one only allowed for heating during the
months of February, March, April and October, November and December, in
addition to that month of January, in order to keep within an estimate of
$1,500 the average amounts expended in those other months would be $192.50—a
graphic illustration that the appellant Parna could not

[Page 318]

have been deceived by the estimate of $1,500. As
to revenue, ex. 6 was incorrect, to the knowledge of the appellant Parna,
because he knew that notice had already been given of an increase in rentals
amounting to $10 per month per apartment and that the revenue had therefore
been increased by $2,880.

During the argument of the appeal, counsel for
the respondents illustrated that the true excess of the disbursements over the
estimates as to the three items only of which the appellant Parna complained in
his action, i.e., heat, light and water, was not the $2,386 per year
taken by the trial judge but only $1,868.94 per year. It was the appellant
Parna’s argument that basing his calculations on the estimates given in ex. 6
and repeated in the schedule to the offer to purchase he found that he would
get a net return on his investment before payment of interest or principal on
mortgage of 9.64 per cent. Taking the disbursements at $1,868.94 in excess of
those estimated and making allowance for the increased revenue of $2,880 due to
the proposed rental increase, of which the appellant Parna had knowledge, his
net return would amount to almost 10 per cent. The appellant, as I have said,
admitted in his testimony that he knew the figures as to light, heat and water
given in ex. 6 and in the schedule to the offer to purchase were mere
estimates.

Under these circumstances, the exact terms of
the statutory declaration which the appellant Parna accepted as being a
substitute for the proof he was entitled to in the offer to purchase become
important. The personal respondents declared that Schedule “A” to the offer to
purchase was a financial statement setting out to the best of their knowledge
and ability an accurate and fair estimate of the yearly revenue and yearly
expenditure of the corporate respondent “bearing in mind the increase in
rentals from time to time and the increase in expenses such as taxes from time
to time” and further that no actual sources of revenue and no actual
disbursements had been omitted in arriving at the estimate.

[Page 319]

I am of the opinion, from the circumstances
which I have outlined above, that the appellant failed to prove, and the burden
of proof was upon him, that the statement was not to the best of the knowledge
and ability of the personal respondents an accurate and fair estimate, and I am
further of the opinion that the appellant Parna has failed to prove that any
actual disbursements had been omitted. It is true that in ex. 5, the statement
produced at trial by the respondents as to the operation of the property, there
are disbursements which do not appear in those estimates but those
disbursements would appear to have been largely disbursements which were not
properly part of the operation of an apartment house, for instance, the
purchases which were part of the construction costs, although the purchases
were made from the same companies which sold the fuel, and the difference
between net and gross bills. It is difficult to understand how the
representations could be considered false to the knowledge of the personal
respondents when both parties knew that the figures set out were merely
estimates and could be nothing else since they purported to be for the
operation of an apartment house for a full year when not even one tenant had
been in the apartment for more than eight months.

I have come to the conclusion that the evidence
given by the appellant Parna himself and by the solicitor who acted for him in
the purchase proves that the appellant Parna was not misled in any way by the
representations even if they had been false to the knowledge of the
respondents, but that a shrewd and intelligent apartment house operator figured
that he could pay $251,000 for the property in question and obtain a
satisfactory percentage of net profit. A rather graphic confirmation of this
conclusion is that even at the trial, which took place in November 1967, the
appellant Parna refused to reconvey the property thus confirming the decision
which he had made on March 31, 1967, when he had elected to close the
transaction without obtaining the proof of the statement to which he was
entitled by the very terms of the offer to purchase.

[Page 320]

I, therefore, have come to the conclusion that
the plaintiff has failed to prove the necessary ingredients in an action for
deceit and that is the basis upon which the appellant has framed his action.

I would dismiss the appeal and allow the
cross-appeal dismissing the action. The respondents are entitled to their costs
throughout.

Appeal dismissed and cross-appeal
allowed with costs.

ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Information—Breach of driving

[Page 439]

The appellant was charged under s. 64(b)
of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 172, with failing to
yield the right of way. The signature of the Justice of the Peace, acting as a
Commissioner for taking oaths, had been affixed on the information with a
rubber stamp. The appellant obtained an order prohibiting the magistrate or any
other magistrate from proceeding with that information. An appeal to the Court
of Appeal was dismissed. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court,
but the issue of this Court’s jurisdiction to grant leave was left to be
decided by the Court which would hear the appeal (see p. 441).

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

It was necessary to decide only whether this
Court had jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court
of Appeal affirming the order of prohibition and to entertain that appeal on
the merits. This Court had that jurisdiction under s. 41 of the Supreme Court
Act.

As to the merits, the Court of Appeal had
rightly held that the information was a nullity.

L’appelant a été accusé sous l’art. 64(b)

dénonciation a été apposée sur la dénonciation au moyen d’une étampe en
caoutchouc. L’appelant a obtenu une ordonnance interdisant au magistrat ou à
tout autre magistrat de donner suite à cette dénonciation. Un appel à la Cour
d’appel a été rejeté. La Couronne a obtenu la permission d’en appeler à cette
Cour, mais la question de la juridiction de la Cour d’accorder la permission
d’appeler a été laissée en suspens pour être décidée par la Cour devant
entendre l’appel (Voir page 441).

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté.

Il est nécessaire de décider seulement la
question de savoir si la Cour a juridiction pour accorder la permission
d’appeler du jugement de la Cour d’appel confirmant l’ordonnance de prohibition
et d’entendre l’appel sur le mérite. La Cour a cette juridiction en vertu de
l’art. 41 de la Loi sur la Cour suprême.

Quant au mérite, la Cour d’appel a eu raison
de conclure que la dénonciation était nulle.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—This is an appeal from an
order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2],
dated June 12, 1967, affirming an order of Stewart J., dated November 1, 1966,
prohibiting Raymond G. Gill, Esq., Justice of the Peace, or any other Justice
of the Peace from proceeding further with an Information sworn on the 17th day
of December, 1965, charging the respondent

that she did while driving a vehicle
license No. 103020, at 10:40 A.M., upon entering the intersection of
Lawrence Ave. W., and Kimbark Blvd., from Kimbark Blvd., the first named being
a highway with a stop sign at the entrance thereto, fail to yield the right of
way to traffic approaching the said intersection on Lawrence Ave., W., so
closely as to constitute an immediate hazard, as required by Sec. 64(b)
of the Highway Traffic Act.

The appeal is brought pursuant to an order of
this Court[3] made on
October 26, 1967, granting the appellant leave to appeal on the following
question of law:

Whether the Court of Appeal for Ontario erred in law in holding that a
rubber-stamped signature on an Information of a Justice of the Peace acting as
a Commissioner for taking Oaths on an Information rendered such Information a
nullity.

At the hearing of the application for leave
counsel for the respondent had submitted that the Court did not have
jurisdiction to grant leave and, in giving leave, the Court stated that it
should be left to the Court hearing the appeal to determine the question
whether we have jurisdiction to grant leave and, if this should be decided in
the affirmative, to deal with the merits.

So far as the question of our jurisdiction is
concerned, for the purposes of the present appeal it is necessary to decide
only whether this Court has jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the Order of Prohibition made by
Stewart J. and

[Page 441]

to entertain that appeal on the merits, and all
members of the Court are in agreement that we have this jurisdiction under s.
41 of the Supreme Court Act.

On the merits of the appeal I find myself so
fully in agreement with the reasons of McGillivray J.A. who delivered the
unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal that I am content to adopt them and
do not find it necessary to add anything to what he has said. This does not
imply any expression of opinion respecting the case to which he refers in which
a typed or stamped signature was held to be valid.

I would dismiss the appeal. Pursuant to the
terms of the order granting leave to appeal the appellant will pay the costs of
the respondent in this Court.

Appeal dismissed, costs to the
respondent.

Solicitor for the appellant: W.C. Bowman,
Toronto.

Solicitor for the respondent: M. Robb, Toronto.

MOTION
FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL[4]

On October 26, 1967, the following judgment on
the application of the Crown for leave to appeal, was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—This is an application, made
pursuant to s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act, for leave to appeal from
an order of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[5],
dated June 12, 1967, dismissing an appeal from an order of Stewart J., dated
November 1, 1966, prohibiting Raymond G. Gill, Esq., J.P., from further
proceeding with an Information charging the respondent with driving a motor vehicle
contrary to s. 64(b) of the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario. The
Order of Prohibition was granted on the ground that the signature of the
deponent on the Information and also the signature of the Justice of the Peace
before whom the Information was sworn, were both affixed with a rubber stamp
instead of in the handwriting of those persons.

Counsel for the applicant informs us that a
large number of other cases depend on the result of this case and argues

[Page 442]

that the judgments below are contrary to the
principles of law laid down in Regina v. Fox[6] and Goodman v. J. Eban Ltd.[7] and other authorities. On these grounds we
were disposed to grant leave to appeal on terms but counsel for the respondent
argued that it has been decided by this Court in Rex v. Paul,[8] which was followed in Fong Sing v. The
Queen,[9] that we
have no jurisdiction to grant leave as the proceedings below arise out of a
charge of an offence other than an indictable offence and the order sought to
be appealed is not a judgment acquitting or convicting or setting aside or
affirming a conviction or acquittal of such an offence.

In reply counsel for the applicant refers to Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation v. Attorney General for Ontario[10], Smith v. The Queen[11], particularly at page 642, neither of
which appear to have been referred to in the judgments in Paul v. The Queen or
Fong Sing v. The Queen, referred to above, and also to the case of Minister
of National Revenue et al v. Lafleur[12].
It appears difficult to reconcile these judgments and under all the
circumstances it seems to us that the proper course is to grant leave to
appeal, leaving it to the Court which hears the appeal to determine the
question whether we have jurisdiction to grant leave and, if this is decided in
the affirmative, to deal with the merits.

As the matter is in the nature of a test case,
we think it proper to grant leave subject to the terms that the applicant will
pay the costs of the respondent in this Court in any event of the appeal.

Leave is granted accordingly.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Appeal—Fraudulent manipulations
of stock exchange transactions—Acquittal at trial on finding that criminal
intent not proved—Inference as to intent a question of fact—Criminal Code ,
1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 325(a), 584.

The appellant, who had been in the brokerage
business for many years, was acquitted on an indictment containing 29 counts
charging that he, with intent to create a false or misleading appearance of
active public trading in securities, effected transactions through the Canadian
Stock Exchange in certain securities which involved no change in the beneficial
ownership of those securities, contrary to s. 325 (a) of the Criminal
Code . The trial judge, having concluded that the appellant had
intentionally effected the transactions in question, held that the Crown had
not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to create a
false and misleading appearance of active public trading. The Court of Appeal
set aside the verdicts of acquittal, held that the facts were not in dispute
and that the only inference that could be drawn from them was that the
appellant intended to create the false and misleading appearance. This, in the
view of the Court of Appeal, raised a question of law so as to give the Crown a
right of appeal under s. 584  of the Criminal Code . The accused appealed
to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and the verdicts of acquittal restored.

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Martland and Ritchie JJ.: There was dispute as to the vital question
of fact whether the appellant did the acts which he is proved to have done with
the guilty intention specified in the section. To determine whether an act,
admittedly done, was done with a certain intention, it is necessary to inquire
into the state of mind of the doer. Such an inquiry is as to a matter of fact.
Unless the intention is expressed, it will be founded on an inference drawn
from all the relevant circumstances. In drawing that inference, the Court is
making a finding of fact. If the trial judge erred in finding that the onus,
which was on the Crown to prove that the appellant did the acts complained of
with the specified guilty intention, had not been satisfied, his error was one
of fact. Sunbeam Corporation of Canada Ltd. v. The Queen [1969] S.C.R.
221, applied.

Per Judson and
Spence JJ.: The Court of Appeal has rightly concluded that the inference that
there was an intent to create a false or misleading appearance of active public
trading in a security, was irresistible. However, following the judgment in Sunbeam
Corporation of Canada Ltd. v. The Queen, supra, the trial judge’s error was
one of fact and the Crown had no right of appeal under s. 584 of the Code.

d’acquittement—Inférence quant à l’intention
est une question de fait—Code criminel , 1953‑54 (Can.), c. 51, art.
325(a), 584.

L’appelant, courtier depuis plusieurs années,
a été déclaré non coupable sur un acte d’accusation contenant 29 chefs
l’accusant d’avoir, avec l’intention de créer une apparence fausse ou trompeuse
de négociation publique active d’une valeur mobilière, fait des opérations par
l’entremise des facilités de la bourse canadienne sur cette valeur qui
n’entraînèrent aucun changement dans la propriété bénéficiaire de cette valeur,
contrairement à l’art. 325 (a) du Code criminel . Le juge au procès
a conclu que l’appelant avait fait les opérations en question
intentionnellement mais statua que la Couronne n’avait pas prouvé hors d’un
doute raisonnable que l’appelant avait eu l’intention de créer une apparence
fausse et trompeuse de négociation publique active. La Cour d’appel a mis de
côté les déclarations de non culpabilité, a jugé que les faits n’étaient pas
contestés et que la seule inférence que l’on pouvait tirer des faits était que
l’appelant avait eu l’intention de créer l’apparence fausse et trompeuse. Ceci,
d’après la Cour d’appel, soulevait une question de droit donnant à la Couronne
un droit d’appel en vertu de l’art. 584  du Code criminel . Le prévenu en
appela à cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être accueilli et les déclarations de culpabilité rétablies.

Le Juge en
Chef Cartwright et les Juges Martland et Ritchie: La question vitale de fait à
savoir si l’appelant a commis les actes que l’on a prouvé qu’il a commis avec
l’intention coupable spécifiée à l’article, était contestée. Pour juger si un
acte, reconnu comme ayant été commis, l’a été avec une certaine intention, il
est nécessaire d’enquêter sur l’état d’esprit de celui qui l’a commis. Une
telle enquête porte sur une question de fait. A moins que l’intention soit
exprimée, elle sera basée sur une inférence tirée de toutes les circonstances
pertinentes. En tirant cette inférence, la Cour en vient à une conclusion de
fait. Si le juge au procès a fait erreur en jugeant qu’on n’avait pas rencontré
le fardeau, qui était sur les épaules de la Couronne, de prouver que l’appelant
a commis les actes dont on se plaint avec l’intention coupable spécifiée, son
erreur en était une de fait. Sunbeam Corporation of
Canada Ltd. v. The Queen [1969] R.C.S. 221.

Les Juges
Judson et Spence: La Cour d’appel a jugé avec raison que l’inférence était
irrésistible que l’appelant avait eu l’intention de créer une apparence fausse
ou trompeuse de négociation publique active d’une valeur mobilière. Cependant,
vu le jugement de Sunbeam Corporation of Canada Ltd. v. The Queen, supra, l’erreur
du juge au procès était une erreur de fait et la Couronne n’avait pas droit
d’appel en vertu de l’art. 584 du Code.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’appel de

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario1, allowing an appeal by the Crown against a verdict of
acquittal. Appeal allowed.

[Page 375]

George D. Finlayson, Q.C., and Burton
Tait, for the appellant.

C.M. Powell, for the respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Martland
and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—This appeal is brought,
pursuant to s. 597(2) (a) of the Criminal Code , from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal[2]
pronounced on April 8, 1968, setting aside verdicts of acquittal entered on
February 9, 1966, by His Honour Judge Waisberg on twenty-nine counts in an
indictment and ordering verdicts of guilty on each of the twenty-nine counts to
be entered.

The respondent was tried before His Honour Judge
Waisberg in the County Court Judges Criminal Court for the County of York. The trial occupied seven
days. The indictment contained thirty-one counts. Except for differences in
dates and in the number of shares all the counts were in the same words. Count
1 read as follows:

1. REGINALD STUART LAMPARD stands charged
that he, on the 7th day of January, in the year 1963, at the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto, in the County of York, with intent to create a false or
misleading appearance of active public trading in the securities of Dominion
Leaseholds Limited, effected a transaction through the facilities of the
Canadian Stock Exchange in the securities of Dominion Leaseholds Limited, to
wit, 14,000 shares that involved no change in the beneficial ownership of the
said securities, contrary to The Criminal Code .

The offence charged is that defined in s. 325(a)
of the Code which reads:

325. Every one who, through the facility of
a stock exchange, curb market or other market, with intent to create a false or
misleading appearance of active public trading in a security or with intent to
create a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market price of a
security,

(a) effects a transaction in the security
that involves no change in the beneficial ownership thereof,

* *
*

is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for five years.

The Crown offered no evidence on count 27 and
consented to the dismissal of count 3. The charges contained in these two
counts were accordingly dismissed. His Honour found the appellant not guilty on
the remaining twenty-nine counts.

[Page 376]

The learned trial Judge found as a fact that the
appellant intended to effect each of the twenty-nine transactions in the shares
of Dominion Leaseholds Limited through the facilities of the Canadian Stock
Exchange and intended that there be no change in beneficial ownership in the
shares involved in the transactions. He acquitted the appellant because he was
not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to create a
false and misleading appearance of active public trading in the shares.

There is no dispute as to the carrying out of
the transactions. The appellant who had been in the brokerage business for many
years was at the material times president of Lampard and Company Limited, a
broker-dealer. The appellant had employed another person to run a publicity
campaign in connection with the shares of Dominion Leaseholds Limited.

The trading by the appellant which resulted in
the wash sales occurred on six different days in the months of January and
February 1963, namely January 7th, January 22nd, January 23rd, January 24th,
February 11th and February 18th.

On January 7th (counts 1, 2 and 4), the
appellant placed orders to buy 41,000 shares at 50¢, 1,000 shares at 49½¢
and 3,000 shares at 51¢. On the same day he placed an order to sell
46,000 shares at 50¢. These orders resulted in three wash trades
totalling 32,000 shares. On that day the total trading in the shares of
Dominion Leaseholds on the Canadian Stock Exchange was 152,000 shares.

On January 22nd, 1963 (counts 5 to 15) the
appellant placed seven orders to buy a total of 38,000 shares at 48½¢
through six different brokers. On the same day he placed four orders to sell a
total of 35,000 shares at 48½¢. These orders resulted in eleven wash
trades of 34,500 shares. The total volume of shares of Dominion Leaseholds
traded on the Canadian Stock Exchange on that day was 38,500.

On January 23rd (counts 16 to 26) the appellant
placed nine orders to buy a total of 173,500 shares through three different
brokers at prices ranging from 50¢ to 65¢. He also placed two
orders to sell a total of 147,500 shares at prices ranging from 50¢ to
56¢. These orders resulted in eleven

[Page 377]

wash trades of 143,000 shares. The total volume
of trading in the shares of Dominion Leaseholds on the Canadian Stock Exchange
on that day was 199,000 shares.

On January 24th (count 28), the appellant placed
one order to buy 20,000 shares at 52¢. On the same day he placed one
order to sell 20,000 shares resulting in one wash trade of 20,000 shares. The
total volume of shares traded on the Canadian Stock Exchange on that day was
25,000 shares.

On February 11th (counts 29 and 30) the
appellant placed two orders to buy a total of 70,000 shares at 62¢. On
the same day he placed two orders to sell a total of 90,000 shares at 62¢.
These orders resulted in wash trades of 69,500 shares. The total volume of
shares of Dominion Leaseholds traded on that day was 72,000 shares.

On February 18th (count 31) the appellant placed
two orders to buy a total of 50,000 shares at 74¢. On the same day he
placed two orders to sell a total of 50,000 shares at 74¢. These orders
resulted in one wash trade of 25,000 shares. The total volume of shares of
Dominion Leaseholds traded on that day was 60,150 shares.

On the buy side of the impeached transactions,
the appellant employed seven different brokers and the orders were placed in
the name of Lampard and Company as buyer. On the sell side most of the orders
were placed through one broker, J.T. Frame and Company, but neither the
appellant’s name nor the name of his company appeared on such sell orders
placed with that firm. Some of the sell orders with respect to transactions
referred to in counts 20 to 26 inclusive and counts 29 to 31 were placed by the
appellant with J.T. Leslie and Company showing Lampard and Company as seller.
All the sales referred to above were carried out at the direction of the
appellant.

On this evidence the learned trial Judge, having
concluded that the appellant effected the transactions without change in
beneficial ownership and that he did so intentionally, that is to say that it
was not due to accident, mistake or inadvertence that there was no change in
beneficial ownership, addressed himself to the remaining question as to whether
the appellant did so with intent to create a false or misleading appearance of
active public trading.

[Page 378]

The final conclusion at which the learned trial
Judge arrived is expressed in his reasons in the following two sentences:

I fail to see that the Crown has proven
beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to create a false
appearance.

* *
*

So that I find that I am not satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to create a false or misleading
appearance of active public trading and I cannot register a conviction. I have
some doubt and the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt and I
dismiss the charges.

The reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal
were delivered by McLennan J.A. After setting out the details of the
transactions he said in part:

...To take for example the simple case
proved with respect to count 28 where the respondent (i.e., the appellant in
this Court) placed one order to buy 20,000 shares and one to sell 20,000 shares
resulting in one wash trade of 20,000 shares. The total volume of shares traded
on the Exchange on that day was 25,000 shares and the only real public trading
that day was 5,000 shares.

It is, I think, irrefutable that a false
and misleading impression of active public trading was created with respect to
that count and so with all the other counts. The ticker tape records of the
transactions impeached with respect to the total volume each day carried to a
greater or lesser degree, depending upon the relationship between the wash
trades and the total volume of shares traded, a false and misleading appearance
of active public trading in the shares.

The respondent did not give evidence
himself nor did he call any witnesses on his own behalf. He had been in the
brokerage business for many years and must be taken in the absence of evidence
from which some other reasonable explanation may be inferred, not only to have
foreseen that each wash trade would create a false appearance of active public
trading, but to have intended that result. In Regina v. Jay (1965) 2
O.R. 471 referred to by the learned trial judge there was evidence in the
record that the accused had an intent other than the intent described in
section 325 . No such evidence of another intent is in the record in this
case or can be inferred.

The record also discloses other matters
relevant to the issue of intent. All the transactions set out in the 29 counts
related to the shares of one company. They were carried out in substantially
the same manner and on the sell side the name of the real seller was concealed
altogether in most of the transactions and in part with respect to the others.
In these circumstances when considering any intent with respect to any one
count, it is proper to consider the conduct of the respondent with respect to
the others in order to determine whether there was an intent to create a false
and misleading appearance of public activity in the shares. Regina v.
Stephens, 16 Cox. 387, C.C.R. referred to in Phipson on Evidence, 10th ed.
p. 464, and such other authorities as Makin v. Attorney General of New South
Wales (1894) A.C. 57; Harris v. Director of Public Prosecution (1952)
A.C. 694; Regina v. Doughty (1921) 50 O.L.R. 360; Regina v. Mortimer (1936)
25 Cr. App. R. 150.

[Page 379]

Considering the transactions proved in the
29 counts, their proximity in time, the manner in which they were executed,
including the subterfuge with respect to most of the sales, the employment of
Roberts to run a publicity campaign with respect to the shares of Dominion
Leaseholds, I can come to only one conclusion—and in my opinion it is an
irresistible one—that the respondent was engaged in a scheme or plan to create
a false and misleading appearance of active public trading in the shares of Dominion
Leaseholds.

Counsel for the respondent submitted that
the finding of reasonable doubt of the learned trial judge was a finding of
fact from which the Crown has no right of appeal by virtue of the provisions of
section 584  of the Criminal Code . As already stated the facts are not in
dispute and in such circumstances where there is only one reasonable inference
to be drawn from the facts, if that inference is not drawn a question of law is
raised. Edwards (Inspector of Income Tax) v. Bearstow (1956) A.C. 14; Bracegirdle
v. Oxley (1947) 1 All E.R. 126 discussed and approved by this Court in Regina
v. Sunbeam Corporation of Canada Limited (1967) 1 O.R. 661. Here the facts
are not in dispute and as I have said the only inference that can be drawn from
the facts in the record is that the respondent intended to create a false and
misleading appearance of active public trading which raises a question of law
and the Crown has a right of appeal.

For the reasons given, I would allow the
appeal, set aside the verdicts of acquittal and direct the entry of verdicts of
guilty on each of the 29 counts.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal in Regina
v. Sunbeam Corporation of Canada Ltd. referred to and relied upon by
McLennan J.A. was reversed by this Court[3]
in a judgment delivered on November 1, 1968. I venture to think that if the
Court of Appeal had had the advantage of reading the reasons of the majority of
the Court in that case delivered by my brother Ritchie they would have come to
a different conclusion.

The basis of the decision of the Court of Appeal
is found in the sentence already quoted above:

...Here the facts are not in dispute and as
I have said the only inference that can be drawn from the facts in the record
is that the respondent intended to create a false and misleading appearance of
active public trading which raises a question of law and the Crown has a right
of appeal.

With the greatest respect I am unable to agree
that a question of law was raised. It is not correct to say that the facts are
not in dispute. There is dispute as to the vital question of fact whether the
appellant did the acts which he is proved to have done with the guilty
intention specified in the section.

[Page 380]

To determine whether an act, admittedly done,
was done with a certain intention it is necessary to inquire into the state of
mind of the doer. That such an inquiry is as to a matter of fact has often been
held.

In Clayton v. Ramsden[4], Lord Wright said:

States of mind are capable of proof like
other matters of fact.

In Edgington v. Fitzmaurice[5], Bowen L.J. said:

But the state of a man’s mind is as much a
fact as the state of his digestion. It is true that it is very difficult to
prove what the state of a man’s mind at a particular time is, but if it can be
ascertained it is as much a fact as anything else.

Nothing that was said in regard to Bowen L.J.’s
celebrated dictum either in R. v. Dent[6]
or in Cox and Paton v. The Queen[7] throws
any doubt on the pronouncement that the state of a man’s mind is a fact.

Unless the doer of the act has expressed his
intention, the finding as to what that intention was will necessarily be
founded on an inference drawn from all the relevant circumstances proved in
evidence. It has often been pointed out that where a trial judge makes findings
of primary facts and draws an inference therefrom an appellate tribunal is in
as good a position as was the trial judge to decide what inference should be
drawn, but in drawing the inference the Court is making a finding of fact. In
the case of an appeal at large the Court of Appeal has, of course, power to
substitute its view, as to what inference should be drawn, for that of the
trial judge, but where, as in the case at bar, the jurisdiction of the Court of
Appeal is limited to questions of law in the strict sense it has no such power.

When the onus of establishing a certain fact
lies upon a party it may be a question of law whether there is any evidence (as
distinguished from sufficient evidence) to prove that fact. In the case at bar
the onus was, of course, upon the Crown to prove that the appellant did the
acts complained of with the guilty intention specified in the section. If the
learned trial Judge erred in finding that that onus had not been satisfied, his
error was one of fact,

[Page 381]

certainly not one of law in the strict sense.
The applicable principles are clearly set out in the reasons of my brother
Ritchie giving the judgment of the majority of this Court in the Sunbeam case,
supra, and it is not necessary to repeat them.

In a criminal case (except in the rare cases in
which a statutory provision places an onus upon the accused) it can sometimes
be said as a matter of law that there is no evidence on which the Court can
convict but never that there is no evidence on which it can acquit; there is
always the rebuttable presumption of innocence.

Nothing would be gained by my expressing an
opinion as to what inference as to the intention of the appellant the learned
trial Judge should have drawn from the primary facts which he found to have
been proved. The Court of Appeal has said in the passage quoted above that
“there is only one reasonable inference”, that the conclusion that the guilty
intention existed in the mind of the appellant is “an irresistible one”, that
it is “the only inference that can be drawn from the facts in the record”. If I
shared fully the view so expressed by the Court of Appeal, I would none the
less be satisfied that the error (if such it were) made by the learned trial
Judge in failing to draw the suggested inference was an error of fact.

In my opinion the Court of Appeal has fallen
into the error of saying that the question of what inference should be drawn
from certain undisputed facts is a question of law. Whether or not it is so
must depend on the nature of the question as to which the inference is to be
drawn. Here, as I have endeavoured to show above, the inference is as to the
intention with which the appellant effected the transactions, that is as to the
state of the appellant’s mind, which is a question of fact.

Before parting with the matter I should point
out that the Crown’s appeal from the acquittal was based on and limited to a
single ground stated in the notice of appeal as follows:

The learned Trial Judge, having found that
the accused had effected the transactions alleged in the indictment, erred in
law in holding that there was any evidence from which it could be inferred that
the accused had any intent other than the intent alleged in the indictment.

This wording seems to me to suggest a
misapprehension as to one of the cardinal principles of the criminal law.

[Page 382]

In order for the appellant to be convicted it
was essential for the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
did the acts complained of with the specified guilty intent. That is an onus
which never shifts. It was not incumbent upon the appellant to show that he did
the acts with some intent other than that charged in the indictment.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal and restore the verdicts of acquittal entered by the
learned trial Judge.

The judgment of Judson and Spence JJ. was
delivered by

JUDSON J.:—The facts relating to the trading
activities of R.S. Lampard, the appellant here, are fully set out in the
reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal[8]
and the reasons of the Chief Justice in this Court. Under s. 584(1)(a)
of the Criminal Code , the Attorney General’s appeal is confined to “any
ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone”. The appellant here
submits that if there was error in the judgment at trial, which he does not
admit, it is error in fact.

The basis of the judgment of the learned trial
judge, who was sitting without a jury, was that the trading activities of the
appellant did not indicate to him beyond a reasonable doubt that they were
carried out “with intent to create a false or misleading appearance of active
public trading in a security”. On the other hand, a unanimous Court of Appeal
thought that the inference that there was such intent was irresistible.

I agree with this conclusion of the Court of
Appeal but we are still left with the question whether the error was one of
fact or law. I am compelled by the majority judgment of this Court delivered in
Sunbeam Corporation of Canada Ltd. v. The Queen[9] to hold that the error—and I am sure that
it was error—was one of fact. The appeal therefore succeeds.

Appeal allowed and verdicts of
acquittal restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
SASKATCHEWAN

Criminal law—Non-capital
murder—Drunkenness—Provocation—Whether jury properly instructed on
provocation—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 208.

After an absence of some five years, the
appellant returned to visit his parents. A few days after his arrival he
purchased a revolver. This act infuriated his father who was still in an angry
mood when he arrived home from work that night. The appellant, who had spent
most of the day drinking beer with friends, telephoned home to say that he
would spend the night with his grandfather. The father then went to the
grandfather’s home, walked in without knocking, went straight to his son and
demanded the gun. The appellant replied that he was 21 and fired three shots at
his father killing him. The appellant was charged with non-capital murder and
was convicted of manslaughter. The Crown appealed on the ground particularly
that the trial judge erred in his directions on the question of provocation.
The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on the charge of non-capital murder.
The accused appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Assuming that there was any evidence of
provocation, within the meaning of s. 203 of the Code, to go to the jury,
the instructions given to the jury, with respect to the test governing
provocation, were inadequate and the verdict might have been different had they
been rightly directed in the matter. The determination of the question whether
there had been any provocation sufficient to reduce the charge to manslaughter
was subject to the dual test stated in s. 203(2) of the Code. The first is
an objective test in which one must consider the effect, on an ordinary person,
of the particular wrongful act or insult relied on. The character, background,
temperament, idiosyncracies or drunkenness of the accused are excluded from the
consideration on this first test. If that first test is satisfied, then the
second, a subjective test, is to determine whether the accused acted actually
upon the provocation, on the sudden and before there was time for his passion
to cool. In the present case, one can hardly escape the conclusion that the
jury must or may have been left with the impression that the test was whether
the conduct of the appellant’s father was of such a nature as to deprive—not
the ordinary man but—the accused himself of the power of self control.

qualifié—Ivresse—Provocation—Directives au jury sur la question de provocation

[Page 336]

Après une absence de quelque cinq années,
l’appelant est revenu visiter ses parents. Quelques jours après son arrivée, il
a acheté un pistolet. Ceci a considérablement irrité son père qui était encore
en colère lorsqu’il est arrivé chez lui ce soir-là après son travail.
L’appelant, qui avait passé presque toute la journée à boire de la bière avec
des amis, a téléphoné à la maison pour dire qu’il passerait la nuit chez son
grand-père. Le père est alors allé chez le grand-père, est entré dans la maison
sans frapper, s’est dirigé directement vers son fils et a demandé le pistolet.
L’appelant a répondu qu’il avait 21 ans et a tué son père en lui tirant trois
balles. L’appelant a été accusé de meurtre non qualifié et a été trouvé
coupable d’homicide involontaire coupable. La Couronne s’est pourvue en appel
pour le motif principalement que le juge au procès avait donné des directives
erronées sur la question de provocation. La Cour d’appel a ordonné un nouveau
procès sur l’acte d’accusation de meurtre non qualifié. L’accusé en appela à
cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté.

Prenant pour acquis qu’il y avait une preuve
de provocation, dans le sens de l’art. 203 du Code, pouvant aller au jury, les
directives données au jury sur le critère relatif à la provocation, n’étaient
pas adéquates et le verdict aurait pu être différent si le jury avait reçu des
directives appropriées. La détermination de la question de savoir s’il y a eu
provocation suffisante pour réduire l’acte d’accusation à un d’homicide
involontaire coupable dépend du double critère énoncé à l’art. 203(2) du Code.
Le premier est un critère objectif dans lequel on doit considérer l’effet, sur
une personne ordinaire, de l’action injuste ou de l’insulte en question. Le
caractère de l’accusé, ainsi que ses antécédents, son tempérament, ses manies
ou son ivresse sont exclus de la considération dans ce premier critère. Si ce
premier critère est satisfait, alors par le second, un critère subjectif, on
doit déterminer si l’accusé a agi actuellement en vertu de la provocation, sous
l’impulsion du moment et avant d’avoir eu le temps de reprendre son sang-froid.
Dans le cas présent, on peut difficilement éviter la conclusion que le jury
doit ou peut avoir été laissé sous l’impression que le critère était de savoir
si. la conduite du père de l’appelant était de nature à priver—non pas l’homme
ordinaire mais—l’accusé lui-même du pouvoir de se maîtriser.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’appel de la
Saskatchewan[1], ordonnant un nouveau procès. Appel rejeté.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Saskatchewan1, ordering a new trial. Appeal dismissed.

Brian A. Crane, for the appellant.

Serge Kujawa, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

[Page 337]

FAUTEUX J.:—The appellant has been charged that
he did, on the 20th day of December 1966, at Moosomin, Saskatchewan, unlawfully kill his father, Frank Albert Wright,
thereby committing the offence of non-capital murder. Tried at Moosomin, in
April 1967, before Davis J. and a jury, he was acquitted of this offence and
found guilty of the lesser offence of manslaughter.

Pursuant to s. 584(1)(a) Cr. C, the
Crown appealed from this verdict to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. By a unanimous judgment, the
Court of Appeal[2] allowed
the appeal, set aside the verdict of manslaughter and ordered a new trial on
the charge of non-capital murder.

Appellant now appeals from this Order pursuant
to s. 597(2) (a) of the Criminal Code .

It is convenient to say immediately that we all
agree that, for the reasons hereafter stated, there should be a new trial. In
these circumstances, only what is essential to our decision should be said.

The evidence shows, beyond per adventure, that
the father died as the result of being shot three times by his son, in the
early hours of the 20th of December 1966. The circumstances leading to this
tragedy are set out in detail in the reasons for judgment of the learned Chief
Justice of Saskatchewan who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal. For
the purpose of our decision, the following summary will, I think, be
sufficient. Appellant was then 25 years old, married with one child. A few days
before the fatal occurrence, namely on the 11th of December, he had returned
from British Columbia to Moosomin, to visit his parents whom he had not seen
since he had left for British Columbia in 1961. Prior to 1961, he was living
with them in Moosomin and there is some evidence that, during that period,
there were difficulties between him and his father who is said to have been a
bad tempered and violent man and to have, on many occasions, abused and slapped
his son. However, during this visit, the relationship was and remained happy
and cordial until some time after 9.30 p.m. on December the 19th when, at

[Page 338]

the beverage room of the Queen’s Hotel where he
was employed as a tapman, the father was informed by one Bernie Myers, a friend
of the appellant, that his son had just bought a revolver from him. The father
then became infuriated and was still in an angry mood when he arrived home
shortly after midnight accompanied by one Norman Hoey. He and his wife were
worried that their son might commit suicide. Concerned with the whereabouts of
his son, the father had enquiries made at the residence of the latter’s
maternal grandfather, Henry Hnatyczyn, and also at the residence of Myers. The
appellant who had spent most of the day drinking beer with friends at the
Queen’s Hotel beer parlour and other places, arrived at his grandfather’s home
at about 2.15 in the morning of December 20th, after having had a late meal. He
telephoned to his parents’ place and informed his mother, who answered the
call, that he would spend the night at his grandfather’s. The mother testified
that before she could hang up the telephone, the father shoved her, grabbed the
telephone, said a few words and became furious as the son hung up on him. And
the mother added that her husband then said I am going down there to get
that goddam gun and I’ll beat some brains into him that should have been done
when he was a kid. Thereupon, appellant’s father left, drove Hoey home and
went to Hnatyczyn’s residence. He entered the house through the porch door,
without knocking, went straight to his son and with a voice showing authority
and anger, said give me the gun. To this, appellant replied I am
twenty-one and he then fired the three shots at his father. A few minutes
later, appellant called the police and said I shot my father, come
and get me.

In defence, the accused pleaded that he was affected
by alcohol to a point of losing the capacity to form the intent requisite in a
case of non-capital murder and he also pleaded that he killed his father in the
heat of passion caused by sudden provocation. On either grounds, the jury were
invited by defence counsel to return—as they subsequently did—a verdict of
manslaughter and not of noncapital murder. Hence the appeal of the Crown
against this verdict.

[Page 339]

In the Court of Appeal, the Crown’s complaints
were directed particularly to the matter of provocation as to which it was
submitted (i) that the trial Judge had erred in law in holding that there was
some evidence of a wrongful act or insult, within the meaning of s. 203  of
the Criminal Code , upon which the defence of provocation could be founded,
and (ii) alternatively, that the trial Judge had erred in law in failing to
instruct the jury adequately as to the test to be applied in the consideration
of a plea of provocation. On the first submission, the Court of Appeal held
that the evidence upon which the trial Judge relied, and upon which he
instructed the jury, was not evidence of provocation within s. 203  Cr. C.,
but declared that it was not saying that there may not have been, in evidence,
evidence of provocation to go to the jury. On the second and alternative
submission, the Court of Appeal found that there was a serious error in law in
the trial Judge’s charge, in that, in dealing with the question whether the
provocative conduct of the victim was of such a nature as to be sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control, he failed to instruct
the jury that no consideration should be given to the quality of the
relationship between the son and his father, or to the mentality of the son or
to the fact that his mind may have been affected by alcohol. And the Court of
Appeal, being satisfied that had there been no such error the verdict of the
jury would not necessarily have been the same, directed the verdict of
manslaughter to be set aside and ordered a new trial on the charge of
non-capital murder.

We find it unnecessary to say anything and we
are saying nothing on the question whether, as contended for by counsel for the
appellant, there was, in evidence, any evidence of provocation—within the
meaning of section 203 —to go to the jury for, assuming that there was
any, we are, for the reasons hereafter stated, in respectful agreement with the
Court of Appeal that the instructions given to the jury, with respect to the
test governing provocation, were inadequate and that the verdict might have
been different had they been rightly directed in the matter.

[Page 340]

The determination of the question whether there
had been any provocation sufficient to reduce a culpable homicide from
non-capital murder to manslaughter is subject to the dual test stated in
s. 203(2):

203.(1) …

(2) A wrongful act or insult that is of
such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control is provocation for the purposes of this section if the
accused acted upon it on the sudden and before there was time for his passion
to cool.

One must then first consider the effect, on an ordinary
person, of the particular wrongful act or insult relied on. In the words of
Lord Simonds, L.C., the purpose of this objective test is …to invite the
jury to consider the act of the accused by reference to a certain standard or
norm of conduct and with this object the “reasonable” or the “average” or the
“normal” man is invoked. Bedder v. Director of Public Prosecutions[3]. It is not enough, therefore, that
an accused acted in a blind rage, if this first requirement of s. 203(2)
is not satisfied. If it is satisfied, then the second branch of the enquiry, or
the subjective test, is to determine whether the accused acted actually upon the
provocation, on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool.
While the character, background, temperament, idiosyncracies, or the
drunkenness of the accused are matters to be considered in the second branch of
the enquiry, they are excluded from the consideration in the first branch. A
contrary view would denude of any sense the objective test. On this aspect of
the matter, one may refer to what was said by Lord Simonds, L.C., at page 804,
in the Bedder case, supra:

It was urged on your Lordships that the
hypothetical reasonable man must be confronted with all the same circumstances
as the accused, and that this could not be fairly done unless he was also
invested with the peculiar characteristics of the accused. But this makes
nonsense of the test. Its purpose is to invite the jury to consider the act of
the accused by reference to a certain standard or norm of conduct and with this
object the “reasonable” or the “average” or the “normal” man is invoked. If the
reasonable man is then deprived in whole or in part of his reason, or the
normal man endowed with abnormal characteristics, the test ceases to have any
value. This is precisely the consideration which led this House in Mancini’s
case (1) to say that an unusually excitable or pugnacious person is not
entitled to rely on provocation which would not have led an ordinary person to
act as he did.

[Page 341]

In Salamon v. The Queen[4], this Court, with a similar view of
the law as to this aspect of the matter, indicated that, on the first branch of
the enquiry, the jury should be directed that no consideration should be given
to the peculiar or abnormal characteristics with which the accused may
personally be invested. In the present case, nowhere either in the charge or
the re-charge, can such a direction be found. On the contrary and
notwithstanding that the provisions of s. 203(2) were read to the jury, on
a consideration of all that was said to them by the trial Judge, one can hardly
escape the conclusion that they must or may have been left with the impression
that the test was whether the conduct of appellant’s father was of such a
nature as to deprive—not the ordinary man but—the accused himself of the power
of self‑control.

For these reasons, we cannot accede to
appellant’s submissions that the jury were adequately directed with respect to
the test governing provocation.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Habitual criminal—Preventive
detention—46 convictions prior to substantive offence—Most of the offences
being related to possession and use of gasoline credit cards or automobiles—Whether
it was expedient for the protection of the public to impose sentence of
preventive detention—Menace to society—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51,
s. 662.

Following his conviction on a charge of theft
of an automobile in January 1967, the appellant, who had been apprehended in
May 1967, was sentenced to a term of 3-year imprisonment on June 10, 1967. The
notice required by s. 662(1)  of the Criminal Code  was duly served
and the appellant was brought before the magistrate on November 14. The notice
specified 46 convictions in addition to the substantive offence. With the
exception of one conviction for armed robbery and one for theft of money, all
convictions related to unlawful possession and use of gasoline credit cards or
automobiles. The magistrate found that at the time of the commission of the
substantive offence the appellant was leading persistently a criminal life and
that he was an habitual criminal. A sentence of preventive detention was then
imposed. The Court of Appeal affirmed the finding and the sentence. The
appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held (Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
allowed and the sentence imposed in respect of the substantive offence
restored.

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Judson, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.: On the evidence, the finding that
the appellant was an habitual criminal was a proper finding. However, it has
not been shown beyond a reasonable doubt that it was expedient for the
protection of the public that the appellant should be sentenced to preventive
detention. His criminal record is a formidable one but there is evidence that
his last employer would be willing to re-employ him on his release. The
appellant did not constitute so grave a menace that the protection of the
public required that he be deprived of his liberty for the remainder of his
life, subject only to the provisions of s. 666  of the Criminal Code  and
the Parole Act.

Per Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: The finding that the
appellant was an habitual criminal was a proper one under the circumstances and
the Court of Appeal did not err in affirming the magistrate’s finding that it
was expedient for the protection of the public in that province to sentence him
to preventive detention. In forming its opinion as to whether or not it is
expedient for the protection of the public to sentence an habitual criminal to
preventive detention, one of the main questions to be determined by the Court
is whether he is a man whose record indicates that after he has

[Page 866]

derived the maximum benefit from imprisonment
the public will be. best protected, and his own interest best served, by
ensuring that his return to society is made subject to supervision and control
of the Parole Board. In imposing a sentence of preventive detention the Court
must be satisfied that there is a real danger to the public in the prospect of
the accused being allowed at large in society without supervision after the
expiration of his sentence for the substantive offence with which he is
charged. Section 660  is to be applied in the cases of persons who have shown
themselves to be so habitually addicted to serious crime as to constitute a
threat to other persons or property in any community in which they live, and
for so long as they remain at large without supervision. Habitual criminals
with records such as the present appellant are proper subjects for the
application of s. 660  of the Criminal Code .

Droit criminel—Repris de justice—Détention préventive—46

une sentence de détention préventive—Menace pour la société—Code Criminel ,
1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 662.

Ayant été déclaré coupable sur une inculpation
de vol d’une automobile en janvier 1967, l’appelant, qui avait été arrêté en
mai 1967, a été condamné à un terme de trois ans d’emprisonnement le 10 juin
1967. L’avis requis par l’art. 662(1)  du Code Criminel  lui a été dûment
signifié et l’appelant a comparu à nouveau devant le magistrat le 14 novembre.
L’avis contenait 46 condamnations en plus de l’infraction dont il s’agit. Sauf
une déclaration de culpabilité pour vol à main armée et une pour vol d’argent,
toutes les déclarations de culpabilité se rapportent à la possession et l’utilisation
illégales d’automobiles ou de cartes de crédit de gazoline. Le magistrat a conclu
qu’au moment de la commission de l’infraction dont il s’agit l’appelant menait
avec persistance une vie criminelle et il l’a déclaré repris de justice. Une
sentence de détention préventive lui a alors été imposée. La Cour d’appel a
confirmé la déclaration ainsi que la sentence. L’appelant a obtenu la
permission d’appeler à cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel doit
être accueilli et la sentence de trois ans imposée le 10 juin doit être
rétablie, les Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland et Ritchie étant dissidents.

Le Juge en Chef
Cartwright et les Juges Judson, Hall, Spence et Pigeon: Sur la preuve, la
conclusion que l’appelant était un repris de justice est la conclusion
appropriée. Cependant, il n’a pas été démontré hors d’un doute raisonnable qu’il
était opportun pour la protection du public que l’appelant soit condamné à la
détention préventive. Son dossier est formidable mais la preuve contient une
déclaration que son dernier employeur serait consentant à l’employer à nouveau
après sa mise en liberté. L’appelant n’est pas une menace si grave que la
protection du public exige qu’il soit privé de sa liberté pour le reste de sa
vie, sujet seulement aux dispositions de l’art. 666  du Code Criminel  et
de la Loi sur la libération conditionnelle de détenus.

Les Juges Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland et Ritchie, dissidents: Dans les circonstances, il
était approprié que l’appelant soit déclaré repris de justice, et la Cour d’appel
n’a pas fait erreur en confirmant la conclu-

[Page 867]

sion du magistrat qu’il était opportun pour la
protection du public dans cette province d’imposer à l’appelant une sentence de
détention préventive. En se faisant une opinion sur la question de savoir s’il
est opportun pour la protection du public d’imposer une sentence de détention
préventive à une personne déclarée repris de justice, une des questions
principales que la Cour doit déterminer est de savoir s’il s’agit d’un homme
dont le dossier indique qu’après qu’il a tiré le plus grand avantage possible
de l’emprisonnement le public sera des mieux protégé, et ses propres intérêts à
lui seront des mieux servis, si l’on s’assure que son retour dans la société
est sujet à la surveillance et au contrôle de la Commission nationale des
libérations conditionnelles. La Cour doit être satisfaite, lorsqu’elle impose
une sentence de détention préventive, qu’il y a un danger réel pour le public
dans la perspective qu’il soit permis à l’accusé de s’en aller en liberté dans
la société sans surveillance après l’expiration de sa sentence pour l’infraction
dont il a été accusé. L’article 660  s’applique aux cas de personnes qui se sont
montrées tellement adonnées habituellement au crime qu’elles constituent une
menace pour les autres personnes ou la propriété dans la communauté où elles
vivent, et pour aussi longtemps qu’elles demeurent en liberté sans
surveillance. L’article 660  du Code Criminel  s’applique aux personnes
déclarées repris de justice et possédant un dossier comme celui que possède l’appelant.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia, affirming a sentence of preventive detention. Appeal allowed,
Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.

Kenneth G. Young, for the appellant.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Judson,
Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—This appeal is brought,
pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a unanimous judgment of the Court
of Appeal for British Columbia, pronounced on January 30, 1968, dismissing an
appeal against a sentence of preventive detention imposed upon the appellant by
His Worship Magistrate Isman, at Vancouver, on November 14, 1967, in lieu of a
sentence of three years

[Page 868]

imprisonment imposed upon him by His Worship
Magistrate Walker, at Vancouver, on June 10, 1967, following his conviction on
June 3, 1967, on a charge that, at the City of Vancouver, between the 1st and
11th days of January, 1967, he did commit theft of a 1966 Ford Galaxie
automobile of a value in excess of $50.

At the date of the hearing before Magistrate
Isman, November 14, 1967, the appellant was forty-seven years of age.

No question was raised as to the fulfilment of
the conditions precedent to the hearing of the application by Magistrate Isman
prescribed by s. 662(1)  of the Criminal Code . The notice required
by that subsection was duly served on the appellant and a copy was filed
with the Clerk of the Court.

The notice specified forty-six convictions in
addition to the conviction on June 3, 1967, before Magistrate Walker of
the offence set out in the opening paragraph of these reasons, which is
hereinafter referred to as “the substantive offence”, and concluded

B. Other circumstances:

1. That you are an habitual associate of
criminals;

2. That after brief periods of freedom you
have consistently returned to your criminal way of life;

3. That during your brief periods of
freedom you have not had regular gainful employment.

No evidence was called by the Crown to show that
since his release early in October 1966 the appellant was associating with
criminals.

The learned magistrate found that it was proved
beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time of the commission of the substantive
offence the appellant was leading persistently a criminal life. This finding
was concurred in by the Court of Appeal and I can find no ground for
disagreeing with it. This leaves for consideration the question whether it is
expedient for the protection of the public to sentence the appellant to
preventive detention.

Davey C.J.B.C., who gave the judgment of the
Court of Appeal, opened his reasons on this branch of the matter with the
sentence:

The only doubt I have, or did have, is
whether a sentence of preventive detention is expedient.

[Page 869]

The learned Chief Justice continued:

… This man produced a letter from his
employer, Ann Kostrich, which said that he was an honest man, which perhaps is
true limited to her experience with him, but certainly was not true in view of
his record and in view of his conduct while he was employed by her, because
while employed by her he bought a car in Ontario for one hundred and
twenty-five dollars and he switched the licence plates from the Ontario car to
the B.C. car and vice versa, so that the presence of the B.C. car would not be
noticed and identified. During that time, from the statement of Staff Sergeant
Campbell, he continued to use the credit card, notwithstanding that he was
gainfully employed at seventy-five dollars a week, I think it was.

Now the learned Magistrate expressly
refrained from taking those circumstances into consideration. In my judgment
they were both relevant and material, and important. They are relevant to the
question of whether this man was persistently leading a criminal life at the
date of the substantive offence, because while they occurred after the
commission of the substantive offence, they show full light on his activities
at the time of the commission of the offence, and they explain what he did.
They are also relevant and material to the question of the expediency of
preventive detention, because they show that while gainfully employed he was
still using the motor car which he had stolen; he switched the plates to
conceal its identity; and he continued to use the stolen credit card. To my
mind those circumstances destroy the inference which might have otherwise been
open that by getting gainful employment he had determined to rehabilitate
himself and that a sentence of preventive detention was no longer necessary. On
those grounds I would dismiss the appeal.

It should be explained that while the
substantive offence was committed between the 1st and 11th of January 1967, the
appellant was not apprehended until the end of May 1967. The exact date of his
arrest does not appear in the record.

I agree with the view of Davey C.J.B.C. that
evidence as to the appellant’s way of life between the date of the commission
of the substantive offence and his arrest some time thereafter was admissible
and relevant to both the questions (i) Whether he was leading persistently a
criminal life and (ii) whether it is expedient to sentence him to preventive
detention. The contrary view expressed by the learned magistrate was, no doubt,
founded on the following passage in Kirkland v. The Queen[1]:

In my opinion it is established by these
decisions, and I would so hold on the wording of s. 575c(1) if the matter
were devoid of authority, that before an accused can be found to be an habitual
criminal the Crown, in addition to proving the prescribed number of previous
convictions, must

[Page 870]

satisfy the onus of proving beyond a
reasonable doubt that at the time when he committed the indictable offence
referred to in s. 575B the accused was leading persistently a criminal
life.

While the question which I am now considering
did not arise in the Kirkland case, as there the accused was arrested
immediately after committing the substantive offence, the statement that the
date as of Which it is to be determined whether an accused is leading
persistently a criminal life is the date of the substantive offence has been
repeated in subsequent judgments of this Court.

In Paton v. The Queen[2], Judson J. who delivered the
judgment of the majority of the Court said at p. 355:

… One thing that Kirkland v. The Queen does
decide is that it must be shown on the application to have the accused declared
an habitual criminal that he is leading ‘persistently’ a criminal life, and
that on this branch of the case the date to be taken is the date of the
commission of the primary or substantive offence.

In Hadden v. The Queen[3], with the concurrence of Judson,
Hall and Spence JJ., I said:

It has been held in a unanimous judgment of
this Court in Kirkland v. The Queen that the time at which the Crown
must show that an accused is leading persistently a criminal life is the time
of the commission of the substantive offence.

But Pigeon J., while agreeing in the result, did
not agree with this passage.

The question which I am now considering did not
arise for decision in either Paton v. The Queen or Hadden v. The
Queen. In each of these cases the accused was arrested on the same day as
that on which he committed the substantive offence.

I find myself in complete agreement with the
following passage in the reasons of Pigeon J. in Paton v. The Queen, supra, at
pp. 362 and 363:

Concerning the unanimous decision of this
Court in Kirkland v. The Queen, this appears to be a case for the
application of the rule enunciated by Lord Halsbury in Quinn v. Leathern and
often referred to in this Court v.g. Regina v. Snider; The Queen v. Harder;
Robert v. Marquis, ‘that a case is only an authority for what it actually
decides’. In the Kirkland case the determination of the period of time
to be considered in making a finding that an accused is an habitual criminal
was not in issue. The only question considered was what evidence is necessary
to prove that an accused is ‘leading persistently a criminal life’. In the

[Page 871]

reasons for judgment it was said (at
p. 7) that ‘the Crown had failed to satisfy the onus of proving that at
the time of the commission of the substantive offence, the appellant was
leading persistently a criminal life’. In that case the accused had been
apprehended immediately after the commission of the primary offence and
undoubtedly was afterwards in custody until the sentence was passed. Therefore,
it was obvious that the fact of leading persistently a criminal life was to be
proved to have existed at the time of the commission of the primary offence and
not subsequently as must indeed be the case in practically every instance,
seeing that accused with criminal records such as to render them apt to be declared
habitual criminals are not usually let out on bail. Thus, it appears to me that
what was said in Kirkland v. The Queen should be taken merely as a
statement of what had to be proved in that case, not as an exposition of the
meaning of the statute applicable to different circumstances.

In the case at bar if it were shown beyond a
reasonable doubt that up to the time when he was arrested in May 1967 the
appellant was leading persistently a criminal life and the other conditions
prescribed in s. 660(2) were fulfilled, this would warrant a finding that
the appellant was an habitual criminal. I have already stated my conclusion
that this was a proper finding on the evidence in this case.

I am, however, of opinion that it has not been
shown beyond a reasonable doubt that it is expedient for the protection of the
public that the appellant should be sentenced to preventive detention.

Of the 47 convictions set out in the Notice of
Application, 27 (Nos. 7, 20, 21 and 23 to 46 inclusive), relate to the unlawful
possession and use, by the appellant, of gasoline credit cards. Twenty-four of
them, Nos. 23 to 46 inclusive, all of which were made on July 21, 1965, and
involved sums totalling $245.95 resulted, in the words of counsel for the
appellant, from “a single spree” extending over the month of December 1964 and
early January 1965. Of the remaining offences enumerated in the Notice of
Application 8, Nos. 1, 3, 5, 10, 13, 18, 19 and the “substantive offence”
itself, relate to the theft and/or unlawful possession and use, by the
appellant, of automobiles.

Since 1957, with the exception of one conviction
for theft of money in March 1965, the appellant has been involved in no
criminal activity which has not, in some way, related to automobiles or
gasoline credit cards.

Only one of the 47 convictions was for a crime
of violence, armed robbery. This conviction was in October 1957 and the
appellant was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment. He

[Page 872]

appears to have served 5 years of this sentence
and I think it not unreasonable to assume that that sentence has had the effect
of deterring him from the commission of further violent crime.

The appellant has now served almost two years of
the sentence of three years imposed for the substantive offence. He must
realize that if he is set at liberty at the expiration of that sentence and
thereafter commits either of the offences of stealing an automobile or
obtaining gasoline by fraudulent means he will be liable to a maximum sentence
of 10 years imprisonment. His criminal record is indeed a formidable one but
there is evidence that his last employer is willing to re-employ him on his
release. On the whole, I am of opinion that, although it is impossible to say
that the appellant is merely a nuisance, he does not constitute so grave a
menace that the protection of the public requires that he be deprived of his
liberty for the remainder of his life, subject only to the provisions of
s. 666  of the Criminal Code  and the Parole Act.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the sentence
of preventive detention and restore the sentence of three years imprisonment
imposed in respect of the substantive offence.

The judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and
Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J. (dissenting):—I have had the
advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice and after
careful consideration, I have decided that it is desirable for me to record my
reasons for dissenting from his view.

The Chief Justice has concluded that the finding
that the appellant was an habitual criminal was a proper one under the
circumstances and with this I respectfully agree; but I cannot assign any
ground for holding that the Court of Appeal of British Columbia erred in
affirming the opinion of the learned magistrate that it was expedient for the
protection of the public in that Province to sentence the appellant to
preventive detention.

I think it to be convenient at the outset to
reproduce in full the habitual criminal provisions contained in s. 660  of
the Criminal Code  which read as follows:

660. (1) Where an accused has been
convicted of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a
sentence of preventive deten-

[Page 873]

tion in lieu of any other sentence that
might be imposed for the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed
for such offence, or in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such
offence if the sentence has expired, if

(a) the accused is found to be an
habitual criminal, and

(b) the court is of the opinion that
because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection
of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.

(2) For the purposes of
subsection (1), an accused is an habitual criminal if

(a) he has previously, since
attaining the age of eighteen years, on at least three separate and independent
occasions been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to
imprisonment for five years or more and is leading persistently a criminal
life, or

(b) he has been previously sentenced
to preventive detention.

(3) At the hearing of an application under
subsection (1), the accused is entitled to be present.

In the case of Poole v. The Queen[4], which was heard by the full Court in
December of last year, it was decided by the majority that this Court has
jurisdiction under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act to entertain an
application for leave to appeal from a finding that, in relation to the
appellant “it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to
preventive detention”. In the reasons for judgment of the majority it was
stipulated that:

Whether or not in any particular case it is
expedient to so sentence a person found to be an habitual criminal is a
question of fact or perhaps a question of mixed law and fact; it is certainly
not a question of law alone.

It was also recognized by the Court of Appeal of
British Columbia in Regina v. Charming[5]
that the determination of what is expedient for the protection of the public is
a question of fact in each case, but as the determination of this issue is, under
the provisions of s. 660(1) (b) of the Criminal Code  made
dependent upon the opinion of the courts concerned, it is desirable, as the
Chief Justice appears to me to have recognized, that some principle should be
established according to which such opinion is to be formulated. It appears to
me that the guiding principle to be gathered from the reasons for judgment of
the Chief Justice in the present case is expressed in the following terms:

…I am of opinion that, although it is
impossible to say that the appellant is merely a nuisance, he does not
constitute so grave a

[Page 874]

menace that the protection of the public
requires that he be deprived of his liberty for the remainder of his life,
subject only to the provisions of s. 666  of the Criminal Code  and
the Parole Act.

The requirement that a man must be found to be a
menace before a sentence of preventive detention can be properly imposed upon
him finds its origin in the decision of Lord Goddard in Rex v. Churchill[6], where he said, at page 110:

The object of preventive detention is to
protect the public from men or women who have shown by their previous history
that they are a menace to society while they are at large.

In order to determine the sense in which Lord
Goddard used the word menace, it is necessary to consider the statement he made
in the same case at page 112 where he said:

As we have already said, when such
sentences have to be passed the time for punishment has gone by, because it has
had no effect. It has become a matter of putting a man where he can no
longer prey upon society even though his depredations may be of a
comparatively small character, as in the case of habitual sneak thieves.

The italics are my own.

The test of whether or not a man constitutes a
“menace to society” was first applied in this Court in relation to
s. 660(1) (b) in Poole v. The Queen, supra, where it was said
of the appellant on behalf of the majority of the Court:

…I am not satisfied that his release at the
expiration of the terms of imprisonment to which he has been sentenced for the
substantive offences will, to use the words of Lord Goddard, constitute a
menace to society or that the protection of the public renders it expedient
that he should spend the rest of his life in custody.

If the word “menace” as used in this excerpt
from the reasons for judgment in that case and in the present case were to be
given the meaning attributed to it by Lord Goddard, it would appear to include
anyone who could be said to “prey upon society”; but in the present case the
Chief Justice appears to have added a further ingredient as a prerequisite to
the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention by indicating that before
such a sentence is imposed, the accused man must “constitute so grave a
menace that the protection of the public requires that he

[Page 875]

be deprived of his liberty for the remainder
of his life, subject only to the provisions of
s. 666  of the Criminal Code  and the Parole Act”. (The
italics are my own).

In this regard I think it desirable to examine
the provisions of s. 666  of the Criminal Code  and the Parole Act
in order to determine whether the question of “being deprived of his
liberty for the remainder of his life” is one which necessarily arises at all
as a result of the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention. I think on
the contrary that under the provisions of s. 666  of the Criminal Code  and
the terms of the Parole Act, 1958 (Can.), c. 38, Parliament has
expressly provided for the supervised return to society of habitual criminals
who have been sentenced to preventive detention. Section 666  of the Criminal
Code  reads as follows:

Where a person is in custody under a
sentence of preventive detention, the Minister of Justice shall, at least
once in every year, review the condition, history and circumstances of that
person for the purpose of determining whether he should be permitted to be at
large on licence, and if so, on what conditions.

The italics are my own.

By s. 24(5) of the Parole Act, it is
indicated that the powers, functions and duties of the Minister of Justice
under s. 666  of the Criminal Code  are transferred to the National
Parole Board established by that Act. Turning to the provisions of the Parole
Act itself, the following sections appear to me to be relevant:

8. The Board may

(a) grant parole to an inmate if the
Board considers that the inmate has derived the maximum benefit from
imprisonment and that the reform and rehabilitation of the inmate will be aided
by the grant of parole;

(b) Grant parole subject to any
terms or conditions it considers desirable;…

Section 11 provides:

11. (1) The sentence of a paroled inmate
shall, while the parole remains unrevoked and unforfeited, be deemed to
continue in force until the expiration thereof according to law.

(2) Until a parole is revoked, forfeited
or suspended the inmate is not liable to be imprisoned by reason of his
sentence, and he shall be allowed to go and remain at large according to
the terms and conditions of the parole and subject to the provisions of this
Act.

The italics are my own.

[Page 876]

In the case of Poole v. The Queen, supra, at
p. 392, these provisions are referred to in the reasons for judgment of
the majority of the Court in the following terms:

In Canada if sentence is passed at all it
must decree imprisonment for the remainder of the person’s life subject to the
possibility of his being allowed out on licence if so determined by the parole
authorities, a licence which may be revoked without the intervention of any
judicial tribunal.

It is true that a parole granted by the Parole
Board may be revoked “without the intervention of any judicial tribunal”. What
Parliament has seen fit to do is to establish a Board composed of people who
are experienced in dealing with criminals and to assign to that Board the duty
of reviewing at least once in each year “the condition, history and circumstances”
of every person upon whom a sentence of preventive detention has been
passed, together with the power to allow such persons “to go and remain at
large” under its supervision and subject to its right to recall such persons to
imprisonment.

It is true that a man who is on parole has less
than complete freedom, but in my view the Parole Act is directed to his
“reform and rehabilitation” rather than to depriving him “of his liberty for
the remainder of his life”. It seems to me that in forming its opinion as to
whether or not it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence an
habitual criminal to preventive detention, one of the main questions to be
determined by the Court is whether he is a man whose record indicates that
after “he has derived the maximum benefit from imprisonment” the public will be
best protected, and his own interests best served, by ensuring that his return
to society is made subject to the supervision and control of the Parole Board.

It is my view that in imposing a sentence of
preventive detention the Court must be satisfied that there is a real danger to
the public in the prospect of the accused being allowed at large in society
without supervision after the expiration of his sentence for the substantive
offence with which he is charged.

I do not find any decision so far rendered by
this Court which makes it plain that a sentence of preventive detention is only
to be imposed on persons who have been guilty of repeated crimes of violence,
and I can find nothing in s. 660  itself to indicate that it is directed
solely to the pro-

[Page 877]

tection of the public against violence; it
rather appears to me that the section is to be applied in the cases of persons
who have shown themselves to be so habitually addicted to serious crime as to
constitute a threat to other persons or property in any community in which they
live, and for so long as they remain at large without supervision. The persons
to whom Parliament intended the preventive detention provisions to apply are
specified in s. 660(2) where “habitual criminal” is defined as one who has

… since attaining the age of eighteen
years, on at least three separate and independent occasions been convicted of
an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or
more and is leading persistently a criminal life…

It will be observed that it is not necessary for
a man to have committed any crime of violence in order to be an habitual criminal
and thus to be subject to a sentence of preventive detention. In my view the
section has particular, though not exclusive, application to the hardened
criminal who has spent the greater part of his life in prison and who, on his
release, unless supervised, will commit a further offence. These are the people
for whom, as Lord Goddard observed: “… the time for punishment has gone by,
because it has had no effect”.

As I have indicated, the question of what is
expedient for the protection of the public is a question of fact in each case,
but it is essential that some principles be established against which to assess
the facts. While I do not consider that we are bound in this case by the
decision in Poole v. The Queen, supra, the two cases are undoubtedly similar
and it has been suggested that as this Court has decided that it was not
expedient for the protection of the public to sentence a man with such a
formidable criminal record as Poole to preventive detention, it would be
inconsistent to impose such a sentence on the present appellant.

It therefore appears to me to be desirable to
examine the facts in these two cases.

In the case of Poole, the following factors
appear to have influenced the majority of the Court:

Since his convictions in 1959, the appellant
has been guilty of no violent crime. For the crime of theft of an automobile in
1962 and the four substantive offences in 1965, which involved comparatively
trifling sums, he has been sentenced to severe punishment; there is some
evidence of his trying to live a normal life; he is now 35 years of age.

[Page 878]

In the case of the present appellant, he is 47
years of age and has a record of 47 convictions which, according to my
calculations, has resulted in his spending far the greater part of his adult life
in prison, and I can find no evidence that he was at any time “trying to live a
normal life”. Very soon after his release from prison in 1967, he stole an
automobile in British Columbia and drove it to Ontario, using stolen credit
cards with which to fuel it. Of this incident he says:

A. I couldn’t find no work.

Q. So you decided to steal a car?

A. So I was reading the paper and there was
work in Ontario, so I figured—I didn’t know how to get to tell you the truth
the proper way, I haven’t got too much money, to get there.

Q. So you decided to steal a car?

A. So I decided to get a car and get over
there.

Q. Steal a car?

A. Steal a car.

It was not surprising that the appellant should
follow this course as he had previously been convicted on six separate occasions
for unlawful possession of motor vehicles and his convictions for use of other
people’s credit cards were numerous.

When the appellant got to Hamilton he obtained
employment as a bartender in a hotel which was apparently owned by a woman by
the name of Ann Kostrich with whom he became “quite friendly”. He kept this job
from February 1967 until he was arrested on the 30th of May in that year, and
all the time he was so employed he was driving a stolen motor vehicle and
fueling it with gasoline obtained with a stolen credit card. After his arrest
his lawyer wrote to Ann Kostrich and received a reply which was admitted in
evidence by consent and which read, in part, as follows: (referring to the
appellant as Michael)

Michael was a very good worker, honest and
non-drinker, in fact I went away on two different occasions and left him in
charge looking after the business. Whenever he is released, he always has a job
with me, this I guarantee. If there is anything that I can do to help him, I
will.

The Chief Justice was apparently referring to
this letter when he said, after reviewing the appellant’s criminal record:

His criminal record is indeed a formidable
one but there is evidence that his last employer is willing to reemploy him on
his release. On the whole I am of opinion that… he does not constitute so grave
a menace that the protection of the public requires that he be deprived of his
liberty for the remainder of his life.

[Page 879]

The Chief Justice also points out that the
appellant “must realize that after he is set at liberty at the expiration of
his present sentence and thereafter commits either of the offences of stealing
an automobile or obtaining gasoline by fraudulent means, he will be liable to a
maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment”. It is perhaps worth observing that
if the accused should receive such a ten-year sentence there will be no
obligation upon the Minister of Justice “at least once in every year” to
review his “condition, history and circumstances”.

The disturbing feature of this case and one
which in my opinion differentiates it from the Poole case, is indicated
in the following paragraph of the Chief Justice’s reasons for judgment:

Since 1957, with the exception of one
conviction for theft of money in March 1965, the appellant has been involved in
no criminal activity which has not in some way related to automobiles or
gasoline credit cards.

When one considers that the appellant has been
convicted 28 times since 1957, the record certainly appears to disclose a
pattern of behaviour which is well illustrated by the appellant’s own evidence
in cross-examination when he said:

Q. First question, Mr. Mendick, at any
time during your career from 1937 on, did you ever decide to quit the life of
crime and stop committing offences?

A. Well, I’ve tried many times; I never
made, I never made—I wasn’t thinking of making any, of making a living out of
crime. It seems like I was enjoying taking these cars and pass a few cheques. I
didn’t make no money at all. As a crime, I don’t know what—can’t explain why I
do all this, because I’m working all the—nearly all the time.

In my view, habitual criminals with records such
as the present appellant are proper subjects for the application of s. 660 
of the Criminal Code  and I can find no ground for holding that the
courts below were wrong in forming the opinion which they did.

I would dismiss this appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Habeas
corpus—Certiorari—Sentence of preventive detention—No appeal taken—Whether
certiorari available—Whether warrant of committal defective—Accused claiming
notice not given seven clear days prior to hearing—Exhibit lost—Onus on accused
to prove when notice served—Criminal Code  1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 661,
662(1)(b), 682, 691.

On April 22, 1958, the appellant was found to
be a criminal sexual psychopath and was sentenced to preventive detention. He
signed a waiver of his right of appeal. From 1964 to 1967, he made several
applications to have the preventive detention order set aside. Finally in 1967,
he made the present application for a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari
in aid to quash the warrant of committal. The writ was refused by Wilson
C.J. The main ground upon which the appellant relied was that he had not been
given seven clear days’ notice of the application under s. 661(1)  of the Criminal
Code  and that consequently, the magistrate had been without jurisdiction to
enter upon the hearing.

At the hearing before the magistrate, the
appellant admitted service of a written notice, which was filed as an exhibit,
but no reference was made to the date of the service. That exhibit was lost.
The appellant filed a lengthy affidavit, largely argumentative, in which he
draws the conclusion that the notice could not have been served seven clear
days before the hearing. His affidavit did not state where or when the notice
was served upon him. In their affidavits, the magistrate and the Crown
prosecutor stated that at the hearing it was proved to the magistrate’s
satisfaction that the appellant received a notice of seven clear days. The
affidavit of the constable who served the notice also stated that he believed
he complied with the legal requirements. The Court of Appeal, by a majority
judgment, affirmed the refusal of the application for the writ. The appellant
appealed to this Court and subse-

[Page 110]

quently obtained leave to appeal from the
refusal of the relief sought in the proceedings by way of certiorari.

Held (Cartwright
C.J. and Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
dismissed.

Per Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The circumstances of this case bring
it within the application of s. 682 (b) of the Criminal
Code  which prevents the removal of the magistrate’s order by certiorari.
If it can be said that the words “the merits were tried” in s. 682 (b)
can only be applicable where the Court had jurisdiction, the
section ceases to have any real meaning. The writ of certiorari is
primarily concerned with the matter of jurisdiction of an inferior Court. The
section was intended to apply, and by its terms does apply in a situation
where, in the absence of the section, the jurisdiction of the Court might have
been questioned on certiorari. The intention of the section is to
preclude the coexistence of two remedies. By its terms it applies, in any case
falling within its provisions, to any attempt to remove a conviction or order
by certiorari. This view of the effect of s. 682  does not run
counter to the judgment of this Court in Smith v. R., [1959] S.C.R. 638.

It is unnecessary to express any view as to
whether, in the light of the provisions of s. 691  of the Criminal Code ,
this Court has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a refusal by the
Courts to grant certiorari.

There is no requirement that the warrant of
committal recite that the accused had been given seven clear days’ notice of
the application.

Even if s. 682 (b) were not
to be considered as constituting a bar to proceedings by way of certiorari, the
appeal fails on the merits. In the light of the circumstances in this case, it
was incumbent upon the appellant, when he applied for certiorari on the
ground that he had not received adequate notice, to establish that fact by
clear and positive evidence. He has not discharged that onus.

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ., dissenting: Seven clear days’ notice not
having been given to the appellant as required by s. 662(1)(b)
of the Code, the magistrate was without jurisdiction ab initio and
the warrant of committal must fall. In these proceedings the Court can inquire
whether the requisite notice was given. Section 682(b) of the Code does
not deprive the Courts of jurisdiction to grant certiorari in this case.
The great weight of authority supports the view that s. 682  is not a bar
to the issue of certiorari where the proceedings

[Page 111]

sought to be questioned are invalid ab
initio. Therefore, the Courts below were entitled to examine the record to
determine whether the magistrate was without jurisdiction ab initio and
this Court has the same right and duty.

If the matter were res integra the
same view would prevail. The case did not fall within the literal wording of
s. 682  as s. 661 does not contemplate the making of any plea.
Furthermore, it cannot be said that “merits were tried” when in fact and in law
the magistrate never acquired jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing. If the
requisite notice was not given then the proceedings before the magistrate were
not a trial but a nullity.

The warrant of committal was defective on its
face in that it shows that the order was made by an inferior Court and does not
show that the notice imperatively required by s. 662(1)(b) as
a condition precedent to the magistrate having power to hear the application
was given and that a copy thereof was filed as required. When, as in the case
at bar it is alleged that a condition precedent to the inferior Court acquiring
jurisdiction to enter on the hearing was not fulfilled and the warrant is
silent, s. 61 of the Supreme Court Act provides an expeditious
method of ascertaining whether or not the allegation is well founded.

The finding of the majority in the Court of
Appeal that the requisite notice was in fact given to the appellant seven clear
days before the hearing cannot be sustained. It cannot be said that an onus
rests upon the appellant to establish that which ought to be a matter of
record.

Per Hall J., dissenting:
The view that s. 682 of the Code denies the right to remove the order
requires holding that a person convicted in a proceeding which is in law a
nullity is without recourse by certiorari when that person might have appealed.
The section does not achieve that result. When Parliament said “where the
defendant appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried”, it meant a lawful
trial or hearing and not a proceeding which was in law a nullity. The language
used in s. 682  is quite explicit, but it is no broader or more explicit
than that found in many statutes which contain privative clauses of which the Labour
Relations Act of Ontario is an example. There is no consistency in holding
that s. 682  is an absolute bar to certiorari in a case involving
the liberty of the person when equally explicit enactments deny certiorari in
Labour

[Page 112]

Relations legislation are not so regarded.
Where there is no jurisdiction there cannot be a trial on the merits within the
meaning of s. 682 .

Per Pigeon J.,
dissenting: Proceedings leading to a sentence of preventive detention
constitute a separate issue distinct from the charge following which they are
instituted. Section 682(b) of the Code cannot be applied to a
sentence of preventive detention because the procedure on an application for
such a sentence does not provide for a plea by the accused. The appellant is in
the same situation as in Smith v. The Queen, [1959] S.C.R. 638, he has
not pleaded. The appellant is therefore entitled to certiorari.

The record shows that it was not proved
before the magistrate that seven clear days’ notice was given as required
imperatively by s. 662  of the Criminal Code . Even if the appellant
could validly admit having received the notice, such an admission is not
sufficient in a criminal case. It could not be presumed that the lost exhibit
showed that the required interval of seven clear days had been observed. The
affidavits did not prove that this did appear on the document.

The magistrate proceeded without adequate
proof of a notice served in accordance with the requirements of the law and
this defect deprived him of his jurisdiction. Section 683(1) of the Code
forbids proceeding without notice. This is a condition precedent to
jurisdiction.

APPEAL from a majority judgment of the Court

corpus with certiorari in aid to quash a sentence of preventive detention.

[Page 113]

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—This is an
appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2] pronounced on June 3, 1968, dismissing the
appellant’s appeal from the judgment of Wilson C.J. pronounced on August 7,
1967, dismissing the appellant’s motions for a Writ of Habeas Corpus ad
subjiciendum with certiorari in aid to direct the release of the
appellant from the sentence of preventive detention imposed upon him by
Magistrate John Hunter on April 22, 1958, at Cloverdale in the Province of
British Columbia following a finding that the appellant was a criminal sexual
psychopath. Norris J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal.

Under s. 691(3) of the Criminal Code  as
enacted by Statutes of Canada 1964-65, c. 53, s. 1 , assented to on April
3, 1965, the appellant has an appeal as of right to this Court from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal confirming the refusal of the application for a
Writ of Habeas Corpus. As s. 691 does not expressly provide a right
of appeal to this Court from the refusal of the relief sought in proceedings by
way of certiorari, counsel for the appellant moved for leave to appeal
and on October 7, 1968, this Court made an order granting leave to appeal from
the judgment of the Court of Appeal pronounced on June 3, 1968,

on all questions of law set forth in the Notice
of Motion of the Appellant subject to argument as to the right of the Supreme
Court of Canada to grant such leave.

and granting the necessary extensions of time.

In this Court counsel for the appellant,
pursuant to s. 61 of the Supreme Court Act, served a notice of
motion returnable at the hearing of the appeal for an order that a Writ of certiorari
issue out of this Court to bring up any papers or other proceedings had or
taken in the Courts below that are considered necessary with a view to this
appeal.

The appeal was first argued in this Court on
December 8, 1968, before a Bench of seven and judgment was reserved. At the
conclusion of the argument on that occasion the Court requested

[Page 114]

counsel to make written submissions on the
question, which had been raised by the Court during the argument, whether
clause (b) of s. 682  of the Criminal Code  deprives
the Courts of jurisdiction to grant certiorari in this case and counsel
complied with this request. Later the Court directed a re-hearing. The appeal
was argued on June 2nd before the full Court and judgment was reserved.

While it is perhaps not altogether relevant to
the questions that we are called upon to decide, I propose to set out briefly
the history of the proceedings taken in this matter up to the present time so
far as this can be ascertained from the somewhat fragmentary records produced
in the Courts below and before us.

On March 6, 1958, the appellant pleaded guilty
before Magistrate Hunter to a charge of committing an act of gross indecency
with another male person, contrary to s. 149  of the Criminal Code .

On April 22, 1958, the appellant was found by
Magistrate Hunter to be a criminal sexual psychopath and was sentenced to two
years imprisonment on the charge of gross indecency and in addition was
sentenced to preventive detention.

On May 18, 1958, the appellant signed a waiver
stating that he had elected not to appeal from either the conviction or
sentence.

On February 8, 1964, the appellant gave notice
of an application to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time for
appealing.

On May 7, 1965, the matter came before the Court
of Appeal, composed of Bird C.J.B.C. and Davey and MacLean JJ.A. Counsel for
the Crown was not called upon and the Court delivered an oral judgment refusing
to grant an extention of time and refusing permission to withdraw the waiver of
appeal.

Bird C.J.B.C. concluded his reasons as follows:

…In the circumstances while I am not
disposed to make any direction, I would ask Crown Counsel if he would see to it
that the matter is reported in

[Page 115]

detail to the Attorney-General’s Department
in the hope that a thorough investigation of the allegations now made by the
man can be made.

As my brother Davey puts it, our purpose
is, first of all, to make sure no injustice has been done and while it is not
open to the court to investigate this situation which is alleged by Saunders at
this late date we do feel there might possibly be something in what he has had
to say and in those terms we would like to be sure that the matter is
thoroughly investigated by the law enforcement officers in this Province.

Davey J.A., as he then was, in the course of his
reasons concurred in the suggestion that counsel for the Crown should make an
investigation.

In September 1965, the appellant gave notice of
an application for a Writ of Habeas Corpus with certiorari in
aid.

On November 12 and 19, 1965, this application
was heard by Branca J., as he then was, and on November 23, 1965, that learned
Judge dismissed the application. It appears that the Warden of the Penitentiary
at New Westminster, B.C., where the appellant was confined had returned to the
Court the Warrant of Commitment in virtue of which the appellant was detained.
It reads as follows:

THE PROVINCE OF BRITISH COLUMBIA

WARRANT
OF COMMITTAL UPON CONVICTION
(S.C.A. 2.51; C.C., ss. 482 and 713)


 
  
  CANADA:
  PROVINCE OF
  BRITISH COLUMBIA,
  COUNTY OF WESTMINSTER

  REGINA
  vs. SANDERS.
  
 


To the Peace Officers in the County of
Westminster and to the Keeper of the British Columbia Penitentiary at New
Westminster, B.C.

[Page 116]

Whereas Francis Stewart SANDERS hereinafter
called the “accused”, was this day convicted upon a charge that Francis Stewart
SANDERS between the 1st day of December, A.D. 1957 and the 1st day of March,
A.D. 1958, at or near Newton, B.C., in the Municipality of Surrey being a male
person did unlawfully commit an act of gross indecency with Roy FLACK, another
male person, contrary to the form of Statute in such case made and provided.

Whereas the said Francis Stewart SANDERS
was, pursuant to Section 661  of the Criminal Code  of Canada, found to be a
criminal sexual psychopath, and it was adjudged that the accused for his
offence be imprisoned in the British Columbia Penitentiary at New Westminster
for the term of Two (2) Years, and in addition a sentence of preventative
detention.

You are hereby commanded in Her Majesty’s
name to take the accused and convey him safely to the British Columbia
Penitentiary at New Westminster, B.C. and deliver him to the keeper thereof,
together with the following precept:

You, the said keeper, are hereby commanded
to receive the accused into custody in the said Prison and imprison him there
for the term of Two (2) Years, and in addition a sentence of preventative
detention, and for so doing this is sufficient warrant.

Dated this 22nd day of April, A.D. 1958 at
Clover-dale, B.C.

While the signature on this Warrant is illegible
it would seem to be that of Magistrate Hunter because an affidavit sworn by him
on October 13, 1965, concludes with the following paragraph:

12. That at the conclusion of the evidence
submitted on the hearing on the 22nd of April, 1958, I found that Francis
Stewart Sanders was a criminal

[Page 117]

sexual psychopath, and sentenced the said
Francis Stewart Sanders to a term of imprisonment for two years, and in
addition thereto I imposed a sentence of preventive detention and subsequently
I signed a Warrant of Committal according to my findings and sentences.

In his careful and detailed reasons Branca J.
examined the record of the proceedings before Magistrate Hunter but held that
he could not look at the evidence to determine whether the finding of the
Magistrate was correct. He concluded his reasons as follows:

I am in conclusion deeply regretful that in
this case acting strictly within the supervisory area reserved to this Court in
matters of this kind, that I must find that the Applicant is detained by a
Warrant in all respects regular on its face and upon a charge fully within the
jurisdiction of the convicting Magistrate. The Affidavit of the Applicant does
not allege or disclose any jurisdictional defect.

I hasten to say that if the supervisory
jurisdiction of this Court permitted a review of the evidence in this matter,
that the conviction or finding insofar as it relates to the fact that the
Applicant was a criminal sexual psychopath would be forthwith quashed for the
reasons stated.

I have deliberately reviewed the evidence
and the authorities at length in the hope and anxious expectation that counsel
will bring this matter to the attention of other authorities who may be able at
law to correct the injustice done in this case which this Court unfortunately
in the circumstances and for the reasons stated is unable to do.

The appellant appealed from the decision of
Branca J. The appeal was heard on March 24 and 25, 1966, and judgment was given
at the conclusion of the hearing. Davey J.A., as he then was, based his
judgment solely on s. 682 (b) of the Criminal Code , holding
that an appeal from the sentence of preventive detention might have been taken
by the appellant but was not taken. Lord J.A. agreed. Bull J.A. expressed his
agreement as follows:

I agree that the appeal should be
dismissed, but I do so with some reluctance. I say with reluctance, however,
for the reason that it has appeared to me that there have been several errors
committed in the actual hearing. However, despite that, I consider

[Page 118]

there was full jurisdiction in the
Magistrate to make the finding and sentence that he did. As stated by my
learned brother, the appeal should be dismissed.

It should be noted at this point that neither
Branca J. nor the Court of Appeal said anything about the ground which was
chiefly relied on before us, Le., that it does not appear that the notice
required by s. 662(1) (b) of the Criminal Code , as it
read at the time of the hearing before Magistrate Hunter, had been given to the
appellant seven clear days before the hearing. It will be observed that in the
passage from his reasons quoted above Branca J. said that the affidavit of the
appellant did not allege any jurisdictional defect.

The only references to the notice contained in
the appellant’s affidavit were in paras. 20 and 22 which read as follows:

20. THAT the Crown Prosecutor did not
present in court proof of service of Notice of Application.

* *
*

22. THAT the Crown Prosecutor did not file
a copy of this Notice of Application with the Clerk of the Court or with the
Magistrate.

It will be observed that these do not raise a
question as to the length of notice given. It is clear from reading the whole
of his reasons that Branca J. made no reference to the question whether a
sufficient length of Notice of Application had been given to the appellant.

On March 31, 1966, the appellant filed a Notice
of Motion for leave to appeal and for an extension of time for appealing from
the finding of Magistrate Hunter. This application was heard on May 27, 1966,
by Bird C.J.B.C., Tysoe and McFarlane, JJ.A. and judgment was given on June 7,
1966, refusing it. The reasons of the Court of Appeal, delivered by Bird
C.J.B.C, set out three grounds relied on by the appellant and state that he
relied on no other ground. None of these grounds raises the question of whether
seven clear days notice of the application before Magistrate Hunter had been
given to the appellant.

On May 18, 1967, the appellant gave Notice of an
Application for a Writ of Habeas Corpus

[Page 119]

and certiorari in aid which was heard and
dismissed by Wilson C.J. on August 7, 1967, as set out in the opening paragraph
of these reasons.

The material before us does not contain any
recorded reasons of Wilson C.J. but on August 16, 1967, the learned Chief
Justice made a report to the Court of Appeal, pursuant to s. 588(1)  of the
Criminal Code , reading as follows:

I have little to report on this matter. The
same conviction was dealt with by Mr. Justice Branca on a previous
application for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid and his written reasons,
dismissing the application, were handed down November 23, 1965. I cannot
improve on them. Generally I may say that since the warrant of committal was
not attacked I could see no opening for habeas corpus. So far as certiorari was
involved I thought Section 682  of the Criminal Code  a bar and also thought that
the application must be dismissed for the reasons given by Branca J., as he
then was.

In support of his application before Wilson C.J.
the appellant filed an affidavit containing ninety-six paragraphs. Paragraph 20
reads as follows:

20. That I was not given seven clear days
Notice before trial as required by Law, before the Court has jurisdiction to
hold a hearing to determine if the Accused was a criminal sexual psychopath.

It will be observed that Wilson C.J. does not
deal with the question whether Magistrate Hunter was without jurisdiction
because of the alleged failure to give seven clear days notice of the
application to decide whether the appellant was a criminal sexual psychopath.

The appeal from the decision of Wilson C.J. was
heard by a Court of five Judges. As has already been stated, Norris J.A.,
dissenting, would have allowed the appeal. The judgment of the majority was
written by Tysoe J.A. and concurred in by Bull, McFarlane and Robertson JJ.A.

Before examining the reasons given in the Court
of Appeal it will be convenient to set out

[Page 120]

the terms of s. 691  of the Criminal Code 
as it now reads and read at the date of the application to Wilson C.J.

691. (1) An appeal lies to the court of
appeal from a decision granting or refusing the relief sought in proceedings by
way of mandamus, certiorari or prohibition.

(2) Except as hereinafter in this
section provided, the provisions of Part XVIII apply, mutatis mutandis,
to appeals under this section.

(3) Where an application for a writ of habeas
corpus ad subjiciendum is refused by a judge of a court having jurisdiction
therein, no application may again be made on the same grounds whether to the
same or to another court or judge, unless fresh evidence is adduced, but an
appeal from such refusal shall lie to the Court of Appeal, and where on such
appeal the application is refused a further appeal shall lie to the Supreme
Court of Canada.

(4) Where a writ of habeas corpus ad
subjiciendum is granted by any judge no appeal therefrom shall lie at the
instance of any party including the Attorney General of the province concerned
or the Attorney General of Canada.

(5) Where a judgment is issued on the
return of a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, an appeal therefrom
lies to the Court of Appeal, and from a judgment of the Court of Appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada, with the leave of that court, at the instance of the
applicant or the Attorney General of the province concerned or the Attorney
General of Canada, but not at the instance of any other party.

(6) An appeal in habeas corpus matters
shall be heard by the court to which the appeal is directed at an early date,
whether in or out of the prescribed sessions of the court.

All the members of the Court of Appeal were of
opinion that “fresh evidence” was adduced before Wilson C.J. in that the first
transcript of the proceedings before Magistrate Hunter which had been supplied
to the appellant by the Court Reporter, and which was before Branca J., was
plainly incomplete and the second and much fuller transcript was not made
available to the appellant until after Branca J. had delivered his

[Page 121]

judgment. This finding was clearly right and
consequently the terms of subs. (3) of s. 691  did not prevent the making
of the application to Wilson C.J.

In his reasons, Tysoe J.A. after summarizing the
history of the earlier proceedings, stated the submission of the appellant that
the evidence before Wilson C.J. established that the appellant had not been
given seven clear days notice of the application to Magistrate Hunter for a
finding that he is a criminal sexual psychopath, that consequently the
Magistrate was without jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing, that the
appellant is unlawfully detained and entitled ex debito justitiae to the
remedy of habeas corpus. He next examined the submissions of counsel for
the Crown (i) that the Warrant of Committal is valid on its face, (ii) that in
these proceedings the Court cannot go behind the Warrant and (iii) that the
Magistrate when proceeding under s. 661  of the Criminal Code  is not
an inferior court but a superior one.

Tysoe J.A. did not accept these submissions of
the Crown but does not appear to have finally decided that they were untenable.
He says in part:

If the attack on the jurisdiction of the
Magistrate succeeds, the warrant of committal must fall for, in that event, it
was issued by a person who was without power to issue it and so is invalid.

I am not convinced that this submission of
the Crown that the court cannot go behind the warrant of committal is sound.
Accordingly, I propose to proceed with my judgment on the assumption that the
Magistrate’s Court is an inferior court and that the court below and this court
are entitled to go behind the warrant of committal for the purpose of
determining whether the Magistrate who issued the warrant of committal had
jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing under Code Section 661 and to make the
finding on which the warrant rested.

It is clear that Magistrate Hunter constituted
an inferior and not a superior court. This appears from the Magistrates Act which
was in force at

[Page 122]

the time of the hearing, R.S.B.C. 1948, c. 195, as
amended by Statutes of B.C. 1955, c. 45, now Statutes of B.C. 1962, c. 36,
particularly ss. 3, 4 and 5, and from the Criminal Code  s. 2(10) (b),
s. 2(38) (d) and s. 659 (a).

Immediately following the passage last quoted
above, Tysoe J.A. continued:

Counsel for the Crown conceded, in my
opinion, rightly, that, notwithstanding the provisions of Code Section
682 which are as follows:

682. No conviction or order shall be
removed by certiorari

(a) where an appeal was
taken, whether or not the appeal has been carried to a conclusion, or

(b) where the defendant
appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried and an appeal might have been
taken, but the defendant did not appeal.

certiorari will lie if the learned
Magistrate acted in this matter without jurisdiction to do so in the sense that
he was without power to hear the Crown’s application ab initio if the
appellant had not in fact been given seven clear days’ notice thereof.

This concession at first appears surprising in
view of the fact that the Court of Appeal which heard the appeal from the
judgment of Branca J. had based its judgment solely on the terms of s. 682
and Wilson C.J. had based his judgment in part on that section; but it must be
remembered that the only occasion prior to the hearing of the appeal in the
Court of Appeal from the judgment of Wilson C.J. on which the appellant was
represented by counsel was on the application before Branca J. and, as already
pointed out, there is nothing in the elaborate reasons of that learned Judge to
suggest that the point was raised before him. The hearing of the appeal from
the judgment of Wilson C.J. was the first occasion on which the argument was
put forward that because of the alleged failure to give seven clear days notice
the Magistrate was without jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing.

If it be the fact that seven clear days notice
was not given to the appellant as required by s. 662(1) (b) of
the Criminal Code , then the

[Page 123]

magistrate was without jurisdiction ab initio
and, as was held by every member of the Court of Appeal, the warrant of
committal must fall.

The two questions that arise are (i) whether in
these proceedings the Court can inquire whether the requisite notice was given
and (ii) if so, whether the finding should be that it was given. It was on the
second of these questions that Norris J.A. differed from the majority in the
Court of Appeal.

On the first question, while Tysoe J.A. accepted
the concession of counsel that the right to certiorari was not taken
away by s. 682  of the Criminal Code , he expressed the opinion that
the concession was rightly made and examined a number of decisions in support
of this conclusion. Before us counsel for the Crown contends that clause (b)
of s. 682  does deprive the Courts of jurisdiction to grant certiorari
in this case. In my opinion this submission should be rejected. I do not
propose to refer in detail to the numerous decisions in which s. 682  has
been considered by the courts, which are collected in Martin’s Annual
Criminal Code, 1968, at pp. 635 to 642. The great weight of authority
supports the view, that was so clearly expressed by Hall C.J.Q.B., as he then
was, in Regina v. Phillips[3] and
by Spence J. in Regina v. Heins[4],
that s. 682  is not a bar to the issue of certiorari where the
proceedings sought to be questioned are invalid ab initio.

If the submission of counsel for the Crown on
this branch of the matter were accepted it would mean that the case of Smith
v. The Queen[5] was
wrongly decided. In that case a motion for certiorari to quash a finding
that a boy aged fourteen was a juvenile delinquent was dismissed by Campbell J.
and the dismissal was affirmed by a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Manitoba. In this Court the judgments below were reversed and the finding
of delinquency was quashed. It is true that s. 682  is not referred to in
the reasons in this Court but it was referred to in the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba by Adamson C.J. in his dissenting judgment. The

[Page 124]

decision of that Court is reported sub nom
Regina v. Gerald X (or G.S.)[6]. At
p. 106 the learned Chief Justice said:

For want of jurisdiction in an inferior Court certiorari
is the appropriate remedy. Certiorari is the appropriate remedy to
raise the question of proper service: 13 Can. Abr. 1706; Re Ruggles (1902),
5 Can.C.C. 163, 35 N.S.R. 57; Cr. Code, ss. 682, 683 and 691; Paulowich
v. Dankochuk, 73 Can.C.C. 273, (1940) 2 D.L.R. 106, 48 Man. R. 6.

Coyne J.A. who wrote the reasons of the majority
said at p. 127:

Here the appellant has a right of appeal
under s. 37 but did not seek to exercise it. On such an appeal he could
have raised all points which arise in this proceeding. The finding of
delinquency by the Juvenile Court Judge was made and the fine imposed on
September 23rd. The time for application for leave to appeal expired on October
3rd and the limit of any extension by special leave of time for appeal was
October 23 rd. These proceedings were not instituted until November 23rd.

I do not think it should be assumed that this
Court gave no consideration to the terms of s. 682(b).

In my view the power to grant certiorari in
aid of the Writ of habeas corpus in the case at bar was not taken away
by the terms of s. 682, and the Courts below were entitled to examine the
record to determine whether the Magistrate was without jurisdiction ab
initio.

I have reached this conclusion because it
appears to me to accord with the great weight of judicial opinion; but if the
matter were res integra my view would be the same. Clearly clause (a)
of s. 682 has no application in the circumstances of the case at bar;
no appeal was taken.

The part of s. 682 with which we are
concerned is as follows:

682. No conviction or order shall be
removed by certiorari

* *
*

[Page 125]

(b) where the defendant
appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried, and an appeal might have been
taken, but the defendant did not appeal.

Applying this to the facts of the case at bar,
the finding of the Magistrate that the appellant was a criminal sexual
psychopath (which entailed the mandatory imposition of a sentence of preventive
detention) was not a “conviction” but it may be that it could properly be
regarded as an “order” within the meaning of that word as used in the section.
It is clear that the appellant appeared before the Magistrate and that an appeal
might have been taken from the Magistrate’s decision but it is equally clear
that no plea was taken; the provisions of s. 661  of the Criminal Code  did
not contemplate the making of any plea by the person as to whom the inquiry
whether he was a dangerous sexual psychopath was to be held. It follows that
this case does not fall within the literal wording of s. 682 .

But the matter does not rest there. How can it
be said that “the merits were tried” if in fact and in law the Magistrate who
purported to conduct the “trial” never acquired jurisdiction to enter upon the
hearing of the application? If the requisite notice was not given then the
proceedings before the Magistrate were not a trial but a nullity. On this point
there was no difference of opinion in the Court of Appeal. It is clear that
Tysoe J.A., who wrote for the majority, would have allowed the appeal if he had
not found that the required notice was in fact given.

The wording of s. 662(1) (b) of
the Criminal Code , as it read at the time of the hearing before
Magistrate Hunter, is explicit. It is as follows:

(b) an application under
subsection (1)  of section 661  shall not be heard unless seven clear
days’ notice thereof has been given to the accused by the prosecutor and a copy
of the notice has been filed with the clerk of the court or with the
magistrate, where the magistrate is acting under Part XVI.

The giving of the notice and the filing of a
copy are clearly made conditions precedent to the right of the Magistrate to
hear the application.

[Page 126]

The writ of certiorari is a very old high
prerogative writ. Its purpose is to enable the Court which corresponds to the
Court of Queen’s Bench in England (in this case the Supreme Court of British
Columbia) to control the action of inferior courts and to make it certain that
they shall not exceed their jurisdiction. It is clear that in the case at bar
it would be an appropriate remedy available to the appellant unless the right
to it is taken away by the terms of s. 682. The power of Parliament to
take away this remedy is not open to question; but, in my opinion, it would
require clear and explicit words to bring about such a result. I have already
stated my reasons for holding that the facts of the case at bar do not bring it
within the terms of s. 682, even if, contrary as I venture to think to the
great weight of authority, it should be held that that section is ever
effective to take away the right to certiorari in cases where it is
alleged that the inferior court acted without jurisdiction ab initio.

In seeking to ascertain the intention of
Parliament it is permissible to consider the results which flow from two
alternative constructions of the words of a statute. If it be the fact (a
question which remains to be decided) that the notice required by s. 662(1) (b)
was not given to the appellant and it is held that s. 682 has taken away
the right to certiorari, then the appellant, who was without counsel,
having waived his right of appeal and having let the time for appealing go by
is left without any remedy although he is under sentence of imprisonment for
the remainder of his life imposed by a magistrate who was without jurisdiction
to make the finding that the appellant was a criminal sexual psychopath or to
impose the sentence that followed such finding. I cannot think that Parliament
intended such a result. When I say the appellant is left without remedy, I have
not overlooked the fact that the Court of Appeal for British Columbia had, and
I suppose still has, power to extend the time for appealing to that Court; but
the appellant cannot claim such an extension as a right, he can but seek it as
an indulgence. He has sought it twice without success. On the second of these
occasions the Court of Appeal, no doubt, had knowledge of what Branca J. had
said in those paragraphs of his judgment which I have quoted

[Page 127]

earlier in these reasons. On the other hand if
it appears that the Magistrate acted without jurisdiction the order of certiorari
would issue ex debito justitiae. In my opinion, if Parliament had
intended to take away the right to certiorari in a case where an
inferior court has acted without jurisdiction it would have added to the
opening words of s. 682 some such words as “even from an inferior court
which has acted without any jurisdiction whatever”. There is no need to dilate
upon the unlikelihood of Parliament having any such intention.

For all these reasons I am satisfied that in the
case at bar the right to certiorari has not been taken away.

Having reached this conclusion, it would seem to
become unnecessary for me to examine Mr. Kennedy’s alternative argument
that the Warrant of Committal returned to the Supreme Court of British
Columbia, which has been set out in full above, was defective on its face in
that it shows that the order under which the appellant is detained was made by
an inferior court and does not show that the notice imperatively required by
s. 662(1) (b) of the Criminal Code  as a condition
precedent to the magistrate having power to hear the application was given to
the appellant and that a copy thereof was filed as required. However, as other
members of the Court have examined and rejected this argument I think I should
express my opinion upon it.

In approaching this argument is must be
remembered that the appellant’s application is not for certiorari
simpliciter but for a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in
aid. Section 691(3) of the Code expressly gives a right of appeal to
this Court from the refusal by the Court of Appeal of an application for a writ
of habeas corpus ab subjiciendum and section 61 of the Supreme
Court Act gives this Court power to issue a writ of certiorari to
bring up any papers or other proceedings had or taken before any court, judge
or justice of the peace, that are considered necessary with a view to any
inquiry, appeal or other proceeding to be had before this Court. It has already
been pointed out that Mr. Kennedy applied for a writ of certiorari under
s. 61.

[Page 128]

Section 691(3) of the Code and s. 61
of the Supreme Court Act must be read together. If there is a conflict
between their provisions and those of section 682 of the Code then
the former must prevail; generalia specialibus non derogant.

I have reached the conclusion that the warrant
of committal is defective on the ground argued by Mr. Kennedy which is
recited above. It has already been pointed out that Magistrate Hunter
constituted an inferior court and the rule has long been established which is
stated in the following words in Broom’s Legal Maxims, 10th ed. at page
101:

Lastly, it has been said that ‘there is a
distinction between process of superior and inferior Courts; in the former, omnia
praesumuntur rite esse acta, in the latter the rule de non apparentibus
et non existentibus eadem est ratio applies.’ The Superior Court need not,
but the inferior Court must, show jurisdiction on the face of an order.

and at page 646:

It is, however, important to observe in
addition to the above general remark, that, in inferior courts and proceedings
by magistrates, the maxim, omnia praesumuntur rite esse acta, does not
apply to give jurisdiction.

The italics are those of the author. These
statements of the rule are fully supported by the judgment of the House of
Lords, adopting the unanimous opinion of the judges, in Mayor and Aldermen
of the City of London v. Richard Henry Cox et al[7], particularly at pages 262 and 263.

To hold that the warrant must affirmatively show
that the required notice was given and a copy thereof filed will not permit the
release of a person detained where the notice was in fact given and filed. In
such a case an amended warrant could be filed and the provisions of s. 683
of the Code could be applied.

When, as in the case at bar, it is alleged that
a condition precedent to the inferior court ac-

[Page 129]

quiring jurisdiction to enter on the hearing was
not fulfilled and the warrant is silent, s. 61 of the Supreme Court Act
provides an expeditious method of ascertaining whether or not the
allegation is well founded.

The applicable rule is accurately stated in Broom’s
Legal Maxims, supra, at page 647, as follows:

But although it is necessary that the
jurisdiction of the inferior court should appear, yet there is no particular
form in which it should be made to appear. The Court above, which may control
the inferior court, must be enabled, somehow or other, to see that there is
jurisdiction such as will support the proceeding; but in what way it shall so
see it is not material, provided it does so see it. The rule, therefore, may be
stated to be, that where it appears upon the face of the proceedings that the
inferior court has jurisdiction, it will be intended that the proceedings are
regular; but that, unless it so appears—that is, if it appear affirmatively
that the inferior court has no jurisdiction, or, if it be left in doubt,
whether it has jurisdiction or not—no such intendment will be made. ‘The old
rule for jurisdiction is, that nothing shall be intended to be out of the
jurisdiction of the superior court but that which specially appears to
be so; nothing is intended to be within the jurisdiction of an inferior court
but that which is expressly alleged’. And again, ‘in all proceedings in
inferior courts it is necessary to show that the proceedings were within the
jurisdiction of the Court’.

While, in my view, it is not strictly necessary
as I think the proceedings below are already properly before us, I would direct
the issue of a writ of certiorari pursuant to s. 61 of the Supreme
Court Act to bring them here.

The result of all that I have said above is
that, in my opinion, the Courts below had the right and the duty to examine the
record of the proceedings before the Magistrate and the affidavits filed before
Wilson C.J. for the purpose of ascertaining whether notice was given and a copy
thereof filed as required by s. 662(1) (b), that is to say
for the purpose of ascertaining whether the Magistrate had jurisdiction to
enter upon the inquiry, and this Court has the same right and duty.

[Page 130]

The next question is whether the finding of the
majority in the Court of Appeal, that the requisite notice was in fact given to
the appellant seven clear days before the hearing, can be sustained. After a
consideration of all the material in the record I have reached the conclusion
that it cannot.

With respect I am unable to agree with the view
which Tysoe J.A. expressed as follows:

It is my opinion that in the circumstances
of this case the onus is on the appellant to establish that he did not receive
the seven clear days’ notice called for by Code Section 662(1)(b)
and the onus is a heavy one. It seems abundantly clear that when the
appellant acknowledged formally before the Magistrate that he had been served
with notice as shown in the foregoing extract of the proceedings, he must have
intended the Magistrate to believe that he was not questioning the adequacy of
the notice given to him of the hearing of the application. This circumstance,
it seems to me, adds to the onus upon the appellant to show conclusively, if he
can, that be had not in fact been given the notice which he was entitled to be
given under the Code Section.

The course of the proceedings would seem to
indicate that it was not until the hearing before the Court of Appeal that the
appellant realized that he was entitled to seven clear days’ notice. He does
not question the receipt of a notice. His whole case is that he did not receive
it seven clear days before the hearing. There is no presumption that he knew of
this when he acknowledged before the Magistrate that he had received notice. I
agree with what was said by Lord Atkin in Evans v. Bartlam[8]:

…For my part I am not prepared to accept
the view that there is in law any presumption that any one, even a judge, knows
all the rules and orders of the Supreme Court. The fact is that there is not
and never has been a presumption that every one knows the law. There is the
rule that ignorance of the law does not excuse, a maxim of very different scope
and application.

Had the proceedings before Magistrate Hunter
been properly conducted and recorded the record returned to the Supreme Court
of British Columbia would have contained a copy of the notice

[Page 131]

given to the appellant and evidence, by way of
affidavit of service or oral sworn testimony, showing the date on which it was
served. It contains none of these. How can it be said that an onus rests upon
the appellant to establish that which ought to be a matter of record?

As was pointed out by Norris J.A., the
appellant’s lengthy affidavit is largely argumentative; but there seems to be
no escape from the conclusion which he seeks to draw that, if the affidavit of
the constable who served the notice upon the appellant is correct in saying
that the service was made at the Court House at Clover-dale, the notice could
not have been served seven clear days before the hearing.

On this branch of the matter I am in substantial
agreement with the reasons of Norris J.A. and will not repeat what he has said.

Before parting with this appeal, I wish to make
one further observation. It is unquestionable that proceedings under s. 660 
or s. 661  of the Criminal Code , in which the liberty of the accused
for the remainder of his life is at stake, are strictissimi juris. At
the trial of an indictable offence by the terms of s. 562 of the Code, and
at the trial of an offence punishable on summary conviction by the terms of
s. 708(5) , an accused or his counsel may admit any fact alleged against
him for the purpose of dispensing with proof thereof. Where there is no plea of
guilty, an accused cannot effectively admit matters of mixed fact and law. In
my opinion, it is an undesirable practice for Crown counsel to refrain from
making strict proof of the giving of the notice required by the terms of
s. 662(1)  and to seek to rely on a loosely worded oral admission made by
an accused who is not represented by counsel.

Since writing the above I have had the advantage
of reading the reasons of my brother Pigeon and wish to express my complete
agreement with them.

For the reasons given by my brother Pigeon and
for those set out above, I would allow the appeal, set aside the Orders of the
Court of Appeal and of Wilson C.J., and direct that judgment be entered (i)
quashing the finding of the Magistrate that the appellant is a criminal sexual

[Page 132]

psychopath, (ii) quashing the sentence of
preventive detention, (iii) quashing the Warrant of Committal and (iv) ordering
that the appellant be discharged from custody.

I would make an order pursuant to s. 689  of
the Criminal Code  protecting the Magistrate and any officer who acted
under the Order or Warrant from any civil proceedings.

The judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland,
Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—The appellant, on March 6, 1958,
appeared before Magistrate Hunter, at Cloverdale, British Columbia, and pleaded
guilty to a charge of committing an act of gross indecency, contrary to
s. 149  of the Criminal Code , and was convicted of that offence. His
criminal record contained two prior convictions for the same type of offence,
and was admitted by the appellant to be correct.

He was not sentenced at that time, but the
hearing was adjourned to a subsequent date. He appeared before the magistrate
on March 28, 1958. On that occasion it appears that he was notified by the
prosecutor of the intention of the latter to apply to hear evidence as to
whether the appellant was a criminal sexual psychopath, because the appellant
was asked to appoint one of the two psychiatrists whose evidence is required
under s. 661(2) of the Code. The appellant says that he asked that his
personal physician should suggest a psychiatrist.

The hearing was adjourned to April 15, and, on
that date, again adjourned to April 22. It was on that date that the evidence
was heard by the magistrate. The magistrate imposed a sentence of two years in
respect of the offence charged, as to which the plea of guilty had been
entered, and also imposed a sentence of preventive detention.

The appellant did not appeal, within the time
limited for appeal. In February 1964, he applied for an extension of time
within which to appeal. The application was heard on May 7, 1965, by the Court
of Appeal, and was dismissed.

[Page 133]

In September, 1965, the appellant applied for a
writ of habeas corpus, with certiorari in aid. One of the grounds stated was:

THAT the court had no jurisdiction to hear
an application under section 661(1) (b), when the hearing
followed immediately after conviction, the procedure laid down that the
application be raised AFTER conviction and seven clear days notice, were not
complied with.

The appellant’s affidavit in support of that
application contained no statement as to where or when he was served with the
notice, nor did it contain any other material in support of the above
submission.

The appellant was represented by counsel on this
application, which was dismissed. The appeal from this decision was dismissed.
Counsel appeared on the appeal as “amicus curiae” as well as counsel for the
Crown.

On March 31, 1966, the appellant applied a
second time for an extension of time within which to appeal from the finding
that he was a criminal sexual psychopath and the sentence of preventive
detention. This application was heard on May 26 and was dismissed on June 7.
Written reasons were delivered by the Chief Justice, on behalf of the Court,
and I quote from those reasons:

In view of the submissions made by Sanders
to this Court on his Motion for extension of Time made in 1965, the Court
directed Crown counsel to inform the Attorney-General of the allegations which
had been made by Sanders before this Court regarding prejudicial conduct of the
proceedings before the Cloverdale Magistrate, with a view to a thorough
investigation of all the circumstances surrounding the proceedings taken before
Magistrate Hunter. Crown counsel has informed the Court during argument that
such an investigation was made by an officer of the Department of the
Attorney-General who reported thereon repudiating the allegations made by
Sanders.

Branca J. in his reasons for judgment in
the Habeas Corpus proceedings before mentioned, criticized adversely the
conduct of the proceedings before Magistrate Hunter, presumably based upon
allegations of the same nature as were made by Sanders in his first motion for
leave to appeal, but

[Page 134]

considered that there was not sufficient
proof of prejudicial conduct of the proceedings before the trial tribunal to
justify a finding that the Magistrate acted without jurisdiction.

On the opening of the current Motions before
this Court Sanders appeared in person, stated that he wished to appear on his
own behalf and did not desire legal aid counsel. He relied on the following
grounds:

1. That the Court is entitled to consider
the merits of his case before determining whether or not to grant an extension
of time to move for leave to appeal.

2. The merits warrant an extension of time
since it now appears from a further transcript of the proceedings before the
learned Magistrate on April 22, 1958 that the transcript presented to this
court on the first motion was not complete.

3. The waiver of appeal signed by the
Appellant on 18th May 1958 does not stand in the way of the granting of an
extension of time to move for leave to appeal.

He relied on no other ground.

* * *

I am satisfied from examination of the
transcript now produced by Sanders and particularly from the comments
attributed to him at the conclusion of the proceedings on April 22, that he
suffered no prejudice from the manner in which those proceedings were
conducted. His concluding comment, in my judgment, affords the fullest support
for the conclusion that he did not then consider he had suffered prejudice.

In view of Sanders’ allegation of prejudice the
Court has seen fit on this Motion for Extension of time to examine the record
of the proceedings before the Magistrate with care. In my judgment no grounds
have been shown to warrant the granting of an extension of time to permit the
appellant to prosecute an appeal from the finding that he is a criminal sexual
psychopath, or from the sentence imposed by the learned Magistrate.

The application was dismissed.

It was on the hearing of this application that
the appellant, for the first time, produced a notice, dated March 31, 1958,
addressed to him, of the intention to apply, on April 15, 1958, at Cloverdale,
British Columbia, for a hearing to

[Page 135]

determine whether or not he was a criminal
sexual psychopath. It bore the name of A.K. Thompson, Crown Prosecutor.

The application which gave rise to the present
proceedings was a second application for a writ of habeas corpus, with certiorari
in aid, made on May 18, 1967. The application was dismissed, and an appeal
from that dismissal was heard by a court of five and was dismissed, Norris J.A.
dissenting.

Tysoe J.A., who delivered the reasons of the
majority, says:

The situation in the case before this Court
is somewhat unique. Some of the records of the Magistrate’s court cannot be
found. All the material that was available in the court below and in this court
is the warrant of committal, two transcripts of the proceedings before the
Magistrate on April 22, 1958, the notice of application served upon the
appellant, and the affidavits hereinafter mentioned.

The first transcript was supplied to the
appellant by the Court Reporter and it is plainly incomplete. The second
transcript was procured by the Crown and was prepared by the Court Reporter
after Branca, J. had delivered his judgment. It is much fuller than the first
and is certified to be “a true report of the evidence and proceedings as
transcribed from my shorthand notes taken on April 22nd, 1958.” Insofar as service
of notice of the application to Magistrate Hunter for a finding under Code Section
661 is concerned, the second transcript contains the following:

CROWN: Your Worship, you will recall in
this matter, the previous hearing, I made application under Section 661(1)  of
the Criminal Code  and Notice has been served upon the accused and the Accused
is prepared to admit it, to avoid the necessity of proof.

MAGISTRATE: Now, Mr. Saunders, you
have been served with a copy of this Notice?

MR. SAUNDERS: Right.

MAGISTRATE: And this is your signature on
the bottom, admitting it?

MR. SAUNDERS: Yes.

MAGISTRATE: That is a copy of what I have
here now?

MR. SAUNDERS: Yes, that is correct.

[Page 136]

EXHIBIT
1.

NOTICE.

The Notice of Application which became Exhibit 1
is not available, but the appellant has produced what he says was the Notice
served upon him.

Three of the affidavits, which are referred to
in this passage, had been filed by the Crown in relation to the first
application for habeas corpus to meet the allegation of insufficiency of
notice.

The affidavit of Magistrate Hunter stated:

7. That on the 28th day of March, 1958, at
Cloverdale in the Province of British Columbia, in the presence of Francis
Stewart Sanders and Crown Counsel Mr. A. Kenneth Thompson, evidence
was tendered to me that satisfied me that Francis Stewart Sanders had received
seven clear days’ notice in writing of an application under Section 661  of the
Criminal Code  of Canada as it then was, to have the said Francis Stewart
Sanders declared to be a criminal sexual psychopath and to have him sentenced
to preventive detention.

The affidavit of the Crown Prosecutor,
Mr. Thompson, stated:

7. That I recall that Notice was given to
Francis Stewart Sanders of our intention to proceed against him as a criminal
sexual psychopath and I recall proving in Court to the satisfaction of the
Magistrate that the proper Notice had been given, but I am not now able to say
on what date the Notice was served upon Francis Stewart Sanders.

The affidavit of Corporal Dempsey of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police stated as follows:

4. That before the hearing to have Francis
Stewart Sanders declared a criminal sexual psychopath commenced, I personally
served on Francis Stewart Sanders a copy of the Notice of Application to have him
declared to be a sexual psychopath.

5. That the aforesaid service took place at
the Court House at Cloverdale, in the Municipality of Surrey in the Province of
British Columbia.

6. That I verily believe that the said
Notice was served by me on the said Francis Stewart Sanders at least seven
clear days before the commencement

[Page 137]

of the hearing, because this was the first
application of this nature in which I had been involved, and I clearly recall
reading the provisions of the then Criminal Code  of Canada, namely Sections 661 
and 662 , before attending to the service on Francis Stewart Sanders.

The appellant filed an affidavit, which, for the
first time, referred to the notice of application dated March 31, 1958, which
he admitted having received. This affidavit did not state where or when it was
served upon him, or, in the alternative, that he did not remember either of
those matters. Instead, the affidavit says:

18. That I was not given any verbal or
written Notice prior to my Election and plea on March 6th, 1958, that a further
charge would be laid, regarding being a criminal sexual psychopath.

19. That I was not given any verbal or
written Notice of Application at any time before the Raising of the Application
in Court on March 28th, 1958.

20. That I was not given seven clear days
Notice before trial as required by Law, before the Court has jurisdiction to
hold a hearing to determine if the Accused was a criminal sexual psychopath.

On the issue of adequacy of notice, the
affidavit is in the form of an argument to this effect:

1. No notice was received prior to March 28,
1958.

2. The notice is dated March 31, 1958.

3. Corporal Dempsey says that he effected
service at the Court House at Cloverdale.

4. The appellant was only at that Court House
after March 28, on April 15 and 22.

5. If it was served on either of those two
dates, in April, the appellant did not have seven clear days’ notice of the
hearing on April 22.

The relevant sections of the Criminal
Code , as they were at the time of the hearing, are the following:

661. (1) Where an accused is convicted of

(a) an offence under

(i) section 136,

(ii) section 138,

[Page 138]

(iii) section 141,

(iv) section 147,

(v) section 148, or

(vi) section 149 ; or

(b) an attempt to commit an
offence under a provision mentioned in paragraph (a),

the court may, upon application, before
passing sentence hear evidence as to whether the accused is a criminal sexual
psychopath.

(2) On the hearing of an application under
subsection (1) the court may hear any evidence that it considers
necessary, but shall hear the evidence of at least two psychiatrists, one of
whom shall be nominated by the Attorney General.

(3) Where the court finds that the accused
is a criminal sexual psychopath it shall, notwithstanding anything in this Act
or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, sentence the accused to a term of
imprisonment of not less than two years in respect of the offence of which he
was convicted and, in addition, impose a sentence of preventive detention.

662. (1) The following provisions apply
with respect to applications under this Part, namely,

* *
*

(b) an application under
subsection (1)  of section 661  shall not be heard unless seven clear
days’ notice thereof has been given to the accused by the prosecutor and a copy
of the notice has been filed with the clerk of the court or with the
magistrate, where the magistrate is acting under Part XVI.

(2) An application under this Part shall be
heard and determined before sentence is passed for the offence of which the
accused is convicted and shall be heard by the court without a jury.

The scheme of these provisions is that, upon a
person being convicted of one of the named offences, the court which convicted
that person is empowered, before imposing sentence, to hear further evidence as
to whether the person convicted is a criminal sexual psychopath. If he is found
to be such, the court must impose a sentence of not less than two years in
respect of the offence charged, and, in addition, a sentence of preventive
detention. The hearing of the further evidence is not a new proceeding. It is a
continuation of the proceedings which led to

[Page 139]

the conviction, and such hearing is for the
purpose of determining the sentence to be imposed.

The present application for habeas corpus, with
certiorari in aid, was dismissed by Wilson C.J. His reasons are set out in his
report to the Court of Appeal, as follows:

I have little to report on this matter. The
same conviction was dealt with by Mr. Justice Branca on a previous
application for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid and his written reasons,
dismissing the application, were handed down November 23, 1965. I cannot
improve on them. Generally I may say that since the warrant of committal was
not attacked I could see no opening for habeas corpus. So far as certiorari was
involved I thought Section 682  of the Criminal Code  a bar and also thought that
the application must be dismissed for the reasons given by Branca J., as he
then was.

Section 682  provides as follows:

682. No conviction or order shall be
removed by certiorari

(a) where an appeal was
taken, whether or not the appeal has been carried to a conclusion, or

(b) where the defendant
appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried, and an appeal might have been
taken, but the defendant did not appeal.

In the Court of Appeal, counsel for the Crown
conceded that certiorari would lie if the magistrate acted in the matter
without jurisdiction, in the sense that he was without power to hear the
Crown’s application ab initio, if the appellant had not in fact been given
seven days’ notice.

On the first argument before this Court on
December 5, 1968, counsel were requested to file written submissions respecting
the application of s. 682  and these were filed. The appeal was
subsequently reargued before the full Court on June 2, 1969.

In my opinion s. 682  does prevent the
removal of the magistrate’s order by certiorari, for these reasons:

1. The sentence of preventive detention was an
order.

[Page 140]

2. The appellant had appeared before the magistrate.
He pleaded guilty to the charge under s. 149 . Upon his conviction for that
offence, the court which had convicted him was empowered and required, upon
application, to hear the additional evidence as to whether or not the appellant
was a criminal sexual psychopath, and to impose sentence accordingly. No
further plea in relation to this inquiry was necessary.

3. He appeared on the hearing of the further
evidence as to whether he was a criminal sexual psychopath and that issue was
determined on the merits.

4. He could have appealed, under s. 667(1),
against the sentence of preventive detention, but he failed to do so within the
time limited.

In my opinion these circumstances bring this
case within the application of s, 682(b) of the Code.

It is, however, contended by the appellant that
it cannot be said that “the merits were tried”, as required by s. 682 (b),
if the appellant did not receive the seven days’ clear notice provided for in
s. 662(1)(b) because, in that event, the court would lack
jurisdiction to hear the matter, and so there would be no trial at all.

If it can be said that those words can only be
applicable in a case where the court had jurisdiction, s. 682 (b)
ceases to have any real meaning. The writ of certiorari is primarily concerned
with the matter of jurisdiction of an inferior court. In R. v. Nat Bell
Liquors, Limited[9], Lord
Sumner, at the foot of page 154, describes the object of a writ of certiorari
as follows: “The object is to examine the proceedings in the inferior Court to
see whether its order has been made within its jurisdiction.”

If the object of certiorari is to see whether an
order has been made within the jurisdiction of an inferior court, and if
certiorari is still available, notwithstanding s. 682 (b), in any
case in which the court lacked jurisdiction, then it would appear that the
provision accomplishes very little. If the court had jurisdiction, certiorari
would not lie,

[Page 141]

altogether apart from s. 682 . If the court
lacked jurisdiction, then, if this submission is correct, certiorari is
available despite s. 682 .

In my opinion the section was intended to
apply, and by its terms does apply in a situation where, in the absence of the
section, the jurisdiction of the court might have been questioned on
certiorari. If the accused has appeared before the inferior court, and has
entered a plea, and if, thereafter, the court has proceeded to try the issue
raised by that plea upon the merits, then the accused, if he wishes to attempt
to set aside the court’s decision, must, if he is given by law a right to
appeal, seek his redress by way of appeal only. The intention of this
section was to preclude the co-existence of two remedies in those cases to
which it applies, and to compel resort to appeal procedures where they are available.

I am not overlooking the fact that certiorari is
also a remedy in a case where there is a failure to observe the law in the
exercise of jurisdiction as well as in a case where there has been an excess of
jurisdiction. Lord Sumner, in the Nat Bell case, supra, referring
to the supervision of a superior court over an inferior tribunal, said, at
p. 156:

That supervision goes to two points: one is
the area of inferior jurisdiction and the qualifications and conditions of its
exercise; the other is the observance of the law in the course of its exercise.

There is, however, nothing in the wording of
s. 682  which purports to limit its application only to cases in which the
proceedings before the inferior court are being attacked on the basis of
failure to observe the law in the exercise of jurisdiction, e.g., error of law
on the face of the record. By its terms it applies, in any case falling within
its provisions, to any attempt to remove a conviction or order by certiorari.

Notwithstanding what appear to me to be the
clear terms of s. 682 , there have been decisions, in provincial courts,
holding that the section does not constitute a bar to certiorari in what
are sometimes referred to as “exceptional cases.”

[Page 142]

In Re Thibault[10], Aikins J. said this:

Sec. 682  is couched in language of the
utmost clarity and if the intention of parliament in enacting this
section was to wholly take away the power of a superior court to grant certiorari
in those cases which fall within sec. 682 , it is difficult to see how
more apt or cogent language could have been selected.

However, in view of the position taken by
crown counsel that, notwithstanding the provisions of sec. 682 , in
exceptional circumstances certiorari will still lie, and bearing in mind
the general principle that where an inferior court exceeds its jurisdiction,
even an express provision against certiorari is ineffective to deprive a
superior court of this jurisdiction: See In re Trade Union Act. 1944; Bruton
v. Regina City Policemen’s Assn., Local No. 155 (1945) 2 WWR 273 (Sask.
C.A.); Re Toronto Newspaper Guild and Globe Printing Co. (1953) 2 SCR
18, 106 CCC 225, affirming (1952) OR 345, 102 CCC 318; and Re Dauphin (Town)
and Director of Public Welfare and Close (1955-56) 17 WWR 628, 63
Man R 532, 23 CR 222, affirmed (1956) 19 WWR 97, 24 CR 238. I proceed on the
assumption that in exceptional circumstances the remedy of certiorari is
still available in respect of a conviction, notwithstanding the provisions of
sec. 682 .

In R. v. Phillips[11], Hall C.J.Q.B., as he then was,
held that certiorari would lie in a case where the information was bad in law,
for duplicity, on the basis that the proceedings were invalid ab initio.

In Re Krakat[12], Hughes J. held that the
circumstances of the case were “so exceptional” that the writ could be issued
“ex debito justitiae.” The matter of complaint in that case was the conduct of
the trial by the magistrate.

In R. v. White[13], Riley J. said at p. 357:

I am of the opinion that the jurisdiction
of the superior court, bearing in mind the doctrines of

[Page 143]

“exceptional circumstances,” and “denial of
natural justice” and “complete absence of jurisdiction,” is not ousted by the
above statutory provision, and it would require a much more strenuously framed
section so to do.

These are examples of cases where certiorari has
issued despite the provisions of s. 682 . The “exceptional cases” where
this has been done include those in which it was said that there was absence of
jurisdiction or a denial of natural justice. With respect to the views therein
expressed, it does appear to me, as has been stated earlier in these reasons,
that these are the very cases in which certiorari is the normal remedy. In
saying that although Parliament has decreed in the broadest terms that this
remedy shall not be available if the accused has pleaded, the merits tried, and
a right of appeal exists, the court may still permit the issue of the writ,
these decisions seem to me to constitute a refusal by the courts to apply the
section in a case which the court regards as “exceptional.”

The cases so far cited are trial decisions. I
now turn to consider those cases in which the matter has been considered by a
court of appeal. I am considering only cases which were decided after 1955,
because the provisions of s. 682 (b) are substantially different
from the former s. 1129 of the earlier Code.

We were referred to two cases in the
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, R. ex. rel. Lotochinski v. Antonenko[14] and Re Wilfong[15]. In both cases certiorari was
refused. In the former case Gordon J.A. cites with approval a statement by
McKay J. in R. ex rel Sanderson v. Eremko[16] that: “Where there is a right of
appeal from a summary conviction, a certiorari should not be granted except
under special circumstances.” The case cited was determined long before
s. 682 (b) was enacted, and there is no discussion of that provision
in the Antonenko case.

[Page 144]

In the latter case s. 682  is not discussed.
Reference was made to the decision of this Court in Smith v. R.[17] as follows, at p. 614:

With all respect, I do not think the
principle adopted in Reg. v. Gerald X. (or G.S.), supra, is applicable
to this case. The Supreme Court held in that case that where the court had
acted without jurisdiction, or in excess of jurisdiction, the order, though discretionary,
would be granted ex debito justitiae. In my view there is a great
difference between the case where the court so acts, and the case where the
court, acting within its jurisdiction, makes an order which may be bad in law: Vide
Rex v. Stafford JJ. (1940) 2 KB 33, 109 LJKB 584; and Reg. v.
Campbell (1956) 1 WLR 622, (1956) 2 All ER 280. In the former case the
right to proceed by way of certiorari is granted ex debito justitiae,
but in the latter, this is not necessarily so.

I will be discussing the effect of the Smith case
later in these reasons.

The Court of Appeal of British Columbia, in R.
v. Fawcus[18], refused
certiorari and did not have to decide whether s. 682  would have been a
bar. Maclean J.A., giving the judgment of the Court, said, at p. 98:

Having reached this conclusion it is not
necessary for me to decide whether s. 682 (b) is a bar to certiorari
in this case. It was argued by respondent’s counsel that in “special
circumstances” the section would not apply. All I can say is that I doubt whether
there could be any “special circumstances” short of a complete lack of
jurisdiction ab initio which would prevent the full application of
s. 682 (b) in a case where the applicant had an unrestricted right
of appeal by way of trial de novo.

In Manitoba, in Dauphin (Town) v. Director of
Public Welfare[19], Schultz
J.A., delivering the judgment of the Court, said, at p. 101, in referring
to the reasons of DuVal J., the trial judge:

DuVal, J. comes to a conclusion he expresses in
these words:

“The writ of certiorari, at common
law, is a prerogative writ to which, notwithstanding any

[Page 145]

statutory provisions to the contrary,
recourse may be had in order to control the action of inferior jurisdictions
and bring them back within the limits assigned by law, whenever there has been
a failure, an absence, or an excess of jurisdiction.”

This statement, in effect, says that where an
inferior court exceeds its jurisdiction nothing Parliament says to the contrary
is effective in restricting the power of the superior court to grant certiorari.
The literal interpretation of sec. 682 (a) seems to leave
little doubt as to the intention of the legislation; that intention was to
remove the right of certiorari where “an appeal was taken.” Legislative
intention seldom has been expressed in words less ambiguous or more free from
doubt as to their meaning. Nevertheless an examination of the authorities would
seem to indicate that DuVal, J. was correct in his statement of the law. He
refers to the oft-quoted-and-followed opinion of Martin, C.J.S. in Bruton v.
Regina City Policemen’s Association (1945) 2 WWR 273, at 283, where the
learned Chief Justice states:

“In Canada it has been repeatedly held that
an express statutory abolition of certiorari does not oust the power of
the court to issue the writ or to quash a conviction if justices have acted
without jurisdiction, for in such a case the inferior court has not brought
itself within the terms of the statute taking away certiorari; even
express words do not take away the supervising power of a superior court when
there is want of jurisdiction in the inferior court.”

This case has been adopted in a number of cases
to be found in Tremeear’s Supplement, supra, at p. 360. DuVal, J.
refers in particular to In re Toronto Newspaper Guild and Globe Printing Co.
(1953) 2 SCR 18, and concludes:

“It would appear that no prohibition that
does not expressly take away the inherent power of the superior court to
exercise this very special remedy of certiorari is effective where the
inferior court or administrative tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction or has
declined jurisdiction.”

In answer to this reasoning, I prefer the view
expressed by Laidlaw J.A., in the Ontario Court of Appeal, in R. v. Kennedy[20]:

It may be said at the outset that a no
certiorari clause such as is contained in s. 682  was not designed 19
[1958] O.W.N. 41 at 44, 119 C.C.C. 200.

[Page 146]

or introduced into the legislation in order
to give validity to proceedings leading to conviction or an order of the Court
in cases where the Court had no jurisdiction. The section in the statute
was not intended to shelter an inferior Court or to permit a denial of
substantive justice by a pretended exercise of jurisdiction. But it appears to
me that the purpose of s. 682 (b) was to prohibit two courses of
proceedings at the option or choice of a person seeking to overcome and set
aside a conviction or order of an inferior Court.

When dealing with the possible application of
s. 682  in the Court below, reference was made, as it was also made in Dauphin
v. Director of Public Welfare, supra, to Toronto Newspaper Guild, Local
87, American Newspaper Guild v. Globe Printing Company[21]. The Court in that case was dealing
with the conduct of an administrative board created by The Labour Relations
Act, 1948 (Ont.), c. 51, which statute provided that the orders, decisions
and rulings of the Board should be final and that the Board should not be
restrained by certiorari or otherwise.

Kerwin J., as he then was, at p. 23, said
this:

We start with the proposition that when an
administrative tribunal has been set up by a paramount legislative body it is
the intention that such tribunal keep within the powers conferred upon it. In
England and in Canada the decisions have been uniform that a Superior Court is
invested with the power and duty of seeing that such a tribunal as the Ontario
Labour Relations Board does not act without jurisdiction.

This statement is in line with the view
expressed in a number of decisions which hold that the enactment of a finality
clause will not enable an inferior tribunal, by its own decision, to exceed its
statutory jurisdiction. This proposition is based, as Kerwin J. indicates, on
the presumed intention of the legislative body which creates such a tribunal
that it is not to be permitted to exceed the powers conferred upon it by the
legislation which created it, even though the legislation purports to make its
decisions final.

[Page 147]

Section 682  of the Criminal Code  is a
part of a complete code dealing with criminal law, and is contained in Part
XXIII wherein Parliament has legislated respecting the application, in criminal
proceedings, of the extraordinary remedies of certiorari, habeas corpus,
mandamus and prohibition. It is not a finality clause. It does not purport to
enable an inferior tribunal to exceed its jurisdiction, or to make its decision
as to its own jurisdiction final. What it does say is that if a person has
taken an appeal from a decision, he shall not thereafter be entitled to
certiorari. It also say that if a person pleads, and the case is tried on the
merits, then, if there is a right to appeal that decision, which is not
exercised, he shall not, thereafter, be entitled to certiorari.

A person who challenges the jurisdiction of a
tribunal which proposes to try him can take objection to the jurisdiction and
refuse to plead, in which event certiorari is available to him. But, if he does
plead, and the case then proceeds to a trial of the merits, and if he has a
right of appeal, his challenge to the jurisdiction can then only be made by way
of appeal.

There can be no doubt of the power of Parliament
thus to limit the exercise of an extraordinary remedy, and it has done so in
clear terms. Nor is there room here for implying a presumed intention that
certiorari be available to compel an inferior tribunal to keep within its
powers, because the obvious intention of s. 682  is that it is the
procedure by way of appeal, and not certiorari, that, where available, should
be used for that purpose.

Does this view of the effect of s. 682  run
counter to the judgment of this Court in Smith v. R., supra? In my
opinion it does not. That case involved a finding by a judge of the Winnipeg
Juvenile Court that the appellant was a delinquent. An application that the
finding be quashed without the actual issue of a writ of certiorari was
dismissed, and an appeal to the Court of Appeal from that dismissal failed. An
appeal to this Court was then taken successfully. I have examined the factums
filed on the appeal and the

[Page 148]

possible application of s. 682  was never
raised. No reference to the section is made in the reasons of this Court.
The possible application of s. 682  was not considered in that case. I do
not think the section could have been raised successfully because it seems
to be clear that the juvenile was not given a proper opportunity to plead and
he did not plead.

Reference has been made to the judgment of the
House of Lords in Crane v. Director of Public Prosecutions[22], as an example of a trial before a
court of competent jurisdiction, which was declared to be a nullity. In that
case two prisoners, indicted separately, had been tried together, and both the
Court of Criminal Appeal and the House of Lords held that the proceedings were
a nullity.

The case has no direct application to the
circumstances of this case, but it is of interest in that the procedure, by
means of which this finding was obtained, was by way of appeal from the
conviction. If Crane had not exercised his right of appeal, his conviction,
though the result of proceedings which, when examined on appeal, were held to
be a nullity, could not otherwise have been attacked, since it would appear
that in that case, which had been tried before a Recorder at Quarter Sessions,
proceedings by way of certiorari would not have been available (R. v. Boaler[23]; R. v. Justice of the Central Criminal
Court[24]; R.
v. Chairman, County of London Quarter Sessions[25]).

My interpretation of s. 682  does not
necessarily involve the conclusion that Parliament intended that that which was
a nullity should be validated. Even proceedings which are a nnullity, as in the
Crane case, can only be shown to have been a nullity by means of some
procedure before a higher court. Parliament can prescribe the nature of such a
procedure, and, in my view, in s. 682  has stated, in clear terms, that, in
any case falling within its provisions, that procedure must be by way of
appeal, and by that means only.

[Page 149]

I do not regard this interpretation as involving
the “monstrous consequences” contemplated by Lord Kenyon in relation to a
section of the bankruptcy statute under consideration in Fowler v.
Padget[26], but,
no matter what are the consequences, my view is that it is the function of
Parliament to consider whether they are such as to necessitate any amendment.

In my opinion s. 682 (b) is a bar to
the removal of the order in this case by certiorari.

In view of this opinion it is unnecessary for me
to express any view on the issue which was raised before us as to whether, in
the light of the provisions of s. 691  of the Criminal Code , this
Court has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from the refusal by the Court of
Appeal to grant certiorari.

The other issue to be determined is the appeal
from the refusal to grant a writ of habeas corpus. The appellant is given an
express right of appeal on this issue by s. 691(3)  of the Criminal
Code . For the appellant it was contented that the warrant of committal was
defective in that it did not disclose that the magistrate had acquired
jurisdiction by the prosecutor having given to the appellant seven clear days’
notice of the application, which is the notice required by s. 662(1) (b)
of the Criminal Code .

The warrant recited that:

Whereas Francis Stewart SANDERS hereinafter
called the “accused,” was this day convicted upon a charge that Francis Stewart
SANDERS between the 1st day of December, A.D. 1957 and the 1st day of March,
A.D. 1958, at or near Newton, B.C., in the Municipality of Surrey being a male
person did unlawfully commit an act of gross indecency with Roy FLACK, another
male person, contrary to the form of Statute in such case made and provided.

Whereas the said Francis Stewart SANDERS
was, pursuant to Section 661  of the Criminal Code  of Canada, found to be a
criminal sexual psychopath, and it was adjudged that the accused for his
offence be imprisoned in the British Columbia Penitentiary at New Westminster
for the term of Two (2) Years, and in addition a sentence of preventative
detention.

[Page 150]

The simple issue is whether it was required also
to cite that he had been given seven clear days’ notice of the application.
None of the authorities cited by counsel for the appellant support this
proposition and Form 18, in Part XXVI of the Code, does not appear to make this
a necessary requirement in a warrant of committal. In my opinion this
submission fails.

Even if s. 682 (b) were not to be
considered as constituting a bar to proceedings by way of certiorari, it is my
opinion that the appellant’s appeal fails on the merits.

There is no doubt that the magistrate had jurisdiction
to hear and determine the Crown’s application that, before passing sentence, he
determine whether the appellant was a criminal sexual psychopath. This is not a
case in which a court purports to deal with a subject-matter which it has no
lawful authority to determine. The magistrate was required by s. 662(1) (b)
not to hear the application unless the appellant had received seven clear
days’ notice.

On April 22, 1958, before any evidence on the
application was received, the magistrate was advised by counsel for the Crown,
in the appellant’s presence, that notice had been served upon the appellant,
who was prepared to admit service to avoid the necessity of proof, and the
appellant then admitted service of the written notice, which was filed as an exhibit.
The magistrate knew, at that time, that the appellant had been made aware, on
March 28, of the Crown’s intention to make such an application, because it was
on that date that the appellant, as he admits, had been asked to appoint one of
the two psychiatrists whose evidence would be required upon such application.
On these facts, the magistrate was entitled to infer, as undoubtedly he did,
that all of the requirements respecting notice had been satisfied.

If the admission of service had not been made,
then, if the proof of service had not established that the necessary notice had
been given, the magistrate would have adjourned the hearing until proper notice
had been given.

In the light of these circumstances it was
incumbent upon the appellant, when he applied

[Page 151]

for certiorari in May, 1967, on the ground that
he had not received adequate notice, to establish that fact by clear and
positive evidence. He admitted receipt of the notice. He did not say when he
received it. He did not say where it was served upon him. Nor did he say that
he did not remember when or where he received it. He says only, by way of
argument, that, on the basic of Corporal Dempsey’s affidavit as to the place of
service, and his own statement as to the dates when he was at that place, he
could not have had seven clear days’ notice.

As against this, we have the affidavit of the
magistrate that he was satisfied that seven clear days’ notice had been given,
the affidavit of the Crown Prosecutor that he proved to the satisfaction of the
magistrate that proper notice had been given, and the affidavit of Corporal
Dempsey, who recalls reading the requirements of the section as to notice,
and who states his belief that at least seven days’ notice was given.

The copy of the notice, which the appellant
produced as being the one served upon him, is dated March 31, 1958, and gives
notice of an application to be made, pursuant to s. 661(1)  of the Criminal
Code , at the Court Room, Municipal Hall, Cloverdale, B.C., on April 15,
1958. The contention raised in the appellant’s affidavit is that, if Corporal
Dempsey’s affidavit as to service on the appellant at Cloverdale is correct, he
must have been served on either April 15, or April 22, 1958. This contention,
however, also involves the conclusion that although Corporal Dempsey read the
requirements as to notice, which call for seven clear days, he nonetheless
served the appellant on the very date set in the notice for the hearing, or one
week after that date. This, in the absence of any statement by the appellant as
to where or when he was served, I find it hard to accept.

I agree with the reasons of the majority of the
Court of Appeal, as delivered by Tysoe J.A., who said:

It seems to me this is particularly a case
where the appellant must produce convincing proof of his allegation that seven
clear days’ notice was not given him. As I have earlier said, I have no doubt
he

[Page 152]

knows very well when and where the notice
was given to him. Yet he has not seen fit to pledge his oath to these matters.
In the light of all the circumstances, I am of the opinion that the appellant
has not come forward with evidence of sufficient cogency to justify the court
in saying he has discharged the onus of proof that is upon him.

I would, therefore, dismiss this appeal.

HALL J. (dissenting)—I agree
fully with the reasons of my brother the Chief Justice. I have only some
observations to make regarding the interpretation and effect of s. 682  of
the Criminal Code . That section reads:

682. No conviction or order shall be
removed by certiorari

(a) where an appeal was
taken, whether or not the appeal has been carried to a conclusion, or

(b) where the defendant
appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried, and an appeal might have been
taken, but the defendant did not appeal.

The view that this section denies the right
to remove the order in question here requires holding that a person convicted
in a proceeding which is in law a nullity is without recourse by certiorari when
that person might have appealed and it is one I cannot accept. Section 682  does
not, in my opinion, achieve that result. I refuse to impute such an intention
to Parliament. I believe that when Parliament said “where the defendant
appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried,” it meant a lawful trial or
hearing and not a proceeding which was in law a nullity.

Parliament specified that the section would
be operative when:

(1) An appeal was taken; or

(2)(a) Where the defendant appeared;

(b) Where the defendant pleaded;

(c) The merits were tried;

(d) An appeal might have been
taken.

Each of the above conditions is as essential as
the others. Here, as the Chief Justice points out,

[Page 153]

no plea was taken nor was there any provision
for the taking of a plea. That fact cannot be ignored. Section 682  can be
invoked only when all its provisos have been met.

It is said that Parliament, by s. 682 , has
decreed in the broadest terms that certiorari shall not be available if
the conditions named in the section exist. I recognize that the language
used in s. 682  is quite explicit, but it is no broader or more explicit
than that found in many statutes which contain privitive clauses of which the Labour
Relations Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 202, is an example. The section in that
Act, being s. 80, reads as follows:

No decision, order, direction, declaration
or ruling of the Board shall be questioned or reviewed in any court, and no
order shall be made or process entered, or proceedings taken in any court,
whether by way of injunction, declaratory judgment, certiorari, mandamus,
prohibition, quo warranto, or otherwise, to question, review, prohibit or
restrain the Board or any of its proceedings.

Another example is that to be found in the Trade
Union Act, 1944, 2nd Sess., c. 69 (Sask), which was dealt with by Martin C.J.S.
in Bruton v. Regina City Policemen’s Association[27]:, when he said:

Sec. 15 of the Act provides that there
shall be no appeal from an order of the Board, and its orders shall not be
reviewable by certiorari. A statutory abolition of the right to certiorari
is not wholly effective, for it is clearly established by authority that,
notwithstanding a provision in a statute abolishing certiorari, the
Courts will still exercise the power to issue the writ where the conviction or
order complained of has been made without jurisdiction. In Colonial Bank of
Australasia v. Willan (1874) L.R. 5 P.C. 417, 43 L.J.P.C. 39, the
authorities are reviewed by Sir James W. Colville in delivering the opinion of
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council after concluding that the statute
in question had taken away the power of the Courts to issue certiorari. See
also Rex v. Nat Bell Liquors, Ltd. (1922) 2 W.W.R. 30, (1922) 2 AC. 128,
91

[Page 154]

L.J.P.C. 146, 37 C.C.C. 129; Halsbury’s
Laws of England, 2nd ed., vol. 9, p. 862; Dillon on Municipal
Corporations, vol. 4, 5th ed., p. 2791.

In Canada it has been repeatedly held that
an express statutory abolition of certiorari does not oust the power of
the Court to issue the writ or to quash a conviction if justices have acted without
jurisdiction, for in such a case the inferior Court has not brought itself
within the terms of the statute taking away certiorari; even express
words do not take away the supervising power of a Superior Court when there is
want of jurisdiction in the inferior Court: Rex v. Collier (1917) 51
N.S.R. 64, 28 C.C.C. 87; Rex v. Slipp; Ex parte Monahan (1928) 54
N.B.R. 550, 51 C.C.C. 15; Rex v. Cook (1908) 18 O.L.R. 215, 14 C.C.C.
495, Anglin, J. at p. 499; Rex v. Yarrow (1922) 51 O.L.R. 509, 38
C.C.C. 269, Meredith, C.J.C.P., p. 271; Rex v. Richmond (1917) 2
W.W.R. 1200, 12 Alta. L.R. 133, 29 C.C.C. 89, Stuart, J., p. 1204.

The explicit language of s. 80 of the Labour
Relations Act above quoted did not impede this Court in Jarvis v.
Associated Medical Services Inc.[28], from
exercising its supervisory jurisdiction by way of certiorari once it
found that the tribunal had exceeded or was without jurisdiction. I am unable
to see any consistency in holding that s. 682  is an absolute bar to certiorari
in a case involving the liberty of the person when equally explicit
enactments denying certiorari in labour relations legislation are not so
regarded. As Cartwright J. (as he then was) said in Jarvis at
p. 502:

The effect of this section, if it receives the
construction most favourable to the appellant, is to oust the jurisdiction of
the superior Courts to interfere with any decision of the Board which is made
in exercise of the powers conferred upon it by the Legislature; within the
ambit of those powers it may

[Page 155]

err in fact or in law; but I cannot take the
section to mean that if the Board purports to make an order which, on the
true construction of the Act, it has no jurisdiction to make the person
affected thereby is left without a remedy;…

No form of words can prohibit this Court from
determining whether the order under review was made by a tribunal having
jurisdiction; in other words, the assumption of jurisdiction by the inferior
tribunal is always an issue. This leads irresistibly to the conclusion that where
there is no jurisdiction there cannot be a trial on the merits within the
meaning of s. 682 .

My brother Martland states in his reasons that
he prefers the view expressed by Laidlaw J.A. in the Ontario Court of Appeal in
R. v. Kennedy[29], where
the learned justice of appeal says that it appears to him:

…that the purpose of s. 682 (b)
was to prohibit two courses of proceedings at the option or choice of a person
seeking to overcome and set aside a conviction or order of an inferior Court.

In Kennedy the jurisdiction of the
magistrate to enter upon the proceedings was not challenged. In the application
for certiorari it was urged that the magistrate had lost jurisdiction in
that: (1) no evidence was heard; (2) the conviction was made after an
adjournment for more than eight days; (3) the proceedings were conducted
maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause. Laidlaw J.A., after
fully reviewing the record and transcript of the proceedings before the
magistrate, found as a fact that there had been a trial on the merits by virtue
of a plea of “Guilty” entered to the charge in the presence of Kennedy by his
counsel and confirmed by Kennedy himself when the question was put to him
directly by the magistrate. Accordingly it seems clear that Laidlaw J.A.’s statement
went beyond what was necessary for the decision in the case and must be
regarded as obiter dicta. It is manifest also that Laidlaw J.A. was not

[Page 156]

purporting to give a definitive interpretation
to s. 682 (b) because he introduced his statement above
quoted by saying:

It appears to me that the primary question
for consideration in this appeal is whether or not the accused had a right to
remove the proceedings before the Magistrate by certiorari into the higher
Court. Section 682 (b) of the Criminal Code  expressly provides
that no conviction or order shall be removed by certiorari “where the defendant
appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried and an appeal might have been
taken, but the defendant did not appeal.” It may be said at the outset that a
no certiorari clause such as is contained in s. 682  was not designed or
introduced into the legislation in order to give validity to proceedings
leading to conviction or an order of the Court in cases where the Court had no
jurisdiction. The section in the statute was not intended to shelter an
inferior Court or to permit a denial of substantive justice by a pretended
exercise of jurisdiction. (Emphasis added)

These last two sentences show that Laidlaw J.A.
was not regarding s. 682 (b) as an absolute bar to certiorari but
only in cases where there had been a trial on the merits and an appeal might
have been taken.

One has but to appreciate the rigid conditions
precedent relating to the right to appeal from a summary conviction court under
ss. 722  and 724  of the Criminal Code  (see R. v. Perehudoff[30] which followed Dennis v. The
Queen[31] to
see how erroneous Laidlaw J.A.’s obiter statement is as a general
proposition.

Section 724(1)(b), for instance,
provides:

724. (1) The following provisions apply in
respect of appeals to the appeal court, namely,

* *
*

(b) where an appeal is from a
conviction or order adjudging that a fine or sum of money be paid and imposing
a term of imprisonment in default of payment, the appellant shall

[Page 157]

(i) remain in custody until the appeal is
heard,

(ii) enter into a recognizance, or (iii)
deposit with the summary conviction court the amount of the fine or the sum of
money to be paid and an additional amount that, in the opinion of the summary
conviction court, is sufficient to cover the costs of the appeal;

This means that a person purportedly convicted
by a summary conviction court and sentenced to a fine of, say, $500 and in
default of payment to imprisonment for six months must, under s. 724(1)(b)
above, either remain in custody or enter into a recognizance in such amount
as may be ordered (which would be an amount in excess of $500) or deposit with
the Court the amount called for by s. 724(1)(b)(iii). He must do
one of these things even though the person constituting the Court under
s. 692(1)(g) was not in fact a person holding any judicial
office as required by that subsection. If the person so convicted did not
appeal but remained in custody for more than sixty days until his right to
appeal had lapsed, he could have redress and be released by habeas corpus and
that means that the interpretation put upon s. 682  in Kennedy that
s. 682  was enacted to prohibit two courses of proceedings at the option of
a person convicted falls. If, on the other hand, the person so convicted pays
the fine and costs and does not appeal within the sixty days and does not find
out that the conviction was made by one who was not a judicial officer until
after the time for appealing has passed, he would be, under the Kennedy interpretation
of s. 682 , without redress at law and would have to carry the conviction
for the rest of his life. I cannot accept the view that Parliament ever
intended to put a person so convicted under such a handicap where the so-called
conviction was made by a volunteer or by one whose term of office had expired
when the “conviction” was made.

The example just given may be said to be one
that may not often occur, but instances of con-

[Page 158]

victions being made by magistrates whose
commissions had expired or been revoked are known. Then there are instances of
magistrates with limited territorial jurisdiction who have purported to convict
for an offence committed outside their territorial jurisdiction. Other examples
are readily available such as where the conviction fails to disclose an offence
known to the law. It cannot be doubted that a purported conviction which
discloses no offence known to the law is anything but a nullity: Rex v.
Perron[32],
Regina v. Jones[33], and
the very recent case of Regina v. Vallee[34] in which the Court of Appeal for
British Columbia held that certiorari was available despite s. 682 
even after a person convicted by a magistrate had appealed unsuccessfully to
the County Court under Part XXIV of the Code where the “conviction” was
for an “offence” not known to the law.

Crane v. Director of Public Prosecutions[35] is an interesting case in point on the
effect of proceedings which are a nullity although heard by a Court that
clearly had jurisdiction to deal with the matter in the first place. In that
case the House of Lords held that a trial at the Leicester Quarter Sessions was
a nullity because two prisoners, indicted separately, were given in charge to
the same jury and tried together. The fact that the prisoners were not jointly
indicted was not brought to the notice of the Recorder or of counsel
appearing in the case. Lord Parmoor said of the proceedings before the
Recorder:

“…there has only been a form of trial which is
void ab initio…” and “In a void trial there is neither conviction,
verdict or judgment.” Yet if the Kennedy interpretation is accepted as
my brother Martland holds it should be, the result is that Parliament is said
to have enacted that what is in law a nullity, something void ab initio, is
nevertheless to stand for all time as a lawful conviction against a person who
was unlawfully convicted once the time for the limited right of appeal under
Part XXIV of the Code has passed.

[Page 159]

Crane is not a certiorari
case because the Court of first instance there was sitting as a Court of
Oyer and Terminer to try prisoners on indictment and was not an inferior court
nor was the Court in R. v. Chairman, County of London Quarter Sessions. The
same observation applies to the cases of The King v. Justices of the Central
Criminal Court[36] and
Reg. v. Boaler[37], the
Central Criminal Court being a superior court whose proceedings and decisions
are not subject to review by certiorari. Therefore, the fact that certiorari
was not available in Crane and the other three cases just mentioned
is not relevant. No enactment similar to s. 682  entered into the
consideration of these cases.

When Parliament enacted s. 682 , it was not
done to prescribe or establish a remedy for declaring some void procedure a
nullity. Instead Parliament was purporting to deprive a citizen of his ancient
right to have that which is in law a nullity or made without or in excess of
jurisdiction so declared by recourse to the prerogative writ of certiorari, a
right which did not originate with Parliament. Accordingly, if Parliament is to
extinguish that right, it must do so by explicit language, and it said
explicitly that s. 682  is only to be applied where “the defendant appeared
and pleaded and the merits were tried”. Section 682  did not grant a remedy, but
purported to extinguish a right.

All of which impels me to say that I must refuse
to impute such an intention to Parliament adopting the language of Lord Kenyon
in Fowler v. Padget[38], where
he said:

I would adopt any construction of the
statute that the words will bear, in order to avoid such monstrous consequences
as would manifestly ensue from the construction contended for…

I would, accordingly, allow the appeal as
directed by the Chief Justice.

[Page 160]

PIGEON J. (dissenting)—On March 6, 1958,
appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of gross indecency. Then on April 22,
considering two similar previous convictions, he was sentenced to preventive
detention in addition to the sentence of two years imprisonment for the last
offence. He did not have counsel, did not appeal, but, on the contrary signed,
as authorized by s. 49 of the Penitentiary Act, R.S.C. 1952, c.
206, a waiver of his right of appeal. Only after more than five years of
imprisonment did he embark upon the numerous proceedings mentioned by my
brethren. This appeal is from a judgment affirming the dismissal of an
application for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid.

I must say at the outset, that, in my opinion,
proceedings leading to a sentence of preventive detention constitute a separate
issue distinct from the charge following which they are instituted, while, on
the contrary, the sentence imposed following a conviction is part of the issue
arising out of the charge. The character of being a separate issue appears from
a consideration of the provisions of the Criminal Code  respecting
preventing detention (Part XXI) as a whole and especially from s. 667 
concerning the right of appeal in such cases. The decisions of our Court
allowing appeals from such judgments by special leave under s. 41 of the Supreme
Court Act notwithstanding the exception of any judgment “acquitting or
convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an
indictable offence”, necessarily imply that a sentence of preventive detention
is pronounced in an issue separate from that in which the conviction arises (Poole
v. The Queen[39]).

It should be noted here that when Parliament, in
1947, (c. 55, s. 18) first enacted provisions for preventive detention, no
amendment to the Criminal Code  was made concerning remedies other than
the right of appeal. Whereas in respect of those new proceedings a right of
appeal

[Page 161]

from the sentence was explicitly provided for,
no amendment was made to Part XXII, Extraordinary Remedies. The new Criminal
Code  brought no change in that regard and nothing is to be found in it
referring specifically to such proceedings under the heading Extraordinary
Remedies (Part XXIII). In particular, Section 682  reads as follows:

682. No conviction or order shall be
removed by certiorari

(a) where an appeal was
taken, whether or not the appeal has been carried to a conclusion, or

(b) where the defendant
appeared and pleaded and the merits were tried, and an appeal might have been
taken, but the defendant did not appeal.

How is subsection (b) above to be
applied to a sentence of preventive detention when the procedure on an
application for such a sentence does not provide for a plea by the accused? Are
we to say that because he is only called upon to appear, it will suffice that
he did appear and did not appeal, to deprive him of any remedy by certiorari?
In a criminal matter, this does not seem possible. The deprivation of a
right can only result from an explicit enactment. If the provisions found in
the Code do not apply exactly because one of the conditions cannot be
met, the same conclusion must be reached as under s. 41 of the Supreme
Court Act: the privative provision not being literally applicable to a
sentence of preventive detention, it cannot be applied thereto by analogy or by
extension, such a construction of a privative clause as s. 682  of the Criminal
Code  would be, I think, without precedent in British jurisprudence.

The special provisions enacted for the right of
appeal show that when Parliament introduced preventive detention into our
criminal law, the necessity of providing explicitly for the right of appeal mutatis
mutandis was seen, the ordinary provisions concerning appeals on
proceedings by indictment not being literally applicable to this

[Page 162]

new kind of proceeding. Until similar provisions
concerning extraordinary remedies are laid down, we cannot do otherwise than to
apply the law as it reads. For this reason, I am of the opinion that the
appellant is in the same situation as in Smith v. The Queen[40], he has not pleaded.

Having concluded that appellant is entitled to certiorari,
I must now say that, in my opinion, the record shows that it was not proved
before Magistrate Hunter that seven clear days’ notice was given as required
imperatively by s. 662  of the Criminal Code . The record indicates
that at the hearing before the Magistrate, instead of proving service of the
notice by the testimony of the officer who served it, a voluntary statement
before the Court by the accused was resorted to. The transcript supplied by the
Court reporter is as follows:

CROWN: Your Worship, you will recall in
this matter, the previous hearing, I made application under Section 661(1)  of
the Criminal Code  and Notice has been served upon the Accused and the Accused
is prepared to admit it, to avoid the necessity of proof.

MAGISTRATE: Now, Mr. Saunders, you
have been served with a copy of this Notice?

MR. SAUNDERS: Right.

MAGISTRATE: And this is your signature on
the bottom, admitting it?

MR. SAUNDERS: Yes.

MAGISTRATE: That is a copy of what I have
here now?

MR. SAUNDERS: Yes, that is correct.

EXHIBIT
1, NOTICE.

Unfortunately, the exhibit is lost; in the
record, there is only the copy which was served upon the accused and that he
recently filed with one of his affidavits.

[Page 163]

It will be noticed that appellant’s admission
covers only the service of the notice. No reference whatsoever is made to the
date of the service, nor to the prescribed interval between the day of service
and that of the hearing. In a civil case, such an admission might be sufficient
due to the rule that the parties are bound by the manner in which the
proceedings were conducted. In my opinion, it cannot be so in a criminal case,
in face of an imperative requirement of the law and especially where the
accused did not have the assistance of counsel. The principle to be followed is
that which applies where no objection is made to illegal evidence; in a
criminal matter, this omission does not necessarily cover the illegality.

Moreover, I doubt that the appellant could
validly admit having received the notice required by Section 662 . The last
subsection is as follows:

(3) For the purposes of section 660 ,
where the accused admits the allegations contained in the notice referred to in
paragraph (b) of subsection (1), no proof of those
allegations is required.

(Even if the amendment was only made the
following year (1959, c. 71, s. 30), one must obviously read paragraph (a)
and not paragraph (b) in view of the reference to the
purposes of Section 660 ).

To say that “for the purposes of Section 660 ”
(habitual criminals), it is not necessary to prove the allegations contained in
the notice if the accused admits them, undoubtedly implies that it is always
necessary to prove the facts required to be established for the purposes of
s. 661  (criminal sexual psychopaths), otherwise the provision would be
entirely useless. Here, we are concerned with the application of s. 661 :
it is therefore clear that the accused could not dispense from proving the
facts by admitting them. Without expressing a firm opinion on this point, I fail
to see how it can be held that this rule

[Page 164]

does not apply to the proof of a fact as
essential to the validity of such proceedings as the service of a seven clear
days’ notice, without which Parliament expressly forbids the hearing to take
place.

It must now be observed that nothing shows that
there was on the exhibit that was lost a date of service showing that the
required time had been allowed. There is no such date on the copy filed by the
appellant. It is true that he himself does not enlighten us on this point, but
legally it cannot be held against him. He does not have to rebut evidence that
is not in the record. He needs only point out its absence.

I do not think that it should be presumed that
the lost exhibit did show that the required interval of seven clear days had
been observed. The sentence having been pronounced by an inferior court, the
observance of the prescribed formalities cannot be presumed. Because the
exhibit was lost, proof by affidavits could no doubt have been made that this did
appear on the document. It was not done.

In his affidavit, the Magistrate merely states
that at the hearing it was proved to his satisfaction that the appellant
received a notice of seven clear days. In saying this, he only repeated his
finding on that point. However, it is well established that an inferior court
judge cannot give himself jurisdiction by making without sufficient evidence a
finding of fact on which his jurisdiction depends. As we have seen, the
admission made by the appellant at the hearing was incomplete and did not show
that an essential requirement had been complied with, namely seven clear days’
notice. In the absence of any other evidence that this fact was proven
otherwise, the only proper legal conclusion is that the Magistrate misapprehended
the admission made by appellant at the hearing. He undoubtedly believed that
appellant had implicitly admitted that the prescribed time had been allowed,
while the actual wording does not warrant such a conclusion.

[Page 165]

As to the Crown prosecutor’s affidavit, it is
sufficient to say that it adds nothing to that of the Magistrate.

There remains the affidavit of the police
officer. He also did not swear that the date of service was entered on the lost
exhibit and that that date was at least seven clear days prior to the date of
the hearing. All he says is that he believes he complied with the legal
requirements because he remembers looking up the requirements of the Code. On
the other hand, he also says that he effected service of the notice at
Cloverdale. But, after March 31, which is the date of the notice according to
the copy filed in the record, the authenticity of which is not disputed,
appellant was at Cloverdale only on April 15 and on April 22, the day of the
hearing. It is therefore impossible for the requirements as to notice to have
been met by service at the place named by the police officer.

Appellant’s affidavit concerning the dates of
his attendance at Cloverdale is not questioned. Furthermore, as he was a
prisoner, the Crown must have been able to verify its accuracy. As no evidence
was submitted to contradict that statement, this fact must now be considered as
proven. The conclusion is that the officer must have been mistaken as to the
required time and that the notice was not of seven clear days. Even if he did
carefully read Section 662 , he did not necessarily understand the meaning of
“seven clear days”, nor correctly make the computation and he does not swear
that such is the case. Since he served the notice at Cloverdale, it must have
been on April 15.

On the whole, in my view, the police officer’s
affidavit does not remedy the defect in the record and it does not show that
proper notice was given. This is no doubt an omission which could have been
easily remedied if the accused had raised the point instead of admitting
without protest what he was asked to admit. Once again, in a civil case this
would no doubt amount to a waiver but, in my view, it cannot be so in a
criminal case as against an imperative require-

[Page 166]

ment of the law especially with regard to an
accused who was not assisted by counsel.

Having reached the conclusion that the
Magistrate proceeded without adequate proof of a notice served in accordance
with the requirements of the law, I must now, in view of the provisions of
subs. (1) of s. 683  of the Criminal Code , consider whether the
defect deprived the Magistrate of his jurisdiction. The provision requiring the
notice cannot be more explicit:

An application under subsection (1)  of
section 661  shall not be heard unless seven clear days’ notice has
been given to the accused by the prosecutor…

I have underlined the words “shall not be heard”
because to me they necessarily imply that the Magistrate does not have
authority to hear the application unless the notice has really been given. The
law does not say that proof must be produced to the satisfaction of the
Magistrate that the notice was given. It forbids proceeding without notice. I
find it impossible to see in that subsection a provision the observance whereof
Parliament intended the Magistrate to be the judge. On the contrary, Parliament
seems to have clearly intended to make it a condition of jurisdiction.

In L’Alliance des Professeurs catholiques de
Montréal v. La Commission des Relations ouvrières[41], this Court held that the
respondent acted without jurisdiction in cancelling a certificate without
notice to the appellant. In Regina v. County of London Quarter Sessions
Appeals Committee, Ex parte Rossi[42], the
English Court of Appeal, on an application for certiorari, considered an
inferior court as having acted without jurisdiction for having erroneously
considered as sufficient notice a registered letter which had not been
delivered to the respondent. Finally, in Dennis v. The Queen[43], in the reasons for the

[Page 167]

majority, it was expressly held that, on an
appeal from a summary conviction, a County Court judge was right in deciding
that he had no jurisdiction because the appellant had not served the notice of
appeal upon the person specified in s. 722  of the Criminal Code . All
the Justices of Appeal who sat in this case have expressed the opinion that if
the required notice had not in fact been served in accordance with the
requirements of the Code, the Magistrate acted without jurisdiction.
This is the proper conclusion. We are not dealing here with a fact to be found
by the Magistrate, in which case an error cannot go to jurisdiction. On the
contrary, this is a condition precedent to jurisdiction. This condition must be
met before he can act validly.

For the above reasons, I agree with the
conclusions of the Chief Justice, including that pertaining to an order
pursuant to s. 689  of the Criminal Code  protecting the Magistrate
and officers.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Escape from lawful
custody—Police officer grabbing accused’s shirt and saying “you are under
arrest”—Accused driving off—Whether in lawful custody—Criminal Code , 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, ss. 110, 125(a).

A police officer, who knew that a
warrant for the respondent’s arrest was outstanding, saw the latter at the
wheel of a motor vehicle which was then stopped for a red light. The officer
approached the respondent’s car and told him that he had a warrant for him. The
respondent, who had started to move forward, accelerated but had to brake
because of traffic. The officer ran up, reached in through the window and
grabbed the respondent’s shirt, saying “you are under arrest”. The respondent
accelerated, breaking the officer’s hold on the shirt and on the car. The
respondent was convicted after a trial by jury, on a charge of escaping from
lawful custody contrary to s. 125 (a) of the Criminal Code . The
Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and directed that a verdict of acquittal
be entered. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court where the sole
question for determination was whether the respondent had been in lawful
custody.

Held (Hall and
Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the conviction
restored.

Per Fauteux,
Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.: The respondent was arrested, he
escaped from lawful custody and was guilty under s. 125 (a) of the Criminal
Code . Arrest consists of the actual seizure or touching of a person’s body
with a view to his detention. A police officer has the right to use such force
as may be necessary to make an arrest. There is no room for what seems to be a
new subdivision of arrest into “custodial” arrest and “symbolical” or “technical”
arrest.

[Page 47]

Per Hall and
Spence JJ., dissenting: The police officer had a lawful right and duty
to arrest the respondent. The respondent accordingly was under a legal
obligation to submit to the lawful arrest. It is not necessary to touch or hold
the person being arrested. He must, of course, be informed that he is being
arrested. If he does not submit or tries to flee, the arresting officer may use
such force as may reasonably be necessary to detain his man having regard to
the nature of the offence for which the person is wanted. If the man flees and
is not in fact detained he cannot be said to have been in lawful custody. In
these circumstances he is clearly guilty under s. 110 (a) of the Criminal
Code . Section 125 (a) is not an included offence under s. 110 (a)
and vice versa.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], quashing the
respondent’s conviction and directing a verdict of acquittal. Appeal allowed,
Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting.

McKeown, for the respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux, Martland, Judson,
Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

JUDSON J.—The respondent, James Whitfield, was
convicted on October 23, 1967, after a trial by jury, on a charge of escaping
from lawful custody contrary to s. 125 (a) of the Criminal Code . He
was sentenced to be imprisoned for a period of six months definite and six
months indeterminate. The Court of Appeal1 allowed his appeal,
quashed the conviction and directed that a verdict of acquittal be entered. The
appeal to this Court is by leave granted on January 29, 1969.

The ratio of the Court of Appeal is that
Whitfield could not be convicted under s. 125 (a) because he had never
been “custodially arrested” and that for a conviction there must be more than
what is termed an “arrest in symbolical form”. A distinction is drawn between
an arrest amounting to custody and a mere or bare arrest. In some parts of the
reasons of the Court of

[Page 48]

Appeal it is referred to as a “technical
arrest”. It is said that the judge ought to have told the jury in view of the
evidence in the case that it was not enough that there was an arrest by
touching and that it was incumbent on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that the constable had taken or captured the accused and that the accused
had thereafter broken away. These propositions enunciated by the Court of
Appeal are, in my opinion, erroneous.

The correct proposition of law is stated in 10
Hals., 3rd ed., p. 342, in these terms:

631. MEANING OF ARREST. Arrest consists of
the actual seizure or touching of a person’s body with a view to his detention.
The mere pronouncing of words of arrest is not an arrest, unless the person
sought to be arrested submits to the process and goes with the arresting
officer. An arrest may be made either with or without a warrant.

There is no room for what seems to be a new
subdivision of “arrest” into “custodial” arrest and “symbolical” or “technical”
arrest. An accused is either arrested or he is not arrested. If this accused
was arrested, he escaped from lawful custody and is guilty under s. 125 (a)
of the Criminal Code .

The law on this matter was stated without
qualification by the Court of Exchequer Chamber in Sandon v. Jervis
and Dain[2]. This
judgment was delivered in 1858 and was stating not a new principle but
established law based on sound public policy. Pollock C.B., Williams J.,
Crowder J., Willes J. and Bramwell B., were all of the same opinion:

It is a matter of positive law whether a mere
touch is to constitute an arrest or not. It might have been reasonably
prescribed either that it should or should not be necessary to an arrest that
there should be a possession of the person. But probably the reason which led
to the laying down of the law as it stands was that it was thought desirable to
avoid unnecessary violence; and therefore it was determined that, if the
officer was near enough to the debtor to touch him, it was the duty of the
debtor to submit;

[Page 49]

and this for the purpose of preventing
conflict. I may remark parenthetically that what the law of England most
aims at is the preservation of peace. It will not allow a man to take forcible
possession of even his own property. But, whatever be the reason, the law is
that, if the officer is near enough to the debtor to touch him, and does touch
him, and gives him notice of the writ, it is an arrest. I can well understand
the reason for its being so held.

It is true that this problem was under
consideration in relation to an action against a sheriff by an execution
creditor for permitting an execution debtor to escape from lawful custody. But
the proposition of law stated by Pollock C.B., is not so limited in its
application. Bramwell B., in his agreement with Pollack C.B., on the general
proposition, introduced an element of qualification when the issue was the
liability of the sheriff for permitting an escape. I quote his precise words:

I am of the same opinion: but I wish to
guard myself against being supposed to lay it down that the sheriff would be
liable to an escape where the officer had been unable to do more than touch the
debtor. The capture might be good as against the debtor so as to preclude him
from saying that he had not been arrested, and yet not complete so as to make the
sheriff liable for an escape... I wish not to be understood as asserting that
the sheriff would have been liable for an escape if the debtor had got away
after he had merely been touched.

This qualification which Bramwell B., alone
wished to introduce was intended to ease the lot of the sheriff when sued for
an escape. It does not touch the general proposition. It was not accepted by
the other members of the Court and it had been argued and rejected in the
earlier case of Nicholl v. Darley[3],
where it was said that the cases “abundantly show that the slightest touch
is an arrest in point of law.”

In Sandon v. Jervis and Dain the Court
was, therefore, following long established authority based on sound principle
which goes back at least as far as the judgment of Holt C.J., in Genner v.
Sparks[4].

[Page 50]

These authorities which have stood so long
should not now be limited to a process which has become obsolete. The reason
for the rule is equally compelling today as it was in the past. A police
officer has the right to use such force as may be necessary to make an arrest.
What kind of arrest are we to expect if it becomes a principle of law that a
police officer, acting under a warrant of which he informs the accused, and who
actually seizes the accused’s person, is found not to have made an arrest
because the accused is in the driver’s seat of a motor car which enables him to
shake off the arresting officer?

I would allow the appeal and restore the
conviction.

The judgment of Hall and Spence JJ. was
delivered by

HALL J. (dissenting)—The respondent, James
Whitfield, was a person for whose arrest a warrant was outstanding. He was
wanted with two others on a charge of having wilfully damaged three seat
cushions in a restaurant some three weeks before. On June 10, 1967, he was driving a motor
vehicle in an eastbound direction at the corner of St. Clair
 Avenue and Dufferin Street in the City of Toronto. At the same time, Constable Kerr, a member of the Toronto Police
Force, who knew that a warrant for Whitfield’s arrest was outstanding, was
driving a police car accompanied by a fellow officer and at the
intersection in question saw Whitfield who was then stopped for a red
light. Kerr got out of the police car and approached Whitfield’s car, and as he
came to the car window Whitfield started to move forward, the light having
changed to green. Kerr, who knew Whitfield, said through the open window: “I
have a warrant for you, Whitfield” and added: “Stop the car and shut off the
ignition”. Whitfield accelerated, veering to the left across the centre line of
St. Clair Avenue but had
to brake abruptly because of westbound traffic. He then proceeded in the
intersection and Kerr was unable to shout at or speak to the accused at
that time. However Whitfield had to brake again in the middle of Dufferin Street because of traffic. Kerr
ran up and groped for the ignition key while Whitfield moved forward again and
continued to turn left. As Whitfield completed the turn to go

[Page 51]

north, travelling then at about 5 miles per hour,
Kerr reached in through the window and grabbed Whitfield’s shirt with both
hands, saying, “You are under arrest”, but Whitfield accelerated breaking
Kerr’s hold on the shirt and on the car. As Kerr’s hold on the car was being
broken, he was dragged a few feet and then fell to the pavement. At some time
when he had hold of Whitfield’s shirt, Kerr struck his neck on the frame of the
car door, and when he fell to the pavement he sustained some bruises to an
elbow joint and his right leg was injured. In the result he was unable to
perform his duties as a police officer for three days. Whitfield was taken into
custody a short time later at another location by two other police officers. He
was indicted on October 23, 1967, under two counts as follows:

1. The said jurors further present that
James Edward Whitfield on or about the 10th day of June in the year 1967 at the
Municipality of Metropolitan
  Toronto in the County of York, by criminal negligence, caused bodily harm to one (Frederick) Kerr, contrary to the Criminal
Code . (Amended Oct. 19, 1967 by Judge Sheppard)

2. The said jurors further present that
James Edward Whitfield on or about the 10th day of June in the year 1967 at the
Municipality of Metropolitan
  Toronto in the County of York, escaped from lawful custody, contrary to the Criminal
Code .

He was tried before His Honour Judge Sheppard
and a jury and found “Not Guilty” by the jury on Count 1 but “Guilty” under
Count 2 and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six months definite and six
months indefinite.

Whitfield appealed on the ground that he could
not be found guilty under s. 125 (a) of the Criminal Code  as he
had not been in lawful custody at the time in question. The Court of Appeal[5] (Gale C.J.O., Laskin and Jessup JJ.A.)
allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction and directed that an acquittal be
entered on the charge of escaping from lawful custody.

The Crown applied and was given leave to appeal
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal

[Page 52]

on the terms that the Crown pay to the
respondent his costs of the appeal in this Court, including the costs of the
motion for leave, the whole on a solicitor and client basis in any event of the
cause.

The sole question for determination is whether
or not, on the facts as hereinbefore set out, Whitfield was, at the relevant
time in question here, in lawful custody because it follows that unless he was
in lawful custody he could not escape from lawful custody as the
section states.

In the argument before this Court a great number
of old English cases were cited dealing with whether an arrest had been
effected or not in certain given circumstances. Virtually all the cases cited
by counsel for the appellant as well as for the respondent had to do with the
purported arrest of an execution debtor under a writ of capeas ad
satisfaciendum usually known as a ca. sa. being the writ directed to
a sheriff to take into custody an execution debtor and: “… him safely keep so
that the sheriff may have the body before the High Court of Justice to satisfy
the execution creditor the amount payable under the judgment order.”: Halsbury,
3rd ed., vol. 16, para. 98. This was a procedure frequently invoked before
imprisonment for debt was abolished by the Debtors Act, (1869) 32-33
Vict., c. 62, s. 4. The ca. sa. writ is still theoretically available
but has fallen out of use and is now regarded for practical purposes as
obsolete: Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 16, footnote (g), p. 63. In the cases cited
by counsel the action was against the sheriff either for not having taken the
debtor into custody or for having allowed the debtor to escape when he might
have been taken into custody. This was at a time when the common law favoured
the man of property and a fictional or notional idea of what constituted an
arrest under a ca. sa. writ was adopted by the courts as cases such as Nicholl
v. Darley[6] show,
and the sheriff who did not hold and keep the debtor once he touched him was
held liable to the creditor. The extent to which the courts stretched the
notional idea of arrest is illustrated by the rejection by the majority in Sandon
v. Jervis and Dain[7] of
the

[Page 53]

qualification which Bramwell B. sought to
introduce in that case. In my view Nicholl v. Darley and Sandon
v. Jervis and Dain cannot be accepted as establishing a principle of law applicable
to situations arising 100 years after the situations to which they applied
became obsolete. The dead hand of the past cannot reach that far. These
outdated procedures evolved before the organization of police forces as we now
know them and had no relation to the arrest or taking into custody of a person
charged with a criminal offence.

Accordingly in my view this case does not fall
to be decided upon the authority of cases applicable to the taking into custody
under writs of capeas ad satisfaciendum obsolete since 1869, civil in
their nature, and not involving the criminal law doctrine of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt but should be decided upon principles applicable to the
circumstances obtaining in this century and particularly since Parliament has
legislated in the very matter to cover both resisting lawful arrest and
escaping from lawful custody as two distinct and separate offences.

In the instant case the police officer, Kerr,
had a lawful right and duty to arrest Whitfield. There is no question as to the
fact that a warrant was outstanding and Kerr’s attempt to arrest was lawful.
Whitfield accordingly was under a legal obligation to submit to the lawful
arrest. It is only by the recognition of these corresponding duties and
obligations that we can avoid the notion that the person being arrested has to
be restrained physically before he can be said to be ‘arrested’. I do not see
that it should be necessary to touch or hold the person being arrested. He
must, of course, be informed that he is being arrested. If he does not submit
or tries to flee, the arresting officer may use such force as may reasonably be
necessary to detain his man having regard to the nature of the offence for
which the person is wanted. If the man flees and is not in fact detained he
cannot be said to have been

[Page 54]

in lawful custody, but that does not mean he has
not committed an offence. Parliament has legislated specifically in this
regard. In these circumstances he is clearly guilty under s. 110 (a)
which reads:

110. Every one who

(a) resists or wilfully
obstructs a public officer or peace officer in the execution of his duty or any
person lawfully acting in aid of such an officer,

* * *

is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for two years.

Parliament had to deal with two situations: (1)
the arrest or taking of a person into custody when authorized by law; (2) the
keeping of such a person in custody once he has been lawfully arrested and/or
sentenced. By creating two offences, the earlier dealing with the actual arrest
or attempt to arrest and the later dealing with escaping from lawful custody,
Parliament clearly recognized that the two situations were different and not
interchangeable and Parliament must be presumed to have known that the words
“arrest” and “custody” are not synonymous. Section 125 (a) is not an
included offence under s. 110 (a) and vice versa. This becomes very clear
from the wording of subss. (b) and (c) of s. 125  as
distinct from the whole of s. 110  which patently deals with the arrest process
itself and not with the custodial situation following upon a lawful arrest.

I would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal with
costs payable in accordance with the order for leave to appeal on the grounds
above mentioned. The Crown should charge an accused with the actual offence it
says he has committed. This is not asking too much of those in charge of
prosecutions. Here Whitfield was avoiding arrest and should have been charged
under s. 110 (a) and would have been liable to imprisonment for two
years. This is the sanction Parliament has provided for a person such as
Whitfield, who at the wheel of a motor car, shakes off an

[Page 55]

arresting officer. He is made liable to the same
punishment under s. 110 (a) as is provided for in s. 125 . Both offences are
equally grave but distinct.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Habitual
criminal—Jurisdiction—Sentence of preventive detention—Finding that accused an
habitual criminal not distur0062ed—Whether expedient to impose sentence of
preventive detention—Whether jurisdiction in Supreme Court of Canada to
entertain appeal from imposition of such sentence—Supreme Court Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 259 s. 41—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 660(1),
667(1).

The appellant, who was then 34 years of age,
was convicted on August 10, 1965, of two offences of obtaining goods by false
pretences and two offences of attempting to obtain goods by false pretences.
This was done by drawing cheques on non-existent bank accounts. The amount
involved in each offence was under $100. He was subsequently found to be an
habitual criminal and sentenced to preventive detention. His record of
convictions commenced at age 16 and all but one included an element of theft.
On June 25, 1965, the day of the expiration of a four-year sentence for theft
of an automobile, he was given money to take him from New Brunswick to
Vancouver. On his arrival in Vancouver the same day, he at once obtained a job
as a labourer and appeared to have been continuously so employed until his
conviction on August 10 of the substantive offences. The Court of Appeal, by a
majority judgment, affirmed the sentence of preventive detention. The appellant
was granted leave to appeal to this Court, where his appeal was dismissed on
June 26, 1967. In this Court, [1967] S.C.R. 554, the majority came to the
conclusion that the magistrate and the majority in the Court of Appeal had
rightly found him to be an habitual criminal, and that this Court had no
jurisdiction to substitute its opinion on the question as to whether or not it
was expedient for the protection of the public to impose a sentence of
preventive detention. The judgment rendered by the minority concluded that it
was not expedient for the protection of the public to impose such a sentence.
As the question of jurisdiction on which the decision of the majority was
founded had not been argued at the hearing of that appeal, an application for a
re-hearing was granted. At this re-hearing, which was argued on the assumption
that the appellant had rightly been found to be an habitual criminal, counsel
for the appellant and for the respondent both contended that this Court had
jurisdiction to deal with the question whether or not it was expedient for the
protection of the public to sentence the appellant to preventive detention.

Held (Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed, the
sentence of preventive detention quashed and the sentences imposed on the
convictions of the substantive offences restored.

[Page 382]

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Judson and Hall JJ.: It has not been shown that it was expedient for
the protection of the public to sentence the appellant to preventive detention.
Section 660(1) of the Code, giving jurisdiction to impose a sentence of preventive
detention, is worded permissively and is not mandatory. Since his convictions
in 1959, the appellant had not been found guilty of any violent crime. For the
crime of theft of an automobile in 1962 and the four substantive offences in
1965, he has been sentenced to severe punishment. There is some evidence of his
trying to live a normal life. It has not been satisfactorily shown that his
release at the expiration of the terms of imprisonment to which he has been
sentenced for the substantive offences will constitute a menace to society or
that the protection of the public renders it expedient that he should spend the
rest of his life in custody.

The judgment in The Queen v. MacDonald, [1965]
S.C.R. 831, does not bind this Court to hold that, unless it can say that the
finding of the Courts below that the appellant was an habitual criminal should
be set aside, this Court is without jurisdiction to interfere with the
imposition of the sentence of preventive detention. On the plain meaning of the
words of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, it seems clear that this
Court has jurisdiction to deal with the appeal on the merits. This is an appeal
for which leave was granted under s. 41 and which is not barred by subs.
(3) thereof. The appeal given by s. 667(1) raises only one question for
decision, that is whether the sentence of preventive detention is to be
sustained or set aside. The answer to the question whether this Court has
jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal sought to be brought before it
depends on the subject matter of the appeal and on the terms of the statute
conferring jurisdiction.

Per Spence J.:
Accepting the view that it was not expedient for the protection of the public
to sentence the accused to preventive detention, an appeal lies to this Court
from that finding.

This is an appeal from a decision which has
resulted in the appellant being sentenced to preventive detention. The matters
considered are not the matters considered in an ordinary appeal from sentence
but resemble the consideration of an appeal from conviction. Under s. 667
of the Code, the provincial Court of Appeal must find affirmatively as to three
elements before it may affirm the sentence of preventive detention. These
elements are: (1) conviction on the substantive offence; (ii) that the accused
is an habitual criminal; (iii) that it is expedient to sentence him to
preventive detention. The leave to appeal to this Court, which was properly
granted under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, brings forward for
consideration the same three elements and it is the right and the duty of this
Court acting within its jurisdiction to consider all three elements. In doing
so, this Court would not be going beyond its jurisdiction.

Per Pigeon J.:
It has not been shown that it was expedient for the protection of the public to
sentence the appellant to preventive detention.

This Court has jurisdiction under s. 41
of the Supreme Court Act to hear appeals by leave in the case of persons
sentenced to preventive detention, and this jurisdiction is not restricted to a
review of the finding that the accused is an habitual criminal.

[Page 383]

Per Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: Once the finding as to the
status of the accused as an habitual criminal is not in issue, this Court has
no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against the sentence of preventive
detention. There is a clear line of authority which establishes that this Court
has no jurisdiction to. entertain an appeal with respect to sentences for an
indictable offence. No appeal lies to this Court from the determination that it
is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence the accused to
preventive detention. Parkes v. The Queen, [1955] S.C.R. 134, is not an
authority for the submission that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain an
appeal from the sentence of preventive detention in isolation from the finding
as to status. The only reported case in this Court in which an appeal has been
taken from a sentence of preventive detention when the finding as to status of
the accused was not in issue is the case of The Queen v. MacDonald, [1965]
S.C.R. 831. In that case the majority of the Court decided that there was no
jurisdiction under s. 41 to entertain an appeal from a sentence of
preventive detention alone. There is no distinction between the present case
and the case of The Queen v. MacDonald in so far as the question of
jurisdiction is concerned.

L’appelant, alors âgé de 34 ans, a été
déclaré coupable le 10 août 1965, de deux infractions d’obtention de biens par
faux semblant et de deux infractions de tentative de pareille obtention. Il
s’agissait de chèques tirés sur un compte de banque qui n’existait pas. Le
montant en jeu dans chaque infraction était de moins de $100. L’appelant a été
subséquemment déclaré repris de justice et condamné à la détention préventive.
Son dossier de condamnations commence à l’âge de 16 ans et toutes, sauf une,
contiennent un élément de vol. Le 25 juin 1965, le jour de l’expiration d’une
sentence de quatre ans pour vol d’automobile, il a reçu une somme d’argent pour
se rendre du Nouveau-Brunswick à Vancouver. A son arrivée à Vancouver le même
jour, il a immédiatement obtenu un emploi comme manœuvre et il paraît avoir été
continuellement employé de la sorte jusqu’au jour de sa condamnation le 10 août
pour les infractions sur lesquelles la sentence de détention préventive est
basée. La Cour d’appel, par un jugement majoritaire, a confirmé cette sentence.
L’appelant a obtenu permission d’appeler devant cette Cour, mais son appel a
été rejeté le 26 juin 1967 par un jugement majoritaire statuant, [1967] R.C.S.
554, que le magistrat et les juges majoritaires en Cour d’appel avaient eu
raison de déclarer qu’il était un repris de justice, et que cette Cour n’avait
pas juridiction pour substituer son opinion sur la question de savoir s’il
était opportun pour la protection du public de lui imposer une sentence de détention
préventive. L’opinion de la minorité dans cette Cour était qu’il n’y avait pas
lieu de juger opportun pour la protection du public d’imposer une telle
sentence. Vu que la question de juridiction sur laquelle la décision
majoritaire était basée n’avait

[Page 384]

pas été discutée lors de l’audition de
l’appel, une requête pour nouvelle audition a été accordée. Lors de cette
nouvelle audition, on a pris pour acquis que l’appelant avait été à bon droit
déclaré repris de justice, et les avocats de l’appelant et de l’intimée ont
tous deux soutenu que cette Cour avait juridiction pour considérer s’il était
opportun pour la protection du public d’imposer à l’appelant une sentence de
détention préventive.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être accueilli, la sentence de détention préventive doit être annulée et
les sentences imposées pour les infractions sur lesquelles elle est basée
doivent être rétablies, les Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland et Ritchie étant
dissidents.

Le Juge en
Chef Cartwright et les Juges Judson et Hall: Il n’a pas été démontré qu’il
était opportun pour la protection du public de condamner l’appelant à la
détention préventive. Le texte de l’art. 660(1) du Code, qui confère la
juridiction pour imposer une sentence de détention préventive, est permissif et
non pas obligatoire. Depuis ses condamnations en 1959, l’appelant n’a été
trouvé coupable d’aucun crime de violence. Pour le vol d’une automobile en 1962
et pour les quatre infractions en 1965 sur lesquelles la sentence est basée, il
a reçu des punitions sévères. Il y a une certaine preuve qu’il essaie de vivre
une vie normale. Il n’a pas été démontré d’une façon satisfaisante que sa mise
en liberté à l’expiration de l’emprisonnement. auquel il a été condamné pour
les infractions dont il s’agit aurait pour effet de constituer. une menace à la
société ou que pour la protection du public il serait opportun qu’il passe le
reste de sa vie en détention.

Le jugement dans The Queen v. MacDonald, [1965]
R.C.S. 831, n’oblige pas cette Cour à décider que, à moins qu’elle puisse dire
que la déclaration des Cours inférieures à l’effet que l’appelant est un repris
de justice doit être mise de côté, elle n’a pas juridiction pour intervenir
dans l’imposition de la sentence de détention préventive. Les mots de l’art. 41
de la Loi sur la Cour suprême, dans leur sens ordinaire, semblent
indiquer clairement que cette Cour a juridiction pour juger l’appel sur le
fond. Il s’agit d’un appel admis par permission sous l’art. 41 et qui n’est pas
prohibé par l’alinéa (3) de cet article. L’appel visé par l’art. 667(1)
requiert la solution d’une seule question, savoir si la sentence de détention
préventive doit être confirmée ou mise de côté. La juridiction de cette Cour
pour entendre et juger un appel que l’on tente de lui faire entendre dépend de
la matière de l’appel et des termes du statut donnant la juridiction.

Le Juge
Spence: S’il n’était pas opportun pour la protection du public de condamner
l’appelant à la détention préventive, cette Cour a juridiction pour entendre un
appel de cette décision.

Il s’agit d’un appel d’une décision qui a eu
pour résultat d’imposer à l’appelant une sentence de détention préventive. Les
questions à étudier ne sont pas les questions à considérer dans un appel
ordinaire d’une sentence mais ressemblent à un appel d’une déclaration de
culpabilité. Avant qu’elle puisse confirmer la sentence de détention préventive
sous l’art. 667 du Code, la Cour provinciale d’appel doit en venir à une
conclusion affirmative sur trois éléments qui sont: (i) la déclaration de
culpabilité; (ii) le fait que l’accusé est un repris de

[Page 385]

justice; (iii) l’opportunité de lui imposer
une sentence de détention préventive. La permission d’appeler devant cette
Cour, qui a été à bon droit accordée sous l’art. 41 de la Loi sur la Cour
suprême, requiert la considération de ces mêmes trois éléments, et c’est le
droit et le devoir de cette Cour agissant selon sa juridiction de considérer
chacun d’eux. En ce faisant, cette Cour n’agit pas au-delà de sa juridiction.

Le Juge
Pigeon: Il n’a pas été démontré qu’il était opportun pour la protection du
public d’imposer à l’appelant une sentence de détention préventive.

Cette Cour a juridiction, en vertu de l’art.
41 de la Loi sur la Cour suprême, pour entendre, avec permission, un
appel dans le cas de personnes condamnées à la détention préventive, et cette
juridiction n’est pas limitée à des questions touchant la déclaration que
l’accusé est un repris de justice.

Les Juges
Fauteux, Abbott, Martland et Ritchie, dissidents: Lorsqu’il n’est pas
question de l’état de l’accusé comme repris de justice, cette Cour n’a pas la
juridiction pour entendre un appel de la sentence de détention préventive. Il
est clairement établi par la jurisprudence que cette Cour n’a pas juridiction
pour entendre un appel d’une sentence imposée pour un acte criminel. Aucun
appel ne peut être entendu par cette Cour concernant la décision qu’il est
opportun pour la protection du public d’imposer une sentence de détention
préventive. La cause de Parkes v. The Queen, [1955] R.C.S. 134, ne
démontre pas que cette Cour a juridiction pour entendre un appel d’une sentence
de détention préventive autrement que sur la déclaration que l’accusé est un
repris de justice. La cause de The Queen v. MacDonald, [1965] R.C.S.
831, est la seule décision rapportée où un appel d’une sentence de détention
préventive a été porté devant cette Cour alors que la déclaration sur l’état de
l’accusé n’était pas en litige. La majorité de la Cour a alors décidé qu’elle
n’avait pas juridiction sous l’art. 41 pour entendre un appel d’une sentence de
détention préventive. Il n’y a aucune distinction à faire entre le cas présent
et la cause de The Queen v. MacDonald en autant que la question de
juridiction est concernée.

respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Judson
and Hall JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—This appeal is brought,
pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia affirming, by a majority, a sentence of preventive
detention imposed on the appellant by His Worship Magistrate G.L. Levey at
Vancouver on June 14, 1966. Bull J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the
appeal, quashed the sentence of preventive detention and restored the sentences
imposed in respect of convictions of four substantive offences in lieu of which
the sentence appealed against had been imposed.

The appeal was first argued on June 5, 1967,
before a Court of five judges and on June 26, 1967, the appeal[1] was dismissed by a majority. My brothers
Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie were of opinion (i) that the learned magistrate
and the majority in the Court of Appeal were right in finding the appellant to
be an habitual criminal and (ii) that this Court had no jurisdiction to
substitute its opinion for that of the Court of Appeal on the question as to
whether or not it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence
the appellant to preventive detention. My brother Judson and I were of opinion
that it was unnecessary to decide whether the appellant was rightly found to be
an habitual criminal because, on the assumption that he was, it was not
expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive
detention.

As the question of jurisdiction on which the
decision of the majority was founded had not been raised by counsel or the
Court at the hearing of the appeal, an application for a re-hearing was granted
and the appeal was argued before the full Court on December 11, 1967. At this
time counsel for the appellant and for the respondent both contended that, on
the assumption that the appellant was rightly found to be an habitual criminal,
this Court has jurisdiction to deal with the question whether or not it was
expedient for the protection of the public to sentence the

[Page 387]

appellant to preventive detention; counsel for
the respondent submitted that on the merits this question should be answered in
the affirmative and the appeal dismissed.

The appellant was born on March 3, 1932.

The evidence as to his past record is accurately
summarized by Bull J.A. as follows:

Just after reaching 16 years of age, the
appellant was convicted of a charge of taking an automobile without consent and
stealing four pairs of shoes a day or so earlier, and was fined $20.00 and
given a suspended sentence, respectively. Three years later, at the age of 19
years, he was convicted of breaking and entering a drug store and was sentenced
to two years in the penitentiary. Upon being released from this imprisonment
about 19 months later, he joined the Canadian Army and served with it in Canada
and Korea for about 2 years until he was dishonourably discharged shortly after
having been convicted in Montreal of two charges of robbery and sentenced to
five years on each to run concurrently. On his release at expiration of
sentence the appellant had odd jobs in and around his home area in New
Brunswick for about five months, when he again fell foul of the law. This time
he was convicted on four charges of breaking and entering business premises
within the space of a few days, and was awarded various sentences to run
concurrently, of which the longest was three years in the penitentiary. The
appellant was released from imprisonment on November 19, 1961, and worked
fairly steadily with some success and employer approval at labouring work for
about ten months when he was convicted of theft of a U-Drive automobile which
he had rented. For this offence he was sentenced to four years in the
penitentiary. On his release from this sentence in June, 1965, the somewhat
unusual events occurred which led to his commission of, and convictions on, the
substantive offences. On the day of release and provided with funds and an
airline ticket by his mother in the Maritimes, he flew to Vancouver claiming to
be filled with the admirable resolution to there start a new honest life away
from the associations which he claimed had always led him into trouble.
Although there were many inconsistencies in his evidence as to exactly what the
appellant did for the next few weeks, it does appear quite clear and
uncontradicted that promptly after arrival he did get a job with a wrecking
company, which lasted about two weeks, followed by a job with a salvage company
commencing on July 12, 1965. On July 9, 1965, however, he purchased $41.85, and
attempted to purchase a further $91.37, worth of goods from a department store
with cheques signed in his own name but drawn on a non-existent account in a
local bank. The appellant said the account number used was that of an account
that he had in the same bank in Fredericton, N.B., but quite properly little
credence was given to this excuse. It is clear that some at least of the goods
in question were working clothes and gear needed by the appellant in the new
job he was just starting. On the same day, allegedly to replace one stolen from
his room, the appellant attempted to buy a watch from a jeweller with a cheque
for $83.99 drawn on the same nonexistent account. The appellant was released on
bail, went back to work and about ten days later obtained a pipe and some
tobacco from a tobacconist with a cheque for $12.74 drawn on a fictitious
account. The appellant was convicted of these four depredations on August 10,
1965, and given concurrent sentences aggregating 3 years. Apparently,
notwithstanding these shopping sprees, the appellant did have gainful
employment for substantially the whole time from his release on June 25,
1965,

[Page 388]

to his conviction on August 10, 1965. There
was no evidence adduced that during this last period of freedom the appellant
associated with criminals or undesirable characters.

I do not find it necessary to choose between the
conflicting views of Bull J.A. and of the majority in the Court of Appeal as to
whether on the evidence the finding that the appellant is an habitual criminal
can safely be upheld; for the purpose of these reasons I will assume that it
can.

On the assumption that the finding that the
appellant is an habitual criminal should not be disturbed, I have reached the
conclusion that it has not been shewn that it is expedient for the protection
of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.

Whether or not in any particular case it is
expedient to so sentence a person found to be an habitual criminal is a
question of fact or perhaps a question of mixed law and fact; it is certainly
not a question of law alone. But, leave to appeal to this Court having been
granted, it is clear that we have jurisdiction to deal with questions of fact.

In Mulcahy v. The Queen[2], this Court in a unanimous judgment
expressly adopted the reasons of MacQuarrie J. who had dissented from the
judgment of the majority in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (in banco) and set
aside the sentence of preventive detention which had been imposed upon the
appellant. The dissenting judgment of MacQuarrie J. is reported in 42 C.R. at
page 1.

In that case the record shewed that, prior to
being convicted of the substantive offence, the appellant had been convicted
between 1941 and 1961 on nineteen occasions of offences, for which he had been
sentenced to a total of fifteen years and six months in the penitentiary and
twenty-six months in prison. None of his convictions were for crimes of violence;
six were for breaking and entering and the remainder for theft or having
possession of stolen goods.

MacQuarrie J. based his judgment on two distinct
grounds. The first of these was that there was no evidence to support a finding
that the appellant was leading persistently a criminal life. The second ground
was expressed as follows:

While I do not attempt to minimize the
record of the appellant, a perusal of it (apart from the lack of evidence to
justify finding him to be

[Page 389]

leading persistently a criminal life)
indicates that he is not the type of person of whom it can properly be said “it
is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive
detention”. In my opinion the Crown has failed to prove that (even although the
accused was leading persistently a criminal life) a sentence of preventive
detention was expedient for the protection of the public.

In the case at bar no exception can be taken to
the terms in which the learned Magistrate instructed himself as to the applicable
principles of law. Following the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia in Regina v. Channing[3], he
expressed the view that in order to impose a sentence of preventive detention
he must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was leading
persistently a criminal life, that the decision of each case must depend on its
own particular facts, (i) as to whether the finding that a person is an
habitual criminal should be made and, (ii) as to whether that finding having
been made, a sentence of preventive detention should be imposed. It is, I
think, implicit in the last sentence of his reasons, read in the light of his
reference to Regina v. Charnning, that he held it necessary that he
should be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on the second of these points as
well as on the first. The sentence to which I refer reads as follows:

I find that the Crown has proved beyond all
reasonable doubt, in my mind, that it is expedient for the protection of the
public to sentence you to preventive detention, and I so do.

In the Court of Appeal Lord J.A., with whom
McFarlane J.A. expressed substantial agreement, dealt with this branch of the
matter as follows:

Nor can I say that he reached the wrong
opinion in finding it expedient for the protection of the public that the
appellant be sentenced to preventive detention.

Bull J.A., having held that the finding that the
appellant was an habitual criminal could not safely be upheld, did not find it
necessary to deal with this question.

In Regina v. Channing, supra, Sheppard
J.A., with whom Norris, Lord and MacLean JJ.A. agreed and Davey J.A. agreed “in
general”, said at page 110:

In the case at bar, the crown must assume
the onus of proving that it is expedient for the protection of the public that
the accused be

[Page 390]

sentenced beyond that imprisonment for the
substantive offence: Mulcahy v. Reg., and that must be proven beyond a
reasonable doubt: Parkes v. Reg. and Kirkland v. Reg.

In the same case at page 101, Davey J.A. said:

Likewise it is undesirable for us to lay
down detailed tests of the sufficiency of evidence to prove either that an
accused is a habitual criminal or that it is expedient for the protection of
the public that he be sentenced to preventive detention. All that is required is
that the evidence be sufficient to prove both these essential matters beyond a
reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of the magistrate or trial judge.

As already indicated, I am dealing with this
appeal on the assumption that the finding that the appellant is an habitual
criminal should not be disturbed and the question to be answered is therefore
whether it can properly be said “that because the accused is an habitual
criminal, it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to
preventive detention”.

The answer to this question depends upon the
application to the facts of the case of the words of s. 660(1)  of the Criminal
Code  which reads as follows:

660.(1) Where an accused has been convicted
of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of
preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that might be imposed for
the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed for such offence, or
in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such offence if the sentence
has expired, if

(a) the accused is found to be an
habitual criminal, and

(b) the court is of the
opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for
the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.

It will be observed that the section is
worded permissively. Even if both conditions (a) and (b) are
fulfilled the Court is not bound to impose the sentence of preventive
detention. The wording may be contrasted with that used by Parliament in
s. 661(3):

(3) Where the court finds that the accused
is a dangerous sexual offender it shall, notwithstanding anything in this Act
or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, impose upon the accused a
sentence of preventive detention…

The wording of s. 660 may also be compared
with that of the corresponding sub-section in the Criminal Justice Act,
1948, of the United Kingdom, 11 and 12 George VI, c. 58, s. 21(2) of
which reads as follows:

(2) Where a person who is not less than
thirty years of age—

(a) is convicted on indictment of an
offence punishable with imprisonment for a term of two years or more; and

[Page 391]

(b) has been convicted on indictment
on at least three previous occasions since he attained the age of seventeen of
offences punishable on indictment with such a sentence, and was on at least two
of those occasions sentenced to Borstal training, imprisonment or corrective
training;

then, if the court is satisfied that it is
expedient for the protection of the public that he should be detained in
custody for a substantial time, followed by a period of supervision if released
before the expiration of his sentence, the court may pass, in lieu of any other
sentence, a sentence of preventive detention for such term of not less than
five or more than fourteen years as the court may determine.

I do not consider that the use of the words “The
court is of the opinion” in s. 660(1)  (b) of the Criminal Code  prevents
the Court of Appeal or this Court from substituting its opinon for that of the
learned Magistrate. That course has been followed in Mulcahy v. The Queen,
supra.

In Regina v. Channing, supra, after
stating that what is expedient for the protection of the public is a question
of fact in each case, Sheppard J.A. continued at page 109:

Moreover, as the sentence for the
substantive offence will have considered the protection of the public as one of
the elements, it would follow that preventive detention should not be imposed
unless the crown has proven that the protection of the public is not
sufficiently safeguarded by sentence for the substantive offence, but does
require some additional protection involved in a sentence of preventive
detention: Mulcahy v. Reg., supra; Reg. v. Rose, supra, to the
extent of making that sentence expedient for the protection of the public.

and at page 110 he quoted with approval the
following passage in the reasons of Currie J.A. in Harnish v. The Queen[4]:

The real, essential principle of the
preventive detention provisions of the Criminal Code , s. 660 , and of the
Prevention of Crime Act, 1908, 8 Edw. VII, ch. 59, is the
protection of the public. It is not enough that the accused is merely
anti-social, or is a nuisance, or that it is a convenience to the police to
have a person removed to a penitentiary.

In R. v. Churchill[5], Lord Goddard, giving the judgment
of the Court of Criminal Appeal, said at page 110:

The object of preventive detention is to
protect the public from men or women who have shown by their previous history
that they are a menace to society while they are at large.

and at page 112:

As we have already said, when such
sentences have to be passed the time for punishment has gone by, because it has
had no effect. It has become a matter of putting a man where he can no longer
prey upon society even though his depredations may be of a comparatively small
character, as in the case of habitual sneak thieves.

[Page 392]

In considering the decisions in England it must
always be borne in mind that the maximum sentence of preventive detention which
can be imposed there is fourteen years and that, as stated by Lord Goddard on
the page last referred to, in the great majority of cases which had come before
that Court the sentence passed had been one of eight years. In Canada if the
sentence is passed at all it must decree imprisonment for the remainder of the
prisoner’s life subject to the possibility of his being allowed out on licence
if so determined by the parole authorities, a licence which may be revoked
without the intervention of any judicial tribunal.

Since his convictions in 1959, the appellant has
been guilty of no violent crime. For the crime of theft of an automobile in
1962 and the four substantive offences in 1965, which involved comparatively
trifling sums, he has been sentenced to severe punishment; there is some evidence
of his trying to live a normal life; he is now 35 years of age. While I cannot
say, in the words used by Currie J.A., that he is merely a nuisance I am not
satisfied that his release at the expiration of the terms of imprisonment to
which he has been sentenced for the substantive offences will, to use the words
of Lord Goddard, constitute a menace to society or that the protection of the
public renders it expedient that he should spend the rest of his life in
custody. Any doubt that I feel in this case arises from the fact that I am
differing from the learned Magistrate and the majority in the Court of Appeal.
In a case in which the consequences of an adverse decision are so final and so
disastrous for the man concerned I think that doubts should be resolved in his
favour.

For the above reasons I have reached the
conclusion that I would dispose of the appeal as Bull J.A. would have done
unless the view suggested by some members of the Court, although neither put
forward nor supported by either counsel, compels us to hold that we are without
jurisdiction.

The suggestion, as I understand it, is that the
reasons of Ritchie J. speaking for a majority of the Court in The Queen v.
MacDonald[6], bind
us to hold that, unless we can

[Page 393]

say that the finding of the Courts below that
the appellant is an habitual criminal should be set aside, we are without
jurisdiction to interfere with the imposition of the sentence of preventive
detention.

When a question is raised as to the jurisdiction
of this Court it is well to look first at the provisions of the Statute which
confer the jurisdiction which the parties seek to invoke; in the case at bar
these are contained in s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act which reads:

41.(1) Subject to subsection (3), an
appeal lies to the Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or
other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge
thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be
appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme
Court has been refused by any other court.

(2) Leave to appeal under this
section may be granted during the period fixed by section 64 or
within thirty days thereafter or within such further extended time as the
Supreme Court or a judge may either before or after the expiry of the said
thirty days fix or allow.

(3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies
under this section from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting
or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable
offence or, except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an
offence other than an indictable offence.

(4) Whenever the Supreme Court has granted
leave to appeal the Supreme Court or a judge may, notwithstanding anything in
this Act, extend the time within which the appeal may be allowed.

On the plain meaning of the words of this
section it seems clear that the Court has jurisdiction. The appeal is
brought, pursuant to leave duly granted by this Court, from the judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia affirming the imposition by the learned
magistrate of a sentence of preventive detention. This is a final judgment of
the highest court of final resort in the province in which judgment can be had
in this particular case. This Court is not deprived of jurisdiction by the
terms of subs. 3 of s. 41 for the judgment of the Court of Appeal is not
one acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or
acquittal of an indictable offence or of an offence other than an indictable
offence. The jurisprudence in this Court on this point is settled and has been
applied consistently since the decisions in Brusch v. The Queen[7] and Parkes v. The Queen[8].

[Page 394]

The contrary view is said to be founded, as
mentioned above, on the reasons of my brother Ritchie, concurred in by a
majority of the Court in The Queen v. MacDonald, supra. In approaching a
consideration of that decision it is well to bear in mind the rule, often
stated, that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides; vide Quinn
v. Leatham[9], per
Lord Halsbury at 506.

While in The Queen v. MacDonald, supra, I
agreed with the conclusion of the majority that the appeal should be quashed it
was for reasons differently expressed. The sole question relating to our
jurisdiction which was raised for decision in that appeal was whether the
Attorney‑General had a right of appeal to this Court from the order of a
Court of Appeal expressly affirming a finding that an accused was an habitual
criminal but deciding that the sentence of preventive detention imposed upon
him should be set aside. No question arose as to the nature or extent of an
accused’s right of appeal.

The formal order of the Court of Appeal in that
case read as follows:

THIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the
appeal of the above-named Appellant from the finding that the Appellant is an
habitual criminal be and the same is hereby dismissed, the Appeal of the
above-named Appellant from the sentence of preventive detention imposed on him
be and the same is hereby allowed, the sentence of preventive detention imposed
on him as aforesaid be and the same is hereby set aside, and pursuant to
section 667  of the Criminal Code , a sentence of imprisonment in Oakalla
Prison Farm, Burnaby, British Columbia, for a term of one year be and the same
is hereby imposed in respect of the said conviction by Magistrate L.H. Jackson
entered on the 20th day of May 1964 on the above-described charge, such
sentence to run from the 20th day of May, 1964.

This may be contrasted with the order of the
Court of Appeal in the case at bar, the operative part of which reads:

THIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE THAT the
said Appeal of the above‑named Appellant from the sentence of preventive
detention imposed on him be and the same is hereby dismissed;

With respect, I think that the formal order of
the Court of Appeal in The Queen v. MacDonald, supra, was improperly
drawn. The Criminal Code  gives no right of appeal from the finding that
the appellant is an habitual criminal.

[Page 395]

Such a finding unless followed by the imposition
of a sentence of preventive detention is brutum fulmen. This is made
plain by the reasons of Bird C.J.B.C. speaking for the Unanimous Court of
Appeal in Regina v. MacNeill.[10] It is
a misconception to regard the appeal given by s. 667(1) as raising two
matters for decision. There is only one question to be answered, that is
whether the sentence of preventive detention is to be sustained or set aside.
It may be set aside for various reasons, for example (i) because the Crown has
not satisfied the onus of proving that the appellant is an habitual criminal or
(ii) because it has not satisfied the onus of proving that it is expedient for
the protection of the public that a sentence of preventive detention be imposed
or (iii) for both of these reasons or (iv) because of some technical defect or
illegality in the proceedings; this list is not necessarily exhaustive. It
appears to me to be a novel proposition that the answer to the question whether
the Court has jurisdiction to entertain and decide an appeal may depend on the
reasons which it assigns for allowing or dismissing it.

In my view the present case is distinguishable
from The Queen v. MacDonald, supra. In the case at bar the appeal to the
Court of Appeal was and the appeal to this Court is simply from the imposition
of the sentence, and this is as it should be for, as pointed out above, the
only right of appeal given to a person sentenced to preventive detention is
that set out in s. 667(1)  of the Criminal Code :

667.(1) A person who is sentenced to
preventive detention under this Part may appeal to the Court of Appeal against
that sentence on any ground of law or fact or mixed law and fact.

It is a trite observation that an appeal is from
the judgment pronounced in the Court appealed from and not from its reasons. It
appears to me that the existence of our jurisdiction cannot depend upon the
grounds upon which we think the sentence should be upheld or set aside. Our
jurisdiction to set aside the sentence in the case at bar upon the grounds set
out in the reasons of Bull J.A. could not be questioned; in my opinion, it
would be consistent with neither principle nor authority to hold that we cease
to have jurisdiction because, as it appears to me, the same result should be
reached by a different line of reasoning.

[Page 396]

At the risk of appearing repetitious, I wish to
emphasize that the answer to the question whether we have jurisdiction to hear
and determine an appeal sought to be brought before us depends on the subject
matter of the appeal and on the terms of the Statute conferring jurisdiction.
The question arises in limine and can and should be answered before we
enter upon the merits of the appeal. Either we have or have not jurisdiction to
decide the appeal; it is, in my view, a misconception to suggest that our
jurisdiction, if we have it, can be lost because we would allow or dismiss the
appeal for one reason rather than another. We have held often enough in dealing
with the question whether an inferior tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction
that we cannot say it has jurisdiction to decide a question rightly but not to
decide it wrongly.

I have reached the conclusion that the judgment
of the majority in The Queen v. MacDonald, supra, does not bind us to say
that we are without jurisdiction in the case at bar and I am satisfied that we
have jurisdiction to deal with the appeal on the merits.

I would dispose of the appeal as Bull J.A. would
have done, that is to say, I would allow the appeal, quash the sentence of
preventive detention and restore the sentences imposed on the convictions of
the four substantive offences.

The judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and
Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J. (dissenting):—I have had the
advantage of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by the Chief Justice in
which he has described the circumstances giving rise to the re-hearing of this
appeal and concluded that this Court has jurisdiction to hear it and that is
should be allowed, but I remain in agreement with the reasons for judgment
rendered by Martland J. at the first hearing in which he says that:

Once the finding as to the status of the
accused as an habitual criminal is not an issue, this Court has no jurisdiction
to entertain an appeal against sentence.

As has been pointed out by the Chief Justice, if
there be jurisdiction in this Court to hear an appeal from the imposition of a
sentence of preventive detention, imposed “in lieu of any other sentence that
may be imposed” for an

[Page 397]

indictable offence pursuant to the provisions of
s. 660(1)  of the Criminal Code , then that jurisdiction must be
found in s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act (hereinafter called “the
Act”), and it accordingly appears to me to be of first importance to consider
the jurisprudence of this Court governing the interpretation of s. 41 in
relation to appeals against sentence.

The first case in which it was contended that
s. 41 of the Act gave the Court jurisdiction to consider an appeal against
sentence was Goldhar v. The Queen[11],
in which Mr. Justice Fauteux, after a detailed review of the
provisions of the statute, concluded, at page 71 that:

Under the former Code, appeals against
sentence have always been left to the final determination of the provincial
courts and there is nothing, under the new Code or s. 41 of the Supreme
Court Act, indicating a change of policy in the matter, with respect to
indictable offences.

The Court is without jurisdiction to
entertain the present application which I would dismiss.

These reasons for judgment were reaffirmed in Paul
v. The Queen[12], where
Taschereau J. (as he then was) said:

It was held in Goldhar v. The Queen that
if an appeal from a sentence was not given by 41(3), nor the Criminal Code , we
could not find any authority in 41(1) to review the sentence imposed by the
Courts below.

In that case it was stated by Fauteux J.:

…that in order to determine if a convicted
person could appeal against a sentence in a matter of indictable offence it was
not permitted to look at s. 41(1) for authority to intervene but only to
the Criminal Code  which does not permit an appeal against sentence.

The effect of these decisions appears to me to
have been accurately summarized by Mr. Justice Fauteux in rendering the
judgment of the Court in The Queen v. Alepin Freres Ltee. et al[13], in which case the Crown had, with
leave granted under s. 41, launched an appeal against the finding of
the Court of Appeal on the question of whether the Court of Queen’s Bench or
the magistrate had jurisdiction to impose sentences, and after quoting ss.
41(1) and 41(3), Mr. Justice Fauteux went on to say:

It is clear from the terms of
subsection (3) that, unless the judgment sought to be appealed is a
judgment ‘acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction
or acquittal’ of either an indictable offence

[Page 398]

or an offence other than an indictable
offence, there is no jurisdiction in this Court under that subsection to
entertain this appeal. The judgment here sought to be appealed does not come
within that description. It is not a judgment related to an acquittal or a
conviction of an offence and, while an important question of jurisdiction is
involved therein, this question does not relate to an acquittal or a conviction
within the meaning of subsection (3) but to sentence. Neither can
jurisdiction of this Court be found in subsection (1). The general
proposition that matters which are not mentioned in s. 41(3) must be held
to be comprised in s. 41(1), with the consequence that this Court would
have jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a judgment of a nature similar to
the one here considered, is ruled out by what was said by this Court in Golkar
v. The Queen and Paul v. The Queen. It may be a matter of regret
that this Court has no jurisdiction to decide the important question which gave
rise to conflicting opinions in the Court below, but strong as my views may be
with respect to that question, I am clearly of opinion that this Court has no
jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.

There is accordingly a clear line of authority
which establishes that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal
with respect to sentences for an indictable offence.

In the present case like the Chief Justice, I
proceed on the assumption that the finding that the appellant is an habitual
criminal should not be disturbed, and that the sole question to be determined
is whether an appeal lies to this Court from the determination made by the
Court of first instance, in conformity with the provisions of s. 660(1)  (b)
of the Criminal Code , that “The Court is of the opinion that because the
accused is a habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection of the
public to sentence him to preventive detention”.

The concept of imposing preventive detention in
the case of habitual criminals was first introduced into our Criminal Code  by
Chapter 55 of the Statutes of Canada, 1947, which enacted sections 575A  to
575H  under the heading “PART X(A) HABITUAL CRIMINALS”, where it was provided
that a statement that the accused was an habitual criminal was to be added to
the indictment after the charge for the substantive offence and further
provided that the offender should first be arraigned on the substantive offence
and if found guilty the judge or jury were charged to inquire whether or not he
was an habitual criminal. Section 575c (4) of the same statute provided, in
part, that:

(4) A person shall not be tried on a charge
of being a habitual criminal unless

(a) the Attorney General of the
Province in which the accused is to be tried consents thereto; and

[Page 399]

(b) not less than seven days’
notice has been given by the proper officer of the court by which the offender
is to be tried and the notice to the offender shall specify the previous
convictions and the other grounds upon which it is intended to found the
charge.

It will thus be seen that in the 1947 statute
the allegation that an offender was an habitual criminal was included in the
indictment and was regarded as being in the nature of an additional charge.
This is made clear by the case of The King v. Robinson[14] which was decided under the 1947
Code and is illustrative of the way in which s. 575c was applied by the
Crown authorities. In that case, as Mr. Justice Fauteux said at page 523:

…Each of the respondents was separately
indicted on two counts: one being that, at some definite time in 1950, in the
province of British Columbia, he was found in unlawful possession of drugs,
under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929 as amended, and the second
one charging him to be a habitual criminal within the meaning of the provisions
of Part X(A) of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

The appeal in the Robinson case, supra,
raised a question of law as to the meaning to be attached to the provisions
of s. 575c and the jurisdiction of this Court was not in question, the
matter being treated in all respects and by all concerned as if it were an
appeal from a conviction for an indictable offence. This is no doubt explained
by the fact that s. 575E  of the Criminal Code  at that time provided
that:

A person convicted and sentenced to
preventive detention, may appeal against his conviction and sentence, and
the provisions of this Act relating to an appeal from a conviction for an
indictable offence shall be applicable thereto.

The italics are my own.

This meant that the provisions of s. 1025
of the Code providing for an appeal to this Court from a conviction for an
indictable offence were applicable to “a person convicted and sentenced to
preventive detention” and accordingly that such an appeal would lie “on a question
of law” if leave to appeal were granted by a judge of this Court. That this is
the meaning which was attached to s. 575E  is made plain from a further
excerpt from the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Fauteux in the Robinson
case, supra, at page 523 where he said:

…the judgment rests on the interpretation
of the provisions of s. 575c 1(a) of Part X(A). On this point and
under the authority of s. 1025  of the Criminal Code  leave to appeal
to this Court was granted to the appellant.

[Page 400]

The next “HABITUAL CRIMINAL” case heard in this
Court was Brusch v. The Queen[15] which
was also decided under the 1947 Code and where there was a dissenting judgment
so that the appeal came here under s. 1023 of the Code which provided
that:

Any person convicted of an indictable
offence whose conviction has been affirmed on appeal taken under s. 1013
may appeal to the Supreme Court against the affirmance of such conviction on
any question of law on which there has been a dissent in the Court of Appeal.

The italics are my own.

The question of law with which the appeal was
concerned was whether the “charge” of being an habitual criminal was “a charge
of a criminal offence” entitling the accused to make an election as to his mode
of trial and the Court decided in the clearest terms that it was not such a
charge and in so doing adopted the language of Lord Reading in Rex v. Hunter[16], where he said at page 74, speaking
of s. 10 of the English Statute (The Prevention of Crimes Act, 1908,
Ch. 59) upon which Part X(A) of the 1947 Code was based:

…that to be a habitual criminal within the
meaning of the statute is not a substantive offence, but is a state of
circumstances affecting the prisoner which enables the court to pass a further
or additional sentence to that which has been already imposed;…

Although it was clearly held in the Brusch case,
supra, that “the charge” of being an habitual criminal was not a charge
for a criminal offence, it was nevertheless recognized that the penalty of
preventive detention attached to the habitual criminal finding as distinct from
the crime which was charged. As Mr. Justice Estey said at page 382:

Throughout the proceeding the offence or
crime charged is treated in every respect, even as to punishment, as
separate and distinct from being a habitual criminal.

The italics are my own.

The Criminal Code  was, however, revised
by Chapter 51 of the Statutes of Canada 1953-54 by which the provisions of Part
X(A) were recast and appeared as Part XXI under the general heading of
“PREVENTIVE DETENTION”. The new statute adopted a completely different

[Page 401]

approach to the whole question and under the new
Part XXI the practice of making “the charge” of being an habitual criminal a
part of the indictment was abolished and a procedure for making of “an application
for preventive detention” was substituted therefor. The new section 660(1) 
provided:

660(1) Where an accused has been convicted
of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of
preventive detention in addition to a sentence for the offence of which he is
convicted if

(a) the accused is found to be an
habitual criminal, and

(b) the court is of the opinion that
because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection
of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.

It is important also to notice the changes in
the section providing for appeals. The new s. 667  provided that:

667. (1) A person who is sentenced to
preventive detention under this Part may appeal to the Court of Appeal against
the sentence.

(2) The Attorney General may appeal to the
Court of Appeal against the dismissal of an application for an order under this
Part.

(3) The provisions of Part XVIII with
respect to procedure on appeals apply, mutatis mutandis, to appeals
under this section.

This is a far cry from the terms of the old
s. 575E  which, as I have said, provided that in appeals from convictions
and sentence of preventive detention

…the provisions of this Act relating to an
appeal from a conviction for an indictable offence shall be applicable thereto…

Under the new Code there was no provision for an
appeal to this Court in habitual criminal cases and accordingly in Parkes v.
The Queen[17], which
was the next such case to come here, application for leave to appeal was not
made under the Criminal Code  but was made under s. 41 of the Act on
the ground that the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario finding the
accused to be an habitual criminal was a final judgment of the highest Court of
final resort in the Province within the meaning of s. 41(1)  and that it
was not a judgment affirming conviction of an indictable offence or indeed any
offence. (See Brusch v. The Queen, supra).

In the Parkes case, supra, the
application for leave to appeal was granted and the judgment granting leave was

[Page 402]

delivered by the present Chief Justice who, at
page 135, cited the decision in Brusch v. The Queen, supra, as authority
for the proposition

…that the ‘charge’ of being an habitual
criminal is not a charge of an offence or crime but is merely an assertion of
the existence of a status or condition in the accused which enables the Court
to deal with the accused in a certain manner,…

and who then continued:

It follows from this that when His Honour
Judge Grosch decided that the applicant was an habitual criminal he was not
convicting him of an indictable offence but was deciding that his status or
condition was that of an habitual criminal. It was this decision which was
affirmed by the Court of Appeal. That such a decision is a ‘judgment’ within
the meaning of that word in s. 41(1) does not appear to me to admit of
doubt. It is indeed a ‘final judgment’ under the definition contained in
s. 2(b). It is a ‘decision which determined in whole… a substantive
right… in controversy in a judicial proceeding’—i.e., the right of an accused
to his liberty at the conclusion of whatever sentence might be imposed for the
substantive offence of theft of which he was convicted prior to the trial and
adjudication of the question whether his status was that of an habitual
criminal, or, alternatively, the right of the Crown to ask that he be
sentenced to preventive detention.

The italics are my own.

In my respectful opinion, the “substantive
right… in controversy” in an appeal from a finding that the accused has the
status of an habitual criminal is “the right of the Crown to ask that he be
sentenced to preventive detention”, because although such a sentence cannot be
awarded unless the accused has been found to be an habitual criminal it by no
means follows that the “habitual criminal” finding automatically carries with
it a sentence of preventive detention. In order to fully understand what was
decided on the motion for leave to appeal in the Parkes case, supra, it
appears to me to be desirable to quote the last three paragraphs of the reasons
for judgment where it was said:

Mr. Common’s argument that for the
purpose of determining whether or not a right of appeal is given the
adjudication that the applicant is an habitual criminal should be treated as a
conviction of an indictable offence cannot in my view be reconciled with the
decision in Brusch v. The Queen, I conclude that we have jurisdiction to
grant leave under s. 41(1).

As to the merits, it was intimated at the
hearing that it was the view of the Court that leave should be granted if we
have jurisdiction to grant it and accordingly counsel for the applicant was
directed to confine his reply to the question of jurisdiction.

[Page 403]

I would accordingly grant leave to appeal,
pursuant to the terms of s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act, from
the affirmation by the Court of Appeal of the decision of His Honour Judge
Grosch that the applicant is an habitual criminal.

I have quoted at such length from this decision
because it is the case which established the jurisdiction of this Court to hear
appeals under s. 41 of the Act in habitual criminal cases, and because it
limits the ground upon which leave was granted to the question of whether the
accused had been properly found to have the status of an habitual criminal.

The Parkes case, supra, does not
appear to me to afford any authority for the submission that this Court has
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from the sentence of preventive detention
in isolation from the finding as to status, although it might perhaps have been
contended that, as the sentence under the 1953-54 Code was specified as being
“in addition to” any sentence for the indictable offence, it was a sentence for
being an habitual criminal and was therefore not a sentence for a criminal charge
so that the reasoning in Goldhar v. The Queen, supra, did not apply to
it.

Any doubts in this latter regard have, however,
been resolved by the enactment of s. 33(2) of Chapter 43 of the Statutes
of Canada 1960-61 whereby s. 660  was amended so as to make it clear that
the sentence of preventive detention is no longer to be treated as being “in
addition to the sentence for the substantive offence”, but that it is in lieu
of such sentence. The new section reads:

660.(1) Where an accused has been convicted
of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of
preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that might be imposed for
the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed for such offence, or
in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such offence if the sentence
has expired, if

(a) the accused is found to be an
habitual criminal, and

(b) the court is of the
opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for
the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.

(2) For the purposes of
subsection (1), an accused is an habitual criminal if

(a) he has previously, since
attaining the age of eighteen years, on at least three separate occasions been
convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for
five years or more and is leading persistently a criminal life, or

(b) he has been previously
sentenced to preventive detention.

(3) At the hearing of an application under
subsection (1), the accused is entitled to be present.

[Page 404]

In the case of Gordon v. The Queen[18], Judson J. had occasion to comment
on this section and said, at page 316:

…the only sentence of preventive detention
which could be imposed in the circumstances of this case was one in lieu of
the sentence that had been imposed.

The italics are my own.

Had it not been for the decision on the
application for leave to appeal in the Parkes case, supra, it
would, I think, have been arguable that s. 660(1)  (a) and (b)
should be read together and that the section should be construed as
dealing with sentence alone and raising no separate question of the finding as
to status,, This would perhaps have been more in line with s. 667(1) which
now provides that:

667.(1) A person who is sentenced to preventive
detention under this Part may appeal to the court of appeal against that
sentence on any ground of law or fact or mixed law and fact.

This section appears to treat the whole
matter as being one of sentence, but in view of the Parkes decision and the
decisions subsequently delivered in this Court concerning the habitual criminal
finding, I do not think that our jurisdiction under s. 41 in appeals from
the findings as to status can be questioned.

I have read the habitual criminal cases which
have come to this Court since the Parkes case and it appears to me that
until the case of The Queen v. MacDonald[19], to which reference has been made
by the Chief Justice, there was no case of an appeal against sentence when the
question of the finding as to status was not in issue. In each case the appeal
was treated as an appeal from the “habitual criminal” finding and was decided
on that basis.

It is said, however, that the case of Mulcahy
v. The Queen[20] was
an exception and is to be treated as an appeal against the sentence of
preventive detention simpliciter.

In the Mulcahy case, supra, Chief
Justice Taschereau delivered the following oral judgment on behalf of this
Court:

We are all of opinion that the appeal
against the sentence of preventive detention should be allowed for the reasons
given by MacQuarrie J.

[Page 405]

and that the record should be returned to
the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco to impose a sentence for the
substantive offence of which the appellant was convicted.

Any suggestion that this decision recognized the
jurisdiction of this Court to entertain an appeal against a sentence of
preventive detention as opposed to an appeal from a finding that the
accused was an habitual criminal, must be considered in light of the dissenting
judgment of Mr. Justice MacQuarrie, which this Court adopted, in which he
said:

I would allow the appeal, quash the
finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal and the sentence that
he be held in preventive detention and impose a sentence of three years… for the
substantive offence.

The italics are my own.

With the greatest respect for those who hold a
contrary view, I do not think that if the appeal presently before us is to be
disposed of on the assumption that the finding that the appellant is an
habitual criminal should not be disturbed, it can at the same time be said that
the Mulcahy case, supra, is an applicable authority because in
that case the finding that the accused was an habitual criminal was quashed and
it therefore followed that the question of whether it was expedient for the
protection of the public to sentence the accused to preventive detention could
not arise. The fact that Mr. Justice MacQuarrie expressed the view that
the accused’s record indicated to him that he was not the type of person of
whom it could properly be said “it is expedient for the protection of the
public to sentence him to preventive detention”, is, in my view, with the
greatest respect, beside the point because once the habitual criminal finding
had been quashed, the matter of sentence was no longer in issue.

The grounds of appeal considered in this Court
in the Mulcahy case, supra, are made apparent from a
consideration of the notice of appeal and of the factum of the appellant. The
notice of appeal set forth the following grounds:

(1) That the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia
In Banco erred in failing to hold that the Crown did not prove beyond
reasonable doubt that the accused was leading persistently a criminal life as
required under Section 660(2) (a) of the Criminal Code .

[Page 406]

(2) That the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia
In Banco erred in failing to hold that there was no evidence against the
appellant to sustain a finding that the accused was leading persistently a
criminal life as required by Section 660(2) (a).

(3) That the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia
In Banco erred in failing to hold that even although the Crown proved the
accused was leading persistently a criminal life a sentence of preventive
detention was not necessary or expedient for the protection of the public.

This Court, having found, as Mr. Justice
MacQuarrie did, in favour of the appellant on the first two grounds, it
followed that the appeal against the sentence of preventive detention must be
allowed.

It has been suggested that the fact that leave
to appeal to this Court was granted in the present case should have some
controlling effect on the decision to be made, after having heard the appeal,
with respect to our jurisdiction to entertain it. In this regard it does not
appear to me to have been the practice of this Court on hearing an appeal to
consider itself in any way affected in deciding the question of whether or not
it has jurisdiction, by the fact that leave to appeal has been granted. The
matter arose in the case of The Queen v. Warner[21], where leave had been granted and
where the Chief Justice, in the course of his reasons for judgment in the
appeal, said:

While it was announced that we had
jurisdiction, further consideration has persuaded the majority of the Court
that such is not the case.

Other illustrations which come to my mind are The
Queen v. Alepin Frères Ltée et al, supra, and The Queen v. MacDonald,
supra, in both of which cases leave to appeal had been granted and the
Court subsequently held that it had no jurisdiction.

As I have indicated, in my view the only
reported case in this Court in which an appeal has been taken from a sentence
of preventive detention when the finding as to the status of the accused was
not an issue, is the case of The Queen v. MacDonald, and in that case
the majority of the Court decided that there was no jurisdiction under
s. 41 to entertain an appeal from a sentence of preventive detention
alone. The majority opinion was there expressed in the following terms:

The sentence of preventive detention could
only have been imposed on a man who had been found to have the status of an
habitual criminal but it was the conviction of an indictable offence which
afforded the

[Page 407]

occasion for its imposition and as this
appeal is from the sentence and the finding as to status is not an issue it is
in my opinion governed by the decision of this Court in Goldhar v. The
Queen, supra.

As will be apparent from what I have said, I am
unable to appreciate any distinction between the present case and the case of The
Queen v. MacDonald in so far as the question of jurisdiction is concerned.

In my opinion the question is a fundamental one
because when such an appeal is taken against the sentence in isolation from the
finding as to status, it is nothing more than an appeal from a sentence imposed
“in lieu” of a sentence for an indictable offence and I can see no logical
distinction between the case of a man who has been sentenced to imprisonment
for life for manslaughter, in which case we would have no jurisdiction under
the Goldhar case, supra, and those which followed it, and the
case of a man sentenced to preventive detention.

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

SPENCE J.:—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons for judgment prepared by the Chief Justice and by Ritchie J. It is
my intention to follow the course which both of my learned brethren have
adopted and consider this appeal on the basis that the appellant has been
properly found to be an habitual criminal. I am also ready to accept the view
of the Chief Justice that it is not expedient for the protection of the public
to sentence the accused to preventive detention and I adopt the reasons
outlined by the Chief Justice for such conclusion.

This leaves, therefore, only the question of
whether this Court has any jurisdiction to allow the appeal for the latter
reason. It is, in my opinion, unnecessary to analyze the various decisions of
this Court referred to in the judgments of the Chief Justice and of Ritchie J.
They have performed that task most adequately and repetition would add nothing.
I propose to approach the problem in a different way and to attempt to
determine just what is the appeal which now comes before this Court.

In this case, the accused was convicted on
August 10, 1965, on four charges as outlined by the Chief Justice in his
reasons and was sentenced to terms of three years’ imprisonment upon two of
them and two years’ imprisonment on the other two, all to run concurrently. By
notice

[Page 408]

of application dated November 5, 1965, properly
served upon the accused, the prosecutor gave to the accused notice that he was
applying to have the accused found to be an habitual criminal and that,
therefore, it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to
protective detention.

On June 14, 1966, Magistrate Levey found that
the accused was an habitual criminal and that it was expedient for the
protection of the public to sentence him to protective detention, and,
therefore, imposed a sentence of preventive detention upon the accused.

By notice of application for leave to appeal and
notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, the accused
appealed “from the said finding (that he was an habitual criminal) and the said
sentence (the sentence of preventive detention)” and by a judgment of the Court
of Appeal for British Columbia pronounced on November 1, 1966:

The appeal of the above named appellant
from the sentence of preventive detention imposed on him by Magistrate G.L.
Levey at Vancouver, B.C., on the 14th June 1966…

THIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the
said appeal by the above named appellant from the sentence of preventive
detention imposed on him be and the same is hereby dismissed.

The accused obtained leave to appeal to this
Court and pursuant to such leave did appeal by notice of appeal dated January
27, 1967. That appeal purported to be “from the judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia made on the 1st day of November 1966 whereby it was
adjudged that the appeal of the above named appellant from the judgment of
Magistrate G.L. Levey made on the 14th of June 1966 finding that the appellant
was an habitual criminal and imposing the sentence of preventive detention was
dismissed…”.

As has been said by the Chief Justice, this is
an appeal for which leave was granted under the provisions of s. 41 of the
Supreme Court Act and is not one which is barred by the provisions of
subs. (3) of that section as it is not an appeal “from the judgment of any
court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or
acquittal of an indictable offence…”.

[Page 409]

Despite the appearance of being an appeal from a
sentence of preventive detention, what the appeal consisted of in the Court of
Appeal for British Columbia and what, in my view, it consists of here, is an
appeal from a decision which has resulted in the accused being sentenced to
preventive detention. I say this despite the words of s. 667(1)  of the Criminal
Code  which provides “a person who is sentenced to preventive detention
under this Part may appeal to the Court of Appeal against that sentence on any
ground of law or fact or mixed law and fact”. However much those words may
imply an ordinary appeal against sentence the matters considered in this case
and in all the other cases in the provincial courts of appeal are not the
matters considered in an ordinary appeal from sentence but on the other hand
resemble the consideration of appeals from conviction. So in s. 583 (b)
of the Criminal Code :

583. A person who is convicted by a trial
court in proceedings by indictment may appeal to the court of appeal

* *
*

(b) against the sentence passed by
the trial court, with leave of the court of appeal or a judge thereof unless
that sentence is one fixed by law.

(The underlining is my own.)

In consideration of such appeals against
sentence the court of appeal commences and should commence with the conviction
and proceed to consider whether the form and length of sentence chosen by the
trial court is appropriate to the particular circumstances of the case and the
characteristics of the convicted person.

The task of the provincial Court of Appeal in
considering an appeal under the provisions of s. 667  of the Criminal
Code  is quite different. There the Court must consider whether each element
of the finding of the Court hearing the application is supportable. Those
elements are as follows:

(a) the conviction of an indictable
offence, i.e., the substantive offence;

(b) that the accused is an habitual
criminal in that he has since attaining the age of 18 years on at least

[Page 410]

three separate and independent occasions been
convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for
five years or more, and that he is leading a persistently criminal life;

(c) that because the accused is an
habitual criminal it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence
him to preventive detention.

If the Court hearing the application found that
each of these three prerequisites was satisfied then the Court hearing the
application may impose a sentence of preventive detention. The Court hearing
the application had no alternative but to impose such sentence of preventive
detention or refuse to do so. The court hearing the application, for instance,
could not have imposed a sentence of eight years rather than the 2 or 3 years
given for the substantive offences. It is an example of a sentence fixed by law
in the words of s. 583 (b) of the Criminal Code . So the
provincial Court of Appeal when considering the appeal from the sentence of
preventive detention must consider the same three questions which I have
recited above. The provincial Court of Appeal must find affirmatively as to
these three questions before it may affirm the sentence of preventive
detention.

In my view, the leave to appeal to this Court,
which was properly granted by this Court, brings forward for consideration the
same three matters and it is the right and the duty of this Court acting within
its jurisdiction as granted by s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act to
consider all three matters. In doing so, this Court is not going beyond its
jurisdiction as limited by the series of cases such as Goldstar v. The Queen[22], Paul v. The Queen[23] and The Queen v. Alepin Frères
Ltée, et al.[24].

In each of these cases the Court refused to
consider an appeal which concerned the propriety of a sentence imposed after a
conviction. In the present case, it is proposed that this Court consider
whether or not a sentence of preventive detention should be imposed upon the

[Page 411]

accused and determine that question upon its
opinion as to whether he falls within the three categories in which it is
necessary for him to fall before such sentence may be imposed.

For these reasons I concur with the opinion of
the Chief Justice and would allow the appeal.

PIGEON J.:—Having had the advantage of reading
the reasons for judgment prepared by the Chief Justice and by Ritchie and
Spence JJ., I agree with the Chief Justice that, on the assumption that the
finding that the appellant is an habitual criminal should not be disturbed, it
has not been shown that it is expedient for the protection of the public to
sentence him to preventive detention.

On the question of jurisdiction, all my brethren
agree that this Court has jurisdiction under s. 41 of the Supreme Court
Act to hear appeals by special leave in the case of persons sentenced to
preventive detention. The only difference of opinion is whether this
jurisdiction is limited to a review of the finding that the accused is an
habitual criminal in the same way as in appeals from indictable offences under
the provisions of the Criminal Code , it is restricted to questions
pertaining to conviction as opposed to sentence.

After anxious consideration, I have come to the
conclusion that no such restriction exists. The basis for the distinction in
appeals under the Criminal Code  is that its provisions for appeals to
the Court of Appeal in ordinary cases contemplate separate and distinct rights
of appeal against conviction and against sentence. (Sections 583 , 584 , 720 ,
etc.). In the case of sentences of preventive detention passed upon habitual
criminals, a single right of appeal is provided for embracing all grounds of
law or fact or mixed law and fact (Section 667 ). This appeal is given against
the sentence of preventive detention, not separately against the finding that
the accused is an habitual criminal and the conclusion that it is expedient to
sentence him to preventive detention. It does therefore contemplate a review of
all the questions involved in passing this sentence, that is the question of
whether this is expedient for the protection of the public as well as the
finding that the

[Page 412]

accused is an habitual criminal. Seeing that no
one doubts that s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act confers jurisdiction
to hear appeals by special leave from the decision of the Court of Appeal in
such cases, I can find no basis for deciding that this jurisdiction is limited
to a consideration of a part only of the questions involved in the judgment
appealed from.

The previous decisions of this Court concerning
our jurisdiction over sentences of preventive detention are reviewed in the
reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice and of my brother Ritchie. I agree
with the Chief Justice that in considering them one should bear in mind the
rule, often stated, that “a case is only an authority for what it actually
decides”. On that basis, I do not find that it was ever decided that our
jurisdiction in dealing with appeals against sentences of preventive detention
is limited to a review of the finding that the accused is an habitual criminal.

For those reasons, I concur in disposing of the
appeal as proposed by the Chief Justice.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Habitual criminal—Preventive
detention—Whether conviction recorded before enactment of habitual criminal
provisions to be considered—Whether conviction subsequent to commission of
substantive offence to be considered—Whether sentence imposed must have been
served—Criminal, Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 660(2)(a).

On December 12, 1956, the appellant was
convicted of an offence, committed on July 15, 1956, of breaking and
entering and theft and was sentenced on that same day to preventive detention.
He had been arrested on July 15, 1956. The three prior convictions upon which
that sentence was founded were: (a) on November 8, 1946, for breaking and
entering; (b) on February 13, 1952, for breaking and entering and (c) on
October 16, 1956, for breaking and entering committed on July 1, 1956. The
Court of Appeal affirmed the sentence of preventive detention and an
application for leave to appeal to this Court was dismissed in October 1957. On
an appeal from the refusal of a writ of habeas corpus, the appellant was
granted leave to appeal to this Court in June 1967. Three questions of law were
raised by the appellant: (1) whether a conviction) recorded prior to the enactment
in 1947 of the habitual criminal provisions should be considered in the
application of s. 660(2)(a) of the Code; (2) whether a conviction
entered after the commission of the primary offence should be considered as one
of the three convictions contemplated in s. 660(2)(a) of the Code;
and (3) whether the sentence imposed on the previous convictions must have been
served when the habitual criminal proceedings are brought.

[Page 342]

Held (Cartwright
C.J. and Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
dismissed.

Per Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The Court was entitled to consider
the conviction recorded in 1946. The word “previously” in s. 660(2)(a)
of the Code takes in convictions before the enactment of legislation in
relation to habitual criminals and that includes the conviction of 1946. The
convictions which the Court may consider are convictions which have occurred
since the accused reached the age of 18 years without regard to the date when
the habitual criminal legislation was first passed.

The Court was entitled to consider the
conviction dated October 16, 1956, as one of the three convictions. There is no
basis for the contention that the three convictions must occur previous to the
commission of the primary offence. It is sufficient for the Crown to prove that
the accused has been convicted on three occasions previous to the conviction on
the primary offence. The word “previously” must apply to any conviction which
in point of time has occurred before the date of the hearing of the application
and before the date of the conviction on the primary offence. The word does not
mean “previously to committing the substantive offence” but “previously to
being convicted of the substantive offence”. All that the Crown has to prove is
that at the time of the conviction on the primary offence, there are three
previous convictions and that at the time of the commission of the substantive
offence, he was leading a “persistently criminal life”.

There is no requirement that the sentence
imposed must have been served in whole or in part. The statute in clear
language requires only proof of a conviction of a certain kind. This language
cannot be converted into a requirement that a sentence passed pursuant to such
conviction must have been served. The serving of the sentence is not one of the
conditions that must be met in order to establish that a person is an habitual
criminal.

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ., dissenting: The Court was not
entitled to consider the conviction, dated October 16, 1956, which was entered
after the commission of the primary offence. The word “previously” in
s. 660(2)(a) means previously to committing the substantive offence
and not previously to being convicted of the substantive offence. The time at
which the Crown must show that an accused is leading persistently a criminal
life is the time of the commission of the substantive offence. The critical
time contemplated by s. 660(2)(a) for the proof of the two matters
required to be proved by the Crown must be the same for both. There is no
evidence to suggest that after the date of the conviction for the third
offence, he persistently led a criminal life as he had been in custody ever
since. At the time the appellant committed the substantive offence he had been
convicted of only two of the three offences set out in the notice given to him
and consequently, the first of the conditions prescribed by s. 660(2)(a)
had not been fulfilled.

Per Pigeon J.,
dissenting: In order to limit the effect of the word “previously”
in s. 660, which by itself takes in all time past without any distinction,
it would be necessary to introduce into the section something which is not
there. On the proper construction of the

[Page 343]

statute after consideration of the relevant
authorities there was no reason in law for excluding from consideration the
conviction recorded in 1946.

The trial judge was not entitled to consider
the conviction entered after the commission of the primary offence.
Grammatically the text of s. 660 does not support the contention that the
word “previously” refers to the date of the commission of the primary offence.
The word “occasions” means when an offender is apprehended, charged, convicted
and sentenced. The word “persistently” implies “persistently after being
convicted on the required three separate and independent occasions”. Therefore,
when the appellant was convicted of the primary offence, he could not be said
to have been previously convicted “on at least three separate and independent
occasions” when the last conviction was for an offence for which he was
arrested and charged on the same occasion as the primary offence, and also
because he could not be found to have been so convicted and to be leading
persistently a criminal life when he had been convicted on the last occasion
after being arrested for the primary offence.

Droit criminel—Repris de justice—Détention
préventive—Doit-on considérer une déclaration de culpabilité enregistrée avant
la promulgation des dispositions visant les repris de justice—Doit-on
considérer une déclaration de culpabilité prononcée après la date de
l’infraction sur laquelle la sentence est basée—Est-ce que la sentence imposée
doit avoir été purgée—Code criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 660(2)(a).

Le 12 décembre 1956, l’appelant a été déclaré
coupable d’une infraction, commise le 15 juillet 1956: entrée par effraction et
vol. Une sentence de détention préventive lui a été imposée le même jour. Il
avait été arrêté le 15 juillet 1956. Les trois déclarations antérieures de
culpabilité sur lesquelles cette sentence est basée, sont: (a) le 8 novembre
1946: entrée par effraction; (b) le 13 février 1952: entrée par effraction et
(c) le 16 octobre 1956: entrée par effraction le 1er juillet 1956. La
Cour d’appel a confirmé la sentence de détention préventive et une requête pour
permission d’en appeler à cette Cour a été rejetée au mois d’octobre 1957. Sur
appel d’une décision refusant d’accorder un bref d’habeas corpus, cette
Cour lui a accordé la permission d’appeler au mois de juin 1967. L’appelant a
soulevé à l’audition trois questions de droit: (1) doit-on, dans l’application
de l’art. 660(2)(a) du Code, considérer une déclaration de
culpabilité enregistrée avant la promulgation en 1947 des dispositions visant les
repris de justice; (2) doit-on considérer une déclaration de culpabilité
enregistrée après la date de l’infraction sur laquelle la sentence est basée
comme l’une des trois déclarations de culpabilité visées par l’art. 660(2)(a)
du Code; et (3) la sentence imposée à la suite des déclarations antérieures de
culpabilité doit-elle avoir été purgée avant que les procédures visant les
repris de justice soient instituées contre l’accusé.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté, le Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Hall, Spence et
Pigeon étant dissidents.

Les Juges
Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson et Ritchie: La Cour était justifiée de
considérer la déclaration de culpabilité enregistrée en 1946. Le mot
«antérieurement» dans l’art. 660(2) (a) du Code englobe les déclarations
de culpabilité antérieures à la promulgation de la législa-

[Page 344]

tion relative aux repris de justice et ceci
inclut la déclaration de culpabilité de 1946. Les déclarations de culpabilité
que la Cour peut considérer sont celles qui sont survenues depuis que l’accusé
a atteint l’âge de 18 ans sans égard à la date de la promulgation de la
première législation relative aux repris de justice.

La Cour était justifiée de considérer la
déclaration de culpabilité du 16 octobre 1956, comme l’une des trois
déclarations de culpabilité prévues par l’art. 660(2)(a). La prétention
que les trois déclarations de culpabilité doivent survenir avant que l’accusé
commette l’infraction sur laquelle la sentence est basée n’est pas fondée. Il
suffit que la Couronne prouve que l’accusé a été déclaré coupable en trois
occasions avant d’être déclaré coupable de cette infraction. Le mot
«antérieurement» doit s’appliquer à toute déclaration de culpabilité qui au
point de vue du temps est survenue avant la date de l’audition de la demande et
avant la date de la déclaration de culpabilité de l’infraction base de la
sentence. Ce mot ne veut pas dire «antérieurement à cette infraction» mais
«antérieurement à la déclaration de culpabilité de cette infraction». Tout ce
que la Couronne doit prouver est que lors de cette déclaration de culpabilité,
il existait trois déclarations antérieures de culpabilité et que lorsque
l’accusé a commis l’infraction, il menait avec persistance une vie criminelle.

Il n’est pas nécessaire que la sentence
imposée ait été purgée en tout ou en partie. Dans un langage clair, le statut
n’exige que la preuve d’une déclaration de culpabilité d’un certain genre. On
ne peut pas transformer ce langage pour lui faire dire qu’une sentence
prononcée en vertu d’une telle déclaration de culpabilité doit avoir été
purgée. Le fait d’avoir purgé la sentence n’est pas une des conditions requises
pour établir qu’une personne est un repris de justice.

Le Juge en
Chef Cartwright et les Juges Hall et Spence, dissidents: La Cour
n’était pas justifiée de considérer la déclaration de culpabilité du 16 octobre
1956, laquelle a été enregistrée après la date de l’infraction sur laquelle la
sentence est basée. Le mot «antérieurement» dans l’art. 660(2)(a)
signifie antérieurement à cette infraction et non pas antérieurement à la
déclaration de culpabilité. Le moment auquel la Couronne doit démontrer que
l’accusé mène avec persistance une vie criminelle est lorsque l’accusé commet
cette infraction. Le moment critique prévu par l’art. 660(2)(a) où doit
se faire la preuve des deux éléments que la Couronne doit établir, doit être le
même pour les deux. Il n’y a aucune preuve suggérant qu’après la date de la
déclaration de culpabilité pour la troisième infraction, il a mené avec
persistance une vie criminelle puisqu’il était sous arrêt depuis ce jour-là. Au
moment où l’appelant a commis l’infraction il avait été déclaré coupable de
seulement deux des trois actes criminels mentionnés dans l’avis qui lui a été
fourni et, en conséquence, la première des conditions prescrites par l’art.
660(2)(a) n’a pas été remplie.

Le Juge
Pigeon, dissident: Pour qu’il soit permis de limiter l’effet du
mot «antérieurement» dans l’art. 660, lequel englobe par lui-même tout le passé
sans distinction, il serait nécessaire d’introduire dans l’article quelque
chose qui n’y est pas. Donnant au statut l’interprétation appropriée et après
examen de la jurisprudence, il n’y a aucune raison en droit de ne pas
considérer la déclaration de culpabilité enregistrée en 1946.

Le juge au procès n’était pas justifié de
considérer la déclaration de culpabilité enregistrée après l’infraction sur
laquelle la sentence est basée.

[Page 345]

Grammaticalement, le texte de l’art. 660 ne
supporte pas la prétention que le mot «antérieurement» réfère à la date de
cette infraction. Le mot «occasions» signifie le temps où le criminel est
arrêté, inculpé, déclaré coupable et reçoit sa sentence. Le mot «persistently»
signifie «avec persistance après avoir été déclaré coupable dans les trois
occasions distinctives et indépendantes requises». En conséquence, lorsque
l’appelant a été déclaré coupable de l’infraction, on ne pouvait pas dire qu’il
avait été trouvé coupable antérieurement «dans au moins trois occasions
distinctes et indépendantes» puisque la dernière déclaration de culpabilité
était d’une infraction pour laquelle il avait été arrêté et inculpé en la même
occasion, et aussi parce qu’on ne pouvait pas dire qu’il avait été ainsi
déclaré coupable et menait ainsi une vie criminelle, dans un cas où la dernière
des trois condamnations était subséquente à son arrestation.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’appel de la
Colombie-Britannique, confirmant une sentence de détention préventive. Appel

dissidents.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia, affirming a sentence of preventive detention. Appeal
dismissed, Cartwright C.J. and Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.

T.R. Berger, for the appellant.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Hall and
Spence JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):—This
appeal is brought, pursuant to an order made by this Court on June 19, 1967,
extending the time for appealing and granting leave to appeal, from a judgment
of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia pronounced on September 20, 1957,
dismissing an appeal from the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention
upon the appellant by His Honour Judge Archibald on December 12, 1956.

The appeal comes before us under unusual
circumstances.

On October 28, 1957, the appellant applied to
this Court for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal
mentioned above and his application was dismissed. The grounds of appeal on
which counsel for the appellant chiefly relies in the appeal now before us were
not raised

[Page 346]

before His Honour Judge Archibald or the Court
of Appeal for British Columbia on the appeal to it in 1957 or on the application
to this Court for leave to appeal in the same year.

On July 23, 1963, an application by the
appellant for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus was refused by Judson
J. and an appeal to the Court from such refusal was dismissed on November 12,
1963. On April 4, 1967, a further application by the appellant for the issue of
a writ of habeas corpus was refused by Judson J. These refusals were
clearly right as it is plain that the appellant is detained under a warrant of
committal valid on its face, issued by a Court of competent jurisdiction.

The appellant appealed to this Court from the
last mentioned refusal and was notified that his appeal would be heard on
Monday, June 19, 1967. Prior to the hearing of the appeal a telegram was
received by the Registrar of the Court from Mr. Thomas Berger stating that
he had been asked to make representations to the Court on behalf of the
appellant and requesting that no determination be made of the appeal until
these reached the Court. Prior to the date of hearing a letter was received
from Mr. Berger setting out grounds, to be referred to hereinafter, on
which he submitted that the sentence of preventive detention had been
unlawfully imposed.

On the appeal coming on to be heard, the Court
informed counsel for the Attorney General that the decision of Judson J.
refusing the issue of a writ of habeas corpus was clearly right and that
the appeal therefrom must be dismissed but that Mr. Berger’s letter
appeared to raise a question of difficulty and importance which had not been
placed before the Court of Appeal or this Court on any previous application by
the appellant. After some discussion, and counsel for the Attorney General not
objecting, the Court made the order granting leave to appeal and giving the
necessary extensions of time as set out in the opening paragraph of these
reasons.

On December 12, 1956, following trial without a
jury which commenced on the previous day, the appellant was convicted on the
charge that he

…on or about Sunday July 15th, A.D. 1956,
at the City of Kelowna, County of Yale, Province of British Columbia, did
unlawfully break and enter a place, to wit, the building of Gordon’s Master
Market Ltd.

[Page 347]

situated at 555 Bernard Avenue, Kelowna,
British Columbia, and therein steal the sum of approximately $14,452.28 in cash
and cheques, the property of Gordon’s Master Market Ltd., contrary to the form
of Statute in such case made and provided.

On November 28, 1956, the appellant had been
served with a notice dated November 28, 1956, in accordance with the provisions
of s. 662  of the Criminal Code  stating that if he should be
convicted of the substantive charge an application would be made to the Court
to impose a sentence of preventive detention upon the ground, inter alia, that

since attaining the age of eighteen years,
on at least three separate and independent occasions previous to the conviction
of the crime charged and hereinbefore recited, you have been convicted of an
indictable offence for which you were liable to imprisonment for five years or
more, namely:—

The three prior convictions are set out in
complete detail; the particulars given may be summarized as follows:

(a) Charge, breaking and entering at
Victoria, on May 30, 1946; conviction, November 8, 1946; sentenced, November
25, 1946, to five years in B.C. Penitentiary.

(b) Charge, breaking and
entering at Haney, B.C., on February 26, 1951; conviction, February 13, 1952;
sentenced to five years in B.C. Penitentiary.

(c) Charge, breaking and entering at
Vancouver on July 1, 1956; conviction, October 16, 1956; sentenced October 23,
1956, to five years in B.C. Penitentiary.

The hearing of the application for the
imposition of a sentence of preventive detention proceeded immediately
following the conviction of the substantive offence. It was proved that the
appellant had been convicted on the three occasions as stated in the notice. It
appears from the evidence of Acting-Sergeant Nuttall given at the hearing of
the application that the appellant was arrested at Vancouver on July 15, 1956.

The grounds of appeal relied on by the appellant
are set out in the appellant’s factum as follows:

1. The first conviction made against the
appellant, in 1946, could not be used against him as one of three essential
previous convictions, because there were no provisions in the Criminal Code  for
preventive detention of habitual criminals then, and the legislation should not
be given retroactive application.

2. At the time of the commission of the
primary offence, the appellant had not previously been convicted on three
separate and independent occasions of an indictable offence for which he was
liable for imprisonment for five years or more.,

[Page 348]

3. There was no adequate legal foundation
for a sentence of preventive detention, in view of the fact that although three
previous convictions had been proved against the appellant, he had not served
the sentence imposed on him on the third previous conviction when the
proceedings were brought against him alleging that he was an habitual criminal
and when the sentence of preventive detention was imposed on him.

I find it necessary to deal only with the second
of these grounds. Both counsel advised us that they had been unable to find any
reported decision in which the question raised in this ground had been
considered.

On December 12, 1956, s. 660  of the Criminal
Code  read as follows:

660. (1) Where an accused is convicted of
an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of
preventive detention in addition to any sentence that is imposed for the
offence of which he is convicted if

(a) the accused is found to be an
habitual criminal, and

(b) the court is of the opinion that
because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for the protection
of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.

(2) For the purposes of
subsection (1), an accused is an habitual criminal if

(a) he has previously, since
attaining the age of eighteen years, on at least three separate and independent
occasions been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to
imprisonment for five years or more and is leading persistently a criminal
life, or

(b) he has been previously
sentenced to preventive detention.

The solution of the question before us depends
primarily upon the true construction of s. 660 , subs. (2)(a) and
particularly upon the meaning of the word “previously” in the first line of
clause (a). Does it mean previously to committing the substantive
offence or previously to being convicted of the substantive offence? In my
opinion it means the former. It has been held in a unanimous judgment of this
Court that the time at which the Crown must show that an accused is leading
persistently a criminal life is the time of the commission of the substantive
offence: see Kirkland v. The Queen[1].

It appears to me that the critical time
contemplated by clause (a) for the proof of the two matters required to
be proved by the Crown must be the same for both. I arrive at this conclusion
from a consideration of the words of

[Page 349]

the section. If the construction were doubtful
it seems to me that the view which I think should be taken is greatly
strengthened by a consideration of the history of the section and the
judicial pronouncements on it and on the statutory provisions in England upon
which it is, with some variations, modelled.

In R. v. Churchill[2], Lord Goddard L.C.J. said
at p. 110:

The object of preventive detention is to
protect the public from men or women who have shown by their previous history
that they are a menace to society while they are at large. There comes a time
when it is not a question of punishment, for that has been shown to be of no
use, but of a necessity to put these offenders in confinement so that they can
no longer prey upon the public.

and at p. 112:

It is not a question of severity. As we
have already said, when such sentences have to be passed the time for
punishment has gone by, because it has had no effect.

These passages indicate the view, which I think
to be the right one, that Parliament intended the extraordinary sentence of
preventive detention to be imposed only after it appeared that convictions on
three separate and independent occasions had failed to deter the accused from
committing the substantive offence.

To the same effect are the following words in
the judgment of Lord Goddard in R. v. Rogers[3]:

The Criminal Justice Act was intended to
deal with people who showed by their conduct that previous sentences had had no
effect upon them and that, therefore, they were fit subjects for long detention
for the protection of the public.

at p. 207:

The principle is that if the prisoner shows
that the sentences he has received at a particular court and also at two
subsequent courts do not deter him from committing crime, then he is to be
liable to preventive detention.

and also at p. 207:

I think on the whole that is giving effect
to the intention of the Act, because it will then have shown that the three
previous appearances in court and the sentences imposed on him on three
separate occasions have not done the prisoner any good, and therefore the time
has come to try a long sentence.

[Page 350]

Reference may also be made to the words of
Sheppard J.A. in R. v. Charming[4]:

The Code does not expressly require that
the accused lead persistently a criminal life of offences for which he is
liable to imprisonment for 5 years or more. It is sufficient if he has been
convicted on three occasions for three such offences and thereafter persistently
led a criminal life, which may be of lesser crimes.

The most significant word in this passage is
“thereafter” which I have italicized. In the case at bar at the time of his
conviction for the third offence, the appellant had been in custody for some
three months and has continued in custody ever since. There is no evidence in
the record to suggest that after the date of that conviction he persistently
led a criminal life.

It may be of use to consider the possible
results of construing the section in accordance with the submission of
counsel for the respondent by suggesting the following example. A person on
separate days during the same month breaks into four different houses and
steals some of the contents. He is apprehended on the fourth occasion. If
separately indicted and convicted for each of the first three offences, he
could following conviction on the fourth be sentenced to preventive detention.
That such a situation is unlikely to arise may be conceded; but it appears to
me to be even more unlikely that Parliament should have intended to render
possible such a result. To so construe the section because the literal
meaning of the words used would seem capable of bearing such a meaning would,
in my opinion, be to disregard the well settled rule of construction which is
succinctly stated in Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 36, p. 416:

For a penalty to be enforced it must be
quite clear that the case is within both the letter and the spirit of the
statute.

This statement is supported by the authorities
cited by the learned authors and there is nothing in the Interpretation Act,
as in force at the time this case was dealt with in the Courts below
(R.S.C. 1952, c. 158), which abrogates the rule. Section 15 of that Act does
require every Act to be deemed remedial but concludes with the words:

…and shall accordingly receive such fair,
large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the
attainment of the object of the Act and of such provision or enactment,
according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.

[Page 351]

It is the commission of the substantive offence
that creates the possibility of an inquiry as to whether the accused is an
habitual criminal. It is, of course, necessary that he be convicted of that
offence before it can be said judicially that he has committed it; but it is
the commission and not the conviction which indicates what manner of man he is.
The number of previous convictions chosen by Parliament as a condition
precedent to the holding of an inquiry as to whether a person is an habitual
criminal is three. Those convictions bring home to the convicted person on three
separate occasions the knowledge of guilt and the punishment which it entails.
It is the fact that he thereafter, with such knowledge, commits yet another
indictable offence that Parliament has declared shall be a condition precedent
to the inquiry as to whether he should be sentenced to preventive detention.

At the time the appellant in the case at bar
committed the substantive offence he had been convicted of only two of the
three offences set out in the notice given to him and, in my opinion, the first
of the conditions prescribed by clause (a) of s. 660(2) had not been
fulfilled; it follows that it was not open to the learned judge to impose a
sentence of preventive detention.

It is obvious that for the reasons given above I
would allow the appeal, but there remains for consideration a point raised by
some members of the Court. It has been suggested that because this Court had,
on October 28, 1957, refused the appellant’s application for leave to appeal it
had no jurisdiction to make the order granting leave which it did make on June
19, 1967, and which was duly signed and entered.

As this point was not put to counsel during the
argument, counsel were invited to submit written argument dealing with it and
they have done so.

It now appears that the majority of the Court
have reached the conclusion that the appeal fails on the merits. It therefore
becomes unnecessary to deal with the question of jurisdiction. I am dealing
with the appeal on the assumption that we have jurisdiction but, following the
example of my brother Judson, I express no opinion on that question.

[Page 352]

I would allow the appeal and quash the sentence
of preventive detention imposed upon the appellant.

The judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland,
Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

JUDSON J.:—On December 12, 1956, the appellant,
George Milton Paton, was sentenced to preventive detention. His appeal from
this sentence to the British Columbia Court of Appeal was dismissed on
September 20, 1957, and an application for leave to appeal to this Court was
dismissed on October 28, 1957. Notwithstanding this last dismissal, in June of
this year, at the same time that an application by way of appeal from the
refusal of a writ of habeas corpus was dismissed, the Court granted
leave to appeal from the above mentioned judgment of the Court of Appeal of
British Columbia, dated September 20, 1957. The question of the Court’s
jurisdiction to hear this appeal has been raised but also the appeal has been
heard on the merits. I express no opinion on the question of jurisdiction
because the appeal must fail on the merits.

The convictions upon which the sentence for
preventive detention was founded are as follows:

I will deal now with the three points of law
which were submitted to the Court on the argument of the appeal.



I. Whether, under the provisions of Section 660(2)(a), the Court was
entitled to consider a conviction in 1946 before the enactment of the Habitual
Criminal provisions of the Criminal Code .



The submission is that if the Court does
consider the conviction of 1946, it is giving a retroactive operation to the
habitual criminal provisions of the Code. I do not

[Page 353]

think that this is correct. The purpose of the
habitual criminal legislation is not to create a new offence nor to increase
the penalties for offences with respect to which sentences have already been
imposed. The purpose is crime prevention. The habitual criminal is not imprisoned
for doing something, but rather for being something. The finding is simply a
declaration of his status as an habitual criminal which is a matter determined
in part by reference to his past record. This was decided in Brusch v. The
King[5].

Legislation in relation to habitual criminals
was first enacted in Canada in 1947. (Statutes of Canada, 1947, 11 Geo. VI,
vol. 1, c. 55, Part X(A)). Section 575c. (1) enacted under that part read:

575c. (1) A person shall not be found to be
a habitual criminal unless the judge or jury as the case may be, finds on
evidence,

(a) that since attaining the age of
eighteen years he has at least three times previously to the conviction of the
crime charged in the indictment, been convicted of an indictable offence for
which he was liable to at least five years’ imprisonment, whether any such
previous conviction was before or after the commencement of this Part, and that
he is leading persistently a criminal life.

On December 12, 1956, the date of Paton’s
sentence to preventive detention, s. 660  had taken the place of
s. 575c. (1). Section 660  came in with the new Criminal Code  enacted
by 2-3 Eliz. II, c. 51, and came into force on April 1, 1955. It read:

660. (1) Where an accused is convicted of
an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of
preventive detention in addition to any sentence that is imposed for the
offence of which he is convicted if

(a) the accused is found to be an
habitual criminal, and

(b) the court is of the
opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for
the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.

(2) For the purposes of
subsection (1), an accused is an habitual criminal if

(a) he has previously, since
attaining the age of eighteen years, on at least three separate and independent
occasions been convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to
imprisonment for five years or more and is leading persistently a criminal
life, or

(b) he has been previously
sentenced to preventive detention.

[Page 354]

In the original enactment of 1947, the words
“whether any such previous conviction was before or after the commencement of
this Part” make it clear that the Court was entitled to take into account the
conviction in 1946, No. 1 on the above list.

On December 12, 1956, when the accused was found
to be an habitual criminal, these words had been omitted and the arrangement of
the words slightly altered. But there was no change in the meaning.
“Previously” takes in convictions before the enactment of legislation in
relation to habitual criminals. It includes the conviction of 1946. The
convictions which the Court may consider are convictions which have occurred
since the accused reached the age of eighteen years without regard to the date
when the habitual criminal legislation was first passed.

The alternatives are the elimination of two
classes of convictions

(a) those before April 1, 1955, when
s. 660  came into force,

Or

(b) those before 1947, when s. 575c.
(1) came into force.

In my opinion the use of the word “previously”
shuts out these alternatives.



II. Whether the learned trial judge, in finding the appellant to be
an habitual criminal, was entitled to consider the conviction dated October
16th, 1956, as one of the three convictions described in section 660(2) (a)
of the Criminal Code .



On reference back to the above table, it will be
seen that the conviction of October 16, 1956, based on the offence of July 1,
1956, was subsequent to the commission of the primary or substantive offence on
July 15, 1956. The appellant’s submission on this appeal is that the three
convictions, in order to comply with s. 660 , must occur previous to the
commission of the primary or substantive offence. The Crown, on the other hand,
submits that there is no basis for such a contention and that it is sufficient
for the Crown to prove at the hearing of an application under s. 660  that
the accused has been convicted on three occasions previous to the conviction on
the primary or substantive offence. In this case, on December 12, 1956, when
this accused was convicted of the primary or substantive offence which he had
committed on July 15, 1956, there were three convictions against him: November
8,

[Page 355]

1946, February 13, 1952, and October 16, 1956.
When the application to have him sentenced to preventive detention was made on
the same date, December 12, 1956, the Court was required to decide at that
point of time whether previously, since attaining the age of eighteen years, on
three separate and independent occasions, the appellant had been convicted. The
word “previously” in such circumstances must apply to any conviction which in
point of time has occurred before the date of the hearing of the application
and before the date of the conviction on the primary or substantive offence.

To go back to s. 575c., the original
enactment of 1947, the words read: “previously to the conviction of the
crime charged in the indictment”. In the present section, 660(2)(a),
the words italicized in s. 575c. (1) have been omitted. The word
“previously” is sufficient. The italicized words were redundant. The two
sections mean exactly the same. It was a case of omitting in the revision
redundant words. See: C.P.R. v. The King[6].

I cannot accept the conclusion of the Chief
Justice that “previously” means “previously to committing the substantive
offence” and not “previously to being convicted of the substantive offence”.
This is not what the section says. I do not think that it follows from Kirkland
v. The Queen[7] that
at the time of commission of the primary or substantive offence it must be
shown that the accused had three previous convictions. One thing that Kirkland
v. The Queen does decide is that it must be shown on the application to
have the accused declared an habitual criminal that he is leading
“persistently” a criminal life, and that on this branch of the case the date to
be taken is the date of the commission of the primary or substantive offence.

I do not think that the history of the
legislation in England or the dicta of Lord Goddard in Rex v. Churchill[8] and in Rex v. Rogers[9] have any bearing upon the
interpretation of this section. In other words, all that the Crown has to prove
is that at the time of the fourth conviction, i.e., on the primary or
substantive offence, there are three previous convictions and that at the time
of the commission of the

[Page 356]

substantive offence, he was leading a
“persistently criminal life”. To prove the second point does not involve the
necessity of holding that when he committed the third of these offences, it
cannot be said that he was leading a persistently criminal life because he had
not then been convicted.

Nor can I accept the illustration given in the
reasons of the Chief Justice [ante p. 350] in the circumstances there
outlined—four different offences on four consecutive days; four separate
indictments and four convictions. An accused could not necessarily be found to
be an habitual criminal after conviction on the fourth indictment. It would
still have to be proved that he was leading a persistently criminal life and
that terminology does not apply to the facts of the illustration. Without more,
the illustration is one of a spasmodic outburst and not of a persistently
criminal life.

Further, the Interpretation Act, which is
appealed to in support of this view, cannot possibly apply when the meaning of
the section to be interpreted is plain on its face. Our task is to give
effect to the plain meaning of the section.



III. There was no adequate legal foundation for a sentence of
preventive detention, in view of the fact that although three previous
convictions had been proved against the appellant, he had not served the
sentence imposed on him on the third previous conviction when the proceedings
were brought against him alleging that he was an habitual criminal and when the
sentence of preventive detention was imposed on him.



There is no merit in this submission. To repeat
what I have already said, what must be proved is that at the time of the
application there are three convictions against the accused “of an indictable
offence for which he was liable to imprisonment of five years or more”. The
statute in clear language requires only proof of a conviction of a kind
carrying a liability for a five-year sentence. This language cannot be
converted into a requirement that a sentence passed pursuant to such conviction
must have been served. The language is “convicted of an indictable offence for
which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more” and not “convicted
of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years
or more and which he has served”. The serving of the sentence is
not one of the conditions that must be met in order to establish that a person
is an habitual criminal.

[Page 357]

The King v. Robinson[10] is against any such submission.
See: Per Fauteux J. at p. 526:

The offences are not identified by names or
by references to sections describing them, but by the measure of
punishment … which the offender is exposed to suffer.

and per Cartwright J. at p. 534:

The controversy is as to the proper
construction of the words “been convicted of an offence for which he was liable
to at least five years’ imprisonment”.

* *
*

The solution of the question depends upon
the meaning to be given to the words “liable to”. Their ordinary and natural
meaning is, I think, “exposed to”. The intention of Parliament as disclosed in
the words of the section seems to me to be to describe a class of
indictable offences, and to require as one of the conditions of a person being
found to be a habitual criminal that he shall at least three times have been
convicted of an offence comprised in such class. The offences of which the
class is composed are described by reference to the penalty which the law
permits to be inflicted on a person convicted thereof, that is to say, the
penalty to which he is exposed, which he runs the risk of suffering, which he
is subject to the possibility of undergoing, not the penalty which he must
suffer.

It is the measure of punishment that is referred
to in the section. Conviction satisfies the condition imposed without any
requirement that the sentence imposed be served in whole or in part.

I would dismiss the appeal.

PIGEON J. (dissenting):—The facts of this
case are stated by the Chief Justice. Because, in the opinion of the majority,
the appeal fails on the merit I will, as he does, deal with it without
expressing any opinion on the question of jurisdiction.

The first question of law raised by the
appellant is whether a conviction recorded prior to the enactment of habitual
criminal provisions, is to be considered in the application of this
legislation. Appellant’s first conviction was entered in 1946 while the
original enactment dates from 1947. In that first text (Criminal Code  s.
575c)  the words “whether any such previous conviction was before or after the
commencement of this Part” were inserted to dispel any doubt, but they do not
appear in the corresponding provision of the revised Criminal Code  enacted
in 1954

[Page 358]

(2-3 Eliz. II, c. 51, in force April 1, 1955).
The question is therefore whether those words were surplusage or, on the
contrary, necessary to prevent the application of the presumption against
retrospective operation.

It must be stressed that, in Canada, this presumption
is not a rule of law but a rule of construction only. There is therefore no
requirement that the intention to displace it be explicit. It is sufficient
that the wording of the enactment be such as not to leave it open fairly to any
other construction. In s. 660 of the present Criminal Code , the
word “previously” by itself takes in all time past without any distinction. In
order to limit its effect, it would be necessary to introduce into the
enactment something which is not there.

When the cases in which the rule against
retrospective operation are reviewed, it becomes apparent that, usually, the
real basis for its application is the explicit or implicit provision fixing the
date of the commencement of the Act. This date is an essential part of every
statute. It is by reference to it that the courts must decide what are the
situations governed by the new enactment and what are those that are not. For
instance, when an enactment deals with a right of appeal, the situations
affected are future cases only, pending cases are not taken in: Taylor v.
The Queen[11];
William v. Irvine[12];
Hyde v. Lindsay[13];
Flemming v. Atkinson[14]; Ville
de Jacques-Cartier v. Lamarre[15]. The
offence of which the appellant was convicted and following the conviction for
which he was sentenced to preventive detention, was committed after the coming
into force of the present Criminal Code  and, therefore, that offence, as
well as the proceedings leading up to the conviction and to the sentence of
preventive detention, was governed by its provisions.

Appellant says that when a person is accused of
an offence created by an Act of Parliament, all the ingredients of such offence
must have taken place after the date on which the Act came into operation and,
in support of this proposition,

[Page 359]

a dictum of Lord Coleridge in Regina v.
Griffiths[16] is
cited. The legislation in that case had made certain acts misdemeanours if
committed by a debtor “within four months next before the presentation of a
bankruptcy petition by or against him” while previously such result obtained
only in the case of a bankruptcy petition against him. It was held that
if the acts had been committed before the new law it did not apply although the
bankruptcy was subsequent. This principle cannot have any application in the
present case because the situation is entirely different. The Criminal Code  does
not by s. 660  create an offence of which past crimes are an ingredient. It
provides, as it read originally at the material time, for “a sentence of
preventive detention in addition to any sentence that is imposed for the
offence …” In this respect, s. 660  does not materially differ from
s. 575B of the old code under which a majority of this Court held that
being an habitual criminal is not an offence but a state of circumstances which
enables the court to pass a further sentence: Brusch v. The Queen[17].

It is contended that this has the effect of
increasing the penalty for offences already committed but it is clear that such
is not the result of the statute nor what was said in this Court in the case
just referred to. On the contrary it is obvious that the sentence of preventive
detention is imposed in respect of the offence concerning which the application
is made. Previous offences as well as the conduct of the accused are nothing
else than what Lord Reading termed “circumstances” in dealing with a
determination under the Prevention of Crime Act 1908: Rex v. Hunter[18]. The principle applicable to such
legislation is that which is set forth as follows by Maxwell, On Interpretation
of Statutes, 11th ed., p. 211:

Nor is a statute retrospective, in the
sense under consideration, because a part of the requisites for its action is
drawn from a time antecedent to its passing.

In The Queen v. St. Mary Whitechapel[19], the statute under consideration
provided that “no woman residing in any parish with her husband at the time of
his death shall

[Page 360]

be removed…”. It was held applicable to a woman
whose husband had died before the passing of the Act. Lord Denman said, at page
127:

the statute is in its direct operation
prospective, as it relates to future removals only, and … it is not properly
called a retrospective statute because a part of the requisites for its action
is drawn from time antecedent to its passing.

In Ex parte Dawson[20], the statute read:

Any settlement of property made by a
settlor shall, if the settlor becomes bankrupt at any subsequent time within
ten years after the date of such settlement, … be void …

It was held applicable to a settlement made
before the commencement of the Act.

In Re. A Solicitor’s Clerk[21], the Act provided that an order
might be made by the Disciplinary Committee directing that no solicitor shall
take or retain in his employment a person who “has been convicted of larceny,
embezzlement, fraudulent conversion or any other criminal offence in respect of
any money or property belonging to or held or controlled by the solicitor by
whom he is or was employed or any client…”. This was amended to provide that
the order might be made when the clerk had been convicted of any larceny,
embezzlement or fraudulent conversion. It was. held that the order could then
validly be made in respect of a clerk convicted of larceny of property which
belonged neither to his employer nor to a client of his, although such conviction
was many years prior to the amendment. Lord Goddard said:

In my opinion this Act is not in truth
retrospective. It enables an order to be made disqualifying a person from
acting as a solicitor’s clerk in the future and what happened in the past is
the cause or reason for the making of the order, but the order has no
retrospective effect. It would be retrospective if the Act provided that
anything done before the Act came into force or before the order was made
should be void or voidable, or if a penalty were inflicted for having acted in
this or any other capacity before the Act came into force or before the
order-was made. This Act simply enables a disqualification to be imposed for
the future which in no way affects anything done by the appellant in the past.

Counsel for the appellant has referred us to
some pas-sages of the judgments in Rex v. Chandra Dharma[22], Rex

[Page 361]

v. Oliver[23] and Buckman v. Button[24].
In none of those cases does the decision lend any support to appellant’s
contention. In the first mentioned it was held that a statute extending. the
time for commencing a prosecution applied to an offence previously committed.
In the other two it was held that a regulation increasing the penalties for
some offences applied to offences previously committed.

On the proper construction of the statute after
consideration of all relevant authorities it must be said that there was no
reason in law for excluding from consideration in passing upon the application
for preventive detention, the conviction recorded in 1946 prior to the
enactment of habitual criminal legislation in Canada.

The second question of law arising in this case
is whether the trial judge was, in finding the appellant to be an habitual
criminal, entitled to consider a conviction entered against the appellant after
the commission of the primary offence as one of the three previous convictions
contemplated in s. 660  of the Criminal Code .

Before a court may find an accused to be an
habitual criminal it must be shown (unless he has previously been sentenced to
preventive detention) that “he has previously, since attaining the age of
eighteen years, on at least three separate and independent occasions been
convicted of an indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for
five years or more and is leading persistently a criminal life”. In
s. 575c of the old Code, the wording was “previously to the conviction of
the crime charged in the indictment”. As on the first question it is now
necessary to ascertain the result of the change in wording.

On behalf of the appellant, it is contended that
“previously” refers to the date of the commission of the primary or substantive
offence, that is the offence in respect of which the application for a sentence
of preventive detention is made. Grammatically, the text does not support that
contention. The section does not open by the words “Where a person has
committed an indictable offence and a conviction is entered against him …” but
“Where an accused has been convicted…” Therefore, when in para. 2 it is
enacted that “for the purposes of sub-section (1) an accused

[Page 362]

is an habitual criminal if he has previously …”
the word “previously” has reference to the time when the accused has been
convicted of the offence, or possibly to the time when the application is made.
There is nothing that renders grammatically possible a construction referring
back to the date of the commission of the primary offence.

As we have already seen, being an habitual
criminal is not an offence but a state of circumstances and the finding that an
accused is an habitual criminal is only one of the elements involved in passing
the sentence of preventive detention. There can be no doubt that in passing an
ordinary sentence the court is entitled to take into consideration the conduct
of the accused subsequent to the commission of the offence; provision is made
for suspended sentences for that very purpose. Thus, there is no principle
suggesting a different construction.

Concerning the unanimous decision of this Court
in Kirkland v. The Queen[25] this
appears to be a case for the ap-plication of the rule enunciated by Lord
Halsbury in Quinn v. Leathern[26] and
often referred to in this Court v.g. Regina v. Snider[27]; The Queen v. Harder[28]; Robert v. Marquis[29] “that a case is only an authority for what
it actually decides”. In the Kirkland case the determination of the
period of time to be considered in making a finding that an accused is an
habitual criminal was not in issue. The only question considered was what
evidence is necessary to prove that an accused is “leading persistently a
criminal life”. In the reasons for judgment it was said (at p. 7) that
“the Crown had failed to satisfy the onus of proving that at the time of the
commission of the substantive offence, the appellant was leading persistently a
criminal life”. In that case the accused had been apprehended immediately after
the commission of the primary offence and undoubtedly was afterwards in custody
until the sentence was passed. Therefore, it was obvious that the fact of
leading persistently a criminal life was to be proved to have existed at the
time of the commission of the primary offence and

[Page 363]

not subsequently as must indeed be the case in
practically every instance, seeing that accused with criminal records such as
to render them apt to be declared habitual criminals are not usually let out on
bail. Thus, it appears to me that what was said in Kirkland v. The Queen should
be taken merely as a statement of what had to be proved in that case, not as an
exposition of the meaning of the statute applicable to different circumstances.

It must also be pointed out that the case was
decided under s. 575c of the old Code. As we have seen, that
section expressly provided that the required three convictions had to be
“previously to the conviction of the crime charged”. There is nothing to
indicate that any consideration was given to the question of whether the
previous convictions and the persistently criminal life had to be proved to
exist at the same time. Nothing indicates that there was any intention to
decide against the clear words of the enactment that the three convictions had
to be made previously to the commission of the crime, not previously to the
conviction thereof. How then can this decision be considered as an authority on
the construction to be given to a different enactment where the question is
essentially whether the change in wording has effected any change in the
substance of the enactment on this point. With the utmost deference for those
who think otherwise, it does not appear to me that the judgment in the Kirkland
case has any bearing on the question arising in the present case. In my
view, it deals solely with the nature of the evidence required to prove that an
accused is leading persistently a criminal life. It does not deal with the time
during which this fact must be proved to exist, except that in that case it is
said that this had to be shown to have existed at the time of the commission of
the primary offence. The case has absolutely no reference to the time at which
the previous convictions must have been made in order to be taken into account
and it can have no application to the construction of a subsequent enactment
that is differently worded in that respect.

This does not dispose of the second point
because another change in wording between the old and the new Criminal Code  remains
to be considered. Under s. 575c it had to be proved that the accused had
“at least three times previously … been convicted …”, while in
s. 660  it is provided

[Page 364]

that “an accused is an habitual criminal if he
has previously … on at least three separate and independent occasions been
convicted …”. It will be noted that the requirement in respect to previous
convictions is changed from “at least three times” to “on at least three
separate and independent occasions”. Bearing in mind that this is coupled with
the other element, “leading persistently a criminal life”, the change is quite
important. It is obvious that the new wording was inspired by consideration of
the decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Rex v. Tier[30] cited and applied in Rex v.
Cindler[31], because
the new wording is precisely that which Cooper J. used (at p. 437) when he
held that in the New Zealand enactment “four occasions” meant “four separate
and independent occasions”.

After anxious consideration, I have come to the
conclusion that the change from “three times” to “three separate and
independent occasions” has more than a formal significance irrespective of what
may have been said in the New Zealand decision about several counts in the same
indictment constituting but one “occasion” with the implication that separate
indictments would constitute as many “occasions”. It should not be supposed
that Parliament intended in effecting this change of wording that the number of
“separate and independent occasions” should depend on whether the prosecutor
chose to proceed by several indictments instead of by several counts in the
same indictment. The legal requirement is not “three separate and independent
convictions” but convictions on “three separate and independent occasions”.

It is therefore necessary to consider the
meaning of the word “occasion” and this must be done bearing in mind that words
in statutes are generally to be construed in the popular or usual sense, not in
any technical sense. In the Oxford dictionary, the first meaning of “occasion”
is as follows:

1. A falling together or juncture of
circumstances favourable or suitable to an end or purpose, or admitting of
something being done or effected, an opportunity …

Applying this definition to the enactment under
consideration, must it not be said that in the usual sense, an

[Page 365]

“occasion” when a criminal is convicted, is when
he is apprehended, charged and convicted of whatever number of crimes he is
found to have committed before being brought to justice and usually given
concurrent sentences.

In requiring convictions previously on at least
three separate and independent occasions, Parliament cannot have intended that
if a man had committed four offences he could be said to be an habitual
criminal if the prosecutor chose to proceed by as many separate indictments on
different dates. This would turn a substantive requirement into a merely formal
requirement and it would not be in accordance with the usual meaning of the
word “occasion” which is clearly not technical. Such an offender cannot be said
to be a “repris de justice” when caught by the law for the first time. If the
requirement cannot be satisfied by proceeding successively on four different
charges after a single arrest it cannot be satisfied by so proceeding after two
or three where the statute calls for three previous “occasions”.

It must also be considered that the accused has
to be shown to be leading persistently a criminal life. In the Oxford
dictionary, the first sense of “persistent” is as follows:

Persisting or continuing firmly in some
action, course or pursuit, esp. against opposition or remonstrance, or in spite
of failure.

In my view, because “persistent” implies
continuing in some action against opposition or remonstrance, the word
“persistently” in the enactment implies “persistently after being convicted on
the required three separate and independent occasions”.

I do not think that it can properly be said that
in thus construing “occasions” and “persistently” one is going beyond the
wording of the Code and adding requirements that are not spelled out. While it
is frequently deemed desirable in legal drafting to go into a great deal of
minute detail, nothing prevents Parliament from resorting to language requiring
elaboration by judicial construction. In the present case, the words
“occasions” and “persistently” have obviously been selected to prescribe
conditions the exact nature of which is left to the judgment of the courts.

For those reasons, I am of the opinion that the
accused was not properly found to be an habitual criminal because,

[Page 366]

when he was convicted of the primary offence, he
could not be said to have been previously convicted “on at least three separate
and independent occasions” when the last conviction was for an offence for
which he was arrested and charged on the same occasion as the primary offence,
and also because he could not be found to have been so convicted and to be
leading persistently a criminal life when he had been convicted on the last
occasion after being arrested for the primary offence.

The conclusion I have reached on the second
question makes it unnecessary to consider the third question raised, namely
that the appellant had not served the sentence imposed upon him on the third
previous conviction.

Because in the opinion of the majority the
appeal fails on the merit I do not deal with the question of jurisdiction but,
assuming that we have jurisdiction, I would allow the appeal and quash the
sentence of preventive detention imposed upon the appellant.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Habitual criminal—Whether
accused leading consistently a criminal life—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c.
51, s. 660(2)(a).

Following his conviction on a charge of theft
of one can-opener, of a value not in excess of $50, committed on July 31, 1963,
the appellant was found to be an habitual criminal and sentenced to preventive
detention. The report of the magistrate to the Court of Appeal showed that of
the 14 offences of which he found the appellant had been convicted previously,
the first two were for vagrancy and the third, in 1947, was for breaking and
entering and theft. All subsequent convictions were either for having
possession of drugs (4 offences) or for petty theft (7 offences). The last
conviction was in December 1962 and the punishment was a term of 6 months
imprisonment. There had been a period of less than three months between the
date of his release from prison, on May 5, 1963, and the commission of the
substantive offence on July 31, 1963. The Court of Appeal found that it had not
been shown that the magistrate had erred in principle in finding that the
appellant was an habitual criminal. The appellant was granted leave to appeal
to this Court.

Held (Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and
the sentence of preventive detention quashed.

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Judson, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ.: There was no evidence that since
his release early in May 1963, the appellant was leading a criminal life,
persistently or otherwise, except the commission of the substantive offence on
July 31, 1963. This was not a case where the commission of the substantive
offence could in itself furnish sufficient evidence that the appellant was
leading persistently a criminal life.

Per Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: It has been established
that the appellant was leading persistently a criminal life as required by
s. 660(2) (a) of the Criminal Code . It is open to the Court
to conclude that the accused is leading persistently a criminal life if he
repeatedly commits the same kind of offence and if the time elapsing between
the commission of the offence prior to the substantive offence and the commission
of the substantive offence is short, without necessarily having to have
evidence of criminal acts or associations during that short period. The pattern
of conduct which has been established of the commission of thefts shortly after
release from

[Page 259]

custody, coupled with the short lapse of time
after release and prior to the commission of the substantive offence, was good
evidence of persistence in leading a criminal life.

Droit criminel—Repris de justice—L’accusé
menait-il continûment une vie criminelle—Code criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51,
art. 660(2)(a).

Ayant été trouvé coupable du vol, commis le
31 juillet 1963, d’un ouvre-boîtes d’une valeur n’excédant pas $50, l’appelant
a été déclaré repris de justice et une sentence de détention préventive lui a
été imposée. Le rapport fourni à la Cour d’Appel par le magistrat fait voir que
des 14 infractions pour lesquelles le magistrat a trouvé que l’appelant avait
été déclaré coupable antérieurement, les deux premières sont pour vagabondage
et la troisième, en 1947, pour entrée par effraction et vol. Toutes les autres
déclarations subséquentes de culpabilité sont soit pour possession de
stupéfiants (4 infractions) ou pour larcin (7 infractions). La dernière
déclaration de culpabilité a été enregistrée en décembre 1962 et l’appelant a
été condamné à 6 mois d’emprisonnement. Il s’est écoulé moins de 3 mois entre
la date de sa mise en liberté le 5 mai 1963 et celle de l’infraction dont il
s’agit, le 31 juillet 1963. La Cour d’Appel a statué qu’il n’avait pas été
démontré que le magistrat avait erré en principe en déclarant que l’appelant
était un repris de justice. L’appelant a obtenu la permission d’en appeler à
cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être accueilli et la sentence de détention préventive doit être annulée,
les Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland et Ritchie étant dissidents.

Le Juge en
Chef Cartwright et les Juges Judson, Hall, Spence et Pigeon: Sauf le fait
d’avoir commis l’infraction du 31 juillet 1963, il n’y a aucune preuve que
depuis sa mise en liberté au début du mois de mai 1963, l’appelant avait mené
une vie criminelle, avec persistance ou autrement. Il ne s’agit pas ici d’un
cas où l’infraction de l’offense substantive est en elle-même une preuve
suffisante que l’appelant menait avec persistance une vie criminelle.

Les Juges
Fauteux, Abbott, Martland et Ritchie, dissidents: Il a été établi que
l’appelant menait avec persistance une vie criminelle au sens de l’art. 660(2) (a)
du Code Criminel . La Cour peut conclure que l’accusé mène avec
persistance une vie criminelle s’il a commis à maintes reprises le même genre
d’infractions et si le temps écoulé entre la dernière infraction et celle qui
donne lieu à la sentence, est de courte durée. La preuve d’actes criminels ou
d’associations criminelles durant cette courte période n’est pas nécessaire. Le
genre de vie révélé par une série de vols commis peu de temps après la remise
en liberté suivis d’un bref intervalle de liberté avant l’infraction, est une
bonne preuve de la persistance à mener une vie criminelle.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[2],
affirming a sentence of preventive detention. Appeal allowed, Fauteux, Abbott,
Martland and Ritchie JJ. dissenting.

T.R. Berger, for the appellant.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright C.J. and Judson, Hall
and Spence JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—This is an appeal, brought
pursuant to leave granted by this Court on October 10, 1967, from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1 pronounced on April 20, 1965,
dismissing an appeal against a sentence to preventive detention imposed on the
appellant by His Worship Magistrate D.D. Hume at Vancouver on March 16, 1964,
in lieu of the sentence of seven months imprisonment imposed on him by His
Worship Magistrate Lorne H. Jackson on August 1, 1963, upon his conviction on
that date on a charge that at the City of Vancouver on July 31, 1963, he
committed theft of one can-opener, of a value not in excess of fifty dollars,
the property of F.W. Woolworth Company Limited.

On October 23, 1963, while the appellant was in
custody in Oakalla Prison Farm, he was served with a notice, pursuant to
s. 662  of the Criminal Code , that an application to find him to be
an habitual criminal and that it was therefore expedient for the protection of
the public to sentence him to preventive detention would be made on Friday,
November 8, 1963, to a magistrate other than Magistrate Lorne H. Jackson. This
notice specified twenty-four convictions previous to the conviction on August
1, 1963, mentioned above and hereinafter referred to as “the substantive
offence”, and concluded as follows:

B. Other Circumstances

26) That you are an habitual associate of
criminals.

27) That you are a drug addict and an
habitual associate of drug addicts.

28) That during your periods of freedom you
have not had regular gainful employment.

29) That after brief periods of freedom you
have consistently returned to your criminal way of life.

[Page 261]

The hearing before Magistrate Hume did not
commence until March 13, 1964; by that time the appellant had been released
from custody. It appeared that the appellant had received notice that the
hearing would proceed on March 13, 1964, but he did not appear; counsel who had
been representing him was given permission to withdraw and the hearing
proceeded ex parte.

At the conclusion of the hearing the learned
Magistrate gave a brief oral judgment as follows:

I find the accused is a habitual criminal
and I sentence him to preventive detention. Issue a warrant for his arrest.

An appeal having been taken, the Magistrate
furnished a report to the Court of Appeal. In paragraph 10 of this report it
was stated that convictions of the three indictable offences for which the
accused was liable to a term of five years or more were proved, that they were
on charges of having possession of drugs and were those specified in
paras. 15, 16 and 19 of the notice of application. On reference to that
notice it appears that those convictions were as follows:

(a) At Vancouver, on April 21, 1953;
sentence, imprisonment for 3 years and a fine of $200.00 or a further term of 2
months;

(b) At Vancouver, On October 2, 1956;
sentence, imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months;

(c) At Vancouver, on July 22, 1959;
sentence, imprisonment for 2 years.

Paragraphs 11, 12 and 13 of the Magistrate’s
report are as follows:

11. The convictions which were proved
against the accused since 1945 are as follows:—

1947 Vagrancy A

1947 Vagrancy A

1947 Breaking and entering and theft

1950 Drugs in possession

1953 Drugs in possession

1956 Drugs in possession

1958 Theft under fifty dollars

1959 Theft under fifty dollars

1959 Drugs in possession

July 1961 Theft under $50.00—2 months

September 1961 Theft under $50.00—2 months

December 1961 Theft under $50.00—4 months

May 1962 Theft under $50.00—6 months

December 1962 Theft under $50.00—6 months

[Page 262]

12. Evidence presented by the Crown to
substantiate paragraph ‘B’ of the Notice of Application, that is other
circumstances, was given as follows:—


 
  
  June 1959
  
  
  Seen with Charles Codd, George
  Harrop, known drug addicts, at which time the accused admitted he was
  unemployed and had no funds.
  
 
 
  
  March 1961
  
  
  Seen by Constable Monk with Violet
  Young and Papenak, known drug addicts, at which time the accused admitted six
  drug convictions.
  
 
 
  
  June 1961
  
  
  Seen by Constable Aitchison with
  Joseph Rawley, who admitted a criminal record.
  
 
 
  
  September 16, 1961
  
  
  He admitted to Constable Hoyle that
  he was at that time a drug addict.
  
 
 
  
  November 1961
  
  
  Seen by Constable Watt with Charles
  Allan, a person who admitted a criminal record and being a drug addict.
  
 
 
  
  March 1963
  
  
  Seen by Corporal Forgopa (RCMP) with
  Gordon Kravenia and Vance Lawson, known addicts.
  
 


(It appears from the transcript, and was agreed
by counsel before us, that this last item is an error. The date should read
March 1953, not March 1963.)

13. In view of the accused’s lengthy record
for drugs and his most recent convictions since 1961 for theft, I found that he
was leading persistently a criminal life and was hence an habitual criminal,
and that it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to
preventive detention; and as he was not present in court I instructed the
prosecutor to issue and have exercised a warrant for his arrest.

In the Court of Appeal the question which is now
before us was dealt with in one sentence as follows:

In our view it has not been shown that the
learned magistrate in the court below erred in principle which had been applied
by him and approved in this court in many cases, either in the matter of the
finding that the appellant is a habitual criminal, nor the conclusion drawn by
the Magistrate that it is expedient in the interests of the public that this
appellant be sentenced to preventive detention.

The remainder of the reasons given by the Court
of Appeal deals with the question, which was not raised before us, whether the
learned magistrate had the right to proceed with the hearing and give his
decision in the absence of the accused.

The report of the learned magistrate shows that
of the fourteen offences of which he found the appellant had been convicted the
first two were for vagrancy and the third, in 1947, was for breaking and
entering and theft (of two

[Page 263]

electric clippers and a quantity of cigarettes).
All subsequent convictions were either for having possession of drugs (four
offences) or for petty theft (seven offences). The last conviction was in
December 1962 and the punishment was a term of 6 months imprisonment. According
to the evidence of P.C. Needham the appellant was released about May 5, 1963.
This witness testified that he “checked” the appellant on May 12, 1963. He
says:

I have here 5:35 p.m. on May the 12th which
is Sunday, May 12, 1963, I checked this man in the 100 East Hastings. At this
time he told me he was living at Room 15 at the Colonial Hotel by himself. He
was on Social Assistance. He had Fifty Cents in his pockets. He said he had
been on Social Assistance for three or more years and at this time he admitted
having been released from prison one week earlier having served a six months
sentence.

It will be observed from paragraph 12 of the
magistrate’s report, quoted above, that the evidence of circumstances other
than previous convictions upon which the magistrate relied related to occasions
the latest of which was November 1961.

It has been held in a unanimous judgment of this
Court in Kirkland v. The Queen[3] that
the time at which the Crown must show that an accused is leading persistently a
criminal life is the time of the commission of the substantive offence.

In the case at bar there is no evidence that
since his release early in May 1963 the appellant was leading a criminal life,
persistently or otherwise, except the commission of the substantive offence on
July 31, 1963. In some circumstances the commission of the substantive offence
may in itself furnish sufficient evidence that the accused is leading
persistently a criminal life, but this is not one of such cases.

P.C. Needham gave evidence in regard to the
substantive offence. He told of going to the Manager’s Office at F.W. Woolworth
Company’s store on West Hastings Street, at 5.10 p.m. on July 31, 1963, in
response to a radio call and finding the accused there. The Manager charged the
appellant with having stolen a can-opener of the value of

[Page 264]

two dollars and ninety-nine cents and the
following day the appellant pleaded guilty to this charge. P. C. Needham
testified as follows:

At the time of this arrest, he had a
appearance of being mildly intoxicated but there was no smell of liquor on his
breath and when questioned about this he admitted being—having had goof balls
earlier.

* *
*

MR. MORRISON: NOW, you said something about
a goof ball, Constable, what do you mean by that?

A. Well, this is the term that—well, we
asked him if he had been drinking and—

THE COURT: Who asked him?

A. I did, your Worship, during the normal
course of the primary investigation and he denied drinking and I suggested
that—by way of suggestion on my part that he had taken goof balls and he
agreed.

MR. MORRISON: What do you understand by the
term, goof balls?

A. It is some chemical preparation taken by
persons addicted to drugs which they can obtain more easily and a lot less
expense and the effect is similar. This is what I am made to understand.

The picture is of a man “mildly intoxicated” by
“goof balls” stealing a can-opener worth $2.99 rather than of one persisting in
leading a criminal life. The facts are even more consistent with yielding to a
sudden impulse than were those in. Kirkland’s case, supra.

No doubt the record shows that the appellant has
for years been addicted to the use of drugs and from time to time commits petty
thefts. In my opinion, the evidence accepted by the learned magistrate fails to
establish that the appellant was, at the time of committing the substantive
offence, leading persistently a criminal life and this is sufficient to dispose
of the appeal.

As is pointed out in the reasons of my brother
Martland, it was also contended on behalf of the appellant that even if he
could properly be found to be an habitual criminal, it was not proper to impose
a sentence of preventive detention upon him but it is unnecessary to deal with
that submission in these reasons.

I would allow the appeal and quash the sentence
of preventive detention.

The judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and
Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.:—This is an appeal from a judgment
of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[4],
which dis-

[Page 265]

missed the appellant’s appeal against a sentence
for preventive detention which had been imposed upon him. The facts giving rise
to this appeal are stated in the reasons of the Chief Justice. The Court of
Appeal found that it had not been shown that the learned magistrate in the
court below erred in principle in the matter of finding that the appellant was
an habitual criminal.

On this issue, the main argument of the
appellant was that it had not been established that he was “leading
persistently a criminal life”, as required by s. 660(2) (a) of the Criminal
Code , which is one of the necessary elements contained in the definition of
an habitual criminal.

The evidence at trial established the following:

1. A series of fifteen convictions (including
that for the substantive offence on August 1, 1963) since the year 1945.

2. He had been convicted in 1950, 1953, 1956 and
1959 of having drugs in his possession.

3. Between 1958 and 1962 the appellant had been
convicted seven times for theft of an article of a value of less than fifty
dollars. The substantive offence, for which he was convicted on August 1, 1963,
was of a similar nature.

4. There had been a period of less than three
months between the date of his release from prison, about May 5, 1963, and the
commission of the substantive offence. When interviewed by a police officer
about a week after that release from detention the appellant said that he was
on Social Assistance and had been on such assistance for three or more years.

5. Detective Devries, of the Vancouver City
Police Force, who had observed the appellant, when he committed the last
offence, prior to the substantive offence, on December 6, 1962, testified that
he had known the appellant for ten years and that the appellant is a user of
narcotics. Asked as to his character and reputation in the community, he said:

Well, in my opinion, as far as he is
concerned, he always hangs down around the 100 Block East Hastings and Skid
Road and I have never known him to make any advance to employment or get out of
the rut he is in.

[Page 266]

In answer to another question, he said:

Yes, I have been on the Drug Squad for a
period of three years or more and also walk the beat in that area for a number
of years and the 100 Block East Hastings is the main hangout for drug addicts
and criminals.

The appellant contends that there was no
evidence that the appellant was engaged in crime between the date of his
release from custody and the commission of the substantive offence and submits
that, without this, the appellant cannot be found to be an habitual criminal
within the requirements of s. 660(2) (a).

In Kirkland v. The Queen[5], this Court agreed with the statement of
Lord Reading L.C.J. in R. v. Jones[6],
that:

The legislature never intended that a man
should be convicted of being a habitual criminal merely because he had a number
of previous convictions against him.

That statement was made in a case which involved
the adequacy of a summation to the jury by the Chairman of a Quarter Sessions,
which contained the statement:

If you think his record justifies this
charge of being a habitual criminal it is your duty to find that he is a
habitual criminal.

While it is true that a criminal record alone
does not necessarily involve a finding that at the time the substantive offence
was committed, the accused is leading persistently a criminal life, if the
accused repeatedly commits the same kind of offence, and if the time elapsing
between the commission of the offence prior to the substantive offence and the
commission of the substantive offence is short, in my opinion it is open to the
court, considering the matter, to conclude that the accused is leading
persistently a criminal life, without necessarily having to have evidence of
criminal acts or associations during that short period.

The evidence in the present case establishes a
clear pattern of conduct. In each case noted below the charge involved was
theft.

[Page 267]

Within three months of his release after the
last of the above sentences, the appellant committed theft once again.

In the Kirkland case, it was said that
there had been cases in the Court of Criminal Appeal in which the nature of the
substantive offence viewed in the light of the previous record of the accused
was in itself evidence that he was leading a persistently criminal life, but
that the cases of this kind cited by counsel were all cases in which the
substantive offence was of a nature which showed premeditation and careful
preparation.

The fact of premeditation and careful
preparation in relation to the substantive offence may certainly be evidence of
persistence in leading a criminal life. In my opinion it is not the only kind
of evidence, in cases of this kind, which can establish such persistence, and I
do not regard the Kirkland case as laying this down as a matter of law.
That case was decided upon its own facts, as this one must be. In my view the
pattern of conduct which has been established of the commission of thefts
shortly after release from custody, coupled with the short lapse of time after
release and prior to the commission of the substantive offence, is equally good
evidence of persistence in leading a criminal life. The case of R. v. Yates[7] is an example of this kind.

Counsel for the appellant contended that Part
XXI of the Criminal Code  was not intended to apply in respect of the
commission of the sort of crimes committed by the appellant in this case, which
involved no violence and were not of a serious nature. In my opinion, if the
application of Part XXI is to be restricted in this way, that is a matter for
Parliament and not to be achieved by judicial decision. Section 660 , in
requiring, as a prerequisite of a person being found to be an habitual
criminal, the commission of three indictable offences for which there is a
liability to imprisonment for five years or more, has defined the nature of the
crimes in respect of which Part XXI can apply.

It was also contended, on behalf of the
appellant, in the alternative, that, even if he could properly be found to be
an habitual criminal, it was not proper to impose a sentence of preventive
detention upon him. In view of the fact that the majority of this Court have
decided that the evidence in this case fails to establish that the appellant
was persistently leading a criminal life, a necessary requirement to his being
found to be an habitual criminal within para. (a) of subs. (2) of
s. 660  of the Criminal Code , it is unnecessary for me to deal with
those submissions in these reasons.

In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

PIGEON J.:—I have had the opportunity of reading
the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice in this appeal. I concur in his
view that there is no evidence that the appellant, since his release early in
May 1963, was leading a criminal life, persistently or otherwise, except the
commission of the substantive offence on July 31, 1963, and that this is not of
itself sufficient evidence in the circumstances of this case. Therefore, I
would allow the appeal and quash the sentence of preventive detention.

MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL

Criminal law—Appeals—Jurisdiction—Leave to
appeal—Dismissal by Court of Appeal of application to extend time to appeal to
that Court front a sentence—Whether Supreme Court of Canada has jurisdiction to
grant leave to appeal—Penitentiary Act, R.S.C. 1962, c. 206,
s. 49(3)—Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1962, c. 269, s. 41—Criminal Code ,
1968-64 (Can.), c. 51, s. 597(1)(b).

The applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of
robbery with violence and was sentenced to imprisonment for ten years. On the
day he was sentenced and pursuant to s. 49(3) of the Penitentiary Act, he
signed a written notice waiving all rights of appeal. Subsequently, he applied
to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time to appeal to that Court from
his sentence. His application was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. He then
applied to this Court for leave to appeal from that refusal.

Held: The
application for leave to appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 235]

This would be a case to grant leave to appeal
if this Court had jurisdiction to do so. However, such jurisdiction cannot be
found either in the Criminal Code  or in s. 41 of the Supreme
Court Act. In Paul v. The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 452, this Court
reached the view that it had no jurisdiction to entertain an application for
leave to appeal from a judgment of a Court of Appeal refusing leave to appeal
in a criminal matter. A fortiori must a like view obtain in the case of
an application for leave to appeal from a judgment of a Court of Appeal
refusing an extension of time for appealing in a criminal matter and, more
particularly so, when the true question, sought to be brought for review
ultimately, relates to sentence.

Droit criminel—Appels—Juridiction—Permission
d’appeler—Rejet par la Cour d’appel d’une requête pour étendre les délais pour
appeler devant elle d’une sentence—La Cour suprême du Canada a-t-elle
juridiction pour accorder la permission d’appeler—Loi sur les pénitenciers,

259, art. 41—Code criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 697(l)(b).

Le requérant a plaidé coupable sur une
accusation de vol qualifié et a été condamné à l’emprisonnement pour dix ans.
Le jour où la sentence fut prononcée, et en conformité avec l’art. 49(3) de la Loi
sur les pénitenciers, il a signé un avis écrit en vertu duquel il se
désistait de tous ses droits d’appel. Subséquemment, il a présenté à la Cour
d’Appel une requête pour obtenir une extension des délais pour appeler devant
elle de sa sentence. Sa requête a été rejetée par la Cour d’Appel. Il a alors
présenté une requête devant cette Cour pour obtenir la permission d’en appeler
de ce refus.

Arrêt: La
requête pour permission d’appeler doit être rejetée.

Il s’agit ici d’un cas où, si cette Cour
avait juridiction de le faire, la permission d’appeler devrait être accordée.
Cependant, on ne peut pas trouver une telle juridiction ni dans le Code
criminel  ni dans l’art. 41 de la Loi sur la Cour suprême. Dans la
cause de Paul v. The Queen, [1960] R.C.S. 452, cette Cour a conclu
qu’elle n’avait pas la juridiction pour accorder une requête demandant la
permission d’appeler d’un jugement d’une Cour d’Appel ayant refusé la
permission d’appeler dans une matière criminelle. Un point de vue semblable
doit a fortiori prévaloir dans le cas d’une requête pour permission
d’appeler d’un jugement d’une Cour d’Appel refusant d’étendre les délais pour
appeler dans une matière criminelle et, encore plus, lorsque la question à
débattre en définitive concerne une sentence.

APPLICATION for leave to appeal from a
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, refusing an extension of time to
appeal from a sentence. Application dismissed.

B.A. Crane, for the applicant.

C. Meinhardt, for the respondent.

[Page 236]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

FAUTEUX J.:—Thomas William Hind applies for
leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which
dismissed his application for an extension of time to appeal to that Court from
a sentence of ten years’ imprisonment, imposed upon him by His Honour
Magistrate Kurata, upon a plea of guilty to a charge of robbery with violence.

In its reasons for judgment, the Court of Appeal
relates the circumstances of this bank robbery, refers to the criminal record
of the applicant and concludes that, having regard to his previous convictions
and the nature of the offence of which he was convicted, there was no merit in
the application. The Court also notes that the applicant had waived all rights
of appeal. In fact, on the day he was sentenced, he gave a written notice to
this effect, pursuant to s.49(3) of the Penitentiary Act, R.S.C. 1952,
c. 206, which provides, inter alia, that, upon such a notice, the time
limited for appeal shall be deemed to have expired. With respect to this
waiver, the circumstances attending its signature and the position taken by
applicant in this regard, the Court of Appeal makes these observations:

The accused had signed a waiver while
imprisoned at the Don Gaol and in his application for extension of time for
appealing he stated that he had signed the waiver ‘without being informed of
and without realizing I was signing away my rights: The signing of the waiver
took place late at night and I was caught unawares (sic) of what I was doing.’ Mr. G.A.
Taggart (an official of the Court of Appeal) communicated with the authorities
at the Don Gaol and was advised that the accused had had his rights fully
explained to him and that the waiver was signed not late at night but before
six o’clock in the afternoon.

The grounds upon which the applicant is seeking
leave to appeal to this Court are formulated as follows:

(1) Had the Court of Appeal jurisdiction to
enter upon the hearing of the application in the absence of the accused, who
was in custody, not represented by counsel, had submitted no written argument,
had requested permission to argue his application in person, and was not
notified of the date of the hearing of the application?

(2) Had the Court of Appeal jurisdiction to
adjudicate the question of fact surrounding the signing by the Applicant of a
waiver of his right to appeal in the absence of legally admissible evidence
regarding this issue?

[Page 237]

The criminal record of the applicant and the
nature of the crime for which he was convicted may or may not justify, as a
proper one, the sentence imposed upon him. This question is not before us and
is not, furthermore, susceptible, in law, to be entertained by this Court: Goldhar
v. The Queen[1]. We
are here concerned with an application for leave to appeal from a judgment of a
Court of Appeal refusing an extension of time for appealing to that Court
from a sentence.

Having considered the grounds raised in support
of the application and the material, in the record, which is relevant to these
grounds, I would be disposed to grant leave to appeal had this Court
jurisdiction to do so, having regard to the nature of the judgment a quo. It
is obvious that this Court has no jurisdiction to exercise a jurisdiction, over
a Court of Appeal, similar to that which the High Court exercises over inferior
tribunals, in certiorari proceedings. It is also clear that this Court
can only deal with a judgment of a Court of Appeal, by way of appeal, if
jurisdiction to do so can be found in some statutory enactment. Welch v. The
King[2];
Okalta Oils Limited v. The Minister of National Revenue[3]; Chagnon v. Normand[4]; William Cully v. François alias Francis
Ferdais[5]. With
respect to a judgment of the nature of the judgment a quo, such a
jurisdiction cannot be found either in the Criminal Code  or in
s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act. The provisions of s. 597(1) (b)
of the Criminal Code , upon which the application purports to be made,
have particularly no application in the matter. In Paul v. The Queen[6], this Court, having to consider
whether it had jurisdiction to entertain an application for leave to appeal
from a judgment of a Court of Appeal refusing leave to appeal in a criminal
matter, reached the view that it had none. A fortiori, in my
opinion, must a like view obtain in the case of an application for leave to
appeal from a judgment of a Court of Appeal refusing an extension of time for
appealing in a criminal matter and, more particularly so,

[Page 238]

when the true question, sought to be brought for
review ultimately, relates to sentence: The Queen v. J. Alepin & Frères
Ltée et al[7].

I would refuse the application for lack of
jurisdiction.

Application dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Common gaming house—Accused
officers of unincorporated bridge and social club—Bridge players charged a fee
for playing—Whether bridge a game of skill or of chance or of mixed chance and
skill—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 168(l)(f), 176(1).

The appellants, who were officers of an
unincorporated bridge and social club, were convicted of unlawfully keeping a
common gaming house, contrary to s. 176(1)  of the Criminal Code . The
game played was bridge; and fees were charged to the players. The Court of
Appeal upheld the conviction and ruled that bridge was a game of mixed chance
and skill. The appellants obtained leave to appeal to this Court where the
question raised was as to whether there was any evidence upon which the Court
of Appeal could find that the game of bridge was a game within the definition
of “game” in s. 168(1) (f) of the Criminal Code .

Held (Spence
J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.: Bridge is a game containing an element
of chance and an element of skill and is, therefore, a “game” within the
meaning of s. 168(1)(f) of the Code. It was clear that Parliament
intended to avoid the uncertainties involved in determining what is the
dominant element and deliberately chose to include in the definition of “game”
all mixed games as well as games of chance.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: In the game of bridge the only chance involved is the chance
in the dealing of the cards. The element of skill predominates in the playing
of the game. On that basis, the game of bridge is not a game of chance or mixed
chance and skill. The predominance of skill indicates that it should not be
considered as being within the words of the statute “a game of mixed chance and
skill”.

club de bridge non constitué en corporation accusés d’avoir tenu une maison de
jeu—Les joueurs de bridge tenus de payer pour jouer—Le bridge est-il un jeu
d’adresse ou de hasard ou un jeu où se mêlent le hasard et l’adresse—Code
criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 168(l)(f), 176(1).

Les appelants, qui étaient des dirigeants d’un
club de bridge non constitué en corporation, ont été déclarés coupables d’avoir
tenu illégalement une maison de jeu, contrairement à l’art. 176(1)  du Code
criminel . Le jeu en question était le bridge; et les joueurs devaient payer
pour le privilège de jouer. La Cour d’appel a maintenu la déclaration de
culpabilité et a statué que le bridge est un jeu où se mêlent le hasard et
l’adresse. Les appelants ont obtenu la permission d’appeler à cette Cour où la
question soulevée a été de savoir s’il y avait une preuve en vertu de laquelle
la Cour d’appel pouvait déclarer que le jeu de bridge est un jeu selon la
définition du mot «jeu» de l’art. 168(1)  (f) du Code criminel .

Arrêt: L’appel doit
être rejeté, le Juge Spence étant dissident.

Le Juge en Chef
Cartwright et les Juges Judson, Ritchie et Pigeon: Le bridge est un jeu qui
comporte un élément de hasard et un élément d’adresse et il est, en
conséquence, un «jeu» au sens de l’art. 168(1) (f) du Code. Il est clair
que le Parlement voulait éviter les incertitudes qui se présentent lorsqu’il
s’agit de déterminer quel est l’élément dominant et a délibérément choisi
d’inclure dans la définition de «jeu» au même titre que les jeux de hasard tous
ceux où se mêlent le hasard et l’adresse.

Le Juge Spence, dissident:
Le seul élément de hasard dans le jeu de bridge se trouve dans la
distribution des cartes. C’est l’élément d’adresse qui prédomine dans le jeu de
bridge. Par conséquent, le jeu de bridge n’est pas un jeu de hasard ni un jeu
où se mêlent le hasard et l’adresse. Le fait que l’adresse prédomine montre
bien qu’il ne doit pas être considéré comme compris dans le sens des mots du
statut «un jeu où se mêlent le hasard et l’adresse».

l’Ontario[1], confirmant la déclaration de culpabilité des trois appelants. Appel rejeté, le Juge Spence étant dissident.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario1, affirming the appellants’ conviction. Appeal
dismissed, Spence J. dissenting.

G. Arthur Martin, Q.C., for the
appellants.

Clay M. Powell, for the respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright C.J. and Judson,
Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

[Page 788]

PIGEON J.:—The appellants have been convicted on
the charge of keeping “a common gaming house”. The agreed statement of facts
shows that they were officers of an unincorporated bridge and social club. The
game played was bridge and the players were charged for playing it the
following fees:

For one pivot, which is the equivalent of
three rubbers, the charge of $1.00; for more than one pivot but less than two
pivots, the charge of $1.25; for two complete pivots, a charge of $1.50; for
more than two pivots but less than three pivots, a charge of $1.75; and for
three pivots or more, a maximum charge of $2.00.

The question raised on the appeal is the
following:

Was there any evidence upon which the Court
of Appeal for Ontario could find that the game of bridge was a “game” within
the definition of “game” in section 168(1)  (f) of the Criminal
Code ?

The following provisions of s. 168  of the Criminal
Code  should be considered:

168. (1) In this Part,

* * *

(d) “common gaming house”
means a place that is

(i) kept for gain to which persons resort
for the purpose of playing games; or

(ii) kept or used for the purpose of
playing games

(A) in which a bank is kept by one or more
but not all of the players,

(B) in which all or any portion of the bets
on or proceeds from a game is paid, directly or indirectly, to the keeper of
the place,

(C) in which, directly or indirectly, a fee
is charged by the players for the privilege of playing or participating in a
game or using gaming equipment, or

(D) in which the chances of winning are not
equally favourable to all persons who play the game, including the person, if
any, who conducts the game;

* * *

(f) “game” means a game of chance or
mixed chance and skill;

* * *

(2) A place is not a common gaming house
within the meaning of subparagraph (i) or clause (B) or (C) of subparagraph
(ii) of paragraph (d) of subsection (1)

(a) while it is occupied and used by
an incorporated bona fide social club or branch thereof if

(i) the whole or any portion of the bets on
or proceeds from games played therein is not directly or indirectly paid to the
keeper thereof, and

(ii) no fee in excess of ten cents an hour
or fifty cents a day is charged to persons for the right or privilege of
participating in the games played therein; or…

[Page 789]

A brief description of the game of bridge, more
precisely contract bridge, was given in evidence. It is sufficient to say that
it shows that the cards in the hands of each of the four players are determined
by chance but that afterwards the outcome of the game depends in substantial
measure upon the skill of the players in bidding and in playing their hands. In
this the only element of chance is that which results from the deal and the
fact that only the hand of the dummy is disclosed to the other players after
the bidding. The opinion of an expert bridge player heard as the only witness
was that, on the whole, the element of skill outweighs the element of chance.
Appellants’ contention is that this takes the game of bridge out of the
category of games of mixed chance and skill.

In considering this submission, it is convenient
to start by examining the language used in the enactment. Taken by themselves
the words used in the definition of “game” are not ambiguous. They apply to any
game of chance only or of mixed chance and skill. The word “mixed” implies no
indication of the respective proportions of the two elements. Nothing shows
that they must be equal or nearly so. Nothing indicates which is to be
preponderant. The first rule to observe in construing any legislative enactment
is that unless there is ambiguity, it is to be applied literally.

In the Encyclopedia Britannica, under the
heading “gaming and wagering”, one reads:

In England and the United States a general
distinction between lawful and unlawful gaming seems to be that where skill
predominates, the gaming is lawful; where chance does, it is unlawful (27 Corpus
Juris p. 969). A court must decide which is the predominant factor in the
case of each game in question. Cases show that one cannot rely on the record,
for it is full of reversals and contradictions.

It seems clear that the Parliament of Canada
sought to avoid the uncertainties involved in trying to ascertain the
predominant factor in mixed games by enacting that they would be treated in the
same way as games of pure chance. The law in force prior to the enactment of
the 1892 Criminal Code  was the Gaming Houses Act originally
enacted by 38 Vict., c. 41, reproduced in R.S.C. 1886, c. 158. As in the United Kingdom act, 17-18 Vict., c. 38,
“unlawful game” was not defined. From the decision of the Queen’s Bench
Division in Jenks v. Turpin[2], it
would appear that

[Page 790]

card games were considered “unlawful” if they
were games of chance, or games of chance and skill combined which cannot be
called games of mere skill.

When the first criminal code was enacted (55-56
Vict., c. 29), s. 196 read as follows:

196. A common gaming-house is—

(a) a house, room or place kept by
any person for gain, to which persons resort for the purpose of playing at any
game of chance; or

(b) a house, room or place
kept or used for playing therein at any game of chance, or any mixed game of
chance and skill, in which—

(i) a hand is kept by one or more of the
players exclusively of the others; or

(ii) in which any game is played the
chances of which are not alike favourable to all the players, including among
the players the banker or other person by whom the game is managed, or against
whom the game is managed, or against whom the other players stake, play or bet.

Three years later, chapter 40 of 58-59 Vict,
added to paragraph a “or at any mixed game of chance and skill”, thus
making the two paragraphs identical in that respect.

What is now subpara. B of para, (ii) of the
definition of “common gaming house” was added in 1919 by 8-9 Geo. V, c. 16.
Sections 4 and 5 of the same statute also replaced the words “any unlawful
game” by “any game of chance or any mixed game of chance and skill” in s. 985
(702 of the 1892 Criminal Code , 169 of the present Criminal Code ) and
made a similar change in s. 986  (703 of the 1892 Code). Those two
sections had their origin in ss. 4 and 8 of the Gaming Houses Act and
it is apparent that the purpose of the amendment was to preclude any
possibility of construction by reference to the law prior to the Criminal
Code .

What is now in substance subpara. (C) of para,
(ii) of the definition of “common gaming house” as well as subs. 2 of article
168  was added in 1938 (c. 44, s. 12). This came shortly after a decision of the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia, Rex v. Williamson[3], in
which it held that a certain club could no longer be considered as not
operating for gain as this Court had on different facts decided, a few years
before, in Bampton v. The King[4]. No
changes of substance have been made since that time and in the

[Page 791]

present Criminal Code , the maximum fees
for playing games in clubs remain those that were established by the 1938
statute.

To support their contention that in classifying
games, one has to ascertain what is the dominant element, appellants contend
that there is an element of chance in every game, even in those that are
admittedly games of skill such as chess, tennis and golf. This argument overlooks
the principle that statutes must be read in accordance with the usual and
accepted meaning of the words used. It is undoubtedly true that there are
chances involved in any human activity and that, statistically, results are
never predictable with complete certainty. However, when the statute speaks of
chance as opposed to skill, it is clear that it contemplates not the
unpredictables that may occasionally defeat skill but the systematic resort to
chance involved in many games such as the throw of dice, the deal of cards.

Among dictionary definitions, the following
appear to be of some interest:

Funk & Wagnalls New Standard
Dictionary:

The expression games of chance is
used to describe those contests the outcome of which is largely governed by
chance, as in cards, dice and gambling games generally; and in opposition to games
of skill the result of which depends largely upon the dexterity of the
contestant.

Bouvier’s Law Dictionary. Vo Gaming:

There are some games which depend
altogether upon skill, others which depend upon chance, and others which are of
a mixed nature. Billiards is an example of the first; lottery, of the second;
and backgammon, of the last.

Larousse XXe siècle:

Jeu de hasard. Jeu
dans lequel le hasard seul décide de la perte ou du gain.

Jeux d’adresse. Jeux
où l’adresse a la principale part, comme le billard, la balle, etc.

Robert Dictionnaire de la langue française:

Jeux mixtes, où le hasard peut être plus ou
moins corrigé à l’aide du calcul ou de certaines combinaisons.

Having cited the above definition of “jeux
mixtes” (mixed games) given by a French lexicographer, I must add that French
courts having to apply criminal code provisions aimed at games of chance (“jeux
de hasard”) only, have held those provisions applicable to games in

[Page 792]

which chance is the predominating element, not
to those in which skill predominates, and have placed bridge among the latter.

Dalloz Nouveau Répertoire. Vo Jeu.

N° 37. Depuis 1877, la jurisprudence attribue
le caractère de jeu de hasard à tous les jeux dans lesquels la chance prédomine
sur l’adresse et les combinaisons de l’intelligence. C’est ainsi qu’elle
considère comme jeux de hasard: le loto, le poker, le baccara, les petits
chevaux. Ne sont pas par contre considérés comme jeux de hasard ceux où
l’adresse prédomine tels que le billard, les échecs, le bridge ou le piquet.

Thus, it would appear that French courts
interpret “jeux de hasard” much as British and American courts interpret “games
of chance”. However, granting that, in the application of legislative
provisions aimed at games of chance (“jeux de hasard”) the generally accepted
view is that these include only games of pure chance or games in which chance
is the dominating element, it does not follow that all other games must be
considered as games of skill within the meaning of a code provision
contemplating not only games of chance, but games of mixed chance and skill as
well. To admit appellants’ contention that mixed games in which skill is a
dominant element are to be considered as games of skill really means to deprive
of any effect the words “or mixed chance and skill”.

In my opinion this would be contrary to
Parliament’s clearly expressed intention. It is clear that Parliament intended
to avoid the uncertainties involved in determining what is the dominant element
and deliberately chose to include in the definition of “game” all mixed games
as well as games of chance.

Concerning Wurtele J.’s dictum in The King v.
Fortier[5], it
must be noted that it is not only obiter but entirely unsupported by any
reference or analysis of the enactment.

I would dismiss the appeal.

SPENCE J. (dissenting):—This is an appeal
from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[6]
pronounced on July 4, 1967, wherein that Court dismissed an appeal from the conviction
of the three accused by the police magistrate at Toronto on September 22, 1966.

[Page 793]

The three accused were convicted on the charge
that:

within six months ending on the 12th day of
March, A.D. 1966, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, in the County of
York, unlawfully did keep a common gaming house situate and known as 3101
Bathurst Street, Suite 201, contrary to the Criminal Code .

Although the Crown, at the commencement of the
trial, adduced the evidence of detective John Frederick Ley-bourne, upon the
continuation of the trial on a later date, an agreed statement of facts was
submitted. That statement with the evidence of Mr. Eric Murray, who was
called as the only defence witness, comprised the complete record considered by
the learned magistrate. Mr. Murray was described by McLennan J.A., in the
Court of Appeal, as follows: “His qualifications as an expert on the game of
bridge are impressive.” In view of the offices held by Mr. Murray, as
taken from his own evidence, that description may be said to be, at any rate,
not put too strongly. Upon such evidence, and after the submission of argument
in writing, the learned magistrate convicted the three accused. That conviction
was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, McLennan J.A. giving in writing the
reasons of the Court.

The three accused applied for and obtained leave
to appeal to this Court, and served a notice of appeal in which was set out the
following ground of law:

Was there any evidence upon which the Court
of Appeal for Ontario could find that the game of bridge was a “game” within
the definition of “game” in section 168(1)  (f) of the Criminal
Code ?

McLennan J.A., in giving the reasons for
judgment of the Court of Appeal, said:

The narrow question is whether a card game
called “Bridge” is a game of skill, in which event the convictions cannot
stand, or whether it is a game of chance or of mixed chance and skill, and if
so, the convictions must be affirmed.

Section 176(1)  of the Criminal Code  provides:

176. (1) Every one who keeps a common
gaming house or common betting house is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for two years.

Section 168(1)  of the Criminal Code  provides,
in part:

168. (1) In this Part,

* * *

(d) “common gaming house”
means a place that is

(i) kept for gain to which persons resort
for the purpose of playing games; or

[Page 794]

(ii) kept or used for the purpose of
playing games

(A) in which a bank is kept by one or more
but not all of the players,

(B) in which all or any portion of the bets
on or proceeds from a game is paid, directly or indirectly, to the keeper of
the place,

(C) in which, directly or indirectly, a fee
is charged to or paid by the players for the privilege of playing or
participating in a game or using gaming equipment, or

(D) in which the chances of winning are not
equally favourable to all persons who play the game, including the person, if
any, who conducts the game;

* * *

(f) “game” means a game of chance or
mixed chance and skill;

It will be seen from a perusal of this
section that the ground of law cited by the appellants for the
determination of this Court is essentially the same question as that set out by
McLennan J.A. and which I have quoted above.

Counsel for the Crown before this Court took the
position that whether or not the game of bridge was one of skill, on the one
hand, or, on the other hand, a game of chance, or mixed chance and skill, was a
question of fact and not a question of law, that that question of fact had been
resolved by the magistrate and therefore there was no question of law to submit
to this Court. Counsel cited authority for that proposition: R. v. Thompson[7], per Lewis J. at p. 94. I am of the
opinion that such objection is not well based. What this Court must do is
interpret the words in s. 168(1)  (f) of the Criminal Code  “means
a game of chance or mixed chance and skill” and that interpretation is a
question of law. As I have said, the magistrate came to his decision upon
consideration of the agreed statement of facts and of the evidence of Mr. Murray.
That agreed statement of facts must be set out in full. It is as follows:

                                                     STATEMENT
OF FACTS

The North York Bridge and Social Club is
located at 3101 Bathurst Street, Toronto, in Suite 201 of an office building
and its name is listed as a tenant on the main directory in the lobby of the
building. The facilities and amenities provided by the Club are as indicated in
the photographs of the Club premises filed as exhibits. These facilities
include: one long room with card tables; an area where a restaurant is set up
with tables on which food may be served; a partitioned area used as an office;
and a room used as a lounge with television and other amenities. The

[Page 795]

Club premises are open from twelve noon
until midnight, and sometimes later, seven days per week. The premises, during
the six months prior to March 11, 1966 were used primarily for the playing of
card games.

During the period in question, the accused,
George Banks, who is aged 42, married, with one child, and is a local Toronto
business man was elected President of the Club. Mr. Banks is of previous
good character and has carried on business in the city of Toronto as a purse
and belt manufacturer for some twenty-five years. The accused, Leo Ross, who is
aged 32, married, and of previous good character, was employed as a Bridge
Instructor and was also elected an officer of the Club. Mr. Ross is a
recognized bridge expert in the city of Toronto and has worked as a Bridge
Instructor in several bridge clubs in the city. He was at various times in
charge of the premises. The accused, Floyd Dyson, was employed as a Bridge
Director sometime in the month of February 1966 and at a meeting of the Club
members was elected a member of the executive.

A copy of the minutes of the said meeting
have been filed as an exhibit. Mr. Dyson is of previous good character and
has been a recognized bridge player in the city of Toronto for a number of
years and has instructed in the game of bridge.

In accordance with various invoices and the
ledger book of the Club filed as exhibits, all of the furniture and fixtures in
and about the Club premises are owned by the North York Bridge and Social Club;
and were paid for by the North York Bridge and Social Club. The Club maintains
a bank account and all monies received are deposited to the credit of the Club
and all disbursements are paid out of Club funds. The four officers of the Club
are George Banks, Leo Ross, Floyd Dyson and Morris Taylor; and any two of the
said officers have signing privileges on the Club account for the disbursal of
funds.

Sometime during the month of December,
1964, the accused Banks contacted Sergeant of Detectives, John Wilson,
respecting the proposed operation of a bridge and social club. Sergeant Wilson
advised Banks as to the means of becoming incorporated.

On December 29, 1964, one Louis Silver, a
Solicitor acting on behalf of Banks and other proposed incorporators also
contacted Sergeant Wilson as to the proposed club. As a result,
Mr. Silver, on January 4, 1965, sent a letter to the Ontario Provincial
Secretary’s Office as to the proposed incorporation. Further correspondence was
exchanged between Silver and the Provincial Secretary’s Office leading to an
application for incorporation being submitted on January 14, 1965. Photostatic
copies of this correspondence have been filed as exhibits. A copy of the final
application for incorporation as submitted to the Provincial Secretary’s
department has also been filed as an exhibit.

In March of 1965, the Club began actual
operations, On September 24, 1965, the Provincial Secretary’s Office advised
Mr. Silver that it would not approve the application for incorporation at
that time. Meanwhile, on August 12, 1965, officers from the Morality Squad of
the Metropolitan Toronto Police force attended at the Club premises. It was
observed that there were approximately 40 men playing cards at the time. In
some of the games, the officers observed that there was an exchange of money
between players taking part in the games. It was learned that the Club charged
an annual membership fee of $35.00, an amount arrived at by the auditors of the
Club as being appropriate to cover the then expenses of running the Club and to
be adjusted as required for this purpose.

There were seven additional attendances by
various members of the Morality Squad from December 13, 1965 to and including
March 11, 1966.

[Page 796]

All these attendances were pursuant to
warrants to search filed as exhibits in this case. During all these
attendances, card games were observed to be played. All the visits made by the
police to the premises were made during the afternoon hours with the exception
of one visit which was made during the evening hours. During the afternoon
visits, the officers did not observe any bridge being played, however, at the
time of the evening attendances upon the premises, two games of bridge were in
fact in progress.

It would appear that the fees charged for
playing bridge are as follows: for one pivot, which is the equivalent of three
rubbers, the charge of $1.00; for more than one pivot but less than two pivots,
the charge of $1.25; for two complete pivots, a charge of $1.50, for more than
two pivots but less than three pivots, a charge of $1.75; and for three pivots
or more, a maximum charge of $2.00. The length of a rubber would be
approximately fifteen to twenty minutes, and consequently, an average pivot
would be about one hour.

On March 11, 1966, various articles on the
premises were seized pursuant to a warrant to search. Among those articles were
decks of playing cards. During the last seven visits, either the accused Banks
or the accused Ross was warned by the officers attending that in their opinion,
the operation of the Club violated the Canadian Criminal Code. It seems, on the
other hand, that Mr. Silver had previously advised Banks and other members
of the Club including Ross, that in his opinion, the operation of the Club on
the basis of instructions given to him were not in contravention of the
provisions of the Canadian Criminal Code.

The ledger of the Club was seized on March
11, 1966 and filed as an exhibit. This ledger was prepared by a chartered
accountant and is admittedly in good order. It has one sheet entitled “Card
Fees” which sheet reveals the amounts that were collected for card fees during
the time of the operation of the Club. The yearly dues supplemented by the
above card fees constituted the only revenues to the Club. The restaurant
facilities are provided to the operator of the restaurant and all profits
derived from the operation of the restaurant are retained by the operator
without any payment being made to the Club.

I shall attempt to summarize the evidence given
by Mr. Murray. Having outlined his qualifications, he very tersely
described the game of bridge in a few paragraphs as follows:

Q. Now, will you explain to the Court how
bridge is played and the basis on which it’s played?

A. Well, very briefly, bridge is a card
game and it’s played with the full deck of fifty-two cards. Thirteen cards are
dealt to each four players who participate in partnerships, one partnership
against the other.

The cards are dealt thirteen face down to
each player and thereafter the partnerships bid—the players bid in rotation,
attempting to reach certain contracts.

When a final contract has been determined,
then a person who has named the suit first becomes the declarer. His partner
spreads his hand face up on the table, which becomes the dummy, and the play
commences and you can play through by tricks, each trick consisting of four
cards, one card from each player’s hand, including the dummy, to each trick.
You bid and achieve game contracts or

[Page 797]

parts of contracts. With slam contracts you
receive points bonuses so that your end result is correlated into points, and
these points are kept on a tabulation.

Mr. Murray continued to testify that the
literature as to the game of bridge was voluminous consisting of many hundreds
of books and a very large number of magazines, monthly publications in Canada,
North America and throughout Europe. He pointed out that bridge was now played
on a basis of international competition, likening it to the Davis Cup in
tennis. Mr. Murray then dealt with the elements of chance and skill in the
playing of the game of bridge. He quite freely admitted that the dealing of the
cards was altogether a matter of chance. He described the deal as “that is
merely putting the weapons in the players’ hands” and continued, “well, once
the cards are dealt, the game is entirely skill, in my opinion”.
Mr. Murray contrasted the game of bridge with other card games such as
poker and pointed out that in the latter there was, what he described, as the
co-mingling throughout the game of skill and chance, and then testified, “this
isn’t true of bridge at all; once the cards are dealt it becomes a question of
conveying information between a partnership within the limits of the rules of
the game and then once the cards are dealt the dummy becomes a question of
playing the hand the most skilful way you can”. The latter part of this
sentence is an accurate quotation from the evidence as certified but the word
“dummy” must be an error. Mr. Murray was of the opinion that after the
deal theoretically there is no opportunity for chance to enter into the playing
of the game. He remarked that it was possible for an individual to play a hand
that, in his opinion, might be played badly and yet he might succeed, but that
had nothing to do with chance because a skilful player, even in a short game,
is going to succeed. Then, in cross-examination, he added: “Certainly over any
lengthy period of time it’s virtually a certainty, if the period of time is
long, you have control of the situation if you have skill”.

Mr. Murray gave as his opinion that in any
game there was some element of chance however small and he used as an example
two games which could easily be considered those of pure skill: firstly, a
chess game between masters, and, secondly, a finely played tennis match. In the
first case, he pointed out that the chance slamming of a door

[Page 798]

nearby when a chess master was in deep
concentration might disturb his thinking and cause him to make a poor move,
and, in the second case, a chance pebble on an otherwise perfectly prepared
court, might cause a ball to twist out of line. Those are both examples of what
I might term accidental hazards. An example had occurred to me of tournament
professional golf, where a bad lie on a fairway 285 yards away from the tee and
quite imperceptible might cause difficulty to even the most skilful and
cautious player.

McLennan J.A., in giving the reasons for the
Court of Appeal, expressed the view that the element of chance caused
originally by the deal continued to affect the play of the game thereafter. In
short, that there was the same co-mingling of chance and skill as Mr. Murray
had pointed out would occur in a poker game. The learned justice in appeal
said:

The play of the hand follows the bidding.
The play consists of each of the players, in some order or other, which has not
been described in the evidence, placing a card on the table with one from the
exposed hand and such cards constitute a “trick”. As each player has 13 cards
to start with there must be 13 tricks, won or lost, following each deal. One
must assume, because it was not otherwise stated, that the play of 13 tricks
following a deal is an individual game or part of a game. It seems a reasonable
inference from the reference in Mr. Murray’s evidence to “bidding” and
“contract” that the partnership making the highest bid undertakes or contracts
to win a certain number of the 13 tricks. The winning of a trick must be based
upon some values determined either by certain differences between the cards or
some rule of the game giving values to groups of cards. It is obvious that such
values, and they may be the same or different values from the bidding values,
must determine whether a trick is won or lost, and since what particular cards
and the playing values thereof each player has is determined by the chance of
the deal, the play of the cards or the way in which they can be played are
substantially affected by chance. The defensive play, no doubt, refers to the
play of the cards by the partnership opposing the partnership making the
highest bid and defensive play would also be substantially affected by chance
for the same reasons as the play.

With respect, these conclusions do not seem to
be in accordance with the evidence given by Mr. Murray. Once the cards
were, by chance, dealt thirteen to each player, then it was the task of each of
those players by the exercise of his skill to inform his partner with a very
considerable degree of accuracy what thirteen cards, which had been so dealt to
him by chance, he held in his hand. It is also the part of each pair of
players, by the process of bidding, to deceive their two opponents as to the
values of the cards

[Page 799]

which they held in their hands. When the bidding
was completed, it was the part of each of the players to so play the thirteen
cards in his hand as to arrive, in the case of those successful in the bidding,
at the contract which they had declared and in the case of those who were
unsuccessful in the bidding to defeat that contract.

I am of the opinion that once the cards had been
dealt then in the progress of the play all element of chance disappears and any
chance thereafter can only result from the deal. In these circumstances,
therefore, I believe it must be taken as established that in the game of bridge
the only chance involved is the chance in the dealing of the cards and that
certainly the element of skill predominates in the playing of the game. It is
the submission of counsel for the appellants that on that basis the game of
bridge is not “a game of chance or mixed chance and skill”.

I am of the view that there is some aid in
interpretation in the submission made to us by counsel for the appellants that
in a very complete research of prosecution as to gaming in Canada and the
United Kingdom he had not found a single case where the playing of a game of
bridge had been the subject of prosecution. There is a series of cases dealing
with other games where remarks have been made, perhaps obiter, by the courts
indicating that in the view of those courts the game of bridge was a game of
skill or even of pure skill. So, in Woolf v. Freeman[8], Macnaghten J. remarked at p. 181:

It is certainly lawful to play bridge. In
playing games of cards some skill is required. Bridge is a game of skill, but
whether poker is a game of skill is more questionable.

In D’Orio v. Leigh & Cuthbertson Ltd.[9], Ellis, Co. Ct. J., said at p. 156:

After the problem to be played is
determined by the method above stated, it appears that skill, if it is not
entirely necessary to win the game, predominates and the element of chance if,
not negligible, is a no greater factor than it is in any game of skill such as
bridge.

In re Betty Loeb Allen[10], Gibson C.J. said, at p. 281:

The rules of the game of bridge, which have
been established on an international basis, are set forth in encyclopedias and
other texts, and we are satisfied from the rules and from the many publications
on the subject that the game is predominantly one of skill.

[Page 800]

In Regina v. Thompson[11], Lewis J. said:

Bearing in mind that all games of cards are
made unlawful by statute and that the Gaming Act, 1845, did not repeal
specifically that part of the statute of 33 Hen. 8 which dealt with “carding”,
we are of opinion that the proper question for a jury, when dealing with a game
of cards, is: Is this a game of skill, i.e., a game in which the element of
chance is so slight as to render the game one which can properly be said to be
a game of mere skill?

(The underlining is my own.)

In my view, we are not assisted by a general
statement as to games of cards, such as made by Chancellor Boyd in The King
v. Laird[12]:

Euchre is a well known game at cards,
imported from the States and it is a game of chance.

Nor that made by Harvey C.J., dissenting, in the
Supreme Court of Alberta, in Rex v. Ring Hoy[13]:

The ordinary game of cards in which there
is a chance in the deal of the cards as to the value of the hands dealt to each
player is a game in which chance and skill are combined, and that is no doubt
what is meant by the expression “mixed game of chance and skill”.

It may be noted that the actual game involved in
this case was that of fan-tan which is surely a game of chance alone.

Counsel for the appellant stressed in his
argument to this Court a statement made by Wurtele J. in the Court of King’s
Bench, Appeal Side, in the Province of Quebec, in The King v. Fortier[14]:

A game of chance is one in which hazard
entirely predominates; and a mixed game of chance and skill is one in which the
element of hazard prevails notwithstanding the skill and adroitness of the
gamesters and the combinations brought to bear by their understanding and
ability.

It is the submission of counsel that the
interpretation of the words in s. 168(1)  of the Criminal Code  “or mixed
chance and skill” should therefore be that in order to fall within such
classification the game must be one in which chance prevails over skill or predominates
and that, therefore, a game of bridge in which any element of chance ends with
the deal and where that element of chance is overcome and very much
subordinated by the exhibition of skill thereafter should not be classed as
such a mixed game.

[Page 801]

Although in the Fortier case the game of
bridge was not being considered at all, certainly the element of predominance
of one factor or the other was considered by the learned justice in appeal to
be a telling and important element. On the basis that there must be some chance
in every game, as Mr. Murray testified, I am of the opinion that the
statements made in the Woolf case, in the D’Orio case, and in the
Betty Loeb Allen case support the contention that the predominance of
skill in the game of bridge should indicate that it is not properly considered
a game of mixed chance and skill. Indeed in the Betty Loeb Allen case a
conviction for permitting an illegal game to be played was quashed by the
Supreme Court of California for that exact reason. I have come to this
conclusion much assisted by the test stated by Lewis J., giving judgment for
the Court of Criminal Appeals in R. v. Thompson, supra, when he put the
question “Is this a game of skill, i.e., a game in which the element of chance
is so slight as to render the game one which can properly be said to be a game
of mere skill?”

The question arises, of course, that if a game
is a game of chance, when although skill is present chance predominates, then
what is the necessity of the words in the statute “a game of mixed chance and
skill”. The explanation may well be found in the judgment of Salmond J. in Weathered
v. Fitzgibbon[15]:

The term “game of chance” is, however,
ambiguous. It may be limited to games which are pure games of chance, or it may
also include games, such as most games of cards, which are games of chance and
skill combined. The question as to the true interpretation in this respect of
s. 10 of the Gaming Act was considered and determined by this Court in Scott
v. Jackson, [1911] N.Z.L.R. 1025. There, if I understand the decision
aright, it was held that the term “game of chance” as used in s. 10 of the
Gaming Act is limited to games of pure chance, and does not include games of
mixed chance and skill. This decision is chiefly based on the provisions in
pari materia of s. 163 of the Crimes Act, 1908, defining the indictable
offence of keeping a common gaming‑house, in which a distinction is drawn
by the Legislature between games of chance and games of mixed chance and skill.
It was held accordingly that the term “game of chance” as used in the
corresponding provisions of the Gaming Act was similarly used by the
Legislature as distinguished from games in which chance was combined with
skill. By a game of pure chance I understand to be meant a game in which there
is either no element of skill whatever, or an element of skill so unsubstantial
and unimportant that for all practical purposes the game is one of chance
exclusively. All such games are unlawful games within the meaning of s. 10 of the
Gaming Act. But this section has no

[Page 802]

application to games of mixed skill and
chance—that is to say, to games in which there exists a substantially operative
element of skill—for example, most games of cards.

The legislator, therefore, desiring to include
in the prohibition not only games of pure chance but games where, although a
degree of skill was present, the predominating element was chance, used the
words as they appear in the present statute. I am none the less of the opinion
that in the game of bridge, where the element of skill far outweighs any
element of chance and where in fact the element of chance is a mere
coincidental preliminary, it should not be considered as being within the words
of the statute “a game of mixed chance and skill”.

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and
quash the conviction.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Jury trial—Possession of
housebreaking instruments—Whether trial judge’s instructions to jury amounted
to comment on failure of accused to testify—Whether new trial only
remedy—Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 307, s. 4(5)—Criminal Code , 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, ss. 295(1), 592(1)(b)(iii).

The appellants were convicted of possession
of housebreaking instruments, contrary to s. 295(1)  of the Criminal Code . The
trial judge instructed the jury that they did not have to accept the
explanations given to the police by the accused because they had not been given
under oath. Upon counsel for the accused taking objection to that portion of
the charge, the trial judge recharged the jury that they were not to take the
previous charge as meaning that the onus was upon the accused to testify, and
that the jury was not to be influenced by their failure to testify. It was
argued before the Court of Appeal that these observations offended against the

[Page 803]

provisions of s. 4(5) of the Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 307, as being a comment on the failure of the
accused to testify, and that a new trial should necessarily be had. The Court
of Appeal, by a majority judgment, affirmed the conviction. The accused
appealed to this Court.

Held (Hall and
Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux,
Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The language used by the trial judge was not so much a
“comment” on the failure of the accused to testify as a statement of their
right to refrain from doing so, and it should not be taken to have been the
intention of Parliament in enacting s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act  to
preclude judges from explaining to juries the law with respect to the rights of
accused persons in this regard. The remarks of the judge viewed in context and
on a reasonable interpretation do not amount to a comment in breach of the
section. That section was enacted for the protection of accused persons against
the danger of having their right not to testify presented to the jury in such
fashion as to suggest that their silence is being used as a cloak for their
guilt. It would be “most naive” to ignore the fact that when an accused fails
to testify, there must be at least some jurors who say to themselves “if he
didn’t do it, why didn’t he say so”. It is for this reason that it is of the
greatest importance that a trial judge should remain unhampered in his right to
point out to the jury that there is no onus on the accused to prove his
innocence by going into the witness box. To construe s. 4(5)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  as interfering with that right not to testify would run
contrary to the purpose of the section itself.

Even if the comment was a violation of s.
4(5) , this was a proper case for the application of s. 592(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code .

Per Hall and
Spence JJ., dissenting: The trial judge’s explanations clearly violated
s. 4(5)  of the Canada
Evidence Act . Consequently, an error fatal to the
validity of the proceedings has occurred and the remedy is not in trying to
speculate whether it had a material or no effect on the jury, but in a new
trial.

art. 4(5)—Code criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 295(1), 592(1)(b)(iii).

Les appelants ont été déclarés coupables
d’avoir eu en leur possession des instruments d’effraction, contrairement à
l’art. 295(1)  du Code criminel . Dans ses directives, le juge au procès a
dit aux jurés qu’ils n’étaient pas obligés d’accepter les explications données à
la police par les accusés parce que ces explications n’avaient pas été données
sous serment. Lorsque le procureur des accusés s’est objecté à cette partie des
directives, le juge au procès, dans de nouvelles directives, a dit aux jurés
qu’ils ne devaient pas considérer les instructions antérieures comme voulant
dire qu’il incombait à l’accusé de témoigner, et que les jurés ne devaient pas
être influencés par l’abstention des accusés de témoigner. En Cour d’appel, on
a soutenu

[Page 804]

que ces remarques allaient à l’encontre des
dispositions de l’art. 4(5) de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada, S.R.C.
1952, c. 307, comme étant un commentaire sur l’abstention des accusés de
témoigner, et qu’il fallait nécessairement un nouveau procès. La Cour d’appel,
par un jugement majoritaire, a confirmé la déclaration de culpabilité. Les
accusés en ont appelé à cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté, les Juges Hall et Spence étant dissidents.

Les Juges
Fauteux, Judson et Ritchie: Le langage employé par le juge au procès était
plutôt un énoncé du droit des accusés de s’abstenir de témoigner qu’un
«commentaire» sur leur abstention de le faire, et on ne doit pas considérer que
le Parlement avait l’intention, par l’art. 4(5)  de la Loi sur la preuve au
Canada , d’empêcher les juges d’expliquer au jury la loi concernant les
droits des accusés à cet égard. Les remarques du juge, considérées dans leur
contexte et raisonnablement interprétées, ne sont pas un commentaire en
violation de l’article. Le but de cet article est de protéger les accusés
contre le danger d’avoir leur droit de ne pas témoigner présenté au jury de
manière à suggérer que leur silence est utilisé pour masquer leur culpabilité.
On serait des plus naïfs si on mettait de côté le fait que lorsqu’un accusé ne
témoigne pas il y a au moins quelquesuns des jurés qui se disent «s’il ne l’a
pas fait, pourquoi ne le dit-il pas». C’est pour cette raison qu’il est de la
plus grande importance que le juge au procès soit libre de signaler au jury que
l’accusé n’a pas le fardeau d’établir son innocence en témoignant. Interpréter
l’art. 4(5)  de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada  comme portant atteinte à
ce droit de ne pas témoigner irait à l’encontre du but de l’article lui-même.

Même si le commentaire était une violation de
l’art. 4(5) , il s’agit ici d’un cas où l’on doit appliquer l’art. 592(1) (b)(iii)
du Code criminel .

Les Juges Hall
et Spence, dissidents: Les explications données par le juge au procès
étaient clairement une violation de l’art. 4(5)  de la Loi sur la preuve au
Canada . En conséquence, il y a eu une erreur fatale à la validité des
procédures et le remède est un nouveau procès et non pas de se demander si cela
a influencé le jury, substantiellement ou non.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’appel de
l’Ontario[1], confirmant la déclaration de culpabilité prononcée contre les
appelants. Appel rejeté, les Juges Hall et Spence étant
dissidents.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario1, affirming the appellants’ conviction. Appeal
dismissed, Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting.

John O’Driscoll, for the appellants.

Ronald G. Thomas, for the respondent.

[Page 805]

The judgment of Fauteux, Judson and Ritchie JJ.
was delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 affirming the conviction of the
appellants on a charge that they did, without lawful excuse, have in their
possession instruments for housebreaking contrary to s. 295 (1)  of the Criminal
Code .

It should be said at the outset that this is an
appeal brought pursuant to the provisions of s. 597(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code  and that the jurisdiction of this Court rests upon the dissenting
opinion of Mr. Justice Wells in the Court of Appeal for Ontario.

The facts which gave rise to this prosecution
were that at 12:35 a.m. on September 3, 1966, the appellant Beer was sitting behind the steering wheel of a
motor vehicle owned by his wife which was parked at the rear of some dry
cleaning premises in Sault Ste. Marie. The head lights were turned off, the
motor was running and the appellant McConnell was some 60 feet away under an
open window of the premises in question. A search of the motor vehicle revealed
an iron bar, a screw driver and a table knife either on or under the front seat
of the vehicle. Beer admitted ownership of these instruments and told the
police that the screw driver was being used because they were having trouble
with the ignition and that the bar was used for taking off hub caps.
Mrs. Beer gave evidence to the effect that her husband had been using the
screw driver to work on the car and that the bar had been moved from the trunk
to underneath the front seat at the time of a camping trip during the previous
summer when the table knife had also been used. The arrangements that Beer may
have made during the previous summer do not appear to me to be an explanation
for having the tools where they were found at the time and place in question,
and the fact that at the time of the arrest, a complete jack, including a wheel
nut wrench with a chisel affair on the other end of it was found in the back
trunk of the car, appears to me to weaken considerably the explanation for the
presence of the bar under the front seat. In addition to this, Beer’s evidence
in explanation of the presence of the bar was elicited on cross-examination of
a Crown witness and is

[Page 806]

self-serving so that in my view its
admissibility was highly questionable.

McConnell admitted his association with Beer but
explained his presence under the open window of the dry cleaning establishment
by saying that he was relieving himself. While this may afford a reason for his
being where he was, it does not seem to me to afford any explanation for being
associated with Beer in the possession of the instruments in question.

I do not think that it is open to question that
the instruments found by the police were capable of being used for
housebreaking and it appears to me desirable in this regard to refer to the
final paragraph of the reasons for judgment of Judson J., with which the
majority of this Court concurred, in Tupper v. The Queen[2] where he spoke of the effect of s.
295(1)  of the Criminal Code . Mr. Justice Judson there said:

Once possession of an instrument capable of
being used for housebreaking has been shown, the burden shifts to the accused
to show on a balance of probabilities that there was lawful excuse for
possession of the instrument at the time and place in question.

In the present case neither of the accused gave
evidence at the trial, and in the course of his charge the learned trial judge
pointed out to the jury that they did not have to accept the unsworn
explanation which McConnell had given to the police for his presence under the
open window.

Upon counsel for the accused taking objection to
this portion of the charge, the learned trial judge recalled the jury and said:

Gentlemen of the Jury, it was pointed out
that in the course of my charge to you I stated that you did not have to accept
the explanations of the accused because those explanations were not made under
oath. You are not to take it from that that there is any onus upon the accused
to prove their innocence by going into the witness box and testifying in their
defence. There is no such onus on these or any accused persons in any criminal
trial of proving their innocence by going into the witness box and testifying
in their own defence. You are not to be influenced in your decision by either
of the accused not going into the witness box and testifying, but the Court
does point out that these explanations were given and when made were not made
under oath and it is not only for that reason alone but for any other number of
reasons that may occur to you, to decide if you will accept these explanations.

It was argued before the Court of Appeal, as it
was before this Court, that these observations offended against

[Page 807]

the provision of s. 4(5)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  and that a new trial should accordingly be had.
Section 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act  reads as follows:

The failure of the person charged or of the
wife or husband of such person to testify shall not be made the subject of
comment by the judge or by counsel for the prosecution.

Mr. Justice Evans, in the course of his
reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal, with which MacKay J.A. agreed,
expressed himself in the following terms:

The principle underlying the prohibition in
Section 4(5)  is the protection of the accused. Originally it was part of
the same enactment by which the disability of an accused person to testify was
removed. R. v. Romano 24 C.C.C. 30. In a jury case when an accused does
not testify on his own behalf, this fact is immediately known to the jury and
one would be most naive to believe that it is not considered by them in their
deliberations. To hold that an accidental slip or an innocuous statement
indicating the failure of the accused to testify must ipso facto result
in a reversible error does violence to the intent and meaning of the Statute.

I am of the opinion that the impugned
statement must be considered solely in the light of possible prejudice to the
accused. If there is no possibility of prejudice then it does not amount to
misdirection because it is a statement of law and amounts to an explanation of
the legal rights of an accused who has already adopted a position of which the
jury is aware. The absence of such a legal explanation might well react
unfavourably to the accused particularly when defence counsel fails to explain
to the jury his client’s legal right to remain silent.

* *
*

In the present case I have carefully
considered the “comment” objected to and I am unable to find that it could be
considered in any way prejudicial to the appellants. It is favourable to the
accused since it is an explanation of the legal right of the accused persons to
adopt the position which they did adopt coupled with a clear warning by the
Trial Judge that no prejudicial inference is to be drawn from their election to
remain out of the witness box. There is no suggestion in the remarks of the
Trial Judge that there was evidence peculiarly within the knowledge of the
appellants which they could give and which they failed to give.

Mr. Justice Evans did, however, express the
view that “once it was determined that the comment violated the statutory
provisions it was a fatal defect and a new trial was mandatory”. Although
Mr. Justice MacKay agreed with Evans J.A. that the remarks of the trial
judge did not constitute a “comment” so as to offend against s. 4(5) , he did
not agree that the effect of such a comment, if made, was to make “a new trial
mandatory.” Mr. Justice MacKay said:

I desire, however, to express the view that
even if the comments of the learned trial judge in reference to the appellants
not giving evidence

[Page 808]

could be construed as offending against
section 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act , that this would be a
proper case to apply the provisions of section 592(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code .

In his dissenting opinion, Mr. Justice
Wells took the view that in recharging the jury as he did the learned trial
judge had made a direct comment on the failure of the accused to testify and
that in so doing he had violated the provisions of s. 4(5)  of the Canada
Evidence Act , and that a new trial was accordingly necessary.
Mr. Justice Wells, who found the matter to be concluded by the decision of
this Court in Bigaouette v. The King[3],
expressed himself as follows:

Looking at what the learned trial judge
said in the case at bar, it would appear to me that in this case there is a
much more direct comment on the failure of the accused to testify in their own
defence. It is not a mere pointing out that certain matters are not
contradicted, it deals directly with their failure to testify at their trial.
In my opinion, this direct comment comes squarely within the prohibition of the
Statute and renders a new trial necessary. The matter is decisively concluded
in my opinion by the judgment of the late Chief Justice which I have quoted
from in Bigaouette v. The King.

In the Bigaouette case Sir Lyman Duff, at
p. 114, speaking on behalf on this Court, adopted the law as being

… correctly stated in the judgment of
Mr. Justice Stewart in Rex v. Gallagher, 1922 37 C.C.C. 83 in these
words:

‘…it is not what the judge intended but
what his words as uttered would convey to the minds of a jury which is the
decisive matter. Even if the matter were evenly balanced, which I think it is
not, and the language used were merely just as capable of the one meaning as
the other, the position would be that the jury would be as likely to take the
words in the sense in which it was forbidden to use them as in the innocuous
sense and in such circumstances I think the error would be fatal.’

It is, I think, pertinent to observe that at the
conclusion of his reasons for judgment in Wright v. The King[4] Chief Justice Rinfret, speaking for
the majority of this Court, said:

We think the Bigaouette case
certainly goes as far on that subject as this Court would care to go…

In the Bigaouette case the accused was
charged with the murder of his mother and he admitted that he was in the house
at the time when the death was said to have

[Page 809]

occurred and in the Gallagher case the
accused was the last person known to have been seen with the deceased whose
murder he was accused of having committed; in each case the learned trial judge
was found to have commented on the accused’s failure to testify in explanation
of these circumstances. There is nothing of this kind in the present case. Here
the language used by the trial judge to which objection is taken was not so
much a “comment” on the failure of the persons charged to testify as a
statement of their right to refrain from doing so, and it does not appear to me
that it should be taken to have been the intention of Parliament in enacting s.
4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act  to preclude judges from explaining to
juries the law with respect to the rights of accused persons in this regard. I
am accordingly in agreement with Mr. Justice Evans “that the remarks of
the trial judge viewed in context and on a reasonable interpretation do not
amount to a comment in breach of the section”.

I think it is to be assumed that the
section in question was enacted for the protection of accused persons
against the danger of having their right not to testify presented to the jury
in such fashion as to suggest that their silence is being used as a cloak for
their guilt.

As has been indicated by Mr. Justice Evans,
it would be “most naive” to ignore the fact that when an accused fails to
testify after some evidence of guilt has been tendered against him by the
Crown, there must be at least some jurors who say to themselves “If he didn’t
do it, why didn’t he say so”. It is for this reason that it seems to me to be
of the greatest importance that a trial judge should remain unhampered in his
right to point out to the jury, when the occasion arises to do so in order to
protect the rights of the accused, that there is no onus on the accused to
prove his innocence by going into the witness box. To construe s. 4(5)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  as interfering with that right would, in my opinion, run
contrary to the purpose of the section itself.

It was stressed in the course of the argument
that by referring to the fact that the explanations of the accused were not
given under oath, the trial judge was indirectly commenting on their failure to
testify, and in my view this

[Page 810]

reasoning runs contrary to the decision of this
Court in Kelly v. The King[5] where
the accused had not gone onto the witness stand but had been permitted to
address the jury and in so doing had made a number of statements of fact. In
the course of his charge to the jury the trial judge said: (See 27 C.C.C. 138
at 166 and 167):

But as far as facts are concerned the only
way to bring them properly before a jury is to bring them out from the lips of
the witnesses or documents submitted to you which have been proved. You should
have the guarantee of the religious sanction of an oath backing up the
statement before you should consider them. I am bound to say that, because I do
not know whether I was quite justified in allowing the accused to make several
of the statements he made. Any statements of facts made by the accused you
should dispel from your minds.

And he later said:

These matters could have been brought out
in cross-examination and have been brought out from certain witnesses. I am not
laying stress upon that not being done, but laying stress upon the facts laid
before you without your having the sanction of an oath to commend them to you.
These statements should be expunged from your mind.

It will be remembered that the facts to which
the judge was referring were facts laid before the jury in the unsworn
statement of the accused. One of the points raised in the case reserved by the
trial judge and which was argued on the appeal to this Court was whether this
language constituted a comment on the failure of the accused to testify,
contrary to s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act , and in the course of the
reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf of the majority of the Court,
Mr. Justice Anglin said, at page 263:

There was no comment whatever on the
failure of the accused to testify. His right to do so was not mentioned during
the trial. The learned judge merely discharged his duty in warning the jury
against treating the statement which he had allowed the accused to make as the
equivalent of sworn testimony;…

In the same case Mr. Justice Duff, speaking
for himself at page 259, said:

… I can find nothing, which, when fairly
construed, amounts to such comment within the meaning of the statutory
prohibition.

If any further authority were needed, I would
adopt the language used by Mr. Justice Longley in The King v.

[Page 811]

McLean[6] as being applicable to the present case. In that case the trial
judge, in the course of his charge to the jury, had said:

Now you are not to consider the prisoner at
all in this matter. He has the right to do as he did; that is to sit there and
say nothing…

and Mr. Justice Longley, speaking on an
equal division of the Court, said:

I am aware that in both Canada and the
United States decisions have gone very far in the direction of shutting out
anything which bore the semblance of comment on the part of judge or counsel in
respect of the non-testifying of the prisoner on his trial. But it seems to me
there should be some limit to this doctrine, and I think the limit should be
where the reference could not be construed as unfavorable to the prisoner, nor
its effect as occasioning any substantial wrong or miscarriage on the trial.
What the learned judge said, on this trial, could only be regarded, I think as
favorable to the prisoner, since it instructed the jury that the prisoner had a
clear right, under the law, to remain silent.

As I have indicated, I agree with the opinion of
the majority of the Court of Appeal that the remarks of the trial judge to
which objection is here taken do not constitute a “comment” in contravention of
s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act , but I am bound to say, with the
greatest respect for those who may hold a contrary view, that I do not agree
with the suggestion in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Evans to
the effect that the case of Bigaouette v. The King[7] is to be treated as authority for
the proposition that whenever a breach of that section occurs it
constitutes a “fatal defect” in the proceedings making a new trial “mandatory”
so that the curative provisions of s. 592(1) (b)(iii) cannot be applied.

No one would, I think, question the binding
effect of the decision rendered by Sir Lyman Duff, C.J., on behalf of this
Court in the Bigaouette case. That was a case of murder in which the
evidence was almost entirely circumstantial and the language used by the
learned trial judge, which was construed as relating “to the failure of the
accused to testify” was, in my opinion, such that it could not have been said
with any certainty whether or not the jury would necessarily have convicted on
the circumstantial evidence if the offending words had been omitted. It was no
doubt for this reason that the Chief Justice made

[Page 812]

no mention whatever of the provisions of the
curative section of the Criminal Code  What the Chief Justice did
say before adopting the language used by Mr. Justice Stuart in Gallagher’s
case, was:

It seems to be reasonably clear that,
according to the interpretation which would appear to the jury as the more
natural and probable one, the comment implied in this passage upon the failure
of la defense to explain who committed the murder would, having regard
to the circumstances emphasized by the learned trial judge, be this, namely,
that it related to the failure of the accused to testify upon that subject at
the trial. It is conceivable, of course, that such language might be understood
as relating to a failure to give an explanation to police officers or others;
but the language of the charge is so easily and naturally capable of being
understood in the other way, that it seems plainly obnoxious to the enactment
referred to, subs. 5 of s. 4, R.S.C., c. 145.

I do not think that the meaning of any of the
language employed by the Chief Justice in that case should be so enlarged as to
be treated as authority for the general proposition that all “comments” which
contravene s. 4(5) , however innocuous they may be, are “fatal” in the sense
that they are not curable by the application of the curative provisions of s.
592(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code . As is indicated in the
excerpt above quoted from the reasons for judgment of Rinfret C.J. in Wright
v. The King, the case of Bigaouette marks the limit to which “this
Court would care to go” on the subject.

It is true that since the Bigaouette case
three cases have been decided in the Court of Appeal of Ontario which hold that
the provisions of s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act  constitute an
arbitrary rule leaving no discretion to the court and that any breach of that
section is fatal to the proceedings. These cases are Rex v. McNulty and
Courtney[8] and
Reg. v. Groulx and Nevers[9] and
R. v. Lizotte[10], but
the contrary view has been adopted in British Columbia in R. v. Darlyn[11] and in New Brunswick in Rex v.
MacDonald[12] and
in Ayles v. The Queen[13]. In
the case of Molleur v. The King[14],
which was decided in 1948, Mr. Justice Casey, speaking on behalf of
the majority of the

[Page 813]

Quebec Court of King’s Bench at page 43, applied
the curative section where crown counsel had made a comment on the failure
of the accused to testify.

I am in agreement with the decision in the last
three cited cases and would adopt the view expressed by Mr. Justice MacKay
in the Court of Appeal in the present case to the effect that the provisions of
s. 592(1)  of the Criminal Code  could be invoked in such a case as this
even if the comment had been found to be in breach of s. 4(5)  of the Canada
Evidence Act . The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code  read as
follows:

592. (1) On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction, the Court of Appeal

(a) may allow the appeal where it is
of the opinion that…

(ii) the judgment of the trial court should
be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law,…

(b) may dismiss the appeal where…

(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of
the opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a)
the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the
opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred;…

There are a number of authorities concerned with
the proper application of s. 592(1) (b)(iii) which are to the effect that
once an error in law has been found to have occurred at the trial, the onus
resting upon the Crown is to satisfy the Court that the verdict would
necessarily have been the same if such error had not occurred.

It appears to me that if the remarks of the
learned trial judge in the present case could have been construed as a
“comment” which offended against the provisions of s. 4(5) , his error would
have been an error in law and I can see no logical reason why the provisions of
s. 592(1) (b)(iii) should not apply to an error in law which consists in
the breach of the provisions of the Canada Evidence Act  in the same way
as they would apply to any other such error.

As I do not consider that the remarks made by
the learned trial judge concerning the accused’s right to keep silent were
obnoxious to the statutory direction contained in s. 4(5)  of the Canada
Evidence Act , I would dismiss this appeal on that ground, but I am in any
event satisfied

[Page 814]

that even if they could have been so construed,
they could not have had any effect upon the outcome in the present case.

The judgment of Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered
by

HALL J. (dissenting):—The facts are set out in
the reasons of my brother Ritchie and I agree that the learned trial judge’s
charge to the jury was unexceptional in all but the one material respect in
which, when he recalled the jury, he said:

Gentlemen of the Jury, it was pointed out
that in the course of my charge to you I stated that you did not have to accept
the explanations of the accused because those explanations were not made under
oath. You are not to take it from that that there is any onus upon the accused
to prove their innocence by going into the witness box and testifying in their
defence. There is no such onus on these or any accused persons in any criminal
trial of proving their innocence by going into the witness box and testifying in
their own defence. You are not to be influenced in your decision by either of
the accused not going into the witness box and testifying, but the Court does
point out that these explanations were given and when made were not made under
oath and it is not only for that reason alone, but for any number of reasons
that may occur to you, to decide if you will accept those explanations.

He recalled the jury because counsel for the
accused, at the conclusion of the charge, had said:

Your Honour, you said when referring to the
explanation of Mr. McConnell that the statement was not made under oath,
and you said it is up to you to decide, was he there for that reason only. I
believe it is not incumbent upon the accused to prove that was the only reason.
The onus would be on the Crown to prove that that was not the only reason.

Counsel’s objection to the charge related to the
following:

The explanations of Mr. Beer were not
made under oath and you do not have to accept them. Consider the circumstances
under which they were made and then decide. If you have any reasonable doubt,
then you must give the accused the benefit of that doubt.

In my view there was no reason to recall the
jury because the sentences just quoted did not call for any further
explanation. The judge was merely stating what was the fact, namely, that the
accused were not under oath when they gave their explanations to the police
officers when first seen and that, of course, was clearly apparent to everyone.
Statements made by an accused in circumstances which require him to make an
immediate explanation, as was the case here, are clearly admissible and cannot,
in the circumstances, be made under oath and, therefore, it is up

[Page 815]

to the jury to decide whether or not the
explanation is to be believed or is one that might probably be true. The
learned judge in the present case had said towards the close of his charge:

Thirdly, if in possession of the accused,
if they are instruments of housebreaking, did the accused give you an
explanation of having them with lawful excuse which might probably be true?

If you have any reasonable doubt as to
whether the explanation is probably true, you must give the accused the benefit
of that doubt.

However, having recalled the jury, the learned
judge then, in my view, clearly violated s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act  when
he said:

Gentlemen of the Jury, it was pointed out
that in the course of my charge to you I stated that you did not have to accept
the explanations of the accused because those explanations were not made under
oath. You are not to take it from that that there is any onus upon the
accused to prove their innocence by going into the witness box and testifying
in their defence. There is no such onus on these or any accused persons in any
criminal trial of proving their innocence by going into the witness box and
testifying in their own defence. You are not to be influenced in your
decision by either of the accused not going into the witness box and
testifying, but the Court does point out that these explanations were given and
when made were not made under oath and it is not only for that reason alone,
but for any number of reasons that may occur to you, to decide if you will
accept these explanations.

(Emphasis added.)

Section 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act  reads:

(5) The failure of the person charged, or
of the wife or husband of such person, to testify, shall not be made the
subject of comment by the judge, or by counsel for the prosecution. R.S., c.
59, s. 4; 1948, c. 33, s. 1; 1953-54, c. 51, s. 749.

The question for decision is whether the learned
judge, having contravened the provisions of s. 4(5)  above, the error is fatal
to the validity of the trial.

Courts of appeal in Canada have taken opposite
views on this question. The decisions of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Rex
v. McNulty and Courtney[15] and
Reg. v. Groulx and Nevers[16] and
in Reg. v. Lizotte[17] are
to the effect that the curative provisions of s. 592(1) (b)(iii) have no
application where there has been a breach of the section. The contrary view was
expressed in British

[Page 816]

Columbia in R. v. Darlyn[18] and in New Brunswick in R. v. Ayles[19] and the same view was accepted in Rex
v. MacDonald[20] and Moleur
v. The King[21].

The matter has been dealt with in this Court in
several cases including Bigaouette v. The King[22] and in Wright v. The King[23]. In the Bigaouette case, Sir Lyman
Duff, at p. 114, speaking for the Court, said:

It seems to be reasonably clear that,
according to the interpretation which would appear to the jury as the more
natural and probable one, the comment implied in this passage upon the failure
of la défense to explain who committed the murder would, having regard
to the circumstances emphasized by the learned trial judge, be this, namely,
that it related to the failure of the accused to testify upon that subject at
the trial. It is conceivable, of course, that such language might be understood
as relating to a failure to give an explanation to police officers or others;
but the language of the charge is so easily and naturally capable of being
understood in the other way, that it seems plainly obnoxious to the enactment
referred to, subs. 5 of s. 4, R.S.C, c. 145. The law, in our opinion, is
correctly stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Stuart in Rex v.
Gallagher, (1922) 37 Can. Cr. C. 83, in these words:

…it is not what the judge intended but what
his words as uttered would convey to the minds of the jury which is the
decisive matter. Even if the matter were evenly balanced, which I think it is
not, and the language used were merely just as capable of the one meaning as
the other, the position would be that the jury would be as likely to take the
words in the sense in which it was forbidden to use them as in the innocuous
sense and in such circumstances I think the error would be fatal.

There must be a new trial.

In the Wright case, Chief Justice
Rinfret, speaking for the majority of the Court, said:

We think the Bigaouette case (1927)
S.C.R. 112 certainly goes as far on that subject as this Court would care to go
and, like the majority of the Court of Appeal, we are unable to find that the
remarks here complained of could have any effect on the jury as being a comment
“obnoxious to the statutory direction”.

The pith of the decision in Wright was
that what the learned trial judge had said was not a “comment” within the
meaning of s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act . The phrase “obnoxious to
the statutory direction” used within quotation marks by Rinfret C.J.C. in the
above extract

[Page 817]

from his reasons obviously referred to the phrase
used by Duff J. (later C.J.C.) in Bigaouette as “plainly obnoxious to
the enactment”. The Wright case is authority only for the proposition
that what was said in that case at the trial was not a comment and consequently
the Court did not have to deal with whether, if there had been a comment, a new
trial would necessarily have to be ordered. The case of Kelly v. The King[24], referred to by my brother Ritchie,
is to the same effect. There the accused who was a building contractor, having
dispensed with counsel, addressed the jury on his own behalf, and in so doing
introduced topics and statements of fact which had nothing to do with the
issues before the Court and made charges against prosecution counsel which had
no relation to the issues being tried. The learned trial judge had permitted
him to make these statements and charges and subsequently, in charging the
jury, the learned judge pointed out to them that the statements of the accused
so made in his address were not evidence and were to be disregarded, not having
been given under oath. This Court held that in so doing, the learned trial
judge had not commented in violation of the Canada Evidence Act . Duff
J. (later C.J.C.) at p. 259 said:

As to the first of these grounds I can find
nothing, which, when fairly construed, amounts to such comment within the
meaning of the statutory prohibition.

In his reasons, speaking for the majority in the
Court of Appeal, Evans J.A. said:

In a jury case when an accused does not
testify on his own behalf, this fact is immediately known to the jury and one
would be most naive to believe that it is not considered by them in
their deliberations.

My brother Ritchie, in referring to this, states
that it was in part to protect the accused from such speculations that s. 4(5) 
of the Canada Evidence Act  was enacted. With deference, I cannot agree.
The accused is accorded the protection he is entitled to by the mandatory
directions which the trial judge must give that an accused is presumed to be
innocent and that the burden of proving the guilt of an accused beyond a
reasonable doubt rests upon the Crown. The learned trial judge adequately
discharged his duty to the accused in the instant case when he said:

For these reasons, therefore, both
Mr. McConnell and Mr. Beer are presumed to be innocent until the
Crown, his accuser, proves him guilty,

[Page 818]

and this presumption of innocence remains
with the accused from the time they were charged and throughout this trial
until the end and this presumption of innocence only ceases to apply at the end
of the trial if, after hearing all evidence, you are satisfied that
Mr. McConnell or Mr. Beer is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

The onus or burden of proving the guilt of
these two accused persons beyond a reasonable doubt rests upon the Crown and
never shifts. There is no burden upon either of these two persons to prove his
innocence. The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they are guilty
of the offence before they can be convicted.

The protection which an accused is entitled to
under s. 4(5)  is compliance with the positive injunction not to comment imposed
upon the judge and counsel for the prosecution, in other words, no comment on
the subject from either of them.

In the present case, Wells J.A. (now C.J.H.C.)
took the view that in recharging the jury as he did, the learned judge had made
a comment on the failure of the accused to testify, and in so doing, had
violated the provisions of s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act  and that a
new trial was, accordingly, necessary.

I am in full agreement with Wells J.A.
Section 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act  is clear and unambiguous.
In it Parliament has defined an area that is forbidden ground to the judge and
to counsel for the prosecution. It is not a difficult matter for either or both
to keep from entering the prohibited zone. If they refrain from doing what
Parliament says they must not do, Courts of appeal and this Court will not be
required to rationalize and refine these transgressions as they try to measure
the depth of the imprint left on the minds of jurors as being consequential or
inconsequential. No measurement of the effect of departing from the standards
set by Parliament becomes necessary where the judge and counsel for the
prosecution obey the law.

What the learned judge said in the instant case
was clearly a comment. In my view, in dealing with a case of this kind, it is a
case of comment or no comment. If there was no comment within the meaning of
the statute as in the Wright and Kelly cases, that ends the
matter. If there was a comment as in Bigaouette, an error fatal to the
validity of the proceedings has occurred and the remedy is not in trying to
speculate whether it had a material or no effect on the jury, but in a new
trial. The accused in no

[Page 819]

way contributed to the result. It flows solely
from the failure of the judge or of counsel for the prosecution to obey the law
which Parliament has clearly laid down.

As long as the doctrine of stare decisis is
applicable, it is, I think, not open to this Court to refuse to follow Bigaouette.
Bigaouette came to this Court by way of appeal from the Court of Queen’s
Bench of Quebec which Court had affirmed Bigaouette’s conviction for murder,
Allard J. dissenting. The dissent was on several grounds, including one that the
learned trial judge had violated s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence Act . Allard J. expressed this dissent as follows:

4° Le savant Juge, dans mon opinion, a
aussi erré en droit, quand au bas de la page 30 il dit:

«Il était donc seul avec sa mère à la maison, quand la mort est arrivée, et si l’accusé
était seul avec sa mère quand elle a été tuée et égorgée, la défense aurait dû
être capable d’expliquer par qui ce meurtre a été commis. Car une pareille
boucherie n’a pas dû se faire sans que l’accusé en eut connaissance.» 

Et continuant dans le même ordre d’idées,
il ajoute à la page 32 dans deux phrases qui se suivent, dont la première
commence par les mots:

«Il ne viendra à l’idée de personne et
surtout… et dont la deuxième commence par les mots:

«Il ne vous viendra pas à l’idée…

Dans ces deux dernières phrases le savant
juge écarte comme auteur possible du crime tous les gens du voisinage,
c’est-à-dire des appartements voisins de celui de la victime pour ne laisser
devant le jury que l’accusé comme l’auteur certain. Et dans la partie tirée du
bas de la page 30 le savant juge, après avoir affirmé et conclu que l’accusé
était seul à la maison avec sa mère quand elle a été tuée, il ajoute que la
défense aurait dû être capable d’expliquer par qui ce meurtre a été commis, car
dit-il, pareille boucherie n’a pû se faire sans que l’accusé en eut
connaissance.

N’est-ce pas là reprocher à l’accusé de ne
pas avoir rendu témoignage en sa faveur pour établir son innocence ou au moins
dénoncer l’auteur du crime, n’est-ce pas là au moins suggérer au jury que
l’accusé aurait dû établir, par son témoignage, qu’il n’avait pas tué sa mère
et de plus donner le nom du coupable, s’il ne l’est pas lui-même.

Le savant Juge affirme que l’accusé était
seul avec sa mère quand le crime a été commis. Or, reprochant à la défense de
ne pas avoir expliqué ce meurtre et dénoncé le coupable, c’était lui reprocher
de ne pas avoir rendu témoignage lui-même. Ce commentaire du savant Juge
constitue une violation formelle de l’acte de la preuve du Canada. Sec. 4
Sous-Section 5. La Couronne devait prouver la culpabilité de l’accusé. Ce
dernier n’avait pas à établir son innocence. Cette seule partie de la charge du
savant Juge est suffisante pour vicier le verdict du jury et lui donner droit à
un nouveau procès. Nos recueils judiciaires contiennent plusieurs décisions en
ce sens.

Je me contenterai de citer un jugement de
La Cour d’Appel de l’Alberta re Rex vs Gallagher, 37 C.C.C., page 83, où
le Tribunal a décidé:

“Where the trial judge, in his charge to the
Jury, in a criminal trial, suggests that evidence ought to have been given,
which only the

[Page 820]

accused could have given, he commits a
breach of sub-section 5 of section 4  of the Canada Evidence Act  which
provides that the failure of the person charged …to testify shall not be made
the subject of comment by the judge …and the accused is entitled to a new
trial.”

It is of particular significance that the
decision in this Court setting aside the conviction for murder and granting a
new trial was solely on this ground. Duff J. (as he then was) said at
p. 113:

It should be said at the outset that the
jurisdiction of this court rests upon the dissent of Mr. Justice Allard,
and in particular upon his view, in which he was not in agreement with his
colleagues, that the learned trial judge, in instructing the jury, had
failed to observe the imperative direction of subs. 5 of s. 4 of the Canada
Evidence Act, which, in effect, requires the trial judge to abstain from
any comment upon the failure of the accused to take advantage of the privilege
which the law gives him to be a witness at the trial in his own behalf.

(Emphasis added.)

The only question dealt with in the judgment of
this Court was in relation to subs. (5) of s. 4  of the Canada Evidence Act  and
Duff J., speaking for the Court, concluded: “The law, in our opinion, is
correctly stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Stuart in Rex v.
Gallagher”[25] and
he quotes the very passage relied upon by Allard J. in his dissent. It is
pertinent to quote the whole paragraph in the judgment of Stuart J.A. in Gallagher
from which the quote just mentioned was taken. He said:

I agree with what my brother Beck has said.
But I would like to add that it is quite possible—or rather of course very
probable—that the trial Judge did not intend to refer, even indirectly, to the
failure of the accused to testify at the trial. The situation seems to me to be
this that the trial Judge inadvertently used language which was, on the face of
it, to say the least, clearly capable of being understood as a reference to the
failure of the accused to testify although it seems tolerably clear that, in
their proper meaning, the words used must be taken as a reference to such
failure. But it is not what the Judge intended but what his words as uttered
would convey to the minds of the jury which is the decisive matter. Even if
the matter were evenly balanced, which I think it is not, and the language used
were merely just as capable of the one meaning as the other, the position would
be that the jury would be as likely to take the words in the sense in which it
was forbidden to use them as in the innocuous sense and in such circumstances I
think the error would be fatal.

(Emphasis added.)

[Page 821]

My brother Ritchie says, regarding the fact that
Duff J. did not refer to s. 1014(2) in Bigaouette: “That was a case of
murder in which the evidence was almost entirely circumstantial and the
language used by the learned trial judge, which was construed as relating ‘to
the failure of the accused to testify’ was, in my opinion, such that it could
not have been said with any certainty whether or not the jury would necessarily
have convicted on the circumstantial evidence if the offending words had been
omitted. It was no doubt for this reason that the Chief Justice made no mention
whatever of the provisions of the curative section of the Criminal
Code .” That ignores, in my view, the acceptance by Duff J. of the word
‘fatal’ in the quotation from Gallagher in which Duff J. says: “The law
in our opinion is correctly stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Stuart
in Rex v. Gallagher…” and it ignores also Duff J.’s description of
Allard J.’s dissent as, “The learned trial judge, in instructing the jury, had
failed to observe the imperative direction of subs. 5 of s. 4  of the Canada
Evidence Act ” (Emphasis added) I fail to see how the use of the word
‘imperative’ and acceptance of the word ‘fatal’ by Duff J. can be explained
away by conjecture as to the reason why Duff J. did not refer to the curative
section of the Code. It is more logical, I think, with deference to
contrary opinion, to accept that Duff J. knew and appreciated that ‘fatal’
meant ‘not curable’.

If the law is as so stated by Stuart J.A. in Gallagher
and proclaimed as correct in this Court by Duff J. in Bigaouette, it
should not be departed from as would appear to be the effect of the majority
opinion. The statement by Cartwright J. (as he then was) in Binus v. The
Queen[26] states
the circumstances in which this Court may depart from a previous judgment of
its own. He said:

I do not doubt the power of this Court to
depart from a previous judgment of its own but, where the earlier decision has
not been made per incuriam, and especially in cases in which Parliament
or the Legislature is free to alter the law on the point decided, I think that
such a departure should be made only for compelling reasons. The ancient
warning, repeated by Anglin C.J.C. in Daoust, Lalonde & Cie Ltée v.
Ferland, (1932) S.C.R. 343 at 351, 2 D.L.R. 642, ubi jus est aut vagum
aut incertum, ibi maxima servitus prevalebit, should not be forgotten.

[Page 822]

There are no compelling reasons in the instant
case to depart from the law as laid down in Bigaouette in 1927.

If Parliament intended to qualify the word
“comment” in the said section to have it mean “comment adversely or
prejudicially”, it could have amended the statute accordingly or may still do
so. It is not for the Court to do it.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction
and direct a new trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE
SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA

Criminal law—Information—Charge of making
false statement in connection with application for admission to
Canada—Information not stating what was the false statement—Oral particulars of
offence given by Crown counsel before trial proceeded with—Whether information
fatally defective—Criminal Code , 1958-54 (Can.), c. 51,
s. 492(3)—Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 325, s. 50(f).

The appellant was convicted by a magistrate
of having made a false statement in connection with his application for
admission to Canada. A motion to quash the information on the ground that it
was defective was refused, but, before the start of the trial, Crown counsel
told the defence what question was alleged to have been answered falsely. On
appeal to a district judge, the information was again attacked and the
conviction was quashed. A further appeal to the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court by the Crown was allowed and the judgment of the magistrate was
reinstated. An application for leave to appeal to this Court was granted on the
questions of law as to (1) whether the information was fatally defective and
(2) whether the judgment of the magistrate should have been reinstated on the
assumption that the information was not fatally defective.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and the case remitted to the district judge for a
hearing on the merits by way of trial de novo.

The information was not fatally defective.
The appellant knew that he was charged with making a false statement in his
application. The charge as framed was not so lacking in detail of the
circumstances that it did not identify the transaction. There was a right to
demand particulars and, in fact, oral particulars were given. Defence counsel
appeared to have been content to proceed with these oral particulars.

As conceded by the Crown, the Court of Appeal
erred in reinstating the judgment of the magistrate. The proper order was to
remit the case to the district judge for a hearing on the merits by way of trial
de novo.

[Page 766]

L’appelant a été déclaré coupable par un
magistrat d’avoir fait une déclaration fausse à l’égard de sa demande
d’admission au Canada. Une requête pour faire rejeter la dénonciation pour le
motif qu’elle était viciée a été refusée, mais, avant que le procès ne débute,
le procureur de la Couronne a révélé oralement à la défense la question à
laquelle on prétendait qu’une fausse réponse avait été donnée. Sur appel à un
juge de district, la dénonciation a encore été attaquée et la déclaration de
culpabilité a été annulée. Un appel subséquent de la Couronne à la Cour d’appel
a été accueilli et le jugement du magistrat a été rétabli. L’appelant a obtenu
la permission d’appeler à cette Cour sur les questions de droit suivantes: (1)
la dénonciation était-elle fatalement viciée et (2) le jugement du magistrat
aurait-il dû être rétabli, prenant pour acquis que la dénonciation n’était pas
fatalement viciée.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être accueilli et le dossier renvoyé au juge de district pour une audition
du litige par voie de procès de novo.

La dénonciation n’était pas fatalement
viciée. L’appelant savait qu’il était accusé d’avoir fait une déclaration
fausse dans sa demande. L’acte d’accusation, tel que rédigé, ne manquait pas à
ce point de détails sur les circonstances, qu’il n’identifiait pas l’affaire.
L’accusé avait le droit de demander des détails et, en fait, des détails ont
été fournis oralement. Il semble que le procureur de la défense était satisfait
de procéder avec les détails qu’on lui avait fournis oralement.

Tel qu’admis par la Couronne, la Cour d’appel
a fait erreur en rétablissant le jugement du magistrat. L’ordonnance appropriée
aurait été de renvoyer le dossier au juge de district pour une audition du
litige par voie de procès de novo.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta allowing an appeal by the Crown and
restoring the conviction imposed by the magistrate Appeal allowed and case
remitted to district judge.

Brian A. Crane, for the appellant.

John A. Scollin and C.D. MacKinnon, for
the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

JUDSON J.:—The appellant, Robert John Corcoran,
was charged by information dated August 10, 1966, that

on or about the 11th day of February, A.D.
1966 at the City of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, Robert John Corcoran,
Advertising agent, of

[Page 767]

205 Wolf Street, Townsite of Banff,
Province of Alberta, did knowingly and unlawfully make a false statement in
connection with the application for admission of himself to Canada, the said
offence being contrary to Subsection (f) of Section 50 of the Immigration
Act, Revised Statutes of Canada 1952, being Chapter 325 as amended.

The magistrate convicted the appellant.

At the beginning of this trial, counsel for the
appellant moved to quash on the ground that the information was defective. The
magistrate refused to grant this application and proceeded to hear the
evidence, but before the magistrate went on with the trial, counsel for the
Crown told counsel for the appellant which question and answer alleged to be
false in the appellant’s application for permanent admission to Canada was in
issue in the case. In other words, he gave him oral particulars.

On appeal to a District Judge, the appellant’s
counsel again moved against the information. It is apparent from the record of
the proceedings before the judge that it was made clear to him, as it had been
to the magistrate, what question was involved in this information. No evidence
was taken before the judge and after argument, he granted the application and
quashed the conviction.

The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of
Alberta allowed the Crown’s appeal and ordered that the judgment of the
District Judge be set aside and that the judgment of the magistrate be
reinstated.

Leave to appeal was granted by this Court on the
following questions of law:

(1) Whether the information is fatally
defective.

(2) Whether on the view that the
information is not fatally defective the Court of Appeal erred in reinstating
the judgment of His Honour Magistrate Stillwell rather than remitting the case
to the Appeal Court having jurisdiction under Section 719 to hear a trial de
novo under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code .

The question in the application for admission to
Canada which gives rise to the difficulty in this case is the following:

13. Have you or has any member of your
family suffered from mental illness, tuberculosis, or been convicted of a
criminal offence, refused admission or deported from Canada? (If “yes” to any
of these, give details) Answer—No.

The Crown’s allegation was that the applicant
had been convicted of a criminal offence in the United States which

[Page 768]

he failed to disclose. This was the oral
information given by counsel for the Crown to the accused before the trial
began both before the magistrate and at the trial de novo before the
District Judge.

Section 50(f) of the Immigration Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 325, under which the accused was charged, reads as follows:

50. Every person who

(f) knowingly makes any false or
misleading statement at an examination or inquiry under this Act or in
connection with the admission of any person to Canada or the application for
admission by any person

is guilty of an offence…

My opinion is that this information was not
fatally defective. It charges an offence punishable upon summary conviction.
Section 701(1) dealing with summary convictions makes applicable ss. 492  and
493  of the Criminal Code . Section 492 , subs. (3), provides:

(3) A count shall contain sufficient detail
of the circumstances of the alleged offence to give to the accused reasonable
information with respect to the act or omission to be proved against him and to
identify the transaction referred to, but otherwise the absence or
insufficiency of details does not vitiate the count.

The accused here knew that he was charged with
making a false or misleading statement in his application for admission to
Canada. I do not think that the charge as framed is so lacking in detail of the
circumstances that it does not identify the transaction. There would have been
no difficulty in stating in the information that what was held against the accused
was that he falsely stated that he had not been convicted of a criminal
offence. Failure to do this was not a fatal defect in the information.

The accused had a right to demand particulars
and, in fact, oral particulars were given to him and, as the record of what
happened before the magistrate indicates, whatever merits counsel for the
accused may have attributed to his motion to quash, he appears to have been
content to proceed with the trial with these oral particulars. The appeal
cannot succeed on this ground.

However, and as conceded by the respondent,
there was error in the order of the Court of Appeal in reinstating the judgment
of the magistrate. I would allow the appeal,

[Page 769]

remit the case to the District Judge for a
hearing on the merits, by way of a trial de novo, on the information as
amended by the oral particulars given before the magistrate.

Appeal allowed.

Queen (Defendant) Respondent.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Voir dire—Confession—Trial by
judge without jury—Accused asked by trial judge whether inculpatory statement
true—Whether proper question—Criminal Code , 1953‑54 (Can.), c. 51, 5.
592(1)(b)(iii).

In the course of an investigation by the
police, the appellant was taken to the police station where he was subsequently
charged with indecent assault. He was then cautioned and made an inculpatory
statement which he signed. During the voir dire as to the admissibility
of that statement, the trial judge, sitting without a jury, asked the accused,
while he was giving evidence, whether the statement was true. The trial judge
had stated at the outset of the inquiry that he did not propose to look at it.
An objection to the question was overruled, and the accused replied that the
statement was substantially correct. The trial judge admitted the statement.
The appellant was convicted and his conviction was affirmed by a majority
judgment in the Court of Appeal. He appealed to this Court, where the issue was
as to whether the trial judge erred in law when he asked the accused whether
the statement was true.

Held (Hall,
Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Cartwright
C.J.: The trial judge did not err in law in putting the question which he did.
It was not possible to say that, as a matter of law, the question was not
permissible, although it was permissible only on the ground that it might
assist the trial judge in determining the credibility of the evidence which the
accused was giving on the voir dire. However, this was eminently a case
in which the trial judge should, in the exercise of his discretion, have
refrained from putting the question.

Per Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The question was admissible: R. v.
Hammond, [1941] 3 All E.R. 318. While the

[Page 903]

inquiry on a voir dire is directed to
finding whether a statement is voluntary, it does not follow that the truth or
falsity of the statement must be irrelevant to such an inquiry. There had been
no attempt by the trial judge to use the voir dire as a means of
determining the guilt of the appellant. The inquiry as to the truth of the
statement was related solely to the weight to be given to the evidence on the
issue as to whether or not it was voluntary.

Per Hall J., dissenting:
It is true that the accused cannot be compelled by the Crown to testify on
the voir dire and does so only of his own will. However, the very
purpose of holding a separate inquiry into the admissibility of a confession is
that this issue may be dealt with only on evidence relevant thereto. It is an
essential feature of this system that the accused is thereby permitted to
testify on that issue without prejudice to his right not to testify on the main
issue. If an accused cannot testify on the voir dire without being
liable to be asked questions bearing directly on his guilt or innocence, he is
put in a situation where he cannot do so without in effect being deprived from
the benefit of the rule against compulsory self incrimination. At least this is
so when the trial is by a judge alone. The question as to whether it was proper
for the trial judge to do what he did is a pure question of law.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: The question should be ruled to be inadmissible. Under the
particular circumstances of the voir dire, the answer of the accused to
the question as to whether the statement was true is not relevant, has no
probative value in determining the voluntary or involuntary character of the
statement, and deprives the accused from the benefit of the rule against self
incrimination. It was not possible to say that the putting of the question by
the trial judge did not cause a miscarriage of justice.

Per Pigeon J.,
dissenting: Questions to an accused concerning the truth of a statement
allegedly made by him cannot be permitted as having a bearing on his
credibility. These questions really go to the main issue of guilt. They cannot
be helpful in reaching a decision on the only issue on the voir dire: the
admissibility of the statement. The result of permitting, on a voir dire, questions
pertaining to the truth or falsity of the statement must inevitably be to
weaken the rule against the admission of involuntary statements and thus to
undermine a very necessary safeguard against improper treatment of suspects.

Droit criminel—«Voir dire»—Confession—Procès
par un juge seul—Le juge demande à l’accusé si sa déclaration incriminante est
véridique—Est-il permis de poser une telle question—Code criminel , 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, art. 592(1)(b)(iii).

Au cours d’une investigation policière,
l’appelant a été amené au poste de police où il a été subséquemment accusé
d’avoir commis un attentat à la pudeur. Il a fait et signé une déclaration
incriminante après avoir été mis en garde. Lors du «voir dire» pour décider de
l’admissibilité de cette déclaration, le juge au procès, siégeant sans jury, a
demandé à l’accusé au cours de son témoignage si la déclaration était
véridique. Le juge avait déclaré au début de l’enquête qu’il n’avait pas
l’intention de regarder la déclaration. Une objection à

[Page 904]

cette question ayant été rejetée, l’accusé a
répondu que la déclaration était substantiellement exacte. Le juge a admis la
déclaration. L’appelant a été déclaré coupable et ce jugement a été confirmé
par un jugement majoritaire de la Cour d’appel. L’accusé en appela à cette
Cour, où le débat s’est engagé sur la question de savoir si le juge avait erré
en droit lorsqu’il a demandé à l’accusé si la déclaration était véridique.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté, les Juges Hall, Spence et Pigeon étant dissidents.

Le Juge en
Chef Cartwright: Le juge n’a pas erré en droit en posant la question. Il n’est
pas possible de dire qu’en droit, la question n’était pas admissible, bien
qu’elle ne l’était que pour aider le juge à en venir à une conclusion sur la
crédibilité du témoignage de l’accusé sur le «voir dire». Cependant, il s’agit
du cas par excellence où le juge aurait dû, dans l’exercice de sa discrétion,
s’abstenir de poser la question.

Les Juges
Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson et Ritchie: La question était admissible: R. v.
Hammond, [1941] 3 All E.R. 313. Bien que l’enquête sur le «voir dire» porte
sur la question de savoir si une déclaration est volontaire, il ne s’ensuit pas
que la véracité ou la fausseté de la déclaration n’a aucun rapport avec l’objet
d’une telle enquête. Le juge n’a pas tenté de se servir du «voir dire» pour
déterminer la culpabilité de l’appelant. L’enquête sur la véracité avait
rapport seulement à la crédibilité du témoignage sur la question de savoir si
la déclaration était volontaire.

Le Juge Hall, dissident:
Il est vrai que l’accusé ne peut pas être contraint par la Couronne de
témoigner sur le «voir dire» et qu’il le fait seulement de sa propre volonté.
Cependant, le but véritable d’une enquête distincte sur l’admissibilité d’une
confession est de faire en sorte que cette question ne soit traitée que sur la
preuve qui lui est pertinente. Permettre ainsi à l’accusé de témoigner sur ce
point sans préjudice de son droit de ne pas témoigner sur la question
principale de culpabilité est une caractéristique essentielle de ce système. Si
un accusé ne peut pas témoigner sur le «voir dire» sans s’exposer à ce qu’on
lui pose des questions portant directement sur sa culpabilité ou son innocence,
il est placé dans une situation telle qu’il ne peut le faire sans être
effectivement privé du bénéfice de la règle que personne n’est tenu de
s’incriminer. Tel est le cas du moins lorsque le juge siège sans jury. La
question de savoir si ce que le juge a fait était permis est une pure question
de droit.

Le Juge
Spence, dissident: La question n’était pas admissible. Selon les
circonstances particulières du «voir dire», la réponse de l’accusé à la
question portant sur la véracité de la déclaration n’est pas pertinente, n’a
pas de valeur probante pour déterminer le caractère volontaire ou involontaire
de la déclaration et prive l’accusé du bénéfice de la règle que personne n’est
tenu de s’incriminer. Il n’est pas possible de dire que le fait d’avoir posé
cette question à l’accusé n’est pas une erreur judiciaire grave.

Le Juge
Pigeon, dissident: Des questions à un accusé sur la véracité de la
déclaration censée avoir été faite par lui ne peuvent pas être admises comme
ayant rapport à sa crédibilité sur le «voir dire». Ces questions portent en
réalité sur la question principale: sa

[Page 905]

culpabilité. Elles ne peuvent pas être utiles
pour en arriver à une conclusion sur le seul point qui se soulève lors d’un
«voir dire»: l’admissibilité de la déclaration. Permettre, alors des questions
sur la véracité ou la fausseté d’une déclaration ne peut avoir d’autre résultat
que d’affaiblir la règle à l’encontre de l’admission d’une déclaration
involontaire et ainsi détruire une protection indispensable contre le mauvais
traitement des prévenus.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’appel de
l’Ontario[1], confirmant une déclaration de culpabilité pour attentat à la
pudeur. Appel rejeté, les Juges Hall, Spence et Pigeon étant dissidents.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario1, affirming the appellant’s conviction for indecent
assault. Appeal dismissed, Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.

Joseph A. Mahon, Q.C., for the appellant.

R.G. Thomas, for the respondent.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—The facts out of which this
appeal arises and the course of the proceedings in the Courts below are set out
in the reasons of my brother Hall and I will endeavour to avoid repetition.

The only question not disposed of at the hearing
of the appeal is whether the learned trial Judge erred in law when he asked the
appellant, who was giving evidence on the voir dire, whether the
inculpatory statement, dated August 6, 1964, signed by the appellant, which the
Crown was seeking to introduce in evidence, was true and insisted on an answer
to the question in spite of the objection of counsel.

The rule that when the Crown seeks to introduce
in evidence an inculpatory statement said to have been made by the accused the
onus lies upon the Crown to show that the statement was voluntary is firmly
established. It is stated in the following words in Ibrahim v. R.[2]:

It has long been established as a positive
rule of English criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in
evidence against

[Page 906]

him unless it is shewn by the prosecution
to have been a voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained
from him either by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out
by a person in authority.

It has frequently been applied in this Court.

While the reason for the rule is said to be the
danger that a confession, the making of which has been induced by threats or
promises made by a person in authority, may well be untrue, it must now, I
think, be regarded as settled that when an inquiry is held during the course of
a trial as to the admissibility of an inculpatory statement sought to be
introduced by the Crown, the question to be determined is whether or not the
statement was voluntary and not whether or not it is true. On the other hand,
an assertion by the accused that the statement is untrue may logically have a
bearing in determining whether or not it was voluntary.

In R. v. Mazerall[3], Robertson C.J.O., giving the unanimous
judgment of the Court of Appeal, said at page 787:

It would be a strange application of a rule
designed to exclude confessions the truth of which is doubtful, to use it to
exclude statements that the accused, giving evidence upon this trial, has sworn
to be true.

I incline to the view that this observation was obiter.
The statements the admissibility of which was in question in that case had
been made by Mazerall under oath before a Royal Commission under the compulsion
of a statute. The basis of the judgment was that such evidence could be used
against him unless he had objected to answer and thereby become entitled to the
protection afforded by s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act .

The question to be determined by the Judge on
the voir dire being whether or not the statement was voluntary in the
sense mentioned above, I think it clear that the Crown could not lead evidence
on that inquiry, the sole object of which was to show that the statement given
was true. Such evidence should be excluded on the ground that it was
irrelevant. In Hollington v. F. Hewthron & Co.[4], Lord Goddard, giving the judgment of the
Court of Appeal, drew a distinction between the “modern law” of evidence

[Page 907]

and the law before the passing of the statutes
which removed the incompetency of witnesses and parties and their spouses on
the ground of interest, and, having done so, said at page 594:

The law being what it was before these
statutes were passed, it is not surprising to find Sir FitzJames Stephen
saying, in his Digest of the Law of Evidence, 12th ed., p. 217, Note XVIII,
that the law of competency “was formerly the most, or nearly the most important
and extensive branch of the law of evidence,” and that rules of incompetency
are “nearly the only rules of evidence treated of in the older authorities.”
But, nowadays, it is relevance and not competency that is the main
consideration, and, generally speaking, all evidence that is relevant to an
issue is admissible, while all that is irrelevant is excluded.

I agree with his concluding statement that the
general rule is that all evidence that is relevant to an issue is admissible
while all that is irrelevant is excluded.

I do not understand that counsel for the
respondent seeks to justify the putting of the question as to the truth of the
statement on the ground that it was relevant; his argument is that it was a
question properly put on cross-examination as bearing upon the credibility of
the accused.

It is not possible to say that at the stage when
the question was put the credibility of the accused was not in issue; he had
deposed that one of the officers had said to him “it would be better for me if
I did make a statement and co-operated in this respect”; the two officers who
were present at the time at which the accused said that this had been said to
him had both been examined as witnesses; one had said that he had no
recollection of such a statement being made and the other had in effect denied
the making of any such statement.

While he did not refer to them by name, it would
seem that when the learned trial Judge said he was satisfied by the authorities
that the question which he put to the accused was proper, he had in mind the
cases of R. v. Hammond[5] and LaPlante
v. The Queen[6].
Neither of these cases suggests that the question put to the accused as to the
truth of his statement was permissible on any ground other than its bearing on
the question of his credibility.

In the Hammond case, supra, Cassels
J., who was the trial Judge, made it clear that he did not decide on the

[Page 908]

admissibility of the confession as the result of
the admission of the appellant that it was a true confession. He admitted it
because he was satisfied on all the evidence that it was a voluntary statement
and this is stressed in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal.

In the LaPlante case, supra, the
second ground of appeal was “that answers made by the accused to questions put
by counsel for the Crown showing that the contents of the statement made by him
were true were not admissible in evidence on the voir dire held to
decide whether those statements should be admitted as voluntary”. Laidlaw J.A.,
who gave the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal, dealt with this ground
in the following paragraph, at page 81:

In respect of the second ground, we can add
nothing to the reasons given by Mr. Justice Humphreys in R. v. Hammond (1941),
28 Cr. App. R. 84. The evidence given by the accused in cross-examination on
the voir dire that the statements made by him were true, touches the
issue of credibility. Likewise, the admission by him that he killed Edwin Jones
touches the matter of his credibility, and his answers in respect of both
matters to the questions put by counsel for the Crown were relevant to the
issue as to whether or not the statements made by him were voluntary.

It should be noted that an application for leave
to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the LaPlante case
was made to this Court. It was heard on December 16, 1957, and judgment was
reserved. Judgment was given on December 19, 1957, dismissing the application.
As is usual in such cases, written reasons for dismissing the application were
not given. The case being a capital one, five Judges sat to hear the
application. The Court consisted of Kerwin C.J., Rand, Locke, Cartwright and
Abbott JJ.

While it may be that much of what was said in
the judgment in R. v. Hammond, supra, was obiter, the paragraph
quoted above from the judgment in LaPlante v. The Queen, supra, formed
the ratio of that decision.

In the case at bar the decision of the learned
trial Judge at the conclusion of the voir dire was as follows:

The court has to determine whether the
statement is a free and voluntary statement, and I am satisfied on the evidence
that it is. Accordingly, it will be admitted.

I do not find it possible to say that, as a
matter of law, the question put in the case at bar was not permissible

[Page 909]

although I think it clear that it was
permissible only on the ground that it might assist the trial Judge in
determining the credibility of the evidence which the accused was giving on the
voir dire.

However, while it cannot be said that the
question was legally inadmissible, in my respectful opinion, this was eminently
a case in which the trial Judge should, in the exercise of his discretion, have
refrained from putting the question on the ground discussed in Noor Mohamed
v. The King[7]:

It is right to add, however, that in all
such cases the judge ought to consider whether the evidence which it is
proposed to adduce is sufficiently substantial, having regard to the purpose to
which it is professedly directed, to make it desirable in the interest of
justice that it should be admitted. If, so far as that purpose is concerned, it
can in the circumstances of the case have only trifling weight, the judge will
be right to exclude it. To say this is not to confuse weight with
admissibility. The distinction is plain, but cases must occur in which it would
be unjust to admit evidence of a character gravely prejudicial to the accused
even though there may be some tenuous ground for holding it technically
admissible. The decision must then be left to the discretion and the sense of
fairness of the judge.

This passage has frequently been referred to
with approval; an instance is the unanimous judgment of this Court in Lizotte
v. The King[8].

While, in my opinion, the learned trial Judge
ought not to have put the question and ought not to have required an answer
after the objection of counsel, I find myself unable to say that the course he
followed constituted an error in law. It was, in my view, with the greatest
respect, a mistaken exercise of his discretion but, as has so often been held,
in an appeal to this Court in a criminal case, our jurisdiction, differing
sharply from that of the Court of Appeal, is limited to dealing with questions
of law in the strict sense.

For these reasons, I have reached the conclusion
that it cannot be said that the learned trial Judge erred in law in putting the
question which he did. The ground on which I am of opinion that he ought not to
have put it raises no question of law in the strict sense and it follows that
in my opinion the appeal must be dismissed.

[Page 910]

The judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland,
Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.:—The facts which give rise to this
appeal are set out in the reasons of my brother Hall. The sole issue before
this Court is as to whether the learned trial judge erred in law when he asked
the appellant whether the statement which he had signed was true.

This is exactly the same issue which had to be
determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R. v. Hammond[9]. In that case, as in this, a question had
been put to the accused on the voir dire as to whether a statement which
he had made was true. The judgment of the Court was delivered by Humphreys J.,
who said, at p. 321:

This appeal is brought on the sole ground
that the question which was put by counsel for the prosecution in
cross-examination of the accused was inadmissible. In our view, it clearly was
not inadmissible. It was a perfectly natural question to put to a person, and
was relevant to the issue of whether the story which he was then telling of
being attacked and ill-used by the police was true or false. It may be put as
it was put by Viscount Caldecote, L.C.J., in the early part of the argument of
counsel for the appellant, that it surely must be admissible, and in our view
is admissible, because it went to the credit of the person who was giving
evidence. If a man says, “I was forced to tell the story. I was made to say
this, that and the other,” it must be relevant to know whether he was made to
tell the truth, or whether he was made to say a number of things which were
untrue. In other words, in our view, the contents of the statement which he
admittedly made and signed were relevant to the question of how he came to make
and sign that statement, and, therefore, the questions which were put were
properly put. They were admissible, and they could not, therefore, have wrongly
affected the mind of the judge.

It was after stating this conclusion as to the
admissibility of the question that he went on to point out that the trial judge
had not reached his conclusion as to the admissibility of the statement as the
result of the admission as to its truth.

As the Chief Justice has pointed out in his
reasons, the Hammond case was followed by the Court of Appeal for
Ontario in LaPlante v. The Queen[10],
a capital case, and an application for leave to appeal, which could only have
been granted on a question of law, was refused by this Court.

[Page 911]

The notice of motion for leave to appeal to this
Court, in that case, relied only upon two grounds. The first was that there had
been non-direction amounting to mis-direction in the charge to the jury in
respect of serious inconsistencies in the evidence. The second was stated as
follows:

Were the questions put to the appellant
during the course of cross-examination on the voir dire by counsel for the
Crown as to the truth or falsity of Exhibits 26 and 27 inadmissible, irrelevant
and prejudicial?

The exhibits mentioned were statements made by
the appellant.

The written submission to the Court said, in
respect of this question:

It is submitted that the sole function of
the Voir Dire is to determine whether or not the Statement or Statements are
voluntary. It is submitted that on the Voir Dire the truth or falsity of the
Statement is irrelevant and any question directed to the issue of truth or
falsity is irrelevant, inadmissible and prejudicial.

Reference was made to the Hammond case as
well as to R. v. Weighill[11] and R.
v. Mandzuk[12].

I am in agreement with the conclusions stated in
the Hammond case. While it is settled law that an inculpatory statement
by an accused is not admissible against him unless it is voluntary, and while the
inquiry on a voir dire is directed to that issue, and not to the truth
of the statement, it does not follow that the truth or falsity of the statement
must be irrelevant to such an inquiry. An accused person, who alleged that he
had been forced to admit responsibility for a crime committed by another, could
properly testify that the statement obtained from him was false. Similarly,
where the judge conducting the voir dire was in some doubt on the
evidence as to whether the accused had willingly made a statement, or whether,
as he contended, he had done so because of pressure exerted by a person in
authority, the admitted truth or the alleged falsity of the statement could be
a relevant factor in deciding whether or not he would accept the evidence of the
accused regarding such pressure.

There was no attempt by the learned trial judge
in the present case to use the voir dire as a means of determining

[Page 912]

the guilt of the appellant. He stated at the
outset of the inquiry that he had not seen the statement and that he did not
propose to look at it. When it was produced it was handed to the witness for
identification and he was questioned concerning it. Had he been satisfied that
the statement was not voluntary, the trial judge would not have become aware of
its contents. The inquiry as to its truth was related solely to the weight to
be given to the evidence on the issue as to whether or not it was voluntary.

In my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed.

HALL J. (dissenting):—The appellant was
convicted by His Honour Judge Waisberg, sitting without a jury in the County
Judges’ Criminal Court for the County of York on May 5, 1965:

THAT he did on or about the 4th day of
August in the year 1964 at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the
County of York, indecently assault one Patricia D’Amata, a female person,
contrary to the Criminal Code .

He was sentenced on May 14, 1965, to six months
definite and two years less one day indefinite.

The charge arose out of a complaint by an
11-year old child, Patricia D’Amata, that, in the absence of her parents from
the house in which the appellant was a lodger, he had indecently assaulted her
by having carried her to his room and placed her on his bed and while on the
bed had touched her on the thigh above the knee. She objected and was released.
The complaint continued that the appellant grabbed a younger sister, placed her
on the bed and touched her in the same manner, but on being threatened by the
older girl with a broom he released the younger girl and both girls went to
their own room. The complainant’s parents were employed away from the home and
when they came home in the evening the complainant told her father what had
happened. He phoned the police who came to the D’Amata home about 8:00 o’clock
that evening, August 4, 1965.

At approximately 2:00 a.m., August 6, 1965,
Detectives Gossen and Pringle of the Metropolitan Toronto Police Department
went to the appellant’s room and requested him to accompany them to the police
station. They told him they were conducting an investigation but the matter
would not be discussed until they arrived at the police

[Page 913]

station. The appellant got dressed and agreed to
go along with the officers. At the police station the appellant was told by the
officers that they were investigating an alleged indecent assault with respect
to the daughters of his landlord. The appellant was not cautioned and had not
been placed under arrest. After some conversation with the appellant, the
officers charged him with indecent assault. He was cautioned and a statement
taken which was reduced to writing and signed by him.

A voir dire was held as to the
admissibility of that statement. The two detectives testified that no advantage
had been held out to the appellant nor were any threats made. They said the
appellant was nervous, embarrassed and co-operative. The learned trial judge
said when the statement was being tendered as an exhibit on the voir dire that
he did not propose to look at it. The record as to this is as follows:

Q. I am showing you a statement which I ask
to be entered as Exhibit One.

MR. MAHON: It shouldn’t be entered as
an exhibit yet.

MR. HANS: This would be merely, Your
Honour, for identification, his signature and Detective Pringle’s signature,
and the fact that this was read out loud and corrected, not as far as
content...

THE COURT: I haven’t seen the statement
yet. I don’t propose to look at it.

MR. HANS: This is on the voir dire.

The appellant gave evidence on the voir dire as
follows:

DIRECT-EXAMINATION ON THE VOIR DIRE BY
MR. MAHON:

Q. Gerard, the officers say that they came
to your room at 2:00 A.M. on the 6th day of August 1964, is that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. And that you were asleep in your room
and that they woke you up, is that correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. I see; did they say anything to you in
the room as to the nature of the charge against you?

A. No, they didn’t.

Q. I see. And then you put your clothes on,
did you?

A. Yes.

Q. Why did you do that?

A. They asked me to.

Q. Did they ask you to do anything else?

A. To come along with them to the station.

Q. Did you ask them the nature of the
charge?

A. Yes, I did.

[Page 914]

Q. Did they tell you?

A. No, sir.

Q. So you went and got into the car and
went with the officers, is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. There were two officers, and the two
officers who testified, was it these two?

A. Yes.

Q. On the way down to the station, was
there any conversation about the charge, or the nature of the charge?

A. I was trying to find out what it was all
about. I was sort of puzzled.

Q. Did they tell you?

A. No.

Q. Did they tell you the nature of the
charge?

A. I asked whether it was a serious charge?

Q. What did they say?

A. One of the officers agreed to it?

Q. Pardon?

A. One of the officers said it was serious.

Q. He said it was a serious charge, I see.
Now, after you got down to the station, what happened?

A. Well, they began to interrogate me.

Q. They began to question you?

A. Yes, sir. 

Q. There were just the two officers there,
Gossen and Pringle, and what happened?.

A. The officers—its such a long time ago,
its very hard to remember exactly what happened.

Q. The exact wording?

A. Yes; they did explain that the indecent
assault had happened in the house at 54 Beatrice Street.

Q. I see.

A. And they asked me would I be so kind…

Q. Speak up, I can’t hear.

A... as to make a statement, which I did.

Q. And did they say anything else before
you made the statement?

A. Well, I asked them what I should do; did
I have to. They said, well, it would be better for me if I did make a statement
and cooperated in this respect.

Q. And was it subsequent to that you told
them—you made a statement?

A. Yes.

Q. Then later, was there a caution given to
you?

A. Yes.

Q. I see. And was what you told them before
caution in the statement itself?

A. More or less, it was all along the same
lines, yes.

Q. The officer said you were nervous and
agitated, would you agree with that?

A. Yes, I may have been.

[Page 915]

Q. And did they tell you you were entitled
to counsel?

A. No, sir.

MR. MAHON: That will be all.

CROSS-EXAMINATION ON THE VOIR DIRE BY
MR. HANS:

Q. Mr. DeClercq, at this time were you
feeling ashamed? Were you feeling ashamed of yourself?.

A. Yes, I think any person with police
officers...

Q. Was your conscience bothering you?

MR. MAHON: No. Objection; the only
matter that is material here—This is not cross‑examination in general. It
is an examination purely on the question of the voluntariness of the statement.

THE COURT: Where is the statement? Have you
it there?—Court receives document.

BY THE COURT:

Q. Give the witness the exhibit. Is that
the statement you signed?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Is it true?

MR. MAHON: Now, in addition to that,
the question of whether the statement is true or is not is not material here.

THE COURT: I think it is.

MR. MAHON: It is purely whether the
statement is voluntary or not.

THE COURT: Eventually the proper statement
was put to the witness. I think it is very important whether it is true or not.
I note your objection and I think it is a proper question taken at this time.

MR. MAHON: There are all sorts of
cases.

THE COURT: Yes, I have read them all. I am
quite familiar with them and I am satisfied with my ruling.

WITNESS: Yes, Your Honour.

THE COURT: All right.

WITNESS:...except for a few details, I
would say the statement is correct.

THE COURT: All right. Have you any further
questions?

MR. HANS: No further questions, Your
Honour.

It is obvious that the first part of the last
answer was not recorded and it is to be noted that the appellant was not asked
as to the details in which the statement was not correct. After hearing
argument, the learned trial judge admitted the statement. It could not be
successfully argued that the statement should not have been admitted because
the evidence on the voir dire was quite conclusive that it was in fact a
voluntary statement apart altogether from the question as to its truth put by
the judge.

Accordingly, the issue in this appeal is not
whether the statement was properly admitted but whether the learned trial judge
was in error in taking over the cross-examination of the appellant, and having
directed that the

[Page 916]

‘confession’ be put in the appellant’s hands,
put to him the question “Is it true?” Defence counsel objected that the
question was not proper. The learned judge ruled that his question was proper
and required the appellant to answer which he did.

An appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal[13] on a number of grounds, but the only one
we are now concerned with is no. 5 as follows:

5. That I gave evidence on the voir dire;
that when objection was made by my Counsel to my being cross-examined on the
contents of the statement, the Judge himself, over the objection of my Counsel
questioned me as to the truth or otherwise of the statement; that I replied
that the statement was true in part; that the learned trial Judge erred in
questioning me on the statement otherwise than on the ground as to whether or
not the statement was a voluntary statement.

The appeal was heard by MacKay, McLennan and
Laskin JJ.A. MacKay and McLennan JJ.A. dealt with this ground of appeal as
follows:

As to the appellant being asked on the voir
dire if his statement given to the police was true, we are bound by the
decision of this court in Regina v. LaPlante (1958) OWN 80 in which it
was held that such a question is permissible.

Laskin J.A. dissented, saying:

The accused was charged with an offence of
a sexual nature, and the rule of caution against convicting on the
uncorroborated evidence of the complainant is applicable. If the accused’s
statement was properly receivable, it would provide ample corroboration of
competent evidence against the accused. Objection was taken at the trial to its
admissibility, and the trial Judge, who was sitting alone, proceeded to a voir
dire. The accused gave evidence on the trial within a trial, and in the
course of his testimony the presiding Judge asked him if the statement was
true. The reply given after objection was that it was substantially true.

In my opinion, this question was improperly
asked on the voir dire. I do not find fault with the trial Judge because
he was following the judgment of this Court in Regina v. LaPlante, (1958)
O.W.N. 80, which in turn rested on the judgment of the English Court of
Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Hammond, (1941) 3 All E.R. 318, 28 Cr. App. R.
84. To say, as was said in the Hammond case that the question is
relevant to credibility is too simple an analysis of the issues raised by the
question. I prefer the contrary approach of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen’s
Bench in Regina v. Hnedish (1958) 26 W.W.R. 685, 29 C.R. 347. I note
also that Rex v. Hammond was questioned by the British Columbia Court of
Appeal in Rex v. Weighill, (1945) 2 D.L.R. 471, 83 C.C.C. 387, and it is
criticized in Cross on Evidence (2nd ed. 1963) p. 55.

[Page 917]

I do not regard this Court as being
prevented by any principle of stare decisis from reconsidering its
previous decisions. If distinctions must be made, I would readily agree that to
allow a trial Judge sitting alone (or Crown Counsel in such a case) to ask the
incriminating question is more prejudicial than to permit it to be put on a voir
dire in the course of a trial by jury. I do not, however, find it seemly to
rest my difference with the LaPlante case on this distinction alone.

A number of vital principles of criminal
law administration are brought under scrutiny in respect of the matter at hand.
It is, of course, clear that the prevailing rule in Canada that permits
illegally obtained evidence to be adduced at a trial if relevant to the issues
does not apply to what I may call involuntary admissions of guilt made to
persons in authority. The reason for this has to do with the values that we
believe are worth protecting beyond the mere desirability of whether the
holding of a trial within a trial is designed to control improper inducements
or threats or other misbehaviour by the police in any efforts they may make to
secure an incriminating statement from an accused or whether the voir dire is
merely intended to assure the presiding Judge that the statement is reliable. I
realize that I am drawing a line that may be very thin, since reliability or
trustworthiness is closely related to the conduct of the interrogating police
officers. Authorities can be cited to show that both the considerations
mentioned lie back of holding of a trial within a trial for a preliminary
consideration of admissibility. Although the basis of the exclusion of
confessions improperly extracted from an accused has not hitherto been
regarded, at least in our cases, as based on the privilege against self‑crimination,
there is the respected opinion of Dixon J. as he then was, of the High Court of
Australia in McDermott v. The King (1948) 76 C.L.R. 501, at p. 513 that
the rules respecting confessions and the privilege against self-crimination are
related.

If an accused must expose himself on a voir
dire to an incriminating inquiry when he finds it necessary to give
evidence to resist the reception of an inculpatory statement, the relation with
the privilege against self-crimination is more pronounced and the privilege is
prejudiced, especially on a trial by a Judge alone. Indeed, on such a trial,
the distinction between a voir dire and the trial proper becomes blurred
if the accused, who is not then testifying in defence, may be compelled on the voir
dire to answer an incriminating question. However, there is prejudice to
the principle that an accused is not a compellable witness. Strictly speaking,
the Hammond case does not preclude a trial Judge from excluding a
confession as involuntary even where the accused has admitted its truth. But
this possibility seems to me to be weak protection against what I consider
substantial unfairness. I gave fleeting consideration to possible resort to
section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1952, c. 307 in
connection with the voir dire but I do not see how it can be said that
the voir dire and the trial on the merits are separate proceedings.
Apart from this, I would not think that an accused’s admission on the voir
dire that his statement was true could be put before the jury even if the
statement itself was admitted. Even if he gives evidence before the Jury, the
trial Judge ought not to allow cross-examination on his admission on the voir
dire nor should he permit that admission to be adduced through a Crown
witness. This is predicated on the correctness of the Hammond case so
far as it goes. I doubt that even it can be carried so far as to support the
right of a Crown witness to give evidence that the accused admitted the truth
of his inculpatory statement on the voir dire.

[Page 918]

Apart from the foregoing, the law of
evidence has developed policies of exclusion based on confusion of issues and
undue prejudice. The first is more appropriately referable, on the matter under
discussion, to trial by Judge alone, but the second has a general application
for present purposes. The trial within a trial has a limited object—to enable
the trial Judge to decide whether an inculpatory statement made to persons in
authority is admissible by examining the circumstances surrounding its making.
To use such an occasion to obtain verification from the accused of the truth of
his statement is to depart from the purpose for which the voir dire is
held, and is to prejudice the accused unfairly on the very question of
admissibility. Putting the matter another way, the question whether a
confession is true, even if relevant to the issue of its voluntariness (and,
hence, admissibility), involves resort to a line of inquiry that goes to much
beyond the issue for which it is invoked at to make it improper either to
initiate it or pursue it.

Since Rex v. Hammond[14] is the starting point for all subsequent
discussion on the point, it is desirable to see what was really dealt with in Hammond.
The facts as stated in the report at pp. 84-5 are as follows:

In opening the case counsel for the
prosecution stated that the appellant had made a statement amounting to a
confession of the crime to the police and that he proposed to relate the
circumstances in which the statement had been made. Defending counsel said that
he intended to object to the admissibility of the statement, and the Judge then
heard evidence as to its admissibility in the absence of the jury. After the
evidence of the police the appellant went into the witness-box and said that
the confession had been extorted from him by violence and ill-treatment on the
part of the police. Counsel for the Crown then cross-examined the appellant as
follows: “Q.—Your case is that this statement was not made voluntarily? A.—Yes.
Q.—Is it true? A.—Yes.” Counsel put further questions in order to ensure that
the appellant understood what he was saying. After hearing all the evidence on
the preliminary issue, Cassels, J., ruled that the statement was voluntary and
admissible, and it was subsequently put in evidence at the trial before the
jury. The statement described in great detail how the appellant had committed
the crime and included a number of matters which were proved to be unknown to
the police.

It is of great importance to note that Hammond’s
confession was not received in evidence by the trial judge, Cassels J., as a
result of Hammond’s admission that it was a true confession but the confession
was admitted by Cassels J. as a voluntary one apart altogether from Hammond’s
admission that what it contained was true. This is made very clear by
Humphreys J. in the appeal judgment at p. 88 where he said:

The facts of this case go even further, for
it is clear from the statement made by Cassels, J., the presiding Judge, that
he did not decide

[Page 919]

on the admissibility of this confession as
the result of the admission of the appellant that it was a true confession. He
himself had some doubt whether or not the question as to its truth was a
desirable question to put, and he said: “I had almost said that it was unnecessary
to put the statement in detail. I have listened to everything the prisoner had
to say in his evidence-in-chief. I hold that this statement is a voluntary
statement, and admissible in evidence.”

We cannot entertain the smallest doubt that
the appellant was rightly convicted upon evidence which was properly before the
jury. Further, we are satisfied that the evidence of his confession of the
crime was rightly admitted by the Judge, who was in no way misled by anything
which took place. The appeal is dismissed.

The ratio decidendi is clearly in those
last two paragraphs. They show that what was said as to the question respecting
the truth of the confession being relevant to credibility on the voir dire is
an obiter dictum which deserves respect but nothing more.

Concerning the refusal in this Court of leave to
appeal from the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in the LaPlante case,
no reasons were given and, therefore, nothing shows that this was not done on
the view that, it being a jury trial, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice had occurred because, apart from the question respecting the truth of
the confession, there was sufficient evidence to justify the trial judge’s
conclusion that it was voluntary.

The question ‘was the learned trial judge right
or wrong in putting the question which he did to the appellant and in requiring
him to answer?’ now comes to this Court for the first time. A discussion of the
nature of the voir dire in respect of alleged confessions is, therefore,
indicated.

The most quoted and generally recognized
authoritative statement relating to the admissibility of confessions by an
accused is that of Lord Sumner in Ibrahim v. The King[15], where at pp. 609-10, he said:

It has long been established as a positive
rule of English criminal law, that no statement by an accused is admissible in
evidence against him unless it is shewn by the prosecution to have been a
voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either
by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in
authority. The principle is as old as Lord Hale. The burden of proof in the
matter has been decided by high authority in recent times in Reg. v.
Thompson ((1893) 2 Q.B. 12)...

[Page 920]

This statement was accepted and applied by this
Court in Boudreau v. The King[16].
Kerwin J. (as he then was) said at p. 267:

Again with great respect, I think it
advisable that it should now be stated clearly what this Court considers the
law to be. My view is that it has not been changed from that set out in Ibrahim
v. Rex (1914) A.C. 599 and Rex v. Prosko 63 S.C.R. 226.

and Rand J. at pp. 269-70 said:

The case of Ibrahim v. Rex (1914)
A.C. 599, Rex v. Voisin (1918) 1 K.B. 531 and Rex v. Prosko 63
S.C.R. 226 lay it down that the fundamental question is whether the
statement is voluntary. No doubt arrest and the presence of officers tend
to arouse apprehension which a warning may or may not suffice to remove, and
the rule is directed against the danger of improperly instigated or induced or
coerced admissions. It is the doubt cast on the truth of the statement arising
from the circumstances in which it is made that gives rise to the rule. What
the statement should be is that of a man free in volition from the compulsions
or inducements of authority and what is sought is assurance that that is the
case. The underlying and controlling question then remains: is the statement
freely and voluntarily made?

(Emphasis added)

In The Queen v. Fitton[17], Rand J. referred to Boudreau and
said at p. 962:

The rule on the admission of confessions,
which, following the English authorities, was restated in Boudreau v. The
King (1949) S.C.R. 262, 94 C.C.C. 1, 7 C.R. 427, (1949) 3 D.L.R. 81, at
times presents difficulty of application because its terms tend to conceal
underlying considerations material to a determination. The bases of torture,
actual or threatened, or of unabashed promises are clear; perplexity arises
when much more subtle elements must be evaluated. The strength of mind and will
of the accused, the influence of custody or its surroundings, the effect of
questions or of conversation, all call for delicacy in appreciation of the part
they have played behind the admission, and to enable a Court to decide whether
what was said was freely and voluntarily said, that is, was free from the
influence of hope or fear aroused by them.

It will be seen that in none of these statements
is the question of the actual truth of the alleged confession put as one of the
factors to be considered. Rand J. stated the proposition in language that
permits of no doubt when he said: “The underlying and controlling question then
remains: is the statement freely and voluntarily made?” There are numerous
decisions to the effect that a confession, even if the truth, will not be
admitted if it was obtained by threats or promises or by duress of any kind.

[Page 921]

See Regina v. McLean and McKinley[18]; R. v. Sim[19]; Regina v. Starr[20] and art. 833 on pp. 267‑68 in
Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd ed.

Another rule of universal acceptance is that the
admissibility of the statement or confession is a question for the judge alone
who must decide after a voir dire whether or not it is admissible. Once
admitted, the statement goes to the jury who alone may decide whether the
statement was in fact made, whether it was true and who may give it such weight
as they think fit. The circumstances of the taking of the statement must be
given in evidence again before the jury even though fully gone into on the voir
dire. One of the most apt statements of the law in this regard is that of
O’Halloran J.A. in Rex v. Mandzuk[21],
where he said:

Once these distinctive functions of the
Judge and jury (which apply equally in principle where as in this case the
Judge sits alone and thereby assumes the additional function of the jury) are
appreciated, it becomes apparent that, in determining the admissibility of a
statement which may be a confession, it is not the function of the Judge to
consider its likely effect upon the minds of the jury. He is confined to determining
whether the statement in itself is a confession in whole or in part and if so
whether it is voluntary. He is not concerned with its truth or its untruth
as such or the good or bad effect it may ultimately have upon the minds of
the jury. He is of course concerned with the truth of testimony as to whether
the statement was or was not made and as to what statement was made. But once
the confession is admitted in evidence, then it is to be weighed and judged in
the same way as any other testimony which may affect the minds of the jury
advantageously or adversely to the accused.

(Emphasis added)

This being the law, it is elementary that the
function of the judge on a voir dire is to determine:

(1) Whether the evidence establishes that
the statement being tendered was in fact made by the accused. If he is not
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to this, he must not admit the
statement;

(2) Whether the statement was voluntary
within the rule in Ibrahim v. The King and Boudreau v. The King.

The problem is whether the truth of the
statement is relevant to this inquiry. It is obvious that it is not directly

[Page 922]

relevant because fundamentally it is relevant
only to the main issue, namely the guilt or innocence of the accused. However,
it is contended that it is indirectly relevant as bearing on the credibility of
the accused testifying on the voir dire. But is it not rather a petitio
principii, trying to find out from the accused whether he is guilty in
order to decide whether to admit his confession as evidence of his guilt?

Whenever the statement or confession amounts to
an admission by the accused that he has committed the offence of which he is
charged, the truth of the incriminating statement is but theoretically
distinguishable from his guilt. If the statement is totally incriminating,
asking the accused testifying on the voir dire: “Is the statement true?”
is tantamount to asking him: “Are you guilty of the offence?” But that is
precisely what an accused may not be asked unless he chooses to testify at the
trial. In Batary v. Attorney-General for Saskatchewan[22], Cartwright J. (as he then was) said,
speaking for the majority of the Court:

It would be a strange inconsistency if the
law which carefully protects an accused from being compelled to make any
statement at a preliminary inquiry should permit that inquiry to be adjourned
in order that the prosecution be permitted to take the accused before a coroner
and submit him against his will to examination and cross-examination as to his
supposed guilt. In the absence of clear words in an Act of Parliament or other
compelling authority I am unable to agree that that is the state of the law.

Would it not be a stranger inconsistency if the
law which carefully protects an accused from being compelled to testify at his
trial should permit that, if an incriminating statement has been improperly
obtained from him, he would not be permitted to give evidence of such
impropriety without being submitted against his will to cross-examination as to
his guilt.

It is true that an accused cannot be compelled
by the Crown to testify on the voir dire and does so only of his own
will. However, the very purpose of holding a separate inquiry into the
admissibility of a confession is that this issue may be dealt with only on evidence
relevant thereto. It is an essential feature of this system that the accused is

[Page 923]

thereby permitted to testify on that issue
without prejudice to his right not to testify on the main issue. As Cartwright
J. said in the Batary case (at p. 478):

the maxim nemo tenetur seipsum accusare...has
been described (by Coleridge J. in R. v. Scott, 1856, Dears & B. 47
at 61, 169 E.R. 909) as “a maxim of our law as settled, as important and as
wise as almost any other in it”.

If an accused cannot testify on the voir dire
without being liable to be asked questions bearing directly on his guilt or
innocence, he is put in a situation where he cannot do so without in effect
being deprived from the benefit of the rule against compulsory
self-incrimination. At least this is so when the trial is by a judge alone.
Before a jury, the problem is not so serious. Those who have to pass upon the
guilt or innocence of the accused are to remain in complete ignorance of the
evidence on the voir dire. But when the accused is tried by a judge
alone once this judge has acquired knowledge of the guilt of the accused by a
question that he has himself put to him, how can he properly weigh the evidence
and give the benefit of the doubt if need be? When the question is being put on
the voir dire, it cannot be presumed that the confession will be found
to have been voluntarily made. The inquiry into the truthfulness then being
made as bearing on credibility, it is uncertain whether the confession will be
admitted, even if truthful. If it is rejected, how can the accused not be
seriously prejudiced by an admission of guilt obtained from him while
testifying?

It must also be considered that if it is held to
be permissible to question an accused testifying on the voir dire as to
the truthfulness of the statement of confession sought to be introduced in
evidence, even when the accused is tried by a judge alone, an essential
safeguard against improper pressure by police authorities is being seriously
compromised. If the confession was not voluntarily made, the accused will know
that he cannot go into the witness box to disprove the evidence brought against
him on that issue without, in fact, renouncing the right to refrain from
testifying on the main issue and thus prevent the Court from questioning him on
his guilt or innocence. Under our law this right is so sacred that any comment
by the prosecutor or the judge on the failure to testify is strictly

[Page 924]

prohibited. In the Supreme Court of Ontario by
Rule 317 of the Rules of Practice it is provided that:

...no statement of the fact that money has
been paid into court under the preceding rules shall be inserted in the
pleadings, and no communication of that fact shall at the trial of any action
be made to the judge or jury until all questions of liability and amount of
debt or damages have been decided…

Is it not much more serious for a judge trying a
criminal case to acquire knowledge of the guilt of the accused otherwise than
through evidence properly admitted at the trial? It goes without saying that
evidence on the voir dire is not evidence at the trial.

This Court having jurisdiction in such cases
only on questions of law in the strict sense, a last point remains to be
considered, namely whether questioning the accused as was done is an error in
law. In Demenoff v. The Queen[23], the
question before this Court was the admissibility, as a voluntary statement, of
the confession of guilt made by the appellant. It was held that the issue being
the inferences to be drawn from the evidence relevant to the voluntariness of
the confession, the question was not one of law in the strict sense. Reference
was made to The Queen v. Fitton, supra, where this principle had been
admitted but it had been held that the rejection or admissibility of the statement
did raise a question of law. Here the question raised is whether it was proper
for the trial judge to question the accused respecting the truthfulness of the
statement that was sought to be introduced in evidence. This does not depend on
any question of fact like the voluntariness or otherwise of the statement. It
is a pure question of law.

Reference has been made to the following
passages of the judgment of Lord Du Parcq in Noor Mohamed v. The King[24]:

It is right to add, however, that in all
such cases the judge ought to consider whether the evidence which it is
proposed to adduce is sufficiently substantial, having regard to the purpose to
which it is professedly directed, to make it desirable in the interest of
justice that it should be admitted. If, so far as that purpose is concerned, it
can in the circumstances of the case have only trifling weight, the judge will
be right to exclude it. To say this is not to confuse weight with
admissibility. The

[Page 925]

distinction is plain, but cases must occur
in which it would be unjust to admit evidence of a character gravely
prejudicial to the accused even though there may be some tenuous ground for
holding it technically admissible. The decision must then be left to the
discretion and the sense of fairness of the judge.

It must be pointed out that in that case the
Privy Council was considering the propriety of allowing in a murder case
evidence of another murder. This had been permitted by the trial judge as
evidence of a “similar pattern”. The Privy Council quashed the conviction.
Immediately after the passage quoted above, which is clearly obiter, Lord
Du Parcq went on to say:

Their Lordships have considered with care
the question whether the evidence now in question can be said to be relevant to
any issue in the case.

He finally concluded by saying (at p. 193):

After fully considering all the facts
which, if accepted, it revealed, their Lordships are not satisfied that its
admission can be justified on any of the grounds which have been suggested or
on any other ground.

When that decision was considered by this Court
in Lizotte v. The King[25], the
following passages were quoted in addition to the passage first above referred
to, namely at p. 190:

In Makin v. Attorney-General for New
South Wales (1894, A.C. 57, 65), Lord Herschell L.C., delivering the
judgment of the Board, laid down two principles which must be observed in a
case of this character. Of these the first was that “it is undoubtedly not
competent for the prosecution to adduce evidence tending to show that the
accused has been guilty of criminal acts other than those covered by the
indictment, for the purpose of leading to the conclusion that the accused is a
person likely from his criminal conduct or character to have committed the
offence for which he is being tried”. In 1934 this principle was said by Lord
Sankey L.C., with the concurrence of all the noble and learned Lords who sat
with him, to be “one of the most deeply rooted and jealously guarded principles
of our criminal law” and to be “fundamental in the law of evidence as conceived
in this country”. (Maxwell v. The Director of Public Prosecutions, 1935,
A.C. 309, 317, 320).

And at pp. 195-196:

Their Lordships think that a passage from
the judgment of Kennedy J. in the well-known case of Rex v. Bond (1906,
2 K.B. 389, 398) may well be quoted in this connexion:

“If, as is plain, we have to recognize the
existence of certain circumstances in which justice cannot be attained at the
trial without

[Page 926]

a disclosure of prior offences, the utmost
vigilance at least should be maintained in restricting the number of such
cases, and in seeing that the general rule of the criminal law of England,
which (to the credit, in my opinion, of English justice) excludes evidence of
prior offences, is not broken or frittered away by the creation of novel and
anomalous exceptions.”

Their Lordships respectfully approve this
statement, which seems to them to be completely in accord with the later
statement of the Lord Chancellor in Maxwell’s case (1935, A.C. 309, 320),
when he said “It is of the utmost importance for a fair trial that the evidence
should be prima facie limited to matters relating to the transaction which
forms the subject of the indictment and that any departure from these matters
should be strictly confined.” They would regret the adoption of any doctrine
which made the general rule subordinate to its exceptions.

On the basis of those principles this Court held
in the Lizotte case that evidence disclosing the commission of another
murder had been improperly admitted in the course of the cross‑examination
of a witness and the conviction was quashed and a new trial ordered.

I would quash the conviction here and order a
new trial.

SPENCE J. (dissenting):—Upon this appeal,
I agree with my brother Hall. Despite reference in various cases to the
possible impropriety of the exclusion of statements of the accused which are
true, it has most certainly been settled by the decisions both in this Court
and in England that the task of the trial judge in considering the
admissibility of a statement made by the accused to a person in authority is to
determine not whether that statement is true but whether it is voluntary. I
need not cite authorities for that proposition, the Chief Justice has already
done so in his reasons.

The only justification, in my opinion, for
either counsel for the Crown or the trial judge questioning the accused when
giving evidence on the voir dire as to truth or falsity of his
statement, which it is sought to introduce, is the relevance of his answer as
to the truth of the statement upon the question of his credibility. Careful
consideration of the matter convinces me that under the particular
circumstances of the voir dire the answer of the accused to that
question is not relevant and has no probative value in determining the
voluntary or involuntary character of the statement. It must be remembered that
the statement of

[Page 927]

the accused to a person in authority is
introduced during the evidence advanced by the prosecution and very often quite
early in the course of the trial. At that time, of course, no evidence has been
given as to guilt or innocence by the accused or anyone on his behalf, and
indeed in the usual course the only evidence given up to that time is evidence
by such witnesses as the complainant and police officers. If the accused were
to answer the question when put by either Crown counsel or the trial judge in
the negative, then there would be no basis upon which the trial judge could
come to the conclusion that his answer was false and that therefore his
credibility in his testimony to the effect that the statement was not voluntary
might be untrue until the trial had been completed. That conclusion could be
made only on the basis of the whole evidence. Therefore, I cannot see how a
negative answer by the accused to the question as to the truth of the statement
would in any way damage his credibility and assist the trial judge in coming to
the conclusion as to whether the accused’s evidence denying the voluntary
nature of the statement was false.

If, on the other hand, the accused answered the
question as to the truth of the statement in the affirmative, it would not in
any way damage or cast doubt on his other evidence that the statement was not
voluntary. It might well be part of the accused’s case that despite the fact
that he did commit the offence with which he has been charged he cannot be
convicted thereof as the Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and
surely it is plain that the Crown cannot proceed to do so by the production of
a statement made to a person in authority which was not voluntary.

Under the circumstances, the affirmative answer
in this situation makes the prejudice two‑fold; firstly, as I have said,
it is not relevant to the issue of whether the statement was voluntary or not
voluntary and, secondly, and particularly when, as in the present case, the
trial was by judge alone without a jury, the accused suffers all the
disabilities pointed out by my brother Hall in his reasons. I am, therefore, of
the opinion that despite the decision in

[Page 928]

Rex v. Hammond[26] and in Regina
v. LaPlante[27], the
question should be ruled to be inadmissible whether put by Crown counsel or
even in the careful fashion put by the learned trial judge in the present case.

It would appear from the wording of the learned
trial judge’s ruling as cited by the Chief Justice in his reasons that the
learned trial judge realized his task and determined that the statement was a
voluntary one. I am, however, of the opinion that that ruling is not sufficient
justification for this Court to act under the provisions of s. 592(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code , It would be speculation for this Court to say that
despite the question put by the learned trial judge to the accused, which I am
of the opinion for the above reasons was improper, and the accused’s answer
thereto, the learned trial judge would have ruled the statement voluntary. The
accused’s answer to that question may well have been the telling factor in
causing the learned trial judge to determine that the statement was a voluntary
one. Moreover, had the statement been excluded then counsel for the accused
might well have proceeded in a very different fashion in his defence, and might
well have chosen not to call the accused in defence.

For these reasons, I am of the opinion that this
Court cannot say that the putting of the question by the learned trial judge to
the accused upon the voir dire caused no substantive miscarriage of
justice. I, therefore, agree with my brother Hall that the conviction should be
quashed and a new trial directed.

PIGEON J. (dissenting):—In this appeal I
agree with what my brothers Hall and Spence have said and wish to add the
following observations.

I cannot hold that questions to an accused
concerning the truth of a statement allegedly made by him, although irrelevant
to the inquiry on the voir dire, may be permitted as having a bearing on
his credibility. These questions really go to the main issue: the guilt or
innocence. On the voir dire, the answers to such questions cannot be
tested

[Page 929]

against full evidence, and they cannot be of any
real help in reaching a decision on the only issue: the admissibility of the
statement.

In my view, the result of permitting on a voir
dire questions pertaining to the truth or falsity of the statement must
inevitably be to weaken the rule against the admission of involuntary
statements and, in fact, to admit in evidence statements which otherwise would
have to be rejected as not voluntarily made. This would be unfortunate because
it would tend to undermine a very necessary safeguard against improper
treatment of suspects.

There is no reason for the judge sitting on a voir
dire to put or permit any question respecting the truth of the statement
unless he is in some doubt as to whether it was voluntarily made or not. Seeing
that he must at that time take the answer of the accused as given, the
consequence of such a question must be that any doubt concerning the voluntary
character of the statement is resolved in favour of the prosecution if the
accused says it is a true statement. The end result of such a course of action
is to admit in evidence, because the accused says it is true, an incriminating
statement that would otherwise probably be rejected.

Where this can lead is strikingly illustrated by
what occurred in the Australian case of Reg v. Monks as related in the
Australian Law Journal (1960, vol. 34, p. 111). The accused testifying on the voir
dire said that a confession had been extorted from him by brutal treatment
on the part of the police. This confession was the only evidence of any
consequence against him. When cross-examined he admitted that it was true in
fact and also that he had committed all the offences with which he was charged.
Thereupon the trial judge, the Chief Justice himself, ruled the confession
admissible, saying that it would be a “public scandal” if, after a full
confession upon oath in open court, the accused should thereafter be acquitted.
Who will say that this man should properly have been disbelieved when saying
that the confession had been extorted because he ought to be believed when
confessing his crimes? Yet this is what must be the reasoning on the issue of
credibility if

[Page 930]

one is going to contend that the principle of
not allowing involuntary confessions in evidence remains unimpaired.

In the present case, much is made of the fact
that the trial judge did not look at the statement before he asked the accused
whether it was true. It is said that this shows that the accused would not have
been prejudiced if the judge had decided to reject the statement. In my view,
the fallacy of this reasoning is that under those circumstances the statement
was inevitably going to be received in evidence if the accused admitted it to be
true. Although the contents had not been disclosed to the judge, it was obvious
from what had been said that the statement was inculpatory. When, in order to
resolve his doubt concerning its voluntary character, the judge asked the
accused whether it was true, the admission obtained by this questioning
necessarily resulted in the statement being admitted. To say that the statement
was admitted because the trial judge came to the conclusion that it had been
voluntarily made is not strictly accurate in the circumstances of this case. In
fact, the judge came to this conclusion partly because the accused admitted
that it was true.

Because the rule against compulsory
self-incrimination is the root of the objection, I cannot agree that this is a
matter of judicial discretion respecting the extent of cross-examination on
credibility. In considering the cogency of the reasoning in the Hammond case
we should bear in mind that, in the United Kingdom, judges are allowed to
comment on the omission of the accused to testify. In this perspective it is
much less obnoxious to permit incriminating questions on the voir dire, than
under a system where such comments are strictly prohibited. One only has to
read the Bigaouette case[28] to
appreciate the importance of this difference in the applicable legal
principles.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION

Criminal law—Entering dwelling house with intent to commit
indictable offence—Elements of offence—Proof of intent—Criminal Code , 1958-54
(Can.), c. 51, s. 293.

The appellant was convicted by a magistrate upon a charge of
unlawfully entering a dwelling house with intent to commit an indictable
offence therein, contrary to s. 293  of the Criminal Code . The
magistrate found that the accused had entered unlawfully and without lawful
excuse and had not given an explanation of his presence, that is, a reasonable
or logical explanation. His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. He
was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the question of law as to whether
the magistrate had erred in failing to determine whether the intent to commit
an indictable offence had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

Held (Judson and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeal
should be allowed and the conviction quashed.

Per Martland J.: The offence defined in s. 293 of
the Code contains two elements: an entry without lawful excuse and an
accompanying intent, which must exist at the time of entry, to commit an
indictable offence in the dwelling house. Under subs. (2) of s. 293 , the
Crown could establish a case against the accused upon proof of entry without
lawful excuse and in the absence of other evidence. Where, however, other
evidence is given relating to the circumstances the Court must be satisfied,
upon the whole of the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the entry was
made accompanied by the requisite intent. The trial judge appears to have
overlooked that the explanation given by the accused, while not establishing a
lawful excuse for his presence in the premises, might well have created a
reasonable doubt as to his intent to commit an indictable offence therein.

Per Hall and Spence JJ.: Proof of the intent to commit
an indictable offence, which intent must exist at the time of entry, is a
necessary ingredient for a conviction and all that subs. (2) does is to provide
prima facie evidence, not disturbing the principle of law that on the
whole evidence the Crown must prove each essential element including, in this
charge, the intent beyond reasonable doubt. There was no evidence upon which
the magistrate could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had
entered the premises with intent to commit an indictable offence.

Per Judson and Pigeon JJ., dissenting: When the
magistrate stated that the appellant had not given the Court an explanation for
his presence, that is, a reasonable or logical explanation, he was stating his

[Page 892]

conclusion that in his opinion the accused’s explanation was
no explanation at all. The magistrate’s mode of expression meant that he
rejected the explanation as one that might reasonably be true and convicted on
the operation of s. 293(2). He was not required to find that the Crown had
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt entry with intent to commit an indictable
offence quite apart from the operation of the presumption. He correctly applied
the presumption. On the facts of this case, the appellant’s entry was without
lawful excuse.

d’habitation avec l’intention d’y commettre un acte criminel—Éléments de
l’infraction—Preuve de l’intention—Code criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51,
art. 293.

L’appelant a été déclaré coupable par un
magistrat de s’être introduit illégalement dans une maison d’habitation avec
l’intention d’y commettre un acte criminel, contrairement à l’art. 293  du Code
criminel . Le magistrat a statué que l’accusé s’était introduit
illégalement, sans excuse légitime, et n’avait pas donné d’explication de sa
présence, c’est-à-dire, une explication raisonnable ou logique. La déclaration
de culpabilité a été confirmée par la Cour d’appel. L’appelant a obtenu la permission
d’en appeler à cette Cour sur la question de droit, à savoir si le magistrat
avait erré en omettant de décider si l’intention de commettre un acte criminel
avait été prouvée hors d’un doute raisonnable.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être accueilli et la déclaration de culpabilité annulée, les Juges Judson
et Pigeon étant dissidents.

Le Juge
Martland: L’infraction dont on donne une définition à l’art. 293 du Code
contient deux éléments: l’entrée sans excuse légitime et une intention
l’accompagnant, devant exister au moment de l’entrée, de commettre un acte
criminel dans la maison d’habitation. En vertu de l’alinéa (2) de l’art. 293 ,
la Couronne peut prouver l’accusation sur preuve d’une entrée sans excuse
légitime et en l’absence de toute autre preuve. Cependant, lorsqu’une autre
preuve relativement aux circonstances est présentée, la Cour doit être
satisfaite hors d’un doute raisonnable, en se basant sur la preuve entière, que
l’entrée était accompagnée de l’intention requise. Il semble que le juge au
procès n’a pas tenu compte que l’explication donnée par l’accusé, quoique
n’établissant pas une excuse légitime de sa présence sur les lieux, pouvait
très bien avoir créé un doute raisonnable quant à son intention d’y commettre
un acte criminel.

Les Juges Hall
et Spence: La preuve de l’intention de commettre un acte criminel, laquelle
intention doit exister au moment de l’entrée, est un élément nécessaire pour
obtenir une déclaration de culpabilité et tout ce que l’alinéa (2) fait est de
fournir une preuve prima facie, sans mettre de côté le principe de droit
que la Couronne, en se basant sur toute la preuve, doit établir chaque élément
essentiel y compris, dans le cas présent, l’intention hors d’un doute
raisonnable. Il n’y avait aucune preuve sur laquelle le magistrat pouvait
statuer hors d’un doute raisonnable que l’accusé s’était introduit dans les
lieux avec l’intention de commettre un acte criminel.

Les Juges
Judson et Pigeon, dissidents: Lorsque le magistrat a déclaré que
l’appelant n’avait pas donné à la Cour une explication de sa

[Page 893]

présence, c’est-à-dire une explication
raisonnable ou logique, il énonçait ses conclusions à l’effet que dans son
opinion l’explication donnée par l’accusé n’était pas une explication.
L’expression employée par le magistrat signifie qu’il a rejeté l’explication
comme pouvant être raisonnablement véridique et a appliqué l’art. 293(2) pour
le déclarer coupable. Il n’était pas obligé d’en venir à la conclusion que la
Couronne devait prouver hors d’un doute raisonnable une entrée avec l’intention
de commettre un acte criminel indépendamment du jeu de la présomption. Il a
correctement appliqué la présomption. Sur les faits de la cause, l’entrée de
l’appelant était sans excuse légitime.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour suprême de l’Alberta,
confirmant une déclaration de culpabilité. Appel accueilli, les Juges Judson et
Pigeon étant dissidents.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of Alberta, Appellate Division, affirming the appellant’s conviction. Appeal
allowed, Judson and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.

J. Harper Prowse, for the appellant.

Brian A. Crane, for the respondent.

MARTLAND J.:—I am in agreement with my brother Spence and merely
wish to add the following comments:

The charge against the appellant was that he did unlawfully enter
a dwelling house with intent to commit an indictable offence therein, contrary
to s. 293  of the Criminal Code .

Section 293  provides as follows:

293. (1) Every one who without lawful excuse, the proof of
which lies upon him, enters or is in a dwelling house with intent to commit an
indictable offense therein is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for ten years.

(2) For the purposes of proceedings under this section,
evidence that an accused, without lawful excuse, entered or was in a dwelling
house is prima facie evidence that he entered or was in the dwelling house with
intent to commit an indictable offence therein.

There are two elements in the offence charged as defined in
s. 293(1):

1. Entry without lawful excuse.

2. An accompanying intent to commit an indictable offence
therein.

[Page 894]

Under subs. (2) it is provided that entry without lawful excuse
is prima facie evidence of entry with intent to commit an indictable
offence therein. In other words, in the absence of other evidence the Crown can
establish a case against the accused upon that evidence.

Where, however, other evidence is given relating to the
circumstances the Court must be satisfied, upon the whole of the evidence,
beyond a reasonable doubt, that the entry was made accompanied by the requisite
intent.

In finding the appellant guilty, the Court said this:

I find as a fact that the accused entered the premises of
505 Kennedy-Towers unlawfully and without lawful excuse and he has not given
this Courtroom an explanation for his presence, that is, a reasonable nor a
logical explanation.

Jeffrey Bain Austin I find you guilty of being in these
premises contrary to Section 293  of the Criminal Code .

(The underlining is mine.)

The Court appears to have been of the view that if a prima facie
case, under subs. (2), was made, thereafter the onus was on the appellant which
had to be met by providing a reasonable and logical explanation for his
presence in the premises. This overlooks the fact that the evidence, while not
establishing a lawful excuse for the presence of the accused in the premises,
might well create a reasonable doubt as to his intent to commit an indictable
offence therein. This is a vital element in the commission of this offence, and
it appears to have been overlooked in this case.

For this reason I think this appeal should be allowed and the
conviction quashed.

The judgment of Judson and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

JUDSON J. (dissenting):—The Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta, in affirming this conviction by the magistrate,
delivered the following unanimous reasons:

Assuming that rule in the Ungaro case is applicable, it is
clear that the learned Magistrate considered whether the explanation of the
Appellant’s presence in the apartment was one which might reasonably be true.
He found that under all the circumstances disclosed the explanation was not one
which might reasonably be true. We have examined those circumstances and we
agree with his conclusion. Accordingly the appeal is dismissed.

[Page 895]

To me it is clear that the magistrate disbelieved the appellant
and, in particular, held that his evidence was untruthful when he stated that
Mrs. Hickling had intended him to look in and keep an eye on the children.
Although the appellant stated that he knew the girl and that she was in the
apartment baby-sitting and that his only purpose was to “See if she was O.K.”,
the girl’s evidence, which was accepted by the Magistrate, was that the
appellant opened the door, said “Hi” to her and went directly into the boy’s
room and that she was too frightened to ask him to leave.

The following are the reasons in full of the magistrate:

Firstly, with respect to the evidence of the adults,
Mr. and Mrs. Hunt, I find that their evidence is very clear. As a matter
of fact, I marvel at the restraint exercised by Mr. Hunt in the manner in
which he gave his testimony. The testimony of both Mr. and Mrs. Hunt
and of the Constable, Constable Benson, make it quite clear that the accused
was adamant at the time that Mrs. Hickling had asked him to look in upon
her children while she was absent from the city. I accept the denial of
Mrs. Hickling that she made such a request or that such a request would be
even thought necessary because she had left her children in charge of a capable
sitter. The evidence of the young girl Margaret or Peggy, as she was probably
called, Hickling, who was babysitting the young Hunt boy at the time on this
occasion, was quite clear after she got over her first fright at being in this
Courtroom. The evidence of that young lady and the evidence of Mr. and
Mrs. Hunt clearly indicate also at the time the Hunts returned that
Austin, the accused, was sitting on the bed and not at the doorway as he
himself said in his own testimony. In other words, on both of those occasions I
find that his evidence is untruthful and I accept the evidence to the contrary
by the other persons.

I find as a fact that the accused entered the premises of
505 Kennedy Towers unlawfully and without lawful excuse and he has not given
this Courtroom an explanation for his presence, that is, a reasonable nor a
logical explanation.

In my opinion, when the magistrate stated that the appellant had
not given the court an explanation for his presence, that is, a reasonable or
logical explanation, he was stating his conclusion that in his opinion the
accused’s explanation was no explanation at all. When an explanation is
tendered as one that might reasonably be true, it cannot be mere fancy but must
have relation to the evidence. The magistrate’s mode of expression does not
mean that he failed properly to apply s. 293(2)  of the Criminal Code . It
means that he rejected the explanation as one that might reasonably be true and
convicted on the operation of s. 293(2) . He was not required to find that
the

[Page 896]

Crown had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt entry with intent to
commit an indictable offence quite apart from the operation of the presumption.
He correctly applied the presumption and in so doing his judgment was affirmed
by the Appellate Division.

Section 293  reads:

293. (1) Every one who without lawful excuse, the proof of
which lies upon him, enters or is in a dwelling house with intent to commit an
indictable offense therein is guilty of an indictable offense and is liable to
imprisonment for ten years.

(2) For the purposes of proceedings under this section,
evidence that an accused, without lawful excuse, entered or was in a dwelling
house is prima facie evidence that he entered or was in the dwelling
house with intent to commit an indictable offence therein.

The appellant’s entry into the apartment was without lawful
excuse. He went directly to the boy’s room where he sat on the bed and on at
least one occasion, laid his hands on the boy. When the boy pulled away from
the appellant and tried to get out of bed, the appellant still stayed with him.

The magistrate properly convicted the appellant of an offence
against s. 231(1)  of the Criminal Code  on the same evidence.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by

SPENCE J.:—This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta pronounced on November 8, 1967,
whereby that Court dismissed an appeal from the conviction by the magistrate
made on May 1, 1967, of the accused upon the charge that he did:

on or about the 3rd day of April, A.D. 1967 at the City of
Edmonton, in the Province of Alberta, did without lawful excuse enter a
dwelling house situated at Suite # 505, Kennedy Towers, with intent to commit
an indictable offence therein, contrary to Section 293  of the Criminal
Code ,

This Court granted leave to appeal upon the following question of
law:

Did the learned Magistrate err in failing to determine
whether the intent to commit an indictable offence, which is an essential
element in the offence defined by section 293(1)  of the Criminal Code , had
been proved beyond a reasonable doubt?

[Page 897]

A rather detailed statement of the relevant facts is necessary.
The appellant was living separated from his wife and family in Apartment 1104
in the Kennedy Towers Apartment House in the City of Edmonton. A Mrs. Lucy
Hickling with her son David and her daughter Peggy, twelve years of age, lived
in Suite # 708 in the same apartment house. A Mr. and Mrs. James Hunt
and their son David, seven years of age, lived in Suite 505 again in the same
apartment house.

The appellant knew Mrs. Hickling and her children and had
spent part of the evening prior to April 3, 1967, in the company of
Mrs. Hickling. He also knew that Mrs. Hickling was leaving for
Calgary to spend the weekend. On April 3, 1967, about 5:00 p.m., when the
appellant returned from his work, he met in the elevator of the apartment house
Peggy Hickling. The appellant left his brief case in his own apartment and then
went to the Hickling apartment, picked up Peggy Hickling there, and another
young boy from another apartment, and took the two children with him when he
went shopping. He returned a very short time later and left the children at
their respective apartments. He then returned to his own apartment, and to use
his own words, “I had something to eat. I had nothing to do so I decided to go
down and see how David and Peggy Lou were making out”. The appellant arrived at
the Hickling apartment, # 708, to find that David was there alone. He
spent a short time with David and then learning that Peggy Hickling was in
apartment 505, the Hunt apartment, he went to that apartment, knocked on the
door, and went in. Peggy Hickling had been engaged by Mrs. Hunt to act as
a baby sitter for her young child David. She had gone to the apartment after
she and the appellant had parted a little earlier in the evening and her
brother David Hickling had later attended that apartment to give her a
sandwich. It would appear that when he left the apartment, David Hickling had
not pressed the lock on the door so that when the appellant knocked on the door
and opened it it was unlocked permitting his easy entry. The hour was about
9:30 in the evening; David Hunt had retired to his bed but was not asleep. The
door to David Hunt’s room was almost opposite the entrance door to the

[Page 898]

apartment and it stood open. The appellant walked into David
Hunt’s bedroom and sat down on the edge of the bed.

The appellant, in his evidence, gave as his reason for entering
the boy David Hunt’s bedroom that he was not asleep and that the appellant
throught he might be able to get the boy to sleep. The appellant swore that in
an attempt to persuade the boy to sleep he promised him a ride in his, the appelant’s
motor boat, if the boy would sleep. David Hunt, who gave unsworn evidence,
corroborated this statement adding, “I said we could buy our own boat”.
Although David Hunt said that the appellant laid against him and his feet were
then partially on the floor, Peggy Hickling who had stood in the doorway of the
room and observed all that occurred, testified that when the boy David Hunt
attempted to roll off the bed the appellant merely put his hand on the boy to
hold him in the bed and that at that time the appellant was sitting on the edge
of the bed with his feet on the floor. At this juncture, Mr. and
Mrs. Hunt returned. What could only be described as a fracas occurred, the
police were called and the appellant was taken into custody. Constable Benson
of the Edmonton Police Force, who had attended at the apartment upon being
summoned, gave evidence that he questioned the appellant as to the reason he
had been in the apartment and that the appellant told him that he, the
appellant, had been asked by Mrs. Hickling to look in on her children
while she was away in Calgary. The constable testified that because of that
answer they had not held the appellant in custody that night, but after a
further investigation they did place the appellant under arrest and proceeded
with the charge. It would appear that that subsequent investigation included
questioning Mrs. Hickling, Peggy Hickling’s mother, as she gave evidence
at the trial that she had not requested the appellant to look after her
daughter since she had already arranged for a responsible person as baby sitter
for her children.

In his evidence, the appellant testified that his purpose in
going down to the Hickling apartment was that he knew Mrs. Hickling was
out of town and he thought that she might appreciate him “looking in on the
kids to see how they were doing and to be sure they were o.k.”. He acknowledged
that he did not recall Mrs. Hickling asking

[Page 899]

him directly to do so but said that they had had considerable
conversation and “I think I may have mentioned that I would check on the kids
when she was out of town”.

It should be added that both the appellant and James Hunt
admitted that they had drunk what they both described as a rather small
quantity of alcohol during the course of the evening. Upon all that evidence,
the magistrate convicted the accused of a breach of s. 293  of the Criminal
Code . That section provides:

293. (1) Every one who without lawful excuse, the proof of
which lies upon him, enters or is in a dwelling house with intent to commit an
indictable offence therein is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for ten years.

(2) For the purposes of proceedings under this section,
evidence that an accused, without lawful excuse, entered or was in a dwelling
house is prima facie evidence that he entered or was in the dwelling house with
intent to commit an indictable offence therein.

In view of the wording of the question of law propounded by this
Court in its order granting leave to appeal, the appellant chose to argue that
even upon the basis that the accused had not proved the lawful excuse, the
burden of proof which lies upon him under the provisions of s. 293 (1) ,
the Crown had failed to prove that there was any intent to commit an indictable
offence. By subs. (2) of s. 293 , evidence that the accused without lawful
excuse entered the dwelling house is prima facie evidence that he
intended to commit an indictable offence therein. Proof of the intent, of
course, is a necessary ingredient for a conviction and all that subs. (2) does
is to provide prima facie evidence not disturbing the principle of law
that on the whole evidence the Crown must prove each essential element
including, in this charge, the intent beyond reasonable doubt: Regina v.
Wendel[1]. It
was also pointed out in the judgment of Tysoe J.A. in that case that the intent
must exist at the time of the entry. Tremeear, in the 6th edition, at
p. 476, however, in the notes to the section, expresses the view that so
long as the intent and the being in the premises are in concurrence then a
conviction may be adjudged. The learned author of Tremeear bases his opinion on
The King v. Higgins[2], a
decision of the

[Page 900]

Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. In The King v. Higgins, the
charge was “for being unlawfully in a dwelling house by night with intent to
assault”, while in the Wendel case and the present case the charge is
“entering a dwelling house with intent”. I am, therefore, of the opinion that
here the judgment in the Wendel case outlines the applicable law and in
order to support a conviction it must be found that the accused had entered the
apartment with intent to commit an indictable offence.

When one turns to consider whether there was any evidence upon
which the magistrate could find beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had
entered the apartment with intent to commit an indictable offence, one asks
oneself what indictable offence is it alleged the accused intended to commit.
The form of charge, unlike those used on the great majority of occasions, does
not specify the intended indictable offence and merely describes it in the
words of the section, as “an indictable offence”. I have read the complete
evidence at trial, and such references to argument as are contained in the
appeal case and I have read the respondent’s factum, and I do not find therein
any clear statement of the offence which it was alleged the accused intended to
commit. It is true that the accused was charged at the same time with common
assault upon David Hunt and, pleading not guilty thereto, by consent the
evidence adduced in reference to the charge presently under appeal was applied
to the assault charge. The accused was convicted and was fined $100. Counsel
for the Crown in his argument before us would seem to rely upon that conviction
as showing the indictable offence which it was alleged the accused intended to
commit when he entered the apartment.

It is significant that the conviction for assault was one for
common assault. The learned magistrate said in discussion with counsel for the
accused:

In this particular case, I find that the intent on his own
evidence was to pull him back into bed, that was sufficient attempt to create
an assault here by touching that boy.

Counsel for the accused: With no hostile intent.

The learned magistrate: The attempt was to restrain
him, which is sufficient. I don’t accept your argument that it has to be
hostile in the sense that you are suggesting not with the new Criminal Code  as
we have it as of 1955.

[Page 901]

I cannot understand how upon the whole record there can be any
evidence that when the accused entered the apartment he had any intent to
commit an assault on the boy, David Hunt. There is no evidence that he knew the
age of the boy or even that he had known the boy at all. There is no evidence
that he knew the boy would be in bed or would be up and around. There is a
perfectly reasonable explanation given by the accused, and in no way
contradicted, that his whole intent, which was first arrived at after he
entered the apartment, was to persuade the boy to go to sleep, as a boy of that
age should have been asleep at that hour. The grasping of the boy by the arm or
his shoulder to prevent the boy from leaving his bed was only part of the
carrying out of the purpose, not any evidence of an intent to commit an
indictable offence.

The learned magistrate was much concerned with what he termed
“nasty, sexual overtones” but such concern which moved him to request a
pre-sentence report and which he even mentioned in his report to the Appellate
Division has no support whatsoever from the evidence. I have no hesitation in
saying there was no evidence of intent to commit an indictable offence against
the boy David Hunt at any time let alone at the time the accused entered the
apartment.

Was there any evidence of intent to commit an indictable offence
as to the girl Peggy Hickling? The accused had the girl in his car earlier and
had shown no such intent on that occasion. The accused was a good friend of the
girl’s mother. When the accused entered the apartment, on his explanation to
merely check on the girl’s welfare, he merely greeted her and she greeted him
as he walked past her into the boy’s room. The accused never moved near her or
touched her. She made no protest at his entry. Although in examination in chief
the girl testified in reply to clearly leading questions by the Crown that she
was frightened to ask the accused to leave, on cross-examination, she agreed
that such fear was really at the possible displeasure of the Hunts should they
return, as they did, and discover the accused in the apartment. Again, on all
of the evidence, there is simply no evidence of intent to commit any indictable
offence against the girl Peggy Hickling either at the time of the accused
entering into the apartment or thereafter.

[Page 902]

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and quash the
conviction.

In the Matter of a
Reference Re: Steven Murray Truscott

1967: January 25, 26, 27, 30; 1967: May 4.

Present: Taschereau C.J. and Cartwright,
Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.

Criminal law—Murder—Youth of 14½ years
convicted of murder—Circumstantial evidence—Whether proper trial—Reference to
Supreme Court of Canada—Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259,
s. 55.

In 1959, the accused, a boy of 14½ years, was
found guilty by a jury of the murder of a girl of 12 years and 9 months. Most
of the evidence was circumstantial and the accused did not give evidence at his
trial. The conviction was unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeal. An application
for leave to appeal to this Court was refused in February 1960.

Pursuant to s. 55 of the Supreme
Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, the governor general in council, in April
1966, referred to this Court for hearing and consideration the following question:
“Had an appeal by Steven Murray Truscott been made to the Supreme Court of
Canada, as is now permitted by Section 597A  of the Criminal Code  of
Canada, what disposition would the Court have made of such an appeal on a
consideration of the existing Record and such further evidence as the Court, in
its discretion, may receive and consider?”

At this hearing, the Court received a large
body of evidence, much of it relating to the medical aspects of the case and
also heard the oral evidence of the accused who had not given evidence at the
trial.

Held: Taschereau
C.J. and Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ.
would have dismissed such an appeal; Hall J. would have allowed the appeal,
quashed the conviction and directed a new trial.

Joint opinion of
the Chief Justice, Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and
Spence JJ.: The verdict of the jury, read in the light of the charge of the
trial judge, makes it clear that they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
that the facts, which they found to be established by the evidence which they
accepted, were not only consistent with the guilt of the accused but were
inconsistent with any rational conclusion other than that he was the guilty
person. On a review of all the evidence given at the trial, the verdict could
not be set aside on the ground that it was unreasonable or could not be
supported by the evidence. The verdict was in accordance with the evidence.
Furthermore, the judgment at trial could not have been set aside on the ground
of any wrong decision on a question of law or on the ground that there was a
miscarriage of justice. It follows that the judgment of the Court of Appeal
dismissing the appeal made to it was right. The effect of the additional evidence
which was heard by this Court, considered in its entirety, strengthens the view
that the verdict of the jury ought not to be disturbed.

Per Hall J., dissenting:
The trial was not conducted according to law. There were grave errors in
the trial. Nothing that transpired on the hearing in this Court or any evidence
tendered before this Court can be used to give validity to what was an invalid
trial.

Droit criminel—Meurtre—Garçon de 14½ ans
trouvé coupable de meurtre—Preuve circonstancielle—Le procès a-t-il été
instruit correctement—Question déférée à la Cour Suprême du Canada—Loi sur la
Cour Suprême, S.R.C. 1952, c. 259, art. 55.

En 1959, l’accusé, un garçon de 14½ ans, a
été trouvé coupable par un jury du meurtre d’une fillette de 12 ans et 9 mois.
La majorité de la preuve était circonstancielle et l’accusé n’a pas témoigné à
son procès. Le verdict de culpabilité fut confirmé unanimement par la Cour
d’Appel. Une requête pour permission d’appeler devant cette Cour a été refusée
en février 1960.

Conformément aux dispositions de l’art. 55 de
la Loi sur la Cour Suprême, S.R.C. 1952, c. 259, le gouverneur général
en conseil, en avril 1966, a déféré à cette Cour la question suivante pour
audition et considération: «Si un appel avait été présenté par Steven Murray
Truscott à la Cour Suprême du Canada, tel que cela est maintenant permis par
l’article 597A  du Code Criminel  du Canada, comment la Cour aurait-elle
disposé de cet appel après avoir considéré le dossier existant ainsi que toute
preuve additionnelle que la Cour peut, à sa discrétion, entendre et
considérer?»

Lors de cette audition, un grand nombre de
témoignages et de documents ont été présentés, dont une grande quantité se
rapportait aux aspects médicaux de la cause, et la Cour a aussi entendu le témoignage
de l’accusé qui n’avait pas témoigné lors de son procès.

Arrêt: Le Juge
en Chef Taschereau et les Juges Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson,
Ritchie et Spence auraient rejeté un tel appel; le Juge Hall aurait maintenu
l’appel, annulé le verdict de culpabilité et ordonné un nouveau procès.

L’opinion collective du Juge en Chef et des Juges Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland,
Judson, Ritchie et Spence: Le verdict du jury, considéré à la lumière de
l’exposé du juge au procès, démontre qu’ils étaient satisfaits hors de tout
doute raisonnable que les faits, qu’ils ont trouvé avoir été établis par la
preuve qu’ils ont acceptée, étaient non seulement compatibles avec la
culpabilité de l’accusé mais étaient incompatibles avec toute autre conclusion
rationnelle que celle qu’il était la personne coupable. Sur un examen de toute
la preuve qui a été présentée au procès, le verdict ne peut pas être mis de
côté pour le motif qu’il était déraisonnable ou ne pouvait pas s’appuyer sur la
preuve. Le verdict était d’accord avec la preuve. Bien plus, le jugement de
première instance ne peut pas être mis de côté pour le motif qu’il y avait eu
erreur sur une question de droit ou pour le motif qu’il y avait eu une erreur
judiciaire. Il s’ensuit que le jugement de la Cour d’Appel rejetant l’appel qui
lui avait été présenté n’était pas erroné. L’effet de la preuve additionnelle
qui a été entendue par cette Cour, considérée en entier, renforce l’opinion que
le verdict du jury ne devrait pas être changé.

Le Juge Hall, dissident:
Le procès n’a pas été instruit selon la loi. Il y a eu de graves erreurs
dans le procès. Pour rendre valide ce qui était un procès invalide, on ne peut
pas se servir de ce qui s’est passé lors de l’audition devant cette Cour ou de
la preuve qui a été présentée à la Cour.

General for Canada.

Joint opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE, CARTWRIGHT,
FAUTEUX, ABBOTT, MARTLAND, JUDSON, RITCHIE and SPENCE JJ.:—On September 16,
1959, Steven Murray Truscott, a boy of 14½ years, went on trial for the murder
of Lynne Harper, a girl of 12 years and 9 months. The trial lasted until
September 30, 1959, when the jury returned a verdict of guilty with a
recommendation for mercy. An appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] against the conviction was dismissed on
January 21, 1960. On the same date the sentence of death was commuted to a term
of life imprisonment. An application for leave to appeal to this Court from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal was refused on February 24, 1960. At that time
this Court had jurisdiction to entertain an appeal only in two cases: (a) where
there was dissent by a judge of the Court of Appeal on any question of law
(there was no such dissent in this case), or (b) on any question of law with
leave of this Court.

By Order-in-Council P.C. 1966/760, dated April
26, 1966, pursuant to s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act, His
Excellency

[Page 312]

the Governor General referred to this Court for
hearing and consideration the following question:

Had an Appeal by Steven Murray Truscott
been made to the Supreme Court of Canada, as is now permitted by
section 597A  of the Criminal Code  of Canada, what disposition would the
Court have made of such an Appeal on a consideration of the existing Record and
such further evidence as the Court, in its discretion, may receive and
consider?

Section 597A  of the Criminal Code  of
Canada was enacted by 1960-61, c. 44, s. 11 , in the following terms:

597A. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Act, a person

(a) who has been sentenced to death
and whose conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal, or

(b) who is acquitted of an
offence punishable by death and whose acquittal is set aside by the court of
appeal,

may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
on any ground of law or fact or mixed law and fact.

It came into force on July 13, 1961. On this
Reference, therefore, we have power to review law or fact or mixed law and
fact.

The Court also received a large body of
evidence, much of it relating to the medical aspects of the case. It also heard
the oral evidence of the accused. He had not given evidence at the trial.

The case against Steven Truscott was that he met
Lynne Harper in the school grounds on the Clinton R.C.A.F. Station at about
7.10 on the evening of June 9, 1959; that he travelled north with her on the
cross-bar of his bicycle on the county road; that he turned into Lawson’s bush,
which is about half way between the school grounds and Highway No. 8; and that
he murdered the girl there. His defence was that the girl had asked him to take
her to the intersection of Highway No. 8 and the county road; that he took
her to this intersection and left her there, and when he was part way on
his return journey, he saw a car stop at the intersection and pick her up,
and that he never saw her again.

For an understanding of the evidence, it is
necessary to describe the neighbourhood, a sketch plan of which is attached to
these reasons. The R.C.A.F. Station is at the southerly end of a county road
which goes north to King’s Highway No. 8. This highway runs east and west. On
leaving the Station, immediately on the right is the Robert Lawson farm
property. Close to the road there are the usual buildings, including a barn. On
the left is the O’Brien

[Page 313]

farm property. At the northerly limit of the
Lawson property there are 20 odd acres of bush, mostly second growth ash, elm,
maple and basswood. The wire fencing between the bush and the road is not in
very good condition. There is an entrance to the bush along the northerly
limit. It is referred to throughout the evidence as the “tractor trail”. From
the southerly end of the county road to the tractor trail is 3,366 feet. 1,568
feet farther north the Canadian National Railway crosses the road at right
angles. Then, 491 feet farther north there is a bridge over the Bayfield River.
This bridge is referred to frequently in the evidence. Then, 1,300 feet farther
north is the intersection of the county road with King’s Highway No. 8.
East from the bridge over the Bayfield River and visible from the bridge there
is a swimming hole about 640 feet away.

We will first describe the movements of Lynne
Harper in the late afternoon and early evening of June 9. She arrived home from
school between 5.15 and 5.30 p.m. and she had finished her supper by 5.45 p.m.
After supper she left the house for a short time to apply for a permit for the
swimming pool for that evening. She could not get the permit because it was
necessary for an infant to be accompanied by a grown-up person. Her parents
were unable to go with her that evening. About 6.35 she went to the schoolhouse
to assist a Mrs. Nickerson, who was conducting a meeting of Junior Girl
Guides. Mrs. Nickerson confirms the time of her arrival.
Mrs. Nickerson said that Truscott came along shortly before 7 p.m. and
that Lynne Harper went over to speak to him and that after a few minutes they
left together on foot in a northerly direction, Truscott pushing his bicycle.
She puts the time between 7.00 and 7.10 p.m.

An estimate of the time was also made by a
Mrs. Bohonus, an officer of the Brownie Pack, who came to assist
Mrs. Nickerson. Mrs. Bohonus said that shortly after she arrived, she
looked at her watch and it was ten minutes to seven. According to her, not more
than five or ten or, at most, fifteen minutes later, Steven Truscott appeared
and talked to Lynne Harper. Mrs. Bohonus does not say how long they talked
or at what time they left.

Three boys, Hatherall, Westey and McKay, were at
the football field adjoining the school and the county road. They saw Truscott
and Lynne Harper come from the

[Page 314]

school area to the county road. Lynne Harper got
on the cross-bar of Truscott’s bicycle and the two went north on the county
road.

We will now deal with Steven Truscott’s
movements during the early evening of June 9th before he met Lynne Harper. We
begin with the evidence of Jocelyne Goddette. She, Lynne Harper and Steven
Truscott were all in the same class, Grade VIII, at school. Jocelyne Goddette’s
story was that Steven Truscott had made an arrangement to meet her at Lawson’s
wood to show her anew calf. He told her to keep the arrangement quiet because
Mr. Lawson did not like people trespassing on his property. She says that
he called at her house about 5.50 p.m. and that she told him that she could not
come out at the moment because of domestic duties and that she would meet him
later if possible. Truscott denies that he made such an arrangement and the
call at the house. Jocelyne Goddette’s father said that there was a call such
as his daughter described but that he did not know who the caller was.

Truscott arrived home for supper between 5.15
and 5.30 p.m. His mother sent him to the store at the end of the street to get
some coffee. She fixes the time as close to six o’clock because there was need
to hurry in order to get there before closing time. He obtained the coffee and
returned home. After supper he went out. His mother had told him that he had to
be back by 8.30 p.m. because she and her husband were going out and he was
needed for baby sitting.

Paul Desjardine, à fourteen year old boy, rode
north on his bicycle to go fishing at the bridge over the Bayfield River at
about 6.10 p.m. He met Steven Truscott a short distance south of Lawson’s bush.
Steven was alone and was riding his bicycle around in a circle on the road.
There was no conversation. Truscott denies that there was such a meeting.

Mrs. Beatrice Geiger left her house in the
married quarters on the Base riding one of her sons’ bicycles to go to the
bridge. This was about ten minutes past six. On the way to the bridge Steven
Truscott passed her in the bush area riding his bicycle. They were both going
north. Steven went as far as the bridge, stopped a second or two, took a look

[Page 315]

around and headed south again. She met him the
second time at about the railroad tracks. This would be around twenty-five
minutes past six or half past six. Truscott said that he did not remember
seeing Mrs. Geiger.

Kenneth Geiger, the twelve year old son of
Mrs. Geiger, left his home about a quarter or twenty minutes after six to
go swimming. He walked to the school and met Robb Harrington and the two boys
rode double on one bicycle down to the river. On the way down from the school
area to the bridge he saw Steven Truscott. He was sitting on his bicycle in the
middle of the road almost opposite the “tractor trail”, which is on the northerly
limit of Lawson’s bush. He was facing towards the station. They passed Steven
at about 6.25 or 6.27 p.m. Steven said to Kenneth Geiger that Mrs. Geiger
was at the bridge and Kenneth Geiger said that he knew that. Robb Harrington
estimates the time as being a quarter to seven. Truscott denies that he ever
saw or spoke to Kenneth Geiger.

Ronald Demaray saw Steven on the bridge just
before he went home. He believes that he got home between 6:30 and 7 p.m. and
that it would take him ten minutes to get home from the bridge. As far as he
could see, Steven was alone and just seemed to be looking around.

Richard Gellatly, a boy of twelve years, was at
the river on the evening of June 9. He had to return home to get his swimming
trunks. He met Steven riding Lynne Harper towards the bridge on the county road
about one-quarter of the way from O’Brien’s farm. Gellatly was riding south on
his bicycle and Steven Truscott and Lynne Harper were riding north. He met them
on the station side of Lawson’s bush, that is, on the south side. He gives the
time as 7:25 p.m. He says that he could be a few minutes out. He put on his
trunks at home and returned to the river. It was about ten minutes after he
passed Steven and Lynne that he went back to the river. He did not see Steven
again. He was familiar with Steven’s bicycle. He did not see the bicycle. He
said that if it had been lying alongside the road by Lawson’s bush or anywhere
alongside the road, he would have seen it.

Mrs. Donna Dunkin drove to the river on the
county road from the married quarters on the evening of June 9. She

[Page 316]

travelled from the married quarters at the
station and pulled off the road just north of the railroad tracks. She saw
Richard Gellatly riding his bicycle towards the station just as she pulled off
the road to park. She also saw Philip Burns, who was walking behind Richard
Gellatly. At the time she saw them, they were between the railway tracks and
the bridge over the river. Philip Burns would be no more than ten feet behind
Richard Gellatly. She placed the time between 7:05 and 7:15 p.m.

Philip Burns, a boy of eleven years, who was
unsworn, started to go south to the Air Force Station from the bridge on foot.
He was behind Richard Gellatly. Gellatly started from the bridge on a bicycle.
Burns left at approximately 7 o’clock. He fixes the time because he asked
Mrs. Geiger what time it was. She did not have a watch. Sergeant
McCafferty was close and he said it was around five to seven. Sergeant
McCafferty gave evidence on the point and said that when Mrs. Geiger asked
him for the time he looked at his watch and said either ten to seven or ten
past seven, he could not remember which. Philip Burns says that he swam over to
the south side of the river, put on his clothes and went up on the bridge where
he waited around for five or ten minutes after being told the time, then he
started for home.

Gellatly had left the swimming hole at about the
same time. He went along the north bank of the river and Burns along the south
bank of the river. Both were on their way home. They left the bridge at about
the same time, Burns on foot and Gellatly on his bicycle. This was between 7
and 7:15 p.m.

Gellatly gave evidence that he met Truscott and
Lynne Harper south of Lawson’s bush at a point between the bush and O’Brien’s
farm. Burns says that he never did meet Truscott and Lynne Harper or either of
them. While walking on his way home, he did meet Jocelyne Goddette and had some
brief conversation with her. She was on her bicycle and she was near the south
side of the bush closest to the station. She was going north towards the river.
Further south along the road near O’Brien’s farm and about two minutes later,
he also met Arnold George, who was also going north and was behind Jocelyne
Goddette.

[Page 317]

When Burns met Jocelyne Goddette he had been
walking for about ten minutes after leaving the bridge with Gellatly. Michael
Burns, a brother of Philip Burns, says that Philip got home about 7:30 p.m.

Jocelyne Goddette, who was thirteen years of age
at the time, says, in more detail than we have already outlined, that on
Monday, June 8, she had a conversation at school with Steven Truscott. She said
to him that on Sunday, the day before, she had gone to Lawson’s barn and had
seen a calf there. Steven asked her if she wanted to see two more new-born
calves. She said “Yes” and he asked her if she could make it on Monday, and she
said “No”. He asked her if she could make it on Tuesday and she said she would
try. Then on Tuesday, he repeated his invitation and she told him she did not
know whether she could go and he invited her to meet him if she could go on the
right-hand side of the county road just outside the fence by the woods. He
repeated his warning not to tell anybody. The time for the appointment was six
o’clock. She says that he called at the house at ten to six when she told him
that she could not go but that she would try later. She had her supper and left
the house about 20 minutes after 6 or 6:30, and went towards Lawson’s barn to
see if Steven was there. It would take but a few minutes to get to Lawson’s
barn. She stayed there for about five minutes. Steven was not at Lawson’s and
she went to see if he was at the meeting place. The meeting place was on the
right-hand side of the county road just outside the fence by the woods. She met
Philip Burns at the southerly limit of Lawson’s bush and had a brief
conversation with him. She bicycled north and got off her bicycle and walked
slowly looking into the woods. She turned in the tractor trail and went three-quarters
of the way in and then looked towards the railway bridge. She shouted Steven’s
name twice and then looked towards the woods and shouted it three or four
times. She turned her bicycle around on the hard part of the ground and at that
point she saw Arnold George going past. Arnold George also saw her on the
tractor trail forty feet back. She did not see any sign of Steven on the
tractor trail. When she saw Arnold George he was just going past the entrance
to the tractor trail. She and George were both looking for Steven Truscott and
they had a brief conversation. While they

[Page 318]

were talking Bryan Glover passed on his way to
the bridge. He noticed them but did not stop. She came out of the tractor trail
and went towards the river to the bridge. She did not see Steven at the river.
She stayed there five or ten minutes and went back to Lawson’s farm. She
estimated that she got back to Lawson’s a little before seven. She remained in
the barn with Mr. Lawson for an hour and a half while he was doing his
chores. The next morning at school she asked Steven why he had not been there
and he just shrugged his shoulders.

Bryan Glover says that he arrived at the bridge
a minute or two before George. He then looked for some friends on the west side
of the river and about five minutes later returned to the bridge, saw his
friends on the railway bridge over the river and went to join them. When George
arrived at the bridge he says that he went over to the swimming hole, still
looking for Truscott.

There is obviously something very wrong with
Jocelyne Goddette’s times. The jury would have to test her estimate of time
along with the evidence of the time when Philip Burns and Arnold George were on
the road and spoke to her and Bryan Glover who passed and noticed her, and also
the evidence of Mr. Lawson. Lawson says that she first arrived at his barn
at approximately 7:15. She left at 7:25. He fixes this time because she asked
him the time before she left. She returned in twenty minutes to half an hour
later.

Teunis Vandenpool, a boy of 15 years of age,
lived on a farm on Highway No. 8 about a mile and a quarter east of the county
road. On June 9 after supper he went swimming. He left his home at five or ten
minutes after seven. He went west on Highway No. 8 and then down the county
road. He was travelling by bicycle and was at the junction of Highway No. 8 and
the county road about 7:15 or 7:20 o’clock. He didn’t see any persons at or
near the corner. He didn’t see a car stopped. After he reached the corner he
went down towards the bridge.

Between the bridge and the railroad is a field
and he went down the path leading towards the river. This would be west of the
bridge. He had his bathing suit on and he took off his clothes and went in the
water. He remained in the water for ten or fifteen minutes and went home. He

[Page 319]

estimates that he made the return trip to the
intersection of the county road between 7:30 and 7:35 o’clock. He arrived
home at a quarter to eight. He noticed that when he started to do his homework,
which was immediately after he got home. He didn’t know Lynne Harper or Steven
Truscott. He did not see a girl on a bicycle on the county road or a boy in red
jeans. Truscott was wearing red jeans that evening. There were bicycles parked
on the bridge but no persons on the bridge.

Steven Truscott was back at the schoolyard at 8
p.m. or shortly after that hour. He was back at home by between 8:25 and 8:30
p.m. according to the evidence of Mrs. Truscott, and he was seen at his
home by his friend Arnold George about 8:45 p.m. We deal later with the
conversation between these two at that time.

Truscott admitted that he had met Gellatly. He
made this admission to F/Sgt. Johnson and Sgt. Anderson of the Ontario
Provincial Police on Wednesday, June 10, and to Sgt. Wheelhouse of the R.C.A.F.
and Constable Hobbs of the O.P.P. on Thursday morning, June 11. F/Sgt. Johnson
said that Truscott’s definition of the place of meeting was “just about the
brow of the hill,” which is a short distance south of the tractor trail; Sergeant
Anderson that it was “halfway between the intersection at the school, the
public school and the bush”, which is about where Gellatly said it was;
Sergeant Wheelhouse that is was “about halfway between where I had picked up
Lynne and the crest of the hill”, which is much the same as the admission to
Sergeant Anderson.

The case went to the jury with five witnesses
saying that they did not see Truscott and Lynne on the road. Two of these were
actively looking for him.

The Crown’s submission was that after he passed
Gellatly he turned into the bush with Lynne and that this accounted for the
failure of the other witnesses to see him on the road with Lynne. On the other
hand, three witnesses who were called by the defence, Douglas Oats, Gordon
Logan and Allan Oats, say that they did see Truscott on the road. The first
two, Douglas Oats and Gordon Logan, say that they saw him cross the bridge with
Lynne on his way to the highway. Allan Oats says that he saw Steven on the
bridge alone some time between 7:30 and 8 p.m.

[Page 320]

Douglas Oats, aged 11 years, said that he was on
the bridge over the Bayfield River on the evening of June 9 looking for
turtles. Steven Truscott and Lynne Harper came by him on the bridge. He turned
around and put up his hand and said “Hi”. Lynne was seated on the cross-bar of
the bicycle. They were going north towards No. 8 highway. He did not see Lynne
again and did not see Steven again that night. He stayed on the bridge until
about 7.30 and got home about a quarter to eight. The only time that he saw
Steven that night, Lynne was with him.

Gordon Logan, aged 13, first heard that Lynne
Harper was missing on the morning of June 10 just before school started. The
previous evening he had been down at the Bayfield River fishing and swimming.
He saw Steven and Lynne go by on the bridge on Steven’s bicycle. Lynne was
sitting on the cross-bar on the bicycle. He made this observation when he was
down at the swimming hole. He was out of the water. The two were near the north
side of the bridge when he last saw them travelling towards Highway No. 8. He
was standing just by the bend in the river on a big rock. This rock is 642 feet
from the bridge at water level. He saw Steven about five minutes later when
Steven rode back to the bridge, stopped and got off his bicycle. He does not
know what Steven did from then on.

The presence of Gordon Logan at the swimming
hole at 7:30 p.m. was confirmed by Beatrice Geiger, who was at the swimming
hole at that time. She also said that there were people on the bridge. She
could not tell whether they were men or women or children, or boys or girls.
She did not pay too much attention. She thought that from where she was, had
she been looking for someone she knew, she could have recognized him.

Allan Oats, 16 years of age, says that he went
for a ride on his bicycle towards the river. He turned back when he was about
800 feet from the bridge. He saw Steven standing on the bridge wearing red
pants and a light coloured shirt. He places the time between 7:30 and 8 o’clock.

The prosecution suggested that Douglas Oats was
mistaken; that on his own admission he only saw Truscott once that evening and
that the time must have been 6:30 p.m., when Douglas Oats was looking for
turtles at the

[Page 321]

bridge and Truscott was alone at the bridge.
This was based on the evidence of Mrs. Geiger and Demaray.

Gordon Logan’s evidence was questioned on the
ground of credibility and ability to make the observation that he claimed to
have made.

The credibility of Allan Oats was also attacked.
He had evidence highly favourable to Truscott on Tuesday, June 9. He said that
he mentioned it to nobody except his mother and no one else knew about it until
Tuesday, June 16, when he was approached by Mrs. Durnin at the request of
Truscott’s father.

This conflict between evidence pointing to a
disappearance into Lawson’s bush and evidence asserting that Steven Truscott
had crossed the bridge with Lynne Harper on his way to the highway and had
returned alone, was the critical issue in this case and it was entirely a jury
problem. The Judge’s instruction to the jury on the issue was emphatic and
clear:

Now then, it is the theory of the Defence,
and they brought evidence to show that, as I say this little Douglas Oats saw
them going across the bridge and then, in a few minutes, according to the boy
by the name of Gordon Logan—Gordon Logan also says he saw them going north on
the bridge and in about five minutes he says he saw Steven return alone. Well,
as regards Gordon Logan, it will be for you Gentlemen to say whether you
believe his evidence, and it is very important, Gentlemen, because if you
believe the Defence theory of this matter and believe Steven’s statement to the
police and to other people, that the girl was driven to Number Eight Highway and
entered an automobile which went east; it is my view that you must acquit the
boy if you believe that story.

In other words, I will put it this way. In
order to convict this boy, you have to completely reject that story as having
no truth in it, as not being true. You have to completely reject that story.

Arnold George says that on the evening of Lynne
Harper’s disappearance he went to Truscott’s house about 8.45 p.m. He gives the
following account of their conversation:

Q. What was said?

A. Well, I asked him where he had been that
night and he said: “Down at the river”. I said: “I heard that you had given
Lynne a ride down to the river,” and he said: “Yes, she wanted a lift down to
Number Eight Highway.” And I said: “I heard you were in the bush with her”. And
he said: “No, we were on the side of the bush looking for a cow and calf.” And
he said: “Why do you want to know for?” and I said: “Skip it and let’s play
ball.”

[Page 322]

At the preliminary hearing he had not said
anything about Steven saying that he was on the side of the bush looking for a
cow and calf.

Truscott in his oral evidence denied that there
was ever any such visit from Arnold George or any such conversation.

Next, on the evening of Wednesday, June 10,
Arnold George says that he had another conversation with Steven:

Q. And what was said on that occasion?

A. Well he said that he—like the Police had
questioned him and that he had told them he had seen me down there, and it
wasn’t me, it was Gordie Logan; and he thought that Gordie was me and he said
that I had seen him, so he told the Police that. And down there at his house he
told that to me and he said that the Police were going to go down to my place
to check up, so I agreed that I would tell them what was just said.

George did support Truscott’s story in his
statements to the police but after the discovery of the body the following day,
Thursday, July 11, he retracted them. His evidence at the trial we have already
outlined. It was that he had been looking for Steven and had not seen him.

Truscott, on the reference, denied that this
conversation ever took place either on the evening of Wednesday, June 10, or at
any other time.

On Wednesday evening, June 10, there was talk
about the disappearance among five boys who were together at the bridge. These
were Paul Desjardine, Arnold George, Thomas Gillette, Bryan Glover and Steven
Truscott. Paul Desjardine was telling Truscott that he had heard that he had
taken Lynne into the bush. The account of the conversation varies from boy to
boy but there is no doubt, according to these witnesses, that a suspicion was
being voiced and that Truscott was appealing to Arnold George in support of his
denial and that George was supporting him to the extent of saying that Steven
was at the side of the bush looking for the cow and the calf.

Truscott did not give oral evidence at the
trial. His defence that he had taken Lynne Harper to the
intersection where she had been picked up by a strange car was before the
jury in the form of exculpatory statements given to the police. On the
reference he did give oral evidence in more detail. He described his movements
from the time he left school until he went home to supper. Before supper and

[Page 323]

just before the store closed, he went to get the
coffee for his mother. He left home about 6.30 p.m. and went first to the
school grounds. He found no one there and rode down to the railroad tracks on
his bicycle. He could see no one at the river so he turned around a couple of
times and went back to the station. He said that he met no one on the waydown
or back. He stopped at the end of the school and was watching the Brownies.
Lynne Harper came over and asked him for a lift down to No. 8 Highway. After a
few minutes they walked to the county road and then got on the bicycle. He says
that they left at 7.30 p.m. He fixed the time by the school clock. On the way
down to No. 8 Highway he passed Douglas Oats on the bridge. He let Lynne Harper
off at the highway and rode back to the bridge. When he arrived at the bridge,
he looked back and saw “there was a car pulled in off the highway and she got
in the front seat”. He said the car was facing northeast. He described the car
as a 1959 grey Chevrolet with what appeared to be a yellow coloured licence
plate. He next said that he stayed at the bridge for five or ten minutes and
from there saw Arnold George and Gordon Logan at the swimming hole. He then
went back to the school, arriving there about 8 p.m.

On Truscott’s return to the school grounds there
is evidence that there was some curiosity among a group of children about what
had happened to Lynne Harper. Several children had seen him leave with her. He
came back alone. When asked whether they made any comment to him or whether
there was any conversation with them, he replied in the following words:

I believe one of them asked me—they said
“What did you do with Harper, feed her to the fish?” and I replied that I had
taken her and let her off at Highway No. 8.

When Truscott returned to the schoolyard at
approximately 8 p.m, no one noticed anything unusual about his demeanour,
conduct or the condition of his clothing. Most of his conversation appears to
have been with his older brother Kenneth. This conversation was testified to by
three witnesses who were standing fairly close. These witnesses were John
Carew, Lorraine Wood and Lyn Johnston. It had to do with an exchange of
bicycles and an exchange of shoes. Kenneth Truscott had with him a smaller
bicycle belonging to a younger brother. Steven Truscott was going

[Page 324]

home and he left his own bicycle and took the
smaller one with him. There was also some conversation between the two about
shoes. Steven Truscott was wearing crepe-soled canvas shoes belonging to
Kenneth. Kenneth was wearing a pair of Steven’s high boots. No exchange was
actually made.

The crepe-soled canvas shoes did not enter into
the trial because of a ruling of the trial judge that the prosecution had no
right to call more expert evidence. But on the reference a photograph was
introduced of the impression of a shoe near the girl’s body. The marks of the
rubber in a foot impression near the body of Lynne Harper corresponded with the
marks of the shoe worn by Truscott to this extent: The shoes were of similar
manufacture, the marks resembled each other, but the most that the evidence
proves is that someone wearing shoes similar to those worn by Truscott on the
night of the disappearance made a foot impression close to the body of Lynne
Harper. There was no further identification. The evidence does not prove that
the impression was made by the very shoes worn by Steven Truscott.

Truscott was unable to state the exact time of
his arrival at home but his father and mother were still there. He says that he
spent the rest of the evening at home and that the first occasion on which he
knew that anything unusual had happened to Lynne Harper was when her father
came to the house the following morning, which would be June 10, before he had
left for school. The following is his account on the brief conversation at the
house:

Q. What happened when he came?

A. He asked me if I had seen Lynne.

Q. Did he ask you or did he ask your
mother?

A. I believe he asked my mother and my
mother called me over and

I informed him that I had given her a ride
to the highway.

Q. Anything else?

A. I don’t remember anything else.

Q. Do you remember when the first time you
mentioned, if you did mention it, a grey 1959 Chevrolet car to anybody?

A. I don’t remember who the first one was
that I mentioned it to.

Q. Do you remember when you mentioned it,
even if you do not remember who you mentioned it to?

A. I believe it was the police.

Mr. Harper’s account of the conversation is
that Truscott did say on this occasion that Lynne “had hitched a

[Page 325]

ride on No. 8 Highway”. There is nothing in the
record to indicate that Truscott had mentioned the car to anyone on his return
to the schoolyard.

We have already said in dealing with the
evidence of Arnold George that George said that he visited Truscott soon after
Truscott’s return to the house to enquire about Lynne Harper. He also gave
evidence of another conversation the following evening when he said that he was
asked to say that he had seen Truscott at the bridge. We have also mentioned
Truscott’s denial of both these conversations.

Truscott gave his own version of the
conversation among the five boys at the bridge on Wednesday evening, June 10.
It differs from the account given by the boys at the trial. Their evidence is
summarized above. This is Truscott’s account:

Q. Was there any conversation about Miss Harper?

A. One of the fellows mentioned something
about it, yes.

Q. Do you remember what it was he said?

A. He said, “I. heard you had Lynne in the
bush”.

Q. What did you say?

A. I asked him who had told him this and he
said Arnold George did.

I went over and asked Arnold George and he
said he had never told anybody that.

Q. Were you in the bush with her?

A. No, sir.

Q. How was this said when it was said, that
he heard you had her in the bush?

A. More or less kidding with each other.

Q. Did you make any statement that you were
not in the bush, you had just been at the edge of the bush looking for calves,
or anything of that nature?

A. No, sir.

Q. Had you been anywhere near the bush
looking for calves with Miss Harper?

A. No, I wasn’t.

Q. Do you remember any discussion about
that time about calves in the bush?

A. No, sir.

Truscott denied any conversation with Jocelyne
Goddette concerning the making of an appointment to go looking for newborn
calves. He denied that he called at Jocelyne Goddette’s house about 5:50 p.m.
to confirm the appointment. He denied that on the trip down to the river
between 6 and 7 p.m. he met Ken Geiger and Robb Harrington. He denied any
conversation with Geiger about his mother being at the

[Page 326]

river. He denied that he had seen Mrs. Geiger
or Paul Desjardine during the course of that trip and said that he did not
remember any of them giving evidence at his trial. He denied having seen either
Robb Harrington, who was with Geiger, or Ronald Demaray, who says that he was
at the bridge while Truscott was there. These were all people who gave evidence
that they met him and described his movements on the road between 6.30 and 7.00
p.m.

He denied that he had met Gellatly on the
highway and said that he did not remember telling the police that he had met
Gellatly. At the trial Gellatly’s evidence had not been challenged on
cross-examination.

He denied that Arnold George came to his house
at 8.30 p.m. on June 9 and that he had any conversation with George at any time
during that evening. This was the occasion when George said that he had heard
that Truscott was in the bush with Lynne and when Truscott had replied that he
was on the side of the bush looking for a cow and a calf.

He denied that he had any conversation with
George the following evening, Wednesday, June 10. This is the occasion when
George said that he had agreed with Truscott to tell the police that he,
George, had seen Truscott at the bridge on Tuesday evening.

Truscott told the police that when Lynne entered
the car at the highway intersection, it was facing northeast and that he could
see the colour of the licence plate when he was standing on the bridge looking
towards Highway No. 8. The police questioned this. Constable Tremblay, Ontario
Provincial Police, stood on the bridge on Wednesday, June 10, with Truscott and
his mother. From the bridge Tremblay noted that he could not see any licence
plates on cars proceeding along Highway No. 8 and also, that when a car with
black and white plates travelled north on the county road and reached the
highway, he could no longer see the licence plates. The bridge is 1,300 feet
from the highway intersection. A photograph was introduced which seemed to
support the police evidence.

On the reference this photograph was described
as being highly distorted and not representing what could be seen by the human
eye standing where Truscott said he was

[Page 327]

standing. Also on the reference, evidence was
given by a team of private investigators who had various colours of licence
plates that identification of colour could be made from the bridge. The Crown
did not introduce evidence to contradict this.

In the final argument, Crown counsel said he
accepted the evidence such as it was. His criticism of the evidence was that on
the admission of the witness who drove the car, it could only be placed in the
position where it was photographed by driving east across the intersection,
stopping and backing up to place the car in a northeasterly position where it
would catch the late afternoon sun, and that no car travelling from west to
east would get into that position in the way Truscott described to pick up a
hitch-hiker standing on the southeast corner of the intersection. The evidence
given on the reference proves no more than this, that if a car is placed in
this position at a certain time with the sun shining on the licence plate, an
investigator standing at the bridge and knowing what he was looking for could
identify colours, but not entirely without error.

The evidence at the reference upon this topic would
seem to weaken the Crown’s submission to the jury as based on the evidence
adduced at the trial that Truscott could not have seen from the bridge what he
alleged he had seen, i.e., that Lynne Harper entered a 1959 grey Bel-Air
Chevrolet with a yellow licence plate, as it would seem that if that car had
been in the one position in which the vehicle used by the witness LaBrash to
carry out his test had been placed, Truscott could have made such observation.
The purpose of that evidence at trial, however, was to attack the credibility
of Truscott on this important part of his defence. Since the evidence was given
at trial, Truscott has testified on the reference. We refer herein to the parts
of his testimony which simply cannot be believed. In such circumstances, the
evidence given at the reference in relation to the possibility of making the
observation of an automobile so placed becomes of much less importance.

The body of Lynne Harper was found on Thursday,
June 11, 1959, at 1:45 p.m., in Lawson’s bush some distance in from the tractor
trail. The evidence strongly pointed to this as the place where she was raped
and murdered. We have

[Page 328]

already quoted from the instruction of the trial
judge to the effect that the jury could not convict unless the jury entirely
rejected the evidence of Douglas Oats and Gordon Logan that they saw Truscott
on the bridge with Lynne Harper on their way to the highway intersection. All
the evidence, including the medical evidence, has to be related to this
critical issue.

An outline of the problem facing the jury at the
trial seems to be this. First of all, they had the time of departure from the
school grounds fixed with reasonable certainty by the evidence of
Mrs. Nickerson and Mrs. Bohonus at not later than 7:15 p.m. Then, on
his own admission, Truscott met Richard Gellatly between the school yard and
Lawson’s bush. He did not meet Philip Burns as he should have done if he had
continued on his way to the highway. He was not seen by Jocelyne Goddette and
Arnold George as he would have been if he had continued on to the highway and
had returned alone from the intersection to the bridge. The jury’s
conclusion must have been that after passing Richard Gellatly and before Philip
Burns, Jocelyne Goddette and Arnold George had an opportunity to see him, he
had disappeared with the girl into Lawson’s bush.

Before they could come to this conclusion the
jury had to reject the evidence of Douglas Oats and Gordon Logan and they must
have done so with the emphatic warning of the trial judge in their minds. On
Truscott’s story, the girl was proposing to go to a place where there were a
few ponies. This was about 500 yards east of the intersection. Yet according to
him she was still at the intersection when Truscott had returned to the bridge
1,300 feet to the south, from which point he says that he saw her getting into
a car, although she was only proposing to go 500 yards. If this were true, then
whoever picked her up or some other person would have had to bring her back to
Lawson’s bush, either dead or alive, unnoticed by anyone. If dead, he would
have had to place her body in the bush and create the appearance that she had
been murdered at that spot.

We do not think that there is any doubt about
the place of death. The position of the body, the scuff marks and a footprint
at the foot, and the flattening of the vegetation between the legs, indicated
that the act of rape took place

[Page 329]

there. There were a number of puncture wounds on
her back and shoulders, some of which were caused before death and some after
death. Under the wound in her left shoulder, which she suffered before death,
was a pool of fluid blood lying on the vegetation. The wounds were consistent
with their having been made by twigs scattered around the ground. A small
quantity of blood was found on the dandelion leaves at the fork of the body.
Under her left shoulder was a button from her blouse. According to the evidence
of Elgin Brown, this button would be ripped from her blouse when it was torn to
form the ligature with which she was strangled. Her clothing was in the area
where the body lay.

There was evidence on the reference but not at
the trial given in support of a theory that the girl had been killed elsewhere
and her body subsequently brought back to the woods where it was found. This
evidence was based on an observation from photographs of the body of what
appeared to the witness to be a condition of blanching. This will be dealt with
later.

We will do no more at this point with the
medical evidence than attempt to summarize what was before the jury and what
the issues were. The first witness was Dr. J. Ll. Penistan, who held an
appointment as pathologist in the Attorney General’s Department and was
pathologist in charge of the laboratories at the Stratford General Hospital. He
arrived at Lawson’s bush at 4:45 p.m. on June 11. He described the position of
the body on the ground and the state of the body and the clothing. The girl’s
blouse had been torn up one side and was tied tightly around the neck and secured
by a knot under the jaw on the left side. There was a pool of blood under the
left shoulder, enough to enable him to take a sample amounting to a dessert or
tablespoonful. He described the condition of the ground below the fork of the
body and took samples of dandelion leaves.

The body was removed to Clinton where he
conducted an autopsy the same evening. He certified the cause of death as
strangulation by a ligature. He removed from the stomach about one pint of a
meal of mixed meat and vegetables. Very little of the meal had passed from the
duodenum

[Page 330]

into the small intestine. His conclusion on the
time of death is contained in the following extract from his report:

Note on time of death: This opinion, which would place the time of death between 7.15 and
7.45 p.m. on 9th June, 1959, is based on the following observations and
assumptions:—

1. The extent of decomposition, which is
entirely compatible with death approximately 45 hours prior to identification,
having regard to the environmental and climatic conditions.

2. The extent of rigor mortis. This had
almost passed off, a finding again compatible with death at the suggested time.

3. The limited degree of digestion, and the
large quantity of food in the stomach. I find it difficult to believe that this
food could have been in the stomach for as long as two hours unless some
complicating factor was present, of which I have no information. If the last
meal was finished at 5.45 p.m., I would therefore conclude that death occurred
prior to 7.45 p.m. The finding would be comparable (sic) with death as early as
7.15 p.m.

The other medical evidence given by the
prosecution related to the condition of Truscott’s penis. On the evening of
Friday, June 12, 1959, in the presence of his father, Truscott was examined by
Dr. Addison, the family physician, and Dr. Brooks, Senior Air Force
Medical Officer. They found what they described as two lesions, one on each of
the lateral sides of the shaft of the penis, about the size of a twenty-five
cent piece, oozing serum. These lesions were immediately behind the glans. The
penis appeared swollen and slightly reddened at the distal end.

Dr. Addison said it looked like a brush
burn of two or three days’ duration. He was of the opinion that there was
nothing inconsistent with the injuries having been caused by entry into a young
small virgin. The injuries could have been caused by a boy of Truscott’s size
and age trying to make entry into an under-developed 12 year old girl.

From his examination of the penial injuries, Dr. Brooks
was of the opinion that they had been incurred between 60 and 80 hours
previously. In fixing the time he allowed for the fact that the injuries would
not be exposed to the air.

The medical evidence for the defence was given
by Dr. Berkely Brown. He is a specialist in internal medicine and a member
of the staff of the Department of Medicine, University of Western Ontario
Medical School. His opinion was that normal emptying time of the stomach after
a mixed meal would be three and one-half to four hours.

[Page 331]

As to the condition of the penis, he thought
that it was highly unlikely that penetration would produce the lesions
described. His opinion was that it is rare that the penis is injured during
rape and that if it is, the injury is usually to the frenum.

We do not wish to give any impression from this
brief summary that the medical evidence at trial was in any way perfunctory. It
was, in our opinion, careful and detailed, and it was tested by careful and
detailed cross-examination. Our purpose at the present time is to show that the
medical issues before the jury were well defined. These issues were the time of
death and the condition of Truscott’s penis as implicating him in the
commission of the crime. On the reference many more witnesses were called. Some
supported Dr. Penistan’s opinion on the time of death, some
Dr. Brown’s. Some said that the condition of Truscott’s penis was
consistent with rape. Others supported an innocent explanation, including
Truscott himself. This evidence will have to be analysed in detail. The
prosecution submits that the whole of the evidence, including the medical
evidence given at trial, after being weighed by the jury leads inevitably to
the conclusion of guilt and that there was no room for any other rational
conclusion. The Crown’s further submission is that there were no new issues
raised on the reference in connection with the time of death and that there was
simply more evidence relating to it and that the weight of this evidence
supports Dr. Penistan’s opinion that death occurred within two hours of
the last known meal, that is, before 7:45 p.m.

We next set out the following more detailed
summaries of the medical evidence:

(a) Medical evidence at the trial as to the time
of death.

(b) Medical evidence at the trial and on the
reference relating to the condition of Truscott’s penis.

(c) Medical evidence on the reference taken
witness by witness.

(a) Medical evidence at the trial as to the
time of death

From the opening of the trial the attention of
the jury was sharply focussed on the importance of the medical evidence as to
the time of death.

[Page 332]

In opening the case to the jury Crown Counsel
referred twice to the medical evidence as to the time of death as follows:

On this day, Tuesday, June 9th, you will
hear witnesses tell of. Lynne’s movements after she left school, playing
football as some member of the school team. Some playing field on or near the
locale of this, being driven home by her teacher, having her supper with her
mother and father, and being seen walking away from her home after the
completion of supper. I am avoiding, quite deliberately, giving you times in
there of when she arrived home. When she had her supper. When she finished her
last meal. When she left the house. I will simply say it was about the supper
hour. These times are important, Gentlemen, and I want you to note them as you
hear from her parents. They won’t follow one another probably. The mother first
and perhaps a little later the father, but I would ask you to note, when they
are in the box, what she had to eat. Also when she finished her meal, and I
will tell you why. You will later hear from a Provincial Pathologist who did a
post-mortem on her body, and he will give you an opinion on the time of her
death, based on his observation of her stomach and its contents. His opinion
will be based, probably the time of death, to the time of finishing the last
meal, so I will prefer you to hear that, because it is of such importance, from
the lips of the witnesses, themselves.

* *
*

The body was later removed—when I say
later, that same afternoon, that later afternoon, to Clinton, where Doctor
Penistan, who arrived on the scene at the bush did a post-mortem. He will
testify as to the cause of death and also the probable time of death.

As witnesses were called for the defence,
Counsel for the Defence was required to address the jury first. His address
commenced at 10.00 a.m. on Tuesday, September 29th, 1959, and concluded at 4.40
p.m. the same day. There was an adjournment for lunch from 12.45 p.m. to 2.15
p.m. and during the afternoon there was a short recess.

All that Counsel for the Defence said as to the
time of death as shown by the medical evidence was as follows:

Now then, there is the question of the time
of death. The opinion of an expert is only as good as the facts on which it is
based, the opinion is based. If the opinion of an expert is based on facts that
are incorrect, then that opinion should carry no weight. When Doctor Penistan
said to you Gentlemen: “I place the time of death between seven and seven‑forty-five,
and I place it at that time because a stomach with a normal meal should empty
in from one to two hours, but this meal was poorly masticated and that would
increase the time which would be taken to digest this food and I allowed an
extra hour because of the poorly masticated meal, and allowing that hour I have
placed the time of death at seven to seven-forty-five, because I concluded this
food had not been in that stomach more than two hours”. And you heard about his
examination. The stomach was emptied into this quart sealer, and then he and
Doctor Brooks took the sealer and turned it around like this, and looked at it.
And they say they

[Page 333]

saw this and they saw that. Now, what in
the world kind of examination is that on the contents of the stomach to base a
time of death? To give evidence on a serious charge such as this?

Here was a Government Pathologist making
his examination by looking at the contents in a bottle with the light against
him and the light behind him. There was no chemical examination of the contents
of that stomach. There is no evidence of any chemical examination of the
contents of that stomach. Doctor Penistan was asked if there was any
examination to determine, the hydrochloric acid content of the stomach, which
is a good gauge as to the time to which digestion had progressed. No such test
was made.

Now, you heard the evidence of Doctor
Brown. He graduated in 1940. He spent a year in pathology and five years in the
Army, doing postgraduate work for two years at London, Ontario. He took two
more years in London, England. He received a degree of Member of the Royal
College of Physicians. He is on the staff of the Medical school of Western
University. He specializes in diseases of the stomach. He is a consultant to
the Ontario Cancer Association. Consultant to the Department of Veterans’
Affairs and consultant to the Ontario Hospital, but not on mental problems, but
the internal physical problems. Now, there is a man of very considerable standing
and must be a man who knows his specialty or he wouldn’t have attained such
prominence, and his specialty is the stomach. And what did he tell you? He said
that the stomach normally empties in between three and a half and four and a
half hours, not one to two hours, as Doctor Penistan said.

Now I suggest to you that a man who
specializes in the problems of the stomach is in a very much superior position
to help you as to the emptying time of the stomach, rather than a pathologist
who does not specialize in the stomach or its problems, and I ask you to accept
the evidence of Doctor Brown when he said that the normal emptying time of the
stomach was three and a half to four hours. And he said further, because of
this poorly masticated food, it would require a further hour and it would take
four and a half to five and a half hours for the stomach of this girl to empty.

Now, Doctor Penistan based his estimate
that this food had not been in this stomach more than two hours, on the
assumption that the stomach normally empties between one and two hours. I
suggest to you that if the stomach emptied in one to two hours, that people
would be extremely hungry before the next meal, four or five hours later. I
suggest to you that it is only proper that you accept the expert opinion of
Doctor Brown. If his opinion is accepted, then you must reject the estimate of
the time of death by Doctor Penistan, because it is not based on proper facts.
The time of death may be very important. You heard Doctor Brown also say that
it was the effort to determine the time of death by the progress which had been
made in the digestion of the meal of the stomach was quite unreliable and an
unsatisfactory way of determining the time of death. You heard him say that a
complete examination of the small bowel would be helpful in determining how
much food had passed from the stomach. You heard Doctor Penistan state that the
stomach was distended with one pint of food. Now, we have no information as to
how much food was consumed. I asked Mrs. Harper how much meat was served
to the girl and she didn’t know. Her husband had served it. So none of the
witnesses gave you any information as to how much food had been consumed.
Surely it would take considerably longer to digest a big meal than a small meal.
You heard Doctor Brown say that if a pint of food is consumed, that the stomach
will produce a pint of digestive juices and you then have

[Page 334]

two pints in the stomach, and according to
him the stomach wouldn’t be fully distended—the stomach of this girl wouldn’t
be fully distended unless it contained three or four pints.

And then, again, Doctor Penistan may be in
error in his estimate of the contents of the stomach. You saw the jar. About a
half a pint. A quart sealer, about a quarter of the sealer is filled with the
contents. Now, it may be said that some part of that was used up in tests, but
we know of no tests. The doctor certainly didn’t use any up. I suggest to you
it would be dangerous to assume that the doctor removed more than that quantity
of food from the stomach. And I do, with all sincerity, suggest to you twelve
men, on whose shoulders rests the question of the guilt or non-guilt of this
accused, that it would be highly dangerous, in view of the evidence of Doctor
Brown, to accept the evidence of Doctor Penistan on that point.

Counsel for the Crown dealt with this question
of the time of death as follows:

On Tuesday, June 9th, Lynne Harper, age
twelve, played ball after school, was driven home by her teacher, Miss Blair,
and then had her supper of turkey, peas, etc., finishing at a quarter to six.
You have the evidence of both her parents on that. When her body was found in
the bush, Thursday, June the 11th, Doctor John Penistan, a Provincial
Pathologist with a highly specialized education and training, and years of
experience in determining causes of death and time of death, and all the
particulars can only be arrived at by a doctor trained in a specialist field.

He arrived soon after the body was found
and attended at the scene where it was found in Lawson’s bush. He made a study
of the position of the body, the surroundings, calculated the climatic
conditions that applied. The marks, the terrain, made some observations on what
he noticed about the flattening of vegetation between the legs. Marks, I said.
This blouse about the neck. He was at a great advantage to find it there and
see the body at the scene. And then he had the body removed to a Funeral Home
in Clinton and performed a full post-mortem examination there. From careful study
he gave the opinion that death had taken place where the body was found, in
Lawson’s woods. I do not believe he was cross-examined on that. That was his
stated, clear opinion, that death had taken place in Lawson’s woods. He gave
the cause of death as strangulation by the blouse knotted around the neck. And,
Gentlemen, you will have among the Exhibits you take out to the Jury room, a
picture, Exhibit forty-two, that will show you how that blouse was about the
neck. That picture was taken at the funeral home.

Now, Doctor Penistan, after all these
observations, gave the time of death, which is important. He gave the time of
death as from seven p.m. to 7:45 p.m. on the date of Tuesday, June 9th. That is
an hour and fifteen minutes, two hours after the last meal, and no one has
raised, I suggest, a suggestion or doubt, serious doubt but what she finished
her last meal—consumed her last food at a quarter to six, as described by her
parents.

Now, on what did he base his observation?
On what did he base his opinion? First he had the stomach, which he described
as distended with about a pint of contents. These were put in a jar. The jar
was taken to Toronto, to Mr. Brown. The evidence of Mr. Brown was he
turned the jar and contents over to Mr. Funk of the laboratory. You heard
my explanation, that I had run out of expert witnesses. I did not call
Mr. Funk, but I made him available to the defence. You haven’t heard from
Mr. Funk. I

[Page 335]

only leave to you, Gentlemen, from the
evidence of Doctor Penistan, what went into the jar, the amount that went into
the jar, to draw your reasonable inference.

Now, he observed the limited degree of
digestion or change in these contents. The absence or near absence of anything
in the intestine, the small intestine leading from the stomach. He observed the
extent of decomposition, and he observed the extent of rigor mortis in the
body, and from those three factors he arrived at the opinion he gave you of the
time of death as being from 7:00 p.m. to 7:45 p.m.

Now, what doubt does the defence cast on
that opinion of Doctor Penistan, on the time of death? Obviously the defence
speaks to show you that it was later, that Doctor Penistan was wrong. And on
what do they rely? I might have mentioned, incidentally, that Doctor Brooks was
present during the autopsy and confirmed the observations that he and Doctor
Penistan each made of the stomach contents, the extent of digestion and so on.
But Doctor Brooks, probably, despite his high qualifications in the general
field of medicine, did not give opinions or attempt to do so on the rigor
mortis factor, because he acknowledged that to be the field of Doctor Penistan.

Now in advancing their theory that death
was later. What does the defence put before you? They called Doctor Brown who
never saw the stomach, who never was in the woods, never saw the body, never
saw the quantity of food in the stomach when it was opened, the nature of the
food, never noted the emptiness of the intestines. No chance to know anything
about rigor mortis, the state of the body, its decomposition, but just from
learning, just from learning. He gives a time of three and a half, four hours,
for an average meal. He doesn’t know how much the girl ate. Nobody has any
actual record of that. He gave this estimate of three and a half to four hours
for an average meal to leave—mind you, Gentlemen, to empty out of the stomach.
But this stomach, as described by Doctor Penistan when he removed it and looked
at it, was distended with food. It wasn’t an empty stomach. It was, largely, a
full stomach.

So I suggest, with all respect to Doctor
Brown and his qualifications, that he just hasn’t any basis for giving a
counter estimate on the time of death at all. I don’t know whether, if you
followed through on his opinion, when an average meal leaves a stomach in three
and a half hours, and you found a half empty stomach, whether that means the
food has been there one hour and a half, or one hour and three-quarters, I
don’t know how he would enlarge that. But he simply based everything on an
empty stomach, which wasn’t here. And again, Gentlemen, he didn’t have any of
those other aids, rigor mortis, decomposition and the other things to go on
with at all. So I say, with all respect, there is nothing, absolutely nothing
for Doctor Brown to give you, or Doctor Brown did give you, to interfere with
Doctor Penistan’s opinion.

Now, Doctor Brown was quoted yesterday as
saying that the examination of the stomach, as a means of indicating time of
death, was an unreliable test. I did not so regard his evidence. I suggest to
you, Gentlemen, that what he said was acknowledging it was used, that he said
it was and it has to be used with caution.

Well, you heard Doctor Penistan during his
considerable time in the box, and I suggest from your observations of Doctor
Penistan, his person, manner of giving testimony and his responsible official
position and years of experience, you can safely assume he would be cautious in
a case like this, and everything considered, taking the three bases for his
opinion, that you can take it with safety that this girl was killed, that she
died

[Page 336]

from 7:00 p.m. to 7:45 p.m. on Tuesday,
June 9th. I don’t know whether the doctor—I think they made it clear, but the
stomach ceases to function on death and that is the basis for this test.
Nothing more gets out of the stomach once death takes place.

Now, we come to apply that opinion of time
of death and I suggest to you Gentlemen, it is awfully important when this girl
died. Now, who was with her during this time? What person or persons had the
opportunity to kill her from 7:00 p.m. to 7:45 p.m.? I suggest that a review of
the facts narrows those facts like a vice on Steven Truscott and no one else.

The trial judge dealt with the medical evidence
as to the time of death as follows:

Doctor Penistan said, having regard to the
food that he found in her stomach, and the fact that in his opinion the stomach
empties itself after a meal within two hours, that she had died within two
hours after having her supper.

The evidence was that she had left home at
a quarter to six, that she had finished her supper, I should say, at a quarter
to six in the evening, so Doctor Penistan concluded that she had died before a
quarter to eight.

Later he said:

According to Doctor Penistan, and to the medical
evidence, she died at a time which is not altogether, in any view, inconsistent
with her having finished her dinner at about a quarter to six. Doctor Brown
says, and I must draw it to your attention, that it takes three and a half to
four hours to empty the stomach and it is on the basis of that that the defence
asks you to say that she could not have been killed before Steve returned at
8:00 p.m. You have Doctor Brown’s testimony. It is unfortunate always, that
medical men should disagree on what is more or less a scientific point. Doctor
Brown says three and a half hours to four hours.

Now, the stomach, of course, was not empty;
Doctor Penistan said there was still a pint of food in the stomach and he
removed that pint. It is true there is not a pint of food in the bottle now,
and it is for you Gentlemen to accept or reject Doctor Penistan’s evidence that
he took a pint out, but Doctor Brooks was there and saw the pint. Don’t forget
that the bottle went to the Attorney-General’s Laboratories, for tests and we
don’t know exactly what happened to it there except it was handed to some man
whom we have not seen. It will be for you to say whether you accept Doctor
Penistan’s theory, an Attorney-General’s Pathologist of many years’ standing,
or do you accept Doctor Brown’s evidence.

In his objections after the conclusion of the
judge’s charge, counsel for the defence said:

And, My Lord, it is the theory of the
Defence that Doctor Penistan was in error when he said that the time required
to empty the stomach after a normal meal was one to two hours. You did tell
them that Doctor Brown said that this time was three and a half to four and a
half hours, but it is the theory of the Defence if Doctor Penistan was
incorrect and Doctor Brown was right, then that would throw out Doctor
Penistan’s calculations as to the time of death. With respect, My Lord, I would
submit Doctor Brown’s evidence was dismissed very summarily by Your Lordship.
This is a man of very considerable prominence, and should carry a considerable
amount of weight, My Lord.

[Page 337]

In the course of a re-charge of the jury the
trial judge dealt with this as follows:

I am asked to point out to you that the
theory of the Defence is that Doctor Penistan is in error when he says it only
takes an hour or two hours to empty the stomach and you can accept the evidence
of Doctor Brown, or at least, Doctor Brown’s evidence should raise a doubt in
your mind. You can understand the point is that his theory is that food took
three and a half hours from a quarter to six to leave the stomach, that she
must have died at a time later than the time that Steven was at the river, that
she must have died after Steven came home, and therefore, it couldn’t be Steven
who killed her. That is what the theory of the Defence is. I am not going to go
over all the evidence again.

Dr. Penistan’s evidence in chief as to the
time of death as shown by the quantity and condition of the stomach contents
was as follows:

Q. Yes, that is my next question, Doctor.

A. The stomach, under normal conditions,
proceeds with the digestion of food and as it is digested the stomach empties
through the duodenum into the small intestines. This process is normally
completed within two hours. I have to bear in mind here that the food in the
stomach, as I said, appeared to have been very poorly chewed, appeared to have
been bolted, and swallowed without proper chewing, which would tend to slow
down the digestion and the emptying of the stomach. I think, therefore, that
while—if I found a normal meal, normally chewed, well-chewed meal in the
stomach, digested to the slight extent this food was digested, I would conclude
that it had not been there for more than an hour. I would, however, make some
allowance for the fact of the poor chewing of the food and give as my opinion
that the food had not been in the stomach for more than two hours.

Q. Could it have been for a lesser time?

A. It could certainly, sir have been for a
lesser time.

Q. To what?

A. I would estimate between one and two
hours.

Q. You were in the Courtroom when
Mrs. Harper testified this girl finished her meal at a quarter to six?

A. I was, sir.

Q. On that basis, sir, you would put her
time of death at…

A. As prior to a quarter to eight…

Q. As early as…

A. Probably between seven and a quarter to
eight.

As to fixing the time of death from post-mortem
changes he said in chief:

Q. Apart from the stomach, these contents,
Doctor, is there any other observations that would assist in determining the
cause of death or the time of death?

A. Yes, sir. I referred in my description
of the body to the post-mortem changes which were beginning to occur in the fat
underneath the skin and in the lungs and indeed, in most of the organs of the
body. I refer also to the fact that rigor mortis was still, although

[Page 338]

only just, demonstrable. Having regard to
the environment and the atmospheric conditions about that time, which as I
recollect clearly the weather was hot and the environment was damp, conditions
under which changes tend to take place rather more rapidly than usual, I felt
that these—the state of the body suggested that death had occurred some two
days previously.

Q. I take it, Doctor, that is supplementary
to your stomach observations?

A. That is divorced from the observations
on the stomach. Should I add it was my view that the changes were entirely
compatible with the time of death as shows from the stomach contents and the
other evidence?

In cross-examination, the question of the
accuracy of an estimate made from observing post-mortem changes was dealt with
as follows:

Q. Doctor, you told us about the
post-mortem changes in this body?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And there were many factors that could
contribute to the variation of time that it would take for those changes to
occur, would it not?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And that is not a very accurate way of
estimating the time of death. It would be difficult to tie it down within five
or six hours of those changes, wouldn’t it?

A. Yes, sir.

The cross-examination of Dr. Penistan was
directed to showing the unreliability of an estimate of the time of death based
on an examination of the contents of the stomach. It showed:

i) that the examination of the stomach contents
was visual and by the naked eye;

ii) that there were differences between the
description of the contents as given by Dr. Penistan at the trial and (a)
at the preliminary hearing and (b) as recorded in his notes made at the time of
the autopsy;

iii) that there are many factors which may slow
down or speed up digestive processes;

iv) that unchewed peas, of which there were
many, are not digested in the stomach at all because they are covered by
cellulose;

v) that the doctor made no test of the
hydrochloric acid contained in the stomach contents.

Dr. Brooks described the removal and visual
examination of the stomach contents. He was not asked to give an opinion as to
the time of death.

[Page 339]

Dr. Brown’s evidence may be summarized as
follows:

He said, in chief, the normal emptying time of
the stomach after a mixed meal containing starch, protein and fat would be
three and one-half to four hours; that one hour should be added if the meal was
poorly masticated; that any estimate of time of death from stomach contents
must be made with caution as there are so many factors which can cause great
variations; and that in cases of accidents requiring an emergency operation it
is thought dangerous to operate if the patient has eaten within the past six or
eight hours because he may vomit and cause suffocation.

In cross-examination he said that in the normal
case the stomach would be empty at the end of three and one-half to four hours
and counsel for the Crown stressed that the stomach of the deceased was by no
means empty. Dr. Brown agreed that Dr. Penistan had a better
opportunity of forming an opinion than he himself had because Dr. Penistan
had actually seen the contents of the stomach. He said he had never before been
called into court to testify as to the time of death of a deceased person.

(b) Summary of medical evidence at trial and
on the reference relating to the condition of Truscott’s penis.

At the trial, evidence was given by Doctors
Addison and Brooks, who medically examined Truscott on the night of June 12 at
the R.C.A.F. guardhouse at Clinton. The only other evidence by an actual
observer of his condition was given by Truscott himself on the reference.

The medical examination was conducted in the
presence of Truscott’s father. Dr. Addison, a medical doctor at Clinton,
who had practised for 20 years, described his observations as follows:

The penis, on first examination, appeared
swollen and slightly reddened on the distal end… By stretching the skin,
pulling it upwards towards the body, there were two large raw sores—they were
like a brush burn. They were raw and there was serum oozing from the sores.
They were located just behind the groove on the lateral side of the penis on
either side. Roughly about the size of the ball of my thumb. The diameter,
circumference involved would be roughly that of a quarter—a twenty-five cent
piece—each one.

I have never seen one as sore as that at
any time—of that nature. I have seen one a few months ago that had a cancer of
the penis that looked an awful lot sorer. And I attended one, at one time, a
cow stepped on, that was a lot sorer… It (Truscott’s) was sorer than any I have
ever seen other than those two I have mentioned.

[Page 340]

Dealing with the cause of these injuries he
said:

There would have to be friction in an oval
shaped orifice. An oval shaped knot hole or something like that. Something of
an oval shape and sufficiently rough to cause a friction or wear of the outer
surface of the skin.

He expressed the opinion that these abrasions
could have been caused by a boy of this size and age trying to make entry into
a girl of twelve. Truscott was sexually developed, the same as any man, and
trying to make entry could cause the sores on his penis.

There was no scab on these lesions, there was a
serous discharge.

Dr. Brooks was the senior medical officer
at the R.C.A.F. station at Clinton. He described Truscott as a sexually well
developed adult. He found on each side of the shaft of Truscott’s penis, a
lesion just bigger than a twenty-five cent piece. There was no bleeding. There
was oozing and, by the time of the examination, the oozing was stagnant. He
estimated the duration of the lesions at between 60 and 80 hours before. He
stated that this was the worst lesion of this nature that he had ever seen.
Since he started medical school he had done 20 years of medicine and he
had never seen one as bad as this.

In his opinion the lesions were caused by
pushing the erect organ into a very narrow orifice. They could have resulted
from penetration or attempted penetration of the private parts of a young girl
such as Lynne Harper. There was no injury to the glans of the penis.

Evidence was given at the trial on behalf of the
defence by Dr. Brown, of London, Ontario, who was in the Canadian Army for
five years, and who subsequently did post-graduate work in internal medicine,
with emphasis on diseases of the digestive system.

The facts stated by Doctors Addison and Brooks
were recited to him. He stated he had seen very similar types of lesions. He
said a lesion of the size of a twenty-five cent piece is a large size. He had
seen lesions of at least a ten-cent size.

As to the cause of such a lesion, he said it
would be highly unlikely that penetration would produce a lesion of this sort.
The penis is rarely injured in rape. When injured, it is usually a tearing
injury confined to the head of the penis, which has a larger circumference. When
the hymen is

[Page 341]

ruptured by the head there may be a pulling that
will tear the urinary opening and the fold of skin (frenum) leading from that
opening to the foreskin.

Truscott testified for the first time at the
Reference. He said that the description of the lesions given by Doctors Addison
and Brooks at the trial did not fit the condition that existed on the night the
examination was made. The sores were a lot smaller than they had been
described. There was a sore on each side, well on the way to healing. There was
no oozing whatsoever. They had been in that condition for two weeks.

When he first noticed anything unusual, it was
about six weeks prior to his arrest. There were little blisters. They continued
to worsen until the time he was “picked up”. One blister would break and it
just seemed that more would appear. He did not know what caused them to break.

He did not tell his father about them because he
was embarrassed. The first persons whom he told about the condition as he first
noticed it were his counsel on the Reference when they interviewed him at the
penitentiary. He was then asked by Counsel what it looked like when he first
noticed it.

The condition had never existed before. A
similar condition did develop subsequently on his back and side of the neck.
The condition of his penis cleared up while he was at Guelph. It just seemed to
heal and went away. It did not hurt.

On the Reference, evidence was given relating to
this point by a number of doctors.

Dr. Marcinowsky described an inflamed cyst
of the dorsum of Truscott’s penis, at Guelph, in May 1962.

Dr. Danby, a specialist in dermatology,
practising in Kingston, gave evidence as to his treatments of Truscott for
dermatitis at Kingston on different occasions in respect of his face, shoulders,
upper arms and ears. Dealing with the condition described by Dr. Addison,
he expressed the opinion that if there were an injury which had occurred two or
three days before, there would have been bleeding visible in and around the
lesions.

He disagreed with Dr. Addison’s opinion as
to the possible cause of the lesions, i.e., attempting to have intercourse with
a young girl. He had never, in his experience, seen

[Page 342]

lesions of the kind described attributed to
forceful intercourse. He had never seen lesions on the side of a penis
attributed to force in intercourse. He was not aware of any medical literature,
describing such lesions, attributing them to force in intercourse.

If the condition originated in a number of
blisters, that condition could have resulted in lesions of the kind described,
apart from intercourse. The condition could have begun as a case of herpes
simplex. The area is one where sweating, contact of skin surfaces, secondary
bacterial infection and irritation could combine to produce lesions.

Dr. Wrong, of Toronto, a specialist in
dermatology, was questioned as to his opinion of the view expressed by Dr.
Addison concerning the possible cause of the lesions. He said that such lesions
are seen in many dermatological conditions, not just following injury. They are
seen with many diseases in which blisters appear on the skin.

I would say these lesions are not
diagnostic of any one specific thing and I personally, if I had examined him,
with the descriptions read, would not have been able to say definitely these
could not have been caused by such alone.

He said it is extremely unlikely to have such an
injury caused by intercourse or attempted intercourse, but he would not say it
was impossible. He had not found anything comparable to this in the standard
textbooks.

It would be unusual for simple herpes to affect
two sides of the penis at the same time, but not impossible. Simple herpes of
itself would not produce erosions. Secondary infection could do so, i.e.,
simple herpes plus infection, or irritation from sweating, and the skin
surfaces rubbing together.

Dr. Petty, of Baltimore, is the assistant
medical examiner for the State of Maryland. He had never seen lesions on either
side of the shaft of the penis allegedly as a result of intercourse of any
type. He had never read of penial lesions following intercourse. It was highly
improbable that they could have been caused in that way.

Dr. Camps, of London, professor of forensic
medicine at the University of London, when asked about the opinion of Doctors
Addison and Brooks respecting the cause of the lesions, said:

From a mechanical point of view and from my
experience I don’t think that this is the sort of injury which could occur from
sexual intercourse. It

[Page 343]

is the wrong part of the organ for one
thing. The commonest injury occurring in this type of forced intercourse is a
tear of the prepuce, which mechanically is one place that is vulnerable and
which can be pulled on, or when push and force is exerted it is pulled in that
way.

Asked regarding medical literature on the
subject, he had not found anything indicating a lesion of that sort.

However, so little interest is paid in
textbooks to this type of injury that in many textbooks it is barely mentioned.

Dr. Simpson, of London, head of the
Department of Forensic Medicine at Guy’s Hospital, called by the Crown, gave
the following evidence:

Q. Finally, Dr. Simpson, I think you
have read and you have heard read in this Court the evidence of a
Dr. Addison and a Dr. Brooks relating to penile injuries to the
accused Steven Truscott, and I think, sir, I know you were aware, in addition
to that evidence, the evidence of Mr. Truscott himself relating to these
injuries. Have you any comments regarding those, sir?

A. Yes, sir, when I first read the
description of these I had not seen a picture of them and, of course, I did not
see them, but when I first read a description of them I found them perplexing,
for I would agree with the evidence I heard, they are not the ordinary kind of
injury one sees in forcible or difficult sexual intercourse. But having heard
the evidence of Steven Truscott that he—if I understood it correctly—already
had some condition of soreness on his penis, this seems to me to give a clue to
the rather curious nature of these two patches.

Q. In what way, Dr. Simpson?

A. Well, I think that if Truscott was right
and he had patches there, there are two possibilities. One is that these
patches—I think they were described as quarter size or thereabouts, patches on
each side of the penis, and the other is that these patches were rubbed in some
way which caused them to become more sore or to weep or crust, and I would
regard that as being consistent with the penis being thrust into or being held,
to be pushed into or being held in some way in a sexual gesture as a part of a
sexual assault.

(c) Summary of Medical Evidence given on the
Reference witness by witness

Henry John Funk is
an analyst in the biological field with the Attorney General’s Department. On
June 12, 1959, he received the jar containing the stomach contents. On a visual
examination he described it as being made up of pieces and chunks. Its general
consistency reminded him of a thick stew. His examination was made between June
12 and August 31. He found pineapple, celery, pickled cucumber, cauliflower,
peas, onion, potatoes, and what appeared to be two types of meat. It seemed to
be consistent with ham and some type of fowl. Many of the foods that were

[Page 344]

supposed to have been eaten by Lynne Harper he
found in the mixture. The total volume of the mixture was 250 cubic
centimetres—eight to nine ounces.

Dr. Noble Sharpe. He has been the Medical Director of the Attorney General’s
Department since 1951 and is now about to retire. From 1923 to 1950 he did
hospital pathology. He received the jar from Funk on June 12. For his
examination he removed between 50 and 60 cubic centimetres. He saw undigested
food mixed with some that was partially digested. He recognized certain
vegetables but remembers only peas, some of which had been swallowed without
chewing and were whole. He made no further examination of the recognizable
parts because Mr. Funk was going to make the detailed examination.

The stomach contents were strongly acid. He
concluded that gastric juices had been secreted and it was not just a recently
chewed and swallowed meal. His rough estimate of the time needed to develop
that amount of acid was about one hour. It was quite a good amount. He saw some
muscle fibres, striated muscle fibres, and knew that meat had been eaten but
had no idea what kind of meat. He described the contents as resembling a thick,
lumpy stew. There was little or no fluid in it. Based on the thick consistency
and the fact that the acid was present, he considered that the stomach contents
had not been long enough in the stomach to be suitable for passing out into the
duodenum. It was not in the condition of chyme, at which stage the contents are
ready to pass into the duodenum.

It is known that after an ordinary meal the
contents are ready to leave the stomach at the end of two hours and that they
go out in small amounts, about three cubic centimetres at a time, for the next
two hours so that by the end of the fourth hour after the food has been taken,
the stomach is usually nearly empty. In his opinion the stomach contents had
been in the stomach for one to two hours after eating. He admitted that there
are many conditions that cause variation—likes and dislikes, preparation of the
food, proper cooking, whether or not the food is fatty as fatty food takes
longer to digest, the state of hunger of the person concerned, whether he had
been exercising before eating or taking it easy, emotions, anatomical position
of the stomach, and many others.

[Page 345]

He agreed with what he wrote some time ago in an
article “Rate of Cooling as an Index of Time of Death”. It is as follows:

For a long time I had felt that
pathologists are placed in an awkward position by the emphasis in courts on
estimation of the time of death from the rate of cooling, rigor mortis,
decomposition and stomach contents. These four bases for estimation depend on
variable factors. The pathologist is usually asked by the investigating officer
to give them a rough starting time for investigation or the period in which
particularly to focus. This may get into the report and is later mentioned in
court.

Both prosecution and defence are prone to
emphasize those points which are of benefit to their particular view of the
case. The time based on one or more of these four examinations is at most an
approximation, an inspired or educated guess. It is more likely only a
probability or a hunch. It is of use to the investigator but of much less value
to the court.

Dr. Cedrick Keith Simpson is head of the Department of Forensic Medicine, Guy’s Hospital,
London; Professor of Forensic Medicine, University of London; Lecturer in
Forensic Medicine, University of Oxford; Home Office Consultant since 1935, and
has done work with the Forensic Science Group of Scotland Yard since that date.
The summary of his opinion is contained in the following extract:

A. I would say that, my lord, it appears to
me in this case most creditable that Dr. Penistan paid particular
attention to this matter. In my own experience this is not always so. I would
say that his conclusion, based, as I see it, on the presence in the stomach of
something approaching a pint of relatively dry food, that is to say, without a
measureable quantity of fluid which could be separated from it, from the fact
that it was of a kind and quality which he observed and had confirmed in the
laboratory, from the fact that this whole amount, with the exception of a
little material which had passed on to the small bowel, still lay in the
stomach. I would say that unless he took into consideration some unusual or
extraordinary conditions, that he was right to conclude that it was likely that
death had taken place somewhere up to two hours after eating that meal.

There was a fragment of food in the bronchial
air passage, which is common in asphyxial deaths. The cause of death was
strangulation by a ligature. There was injury to one of the voice box bones,
discoloration of the face and the characteristic asphyxial hemorrhage in the
lungs and thymus gland.

On an examination of the photographs taken at
the scene where the body was found, there was nothing inconsistent with death
having taken place where the girl was found

[Page 346]

and photographed. He agrees with
Dr. Penistan that the twigs on the ground would cause the type of puncture
wound found on the body.

As to lividity, looking at two photographs taken
in the mortuary, he agreed that the chin and left cheek and region over and
above the left eyebrow and the nose showed pallor against the general colour of
the face, the colour he takes to be that described as lividity engorgement. The
discoloration was consequent on strangulation. His explanation was that two
other photographs taken where the body was found show the body turned on its
left side and lying partly on some sheeting or covering. So long as the blood
was fluid when this took place, it would be natural for the pressure to give
these areas just where they appear to have developed. He was asked how long
blood remains fluid in a dead body and he could not give any definite answer.
Sometimes it never appears to clot; sometimes it clots in a short period and
becomes dissolved again. The variations are so vast that no figure can be
given. As to the absence of acid phosphatase on the twigs and dandelion leaves
which were preserved for sampling and taken at the scene of the crime, he said:

A. Well, I have seen many cases of both
sexual intercourse against resistance as shown by injuries and other marks
about the body, and I would say that in some of them one does see seminal fluid
not only in the vagina but at the orifice and extending from it on to the
thighs or down between the crotch, but by no means always, and I would
certainly not regard the absence of spermatozoic fluid on the ground between
the crotch area as giving any evidence that sexual intercourse of some kind did
not take place where the body lay.

As to rigor mortis, one of the witnesses said
that an arched back and the fingers indicated that this was present in the
mortuary. Dr. Penistan had said that rigor mortis had almost passed away.
Dr. Simpson said that he was surprised to hear the witness refer to the
arched back as an indication of the degree of rigor. He said that was the
natural shape of the body and that dead or alive, it would preserve its shape.
He says that one sees that every day. It is a matter of common sense and
personal observation.

As to the suggestion of rigor mortis in the
fingers by Dr. Petty, he said that two of the fingers were being held by
the assistant to hold the hand in a certain position for the taking of
photographs.

[Page 347]

His estimate of the emptying of the stomach and
the time of death as indicated by it is contained in the following extract:

Q. Doctor, if I may turn for a moment, sir,
to a general discussion of the stomach contents—and again in this matter I am making
the assumption and premise that you have heard read the evidence of
Dr. Penistan regarding the stomach content, you have heard the evidence of
Mr. John Funk and you heard the evidence of Dr. Noble Sharpe—based on
that premise, what do you say, doctor, as to setting of a time or approximate
time of death from stomach contents?

A. Well, sir, I would say that based upon
my own experience of those cases in which the time of the last meal is known,
and based upon the relatively few quotations that can be listed from the
textbooks in forensic medicine—I refer to Sidney Smith and Poison, in
particular, and based upon the enormous—I think no other word could be used to
describe it—enormous literature from the physiologists on the emptying process
of the stomach, it would seem to me there is general consensus of view that the
process of emptying is a gradual one which appears to be best described in
terms of a half life, that is to say, during a period of time which seems to be
within thirty minutes and an hour, around about forty-five minutes, perhaps,
the stomach half empties itself, and then in a similar period half empties
itself again, and again, and again. So that it is described as a half life. I
would say that if these observations are correct—and there is an overwhelmingly
large literature in support of this—that one might have expected, as Sidney
Smith and Poison and my own experience, of course, one might have expected the
bulk of the meal to have left the stomach inside two hours. This seems to me a
generalization which experience and experiment support.

Q. Based on what you have read from the
original trial transcript and what you have heard in this Court, what
conclusion and opinion would you have come to in this matter?

A. As I say, I think—certainly earlier in
my evidence, sir—I think that based on the amount of food in the stomach as
compared with the little, the very little, I think it was described, that had
started to pass into the small bowel, based on its character and the relatively
little indeed which appears to be an unmeasurable quantity of food which was
present, that this girl’s death must, if the stomach be taken as an indication
of it—and I think it is the one useful indication in this case—must have taken
place within two hours of her taking that meal.

Q. Doctor, are there, as has been described
in this Court, variables that do in fact affect the digestion, such as emotion?

A. Yes, sir, I think that if that view is
looked at more critically, I think one has to be prepared if there is some
evidence to qualify it in some way. If there is some evidence about outside
conditions that—such as emergency, for instance—that may affect the stomach,
then one must be prepared to qualify it, but in the absence of such evidence I
would say that Dr. Penistan was quite right to give as an indication and
estimation a period which is about usual, about normal, which would be likely,
and the last thing I would

[Page 348]

say, sir, about that, is that there are of
course upper and lower limits to this. Some stomachs, some stomach contents
empty a little earlier and some a little later.

Q. Doctor, I just have two further
questions, one dealing, sir, with the evidence that was given in this Court
relating, Dr. Simpson, to changes in the decomposition of this body, and
very generally, and paraphrasing again, they were referred to as swelling,
bloating and lack of venous patterning and other decomposition changes. What
value, if any, sir, based on your experience, do you attach to decomposition
changes such as I have just mentioned to you?

A. I would say, sir, that those words,
described as stated decomposition which is becoming well marked, and they did
not appear to be present in this case, that the earliest of changes is
commonly, usually, I think, a discolouration in the flanks of the body or in
the veins rising up out of the trunk, and this is likely to be seen from about
forty-eight hours, but it varies according to temperature.

Q. Were you surprised to read and to hear
and not to find here swelling and bloating and a venous pattern?

A. No, sir, no, these I would not expect to
be likely to become evident until about the second to third, to fourth day, or
later on, that depending on the outside conditions.

Q. There was also a reference very briefly
to the lack of greenish discolouration in the flanks of the body. What is your
comment, if any, sir, regarding that?

A. Well, sir, this is the earliest of the
signs. As I say, it would be likely to appear somewhere about the second day,
the forty-eighth hour, but it need not be present. Indeed it need not appear at
all.

Dr. Milton Helpern has been Chief Medical Examiner for the City of New York since 1954
and is visiting Professor of Pathology, Cornell University; Professor and
Chairman of the Department of Forensic Medicine, New York University School of
Medicine. Cause of death was strangulation. The food of microscopic size in the
bronchials was one incident in the process of dying by strangulation. The place
of death was where the body was found. He disagreed with Dr. Petty that
twigs would not cause the puncture wounds. He agreed with Dr. Simpson that
apparent blanching and whitening shown in the photographs to which he referred
was attributable to the body having been turned on its side and that the only
valid evidence on this subject was to be found in a photograph of the body
before it was disturbed or turned and which showed no blanching. He disagreed
with Dr. Petty that there was any evidence of rigor mortis in the arched
back or the fingers.

His opinion as to stomach contents is contained
in the following extract:

Q. Now, based on your experience that goes
back many years, sir, based on those, the factors developed and shown by that
testi-

[Page 349]

mony, what if any opinion would you have as
to how long that stomach content had been in that particular stomach of this
young girl?

A. In my opinion, from the amount of food
in the stomach and from the fact that this was a healthy body, the body of a
healthy young girl, and from the fact that death was rapid, I think it is
reasonable to conclude that the time it took this person to die was rather
short, and from all these factors I would conclude that this food had been
ingested no more than two hours after—that is, that death had occurred, I’m
sorry, gentlemen—that death had occurred no more than two hours after the food
was ingested. I think that is the rule in these cases.

Q. That is from your experience in these
matters, sir?

A. Yes, I have been particularly interested
in recent years in the emptying time of the stomach, and we have had enough
cases in which we could find a large amount of recently ingested food, that is,
easily recognizable food in large amounts and in which we were able to
determine the time the food was ingested, and in those cases the food was ingested
less than two hours prior to death.

I might explain, in discussing this I don’t
want to be—to appear to be just arbitrary about this thing. There are
conditions which do slow up the emptying of the stomach, and the most common
condition that does this is coma. In other words, this opinion could not be
common in a man who was knocked down by an automobile and then died as a result
of brain injury, having lain in a coma for several days. I have seen food in
the stomach in cases like that which has been in the stomach for over a week,
but in a person who is healthy, who dies suddenly or rapidly, I would say that
this amount of food and the condition it was in is indicative of a time of
death, about two hours or within two hours of the ingestion of the food. Now,
this is the rule.

Dr. Samuel Robert Gerber has been the Coroner, since 1937, of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, which
includes the City of Cleveland.

Without going into his evidence in detail, he
agreed with Dr. Simpson and Dr. Helpern as to the cause of death, the
place of death and the cause of the signs of blanching.

He agreed with the others and Dr. Penistan
that the arched back and the fingers were no indication of rigor mortis.

His opinion was that the food had been in the
stomach less than two hours after ingestion.

Dr. Charles Sutherland Petty is now Assistant Medical Examiner for the State of Maryland. He was
Chief Resident in Pathology at various hospitals from 1952 to 1955 and a
Teaching Fellow at Harvard Medical School in the Department of Pathology from
1952 to 1955; Instructor

[Page 350]

and Assistant Professor of Pathology, Louisiana
State School of Medicine 1955 to 1958; Associate Professor of Forensic
Pathology, University of the State of Maryland and Associate in Public Health
Administration, Johns Hopkins University.

Dr. Penistan’s report was put before him
and he was asked for his conclusion as to the time of death. His opinion was
that the time of death could only be stated within very broad limits. These
broad limits are stated to be:

A. These broad limits lie anywhere between
several minutes to several hours; thirty minutes to perhaps eight hours. The
missing factors here: Dr. Penistan mentioned the bolting of the food or
the rapidity evidently with which the food was eaten. The fact it had not been
well chewed is a factor which caused him to advance the time from one hour to
perhaps two hours after eating, the interval between eating and death. But I do
not see that he has taken into consideration any of the many other factors
which might change the emptying time of the stomach or change the amount of
food that one would see in the stomach at the time of the autopsy.

Q. What are, in a general way—Would you
describe the factors which must be—which cause a variation in the rate of
digestion and the rate of the emptying of the stomach?

A. Well, there are many. We do not know,
for example, whether this girl was taking drugs; we do not know whether this
individual, in fact was emotionally disturbed; we do not know whether there was
loss of the stomach contents significantly, that is, into the duodenum or,
indeed, further into the small and large intestine; and, as a matter of fact,
we do not know how much, if any, of the food was lost through either opening
into the stomach. There are two, the top opening from the esophagus and the
bottom opening into the duodenum. We do not know even, for example, whether or
not there was loss of food through the esophagus either during the act of dying
or after the death occurred.

On a consideration of Dr. Brooks’ evidence
given at the trial as to the contents of the stomach, he repeated his opinion
that the estimate would vary from minutes to hours.

The evidence of Mr. Funk, the analyst, and
Dr. Noble Sharpe was then put before him and he was asked to assume the
correctness of the description of the contents given by these witnesses. His
answer was:

Q. Now, again assuming the correctness of
the description of the contents given by Mr. Funk and Dr. Sharpe,
does that affect the opinion that you have expressed?

A. No, sir, it does not, because we do not
know what factors were present between the time the meal was eaten and the time
that death occurred.

[Page 351]

Again returning to Dr. Penistan’s evidence
as between one and two hours, or prior to a quarter to eight, and probably
between seven and a quarter to eight, his answer was:

Q. The question I want to now ask you, what
is your opinion as to whether the time of death can be put within such narrow
limits, based on the stomach contents and the state to which digestion had
proceeded, assuming the evidence of Dr. Penistan as to his observations is
correct, and assuming the evidence of Mr. Funk and Dr. Sharpe, as to
their observations, is correct?

A. Based on the appearance of the stomach
contents, the amount of the stomach contents, the degree to which the stomach
contents had apparently been digested, I would find myself completely unable to
pinpoint any time, a figure such as seven o’clock to seven forty-five, or a
quarter to seven to a quarter to eight.

On being questioned about Dr. Penistan’s
finding that very little had passed through the duodenum into the small
intestine, he replied:

Q. Just taking the information as you have
it, the facts I have given to you by themselves, if you were in possession of
those facts and that description, what would be the limits either way in which
you would place the time of death?

A. Again, sir, several minutes, 20, 30, 40
minutes, perhaps five days, possibly as long as eight hours.

(NOTE: It says five days in the record. We assume
that the witness must have intended to say five hours.)

He then went on to deal with rigor mortis and
what is sometimes called post-mortem lividity or hypostasis. He found evidence
of rigor mortis from the arched back and the position of the fingers and the
position of the leg on the mortuary table “provided the leg has not been placed
there deliberately or accidentally”.

His conclusion was that the onset of rigor
mortis is rapid in a warm environment (and the weather was very warm on June 9,
June 10 and June 11). He also says that rigor mortis disappears more rapidly in
a warm environment and his conclusion was that this body had been where it was
found “perhaps less time than has been indicated in some of the evidence I have
read”. His conclusion was that death occurred later than 7:45 p.m. on June 9.

From the photographs and the rigor mortis
alone I would be unable to say precisely when death occurred but that from this
amount of rigor mortis I would be inclined to put it on the light side of two
days. The light side or the short side of two days, rather than forty-eight
hours.

[Page 352]

He noted the absence of bloating and venous
patterning and skin slippage. He would expect to see this sort of thing in a
body dead forty-eight hours in the temperatures which were given in evidence.

Then, by way of summary:

Q. Then, Doctor, I now, having taken you
over Dr. Penistan’s evidence with respect to the stomach contents and his
evidence with respect to the existence of rigor, his evidence with respect to
the beginnings of putrefaction and having referred you to the photographs of
the—Taking the total picture into consideration, the amount of fluid, the
evidence of post-mortem changes as described and shown in the pictures, can you
come to any opinion as to the time of death?

A. Well, the best opinion I can come to on
the time of death is this: It is my opinion that the body has been dead in the
neighbourhood of thirty, thirty-six hours, possibly forty hours and I am taking
my time now from the autopsy time, not from the time of sighting of the body;
but I cannot narrow the limits to less, perhaps, than twelve hours. I clearly
have the impression from examination of these photographs, and with particular
reference to those things that I have pointed out already to this Court, that
the body has been dead not an inconsiderable time short of forty-eight hours;
but, I cannot pinpoint that in time, less perhaps. A range perhaps of less
perhaps than eight or ten or twelve hours.

Q. In your opinion is it possible for
anyone, on the basis of the facts that have been disclosed with relation to the
stomach contents, post-mortem changes, to place that period of death within the
narrow limits of 7:00 p.m. and 7:45 p.m. on June the 9th?

A. Of course not. Not unless we know
precisely what happened between the time that the child was last seen and the
time when death occurred; and, of course, if we knew that we would know the
time of death.

The time of the autopsy was approximately 48
hours after the girl was last seen.

He next went on to deal with the place of death.
Dr. Penistan’s report as to what he found when he arrived at the scene was
put to him in detail. First, he did not think that the puncture wounds had been
caused by twigs. He referred to the puncture wound under the left shoulder, a
scratch mark on the front of the left thigh extending over the left kneecap and
down to the top of the left foot, and small “interruptions” of the skin’s
surface on the buttock. He thought the scratch marks on the leg indicated a
dragging of the body in a limp condition. He disagreed with any theory of the
causation of the marks by twigs. He thought the twigs would be pressed down and
would not penetrate. He demonstrated by the use of fountain pens scattered on
the desk before him.

[Page 353]

He would have expected some spots of semen, acid
phosphates to be present at the crotch or very close to it or on the leaves or
twigs or whatever was immediately beneath that point of the body.

As to the presence of vegetable matter in the
bronchi, he thought it was in a microscopic amount. He called it a remarkable
finding in view of the presence of the ligature about the neck. All the other
experts thought it was a normal incident of death by strangulation.

Q. What inference did you draw or what is
your conclusion from the presence of vegetable matter in the bronchi?

A. I call this a very remarkable finding in
view of the presence of a ligature about the neck. The blouse or the ligature
about the neck would certainly compress the neck organs and would certainly
tend to cause the esophagus, or the tube leading from the mouth down to the
stomach, to be collapsed; and I would find it difficult to explain how this
food material, this vegetable material found its way into the lung passages
that have not a route to go out of the stomach, through the esophagus, to be
aspirated and drawn into the air tubes themselves. I think it is quite
remarkable in view of the ligature or restricting band about the neck.

Q. What would that indicate to you about
the time the vegetable matter got into the bronchi?

A. Inhalation of apparently vomited stomach
contents is not an unusual thing during death. I would, therefore, believe this
occured during the act of dying, possibly slightly before, during the act of
attack, whatever that may have been; and, therefore, I believe this related to
the death, if that is an answer to your question, sir.

Q. Are you able to form any opinion as to
whether aspiration of the vegetable matter into the bronchi occurred before or
after the application of the ligature?

A. As I have already indicated, I think
that this occurred before the application of the ligature.

He next examined the photographic exhibits at
some length leading up to the conclusion that the body was on its left side
shortly after death. It is expressed in the following extract:

Q. What in your opinion caused that?

A. I believe this body laid on its left
side for a period of time after death and was moved at a later time.

Q. And why do you reach that conclusion?

A. Because of the pattern of the wrinkles
present and the depression on the outer aspect of the left upper arm and the
blanch or relatively white areas involved in the left breast and probably also
the left side of the face. I believe this is the pattern of a post‑mortem
lividity which develops shortly after death when the body was on that side so
that the blood drained down into that side, that the hypostasis became, as
forensic pathologists put it,

[Page 354]

fixed or partially fixed so that when the
body was again placed on its back that the markings of its previous position
were left and did not vanish because all of the blood had been drained out of
that area into what was now the bottom and down side of the body. So, in this
photograph, if taken in conjunction with the other photograph which we have
seen, it is my opinion that the body was first on its left side and then was
turned at a later time and put on its back in the position in which it was
found.

Q. And what would cause—You say, for
instance, on the left breast there is an area that is whiter?

A. Yes.

Q. What would create the whitening or
lighter colour?

A. This is where the breast itself was
pressing against whatever the body was lying on and prevented the blood from
flowing into that area.

Q. How soon after death would the body have
to lie in that position to develop this pattern?

A. This is not subjected as rigor mortis
and stomach contents to any specific or definitive answers. The blood begins to
settle in the body immediately following death. The point really is at what
point was the body moved after death. If the body remained on its left side for
a period of time after death until some of the blood was fixed, that is, there
was some clotting, perhaps, of the small blood vessels, possibly some passage
of red blood cells out into the surrounding tissue, then the point at which
this occurred to a significant degree, but the main majority of the blood was
still fluid so that when the body was shifted again now onto its back the
ordinary hypostasis pattern developed. I could not say precisely, but I would
say possibly the inner limit of an hour, an hour and a half, the inner limit of
several hours. I do not know, four, six hours, somewhere within this period of
time.

Q. How long would the body have to lie in
that position?

A. I would say the body would probably have
to lie there for a period of certainly an hour or two, in this region.

As to the lesions on the penis, he said that he
had never seen lesions on either side of the shaft of the penis allegedly as a
result of intercourse of any type. Nor did he know of any reference to this
possibility in the literature. He thought it highly improbable that these
lesions would be caused by intercourse.

Dr. Frederick Albert Jaffe is presently lecturing in Pathology at the University of Toronto and
is an Assistant Pathologist, Toronto Western Hospital. He has been a Regional
Pathologist for the Province of Ontario since 1951. He is soon to assume the
duty of Medical Director of the Forensic Section in succession to
Dr. Noble Sharpe.

He considered that the stomach contents and the
state to which digestion has proceeded after the last known meal a most
unreliable guide as to the time of death. He had read

[Page 355]

the evidence of Dr. Penistan as to the
stomach contents; also that of Dr. Brooks, and heard the evidence of
Dr. Sharpe and Mr. Funk. On the assumption that the girl started her
dinner at 5.30 p.m. and finished at 5.45 p.m., he would not place the time of
death within the period 7.00 to 7.45 o’clock with any reasonable degree of
certainty.

His opinion of the time of death, as indicated
by the post-mortem changes, is contained in the following extract:

Q. Now, dealing—passing from the stomach
contents to the post-mortem changes which were observed, again assuming you
heard read the evidence of Dr. Penistan as to the post-mortem changes he
observed, that is, the very slight rigor that was present, the infestation of
the body by maggots, and assuming the correctness of all Dr. Penistan’s
observations and also his statement that autolysis was present but the body had
not yet begun to putrefy or had not reached a stage of putrefaction, do those
facts enable you to form an opinion as to when death occurred?

A. Only within very wide limits. I believe
on the basis of Dr. Penistan’s description and the photographs which I was
able to see, that death has occurred no less than twenty-four hours before the
discovery of the body.

Q. Could you go any farther than that?

A. To me the really outstanding feature of
the body, both basing my view upon the autopsy protocol and Dr. Petty’s
description of the photographs, is the absence of those changes of
decomposition which one would expect to find in a body which had allegedly lain
two days in an environment which was certainly very hot and humid. This to me
is one of the outstanding characteristics of this body. I would place the time
perhaps half way between twenty-four and forty-eight hours.

He agreed with Dr. Petty as to the cause of
the blanching.

Dr. Francis Edward Camps is a lecturer in Forensic Medicine at the London Hospital Medical
College, Royal Free Hospital Medical College and the Middlesex Hospital Medical
School and a professor of Forensic Medicine at the University of London.

His opinion of the significance of the contents
of the stomach is contained in the following extracts:

Q. First of all, Dr. Camps, what is
your opinion as to whether the contents of the stomach and the state to which
digestion has proceeded in relation to the last known meal consumed by the
deceased, is a reliable guide to the time of death?

A. It is so variable that this generally
has been described as being of no value in assessing the time of death within a
limited period. That is to say, what you can say is, first of all, that the
contents indicate the nature of the last meal that the person has had. In other
words, it enables you to say they have had nothing else to eat since the last
meal. And, secondly, that death has occurred

[Page 356]

within a number of hours. It is possible,
by taking other matters into consideration, to place perhaps within that number
of hours a distance in one or other direction; but other than that, it is quite
impossible.

* *
*

Q. Assuming the correctness of the
observations of Dr. Penistan and Dr. Brooks and Dr. Sharpe and
Mr. Funk, what is your opinion as to whether on this—on that basis you
could, with any reasonable degree of certainty, state that the time of death of
the deceased was between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 7:45 p.m., having regard
the fact that she finished her last known meal at 5:45?

A. I would say it is quite impossible and,
in fact, I would say it could be dangerously misleading to the investigating
officers.

As to rigor mortis, he disagrees with
Dr. Penistan’s finding in the following extract:

Q. Does the evidence with respect to the
existence of rigor mortis and its extent enable you to express any opinion with
respect to the time when death occurred?

A. No. I think, once again, there is so
much variation in rigor mortis that, at the best of times, you cannot express
an answer except within a reasonably broad limit. In this particular case I
think it was a pity that the examination for rigor mortis was not done at 1:45
but waited until 7:15. But, on the basis of the appearance of the body, of the
fact that the appearance is, to some extent, and I can say no more than that,
present again only at the scene of the crime but also on the autopsy table, I
think one must assume that rigor mortis was pretty established still, certainly
a little earlier in the evening.

On this point he is in direct conflict with
Doctors Penistan, Simpson, Helpern and Gerber. As to post-mortem changes, his
opinion is expressed in the following extract:

Q. You have also heard the evidence read of
Dr. Penistan with respect to the other post mortem changes—that is, the
presence of autolysis, the infestation of certain parts of the body by maggots,
and assuming again the correctness of those observations, does that enable you
to determine the time of death?

A. No. I would like to make it quite clear,
if I may, I am in no way criticizing Dr. Penistan’s observations. The only
thing here is, first of all, that the autolysis I find supremely surprising for
forty-eight hours, to be so little in the temperature and under these
conditions.

In the temperatures established during the
48-hour period, he would have expected to find more post-mortem changes than
were found on this body. The implication of this is contained in the following
extract:

Q. Does he not refer to autolysis in
paragraph 4?

A. Yes, that is right. Yes, I would repeat
what I said, that the temperature, even putting it at its lowest, for
forty-eight hours I

[Page 357]

would expect to find more post mortem
changes than were found in this body. The implication of that, had I been
there, would have been, having found the stomach contents in the condition
which could be to indicate death at the end of one hour or up to nine or ten
hours, would make me put my time of the death closer to the ten than to the
one. That is the only observation I can make. I find, also, it is very
remarkable from this point of view that there is no green discolouration of the
abdomen on the right side, which we normally reckon to appear somewhere
about forty-eight hours. So that would also tend to put it back.

He explained the blanching in the same way as
Dr. Petty, i.e., that the body had lain on its side. He thought an hour
might be reasonable. It might have been much less than that.

He expressed some doubt whether the puncture
marks described by Dr. Penistan would have been caused by twigs. He
thought they would more likely cause scratch marks, not a straight hole. He
thought that some sort of sharp thing that might have caused the scratch mark
down the leg might have caused the puncture marks.

Because of the absence of acid phosphatase, he
expressed the opinion that where the body was found was not the place where the
rape occurred. He thought that if it had occurred here, there would have been
more injury on the back.

As to the injury to Truscott’s penis, he did not
think it was the kind of injury that could occur from sexual intercourse. The
commonest injury is a tear of the prepuce. “However, so little interest is paid
in textbooks to this type of injury that in many textbooks it is barely
mentioned.”

Another body of medical evidence had to do with
dermatology.

Dr. Emilian Marcinkovsky is a physician at the Ontario Reformatory at Guelph. On March 3,
1961, he treated Truscott for an infected burn of the right internal ear. He
treated him with compresses and Chloromycetin. He found that Truscott was
sensitive to this drug and he was kept in hospital. On June 28, 1961, there was
further treatment.

On December 27, 1962, Truscott was suffering
from dermatitis in the armpits. The doctor thought it was the result of
chemicals, the detergent in the washing. He called it contact dermatitis.

[Page 358]

On May 15, 1962, he treated him for an inflamed
cyst of the dorsum of the penis. On May 24, he marked the medical card “Cyst
now not inflamed. Excision will be indicated if frequently inflamed.”

Dr. Norman McKinnon Wrong. He graduated in 1927 from the University of Toronto and has been on
the teaching staff since 1932. From 1954 to 1962 he was Associate Professor of
Medicine in charge of Dermatology at the University of Toronto. His opinion on
the cause of the lesions on the penis is:

Q. What is your opinion as to whether the
lesions—the lesions as described, could be caused in that way?

A. The lesions described, or what we call
erosions of the skin, such erosions are seen in many dermatological conditions,
not just following injury, superficial injury of the skin, and we see them with
many diseases in which blisters appear on the skin, so that I would say these
lesions are not diagnostic of any one specific thing, and I personally, if I had
examined him, with the descriptions read, would not have been able to say
definitely these could not have been caused by such alone.

Q. Have you any opinion as to the
likelihood of an injury such as that being able to be caused by intercourse or
attempted intercourse?

A. I would think it rather unlikely or
extremely unlikely. I would not say impossible, but I would say extremely
unlikely that a lesion on the side of the shaft of the penis would be caused by
intercourse.

Q. Are you familiar with any medical
literature attributing lesions of that kind on the sides of the penis to trauma
or injury involved in or received during forcible or violent intercourse?

A. I have not gone over the medical
literature exhaustively, but I have not found anything comparable to this in
the standard textbooks.

He also was of the opinion that it was most
unlikely that the abrasion on the right labia of the deceased about the size of
a finger-nail, was caused by a penis. He thought that the condition of the
penis described by Dr. Brooks and Dr. Addison indicated simple
herpes.

As to the precise conditions observed by
Dr. Addison and Dr. Brooks, he explained them as follows:

A. I think simple herpes plus infection or
plus irritation from sweating and the skin surfaces rubbing together. I don’t
think that simple herpes in itself usually produces erosion, but secondary
infection could very well produce these erosions.

He had never seen any lesions on the shaft of
the penis which had been attributable to forcible intercourse or trau-

[Page 359]

ma. He had seen injury about the meatus and
around the frenum, but never traumatic lesions on the shaft of the penis as a
result of intercourse.

Dr, Charles William Elliott Dauby is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Queen’s University, and the
Consultant in Dermatology for the three federal penitentiaries at Kingston,
Collins Bay and Joyceville.

He treated Steven Truscott on January 30, 1964,
for infected dermatitis of the left side of his face extending from the level
of his eyelid down to below the mouth, with an oozing, scaling and crusty
condition. His opinion was that this was secondarily infected dermatitis due to
some agent that had irritated his skin. Truscott told him that it had been
present for a year. The doctor saw him on five subsequent occasions, the last
time being April 24. There was good improvement up to March 1st. Then, on April
15th, he had a patchy nummular type of eczema involving the back part of his
shoulders, upper arms and his face and ears. On his last visit, April 24, he
had improved.

Counsel then put to him the description of
Truscott’s condition that was given by Dr. Addison and Dr. Brooks at
the trial.

Q. This was the view expressed by
Dr. Addison, a brush burn of two or three days’ duration, was his
description. But that is part of the description. Assuming the size, the
description of the raw sore, oozing, having the appearance of a brush burn of
two or three days’ duration; from that description would you be able to reach
any conclusion as to the nature and cause of these injuries?

A. I would think that in the area where
these lesions have been described, if it were an injury that had occurred three
days before, or two days before, there would have been haemorrhage or bleeding
visible in and around these lesions. Now, one must remember that in this area
the skin is very thin. I would think a good comparison would be the thickness
of the skin of your eyelid. If we remember that the skin is made up of two
parts, the epidermis and dermis. For convenience, the epidermis is the outer
layer of the skin, below which there are blood vessels ready to bleed and is
not thicker than six one hundredths of a millimetre. It is tissue paper thin. I
would think that if this had been due to injury there would have been haemorrhage.

Q. Would you be able to give any
information as to the extent or the degree of the bleeding or haemorrhaging
that would occur from injury of that kind?

A. I have in the past, and I still do
occasionally, perform an operation called dermo‑abrasion of the skin in
which we abrade the skin in order to improve the appearance of scars. Now, we
do not have to abrade it very deeply to get copious bleeding.

[Page 360]

He went on to say that he did not think that
these lesions could have happened by the penetration or attempted penetration
of the organ into the private parts of a young girl. He had seen six or seven
cases of a tearing of the praeputium. He was not aware of any medical
literature on this subject.

Next, he dealt with the injury to the labium
majus. This was testified to by Dr. Penistan and Dr. Brooks. He
thought it very unlikely, if not impossible, that this could occur from an
attempted penetration.

He thought that the condition described by
Dr. Brooks and Dr. Addison was herpes simplex (cold sores).

There was, in addition, evidence given by
psychiatrists called by the Crown and the Defence. We do not consider that this
evidence assists us in coming to our conclusion.

Conclusions

After all the evidence given on the Reference,
the issues are still the same as those which faced the jury—who raped and
killed this girl. The evidence both as to fact and opinion has to be considered
as a whole. We begin with Truscott’s oral evidence on the Reference. It differs
from the evidence given by all those witnesses who saw him on the road before 7
p.m. and described his movements. These movements give an impression of aimless
loitering of no particular significance to him. This may account for his
failure to remember whom he had met and who had seen him. On the other hand,
although as a boy of 14½ years, he had heard all these witnesses give evidence
at the trial. The evidence had some connection with that of Jocelyne Goddette
and to the jury could have indicated that he was waiting for someone and that
the person for whom he was waiting was Jocelyne Goddette, who by her subsequent
actions indicated that she was looking for him and did not find him.

The evidence of the time of departure from the
school grounds is of decisive importance in this case. According to Mrs. Nickerson
and Mrs. Bohonus, it was not later than 7.15 p.m. and Truscott had
appeared about 7 p.m. On the Reference Truscott for the first time gave his
time of departure as within a minute of 7.30 p.m. By 7.30 Richard Gellatly and
even Philip Burns on foot were back at home.

[Page 361]

But Truscott had told the police that he did
remember meeting Gellatly. Gellatly remembered meeting Truscott and he was not
cross-examined. One of the certainties in this case is that this meeting did
happen. We find it impossible to accept Truscott’s evidence given before us
that he and the girl left at 7.30 p.m. and that they did not meet Gellatly.

Further, Jocelyne Goddette, according to
Mr. Lawson’s evidence, left Lawson’s barn at 7.25 p.m. If Truscott’s time
is taken, she would have been on the road ahead of him. So would Arnold George,
for she and George were on the road near the bush at approximately the same
time. Jocelyne Goddette and Arnold George could not have failed to see Truscott
and the girl if they had left the school grounds at 7.30 p.m. The case for the
prosecution, as put to the jury, was that Truscott and Lynne were ahead of
Jocelyne Goddette and Arnold George and were not seen after passing Gellatly.

Our conclusion is that Truscott’s evidence on
the Reference does not and cannot disturb the finding implicit in the jury’s
verdict, that after passing Gellatly, Truscott and Lynne went into Lawson’s
bush.

It is also implicit in the jury’s verdict that
the girl died where she was found in Lawson’s bush and that she was not picked
up at the intersection and subsequently brought back dead or alive by
someone other than Truscott. We do not think that this conclusion could be
disturbed by anything to be found in the evidence given at the trial or on this
Reference.

We have described the conditions found by
Dr. Penistan when he went to the scene. Dr. Petty and Dr. Camps
said that they would have expected to find spermatozoic fluid at the crotch or
in the blood at the crotch or on the leaves and twigs in the immediate area of
the crotch if intercourse had taken place where the body was found.
Dr. Simpson said that he “would certainly not regard the absence of
spermatozoic fluid on the ground between the crotch area as giving any evidence
that sexual intercourse of some kind did not take place where the body lay”.
Dr. Penistan said that the intercourse took place “while the child was
dying, when the heart had stopped or had almost stopped beating”. His reason
for this conclusion was that although the

[Page 362]

injuries to the parts were severe, the bleeding
from them was extremely small.

Dr. Petty developed a theory based upon an
examination of the photographs that the body must have lain on its left side
for an hour or two following death. We have quoted at length from his evidence
and that of others on this subject. He found signs of blanching on the left
side of the face, the left breast and the left arm from certain photographs
taken after the body had been moved both at the scene and after transportation
to the mortuary. These signs are not apparent from the photograph of the body
lying on its back, taken at the scene before the body was turned on its side.
Dr. Simpson, Dr. Helpern and Dr. Gerber all said that if the
photographs did indicate some blanching, the simple explanation was to be found
in the movement of the body at the scene and afterwards. The descriptions given
by Dr. Penistan and Dr. Brooks of the condition of the body at the
autopsy were inconsistent with the existence of any blanched areas on the face
capable of demonstrating hypostasis. They were the only ones who saw the body.
The others were testifying from their observation of photographs.

Dr. Penistan said that the face was dusky
in colour as far down as the ligature and that this dusky colour was caused by
strangulation and not by post mortem changes. This colouring was absent from
the rest of the body except perhaps for the arm, where some post mortem
lividity had occurred. He pointed out that this was a dependent part whereas
the front of the face was not. The colour of the face was due to the fact that
the blood could not escape past the ligature and not due to hypostasis, that
is, a condition caused by settling of blood in the dependent parts of an organ.

Our conclusion on the evidence relating to blanching
is that whatever traces suggesting this condition were observable from the
photographs are to be attributed to the movement of the body in the bush,
movement to the mortuary and movement in the mortuary. This evidence does not
disturb our conclusion that the place of death was where the body was found.

On the subject of rigor mortis, we think that
the man who actually saw the condition had an overwhelming ad-

[Page 363]

vantage over those who were testifying from
photographs. He says that the condition had almost passed off. Yet
Dr. Petty testified to rigor mortis from what others described as the
natural arching of the back and a natural position of the fingers which were
being held by the assistant in order that a photograph could be taken. We are
of the opinion that Dr. Penistan’s evidence on rigor mortis must be
accepted and that defence evidence on this subject tending to put the time of
death at a later hour must be rejected.

On the question of the contents of the stomach
and the state of digestion as indicating the time of death, there was diversity
of opinion. Doctors Sharpe, Simpson, Helpern and Gerber supported
Dr. Penistan’s opinion that death occurred prior to 7.45 p.m.
Dr. Petty, Dr. Jaffe and Dr. Camps rejected any possibility of
such precise definition. We have already set out their opinions in detail
earlier in these reasons. There is no need of repetition. We do, however, wish
to explain that with each medical expert we chose the opinion which he
expressed in his own words in examination-in-chief. We think it is better done
this way because we could not see that on cross-examination any expert
retracted or seriously modified what he said in chief.

We think that the evidence indicates that this
was the same meal that the girl had finished eating at 5.45 p.m. We know the
time of the meal. This was a normal healthy girl of 12 years and 9 months who
had eaten a normal meal. There is no evidence of any complicating factor apart
from an expression of annoyance because she could not go swimming.

Dr. Petty spoke of factors which might
change the emptying rate of the stomach—drugs (which seems to be out of the
question in this case), loss into the duodenum, loss through the esophagus
during the act of dying or after death occurred. We have the definite evidence
of Dr. Penistan on loss into the duodenum. He says there was very little.
It is difficult to think of loss through the esophagus when one considers how
this girl died. There were microscopic particles of food in the bronchii, a
common occurrence in death by strangulation.

Again we say that this opinion evidence must be
related to all the other evidence. We have the known facts of the

[Page 364]

meal, the time when she finished, that she was
in the school grounds engaged in normal activity after the meal and before she
started down the road. We have the time when she started down the road and it
was not later than 7.15 p.m., not 7.30 as Truscott said. She was found 42 hours
later in a bush off the road at 1.45 p.m. on Thursday, June 11, 1959. The
jury’s verdict must have rejected Dr. Brown’s time of three or four hours
after the meal because it contained no possibility of accuracy in relation to
this case if they came to the conclusion that Truscott did not take the girl to
the intersection.

We are faced with the same problem. No new
issues were raised before us but there was a great volume of new evidence. The
weight of the new evidence supports Dr. Penistan’s opinion. But the
decisive point in this case is still the one put to the jury by the trial judge
and decided against the accused.

The Court heard 467 pages of new oral evidence
on this Reference. According to firmly established rules, none of this would
have been admissible had these proceedings been by way of appeal. But in view
of the terms of the Order of Reference the Court decided to hear everything and
did hear everything that the parties thought relevant.

Another aspect of the medical evidence related
to the condition of Truscott’s penis. Truscott, in his evidence before us,
introduced an explanation of the condition of his penis, as described by
Dr. Addison and Dr. Brooks following their examination on Friday
evening, June 12, 1959, three days after the girl’s disappearance. They
saw the condition and described it in detail. Their opinion was that it was
consistent with forcible intercourse with a girl of the age of Lynne Harper.
Truscott’s father was present when this examination was made. Truscott and his
counsel were present in court when the evidence of the two doctors was given. There
is no indication in any of the evidence that was before the jury that these
injuries were the result of a pre-existing condition. On the reference,
Truscott said that there was a pre-existing condition which started about six
weeks before he was picked up. This is his evidence:

A. It was about six weeks before I was
picked up. And it started off, what appeared to be little blisters, and
continued to worsen from there until it was in the state it was when I was
picked up.

[Page 365]

Q. What caused it to worsen? How did its
appearance change?

A. Well, one blister would break and it
just seemed that more would appear.

Q. Do you know what caused them to break?

A. No, I don’t.

Q. Now, when you first noticed this
condition that you described did you tell your father about it?

A. No, I didn’t.

Q. Was there any reason why you didn’t.

A. I was too embarrassed.

Q. Do you recall the first person to whom
you described this condition when you first noticed it?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Who was it?

A. It was yourself and Mr. Jolliffe.

Q. Myself and Mr. Jolliffe. And where
did you describe that to us?

A. Collin’s Bay penitentiary.

We find it impossible to accept Truscott’s
statement that he had never described the condition of his penis, as it existed
prior to June 9, 1959, to anyone before he described it at the penitentiary to
his counsel on the Reference. It may be that, on his first discovering the
condition he was too embarrassed to tell his father about it. But when the
condition existing on June 12 was discovered by Dr. Addison and
Dr. Brooks on their medical examination of him, in the presence of his
father, and when those two doctors described the condition which they found at
the trial, and drew inferences from it, it is incredible that no disclosure was
made by him to his father and to his then counsel as to the condition which he
says had existed for six weeks before he was picked up.

If the condition which Truscott described did
exist for some time prior to June 9, we have the evidence of Dr. Simpson
that the patches could have been rubbed, causing them to be more sore, and that
this is consistent with a sexual assault. Dr. Danby and Dr. Wrong,
the two expert dermatologists called by the defence on the Reference, who
testified on this matter, both recognized the possible impact of irritation in
activating the condition described by Truscott.

Our conclusion is that there was a pre-existing
condition and that it was disclosed by him prior to his trial, although no
evidence about it was given before the jury. The serious condition found and
described by Dr. Addison and Dr.

[Page 366]

Brooks was consistent with the aggravation of a
pre-existing condition resulting from a sexual assault upon Lynne Harper.

When the case went to the jury, they had before
them the evidence given at the trial which we have summarized above. It was all
circumstantial. Their verdict read in the light of the charge of the trial
judge makes it clear that they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
the facts, which they found to be established by the evidence which they
accepted, were not only consistent with the guilt of the accused but were
inconsistent with any rational conclusion other than that he was the guilty
person. On a review of all the evidence given at the trial we are of opinion that,
on the record as it then stood, the verdict could not be set aside on the
ground that it was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence.
Indeed, it being implicit in their verdict that the jury completely rejected
the evidence of those witnesses who said that they had seen Truscott pass over
the bridge with Lynne Harper, and Truscott’s statements as to having seen Lynne
Harper enter a motor car, we are of opinion that the verdict was in accordance
with the evidence.

We are also of opinion that the judgment at
trial could not have been set aside on the ground of any wrong decision on a
question of law or on the ground that there was a miscarriage of justice. It
follows that, in our opinion, the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] dismissing the appeal made to it was right.

On this Reference we heard the additional
evidence summarized above. It disclosed differences of opinion amongst the
expert medical witnesses who testified. As has already been pointed out, none
of this fresh evidence would have been allowed if the case had come before us
on an appeal in the ordinary way under s. 597A  of the Criminal Code . Because
of the terms of the Order-in-Council referring the matter to us, we decided to
receive this evidence and it becomes our duty to weigh it with a view to
determining whether it causes us to doubt the correctness of the judgment at
the trial. We have come to the conclusion that it does not.

[Page 367]

There were many incredibilities inherent in the
evidence given by Truscott before us and we do not believe his testimony. The
effect of the sum total of the testimony of the expert witnesses is, in our
opinion, to add strength to the opinion expressed by Dr. Penistan at the
trial that the murdered girl was dead by 7.45 p.m. We have dealt above with the
evidence which we heard as to what observation of a car at the junction of
Highway No. 8 and the county road could be made from the bridge 1,300 feet to
the south.

We have already stated our conclusion that the
verdict of the jury reached on the record at the trial ought not to be
disturbed. The effect of the fresh evidence which we heard on the Reference,
considered in its entirety, is to strengthen that view.

We turn now to certain legal objections taken by
counsel for the defence on the Reference. He argued that the learned trial
judge should have declared a mistrial because Crown counsel, in his opening
address to the jury on September 16, said in part:

I might say then that in sequence that on
Friday night—I should say the Friday a statement was taken from the accused by
Inspector Graham and the other Police, one of the other Policemen, signed that
night by him…

At this point he was stopped by the trial judge.

The Court of Appeal for Ontario rejected this
submission on the ground that in his opening address read as a whole Crown
counsel had made it clear to the jury that the statements made by Truscott to
the police which he intended to introduce were not in the nature of
“confessions at all or anything like that”.

In our opinion there is another ground on which
the submission should be rejected. In the discussion had in the absence of the
jury after the learned trial judge had stopped Crown counsel from making any
further reference to the statement he made it plain that if the statement, when
tendered, was ruled inadmissible he would be prepared to declare a mistrial. On
the afternoon of September 18, the statement was ruled inadmissible but counsel
for the accused did not then or at any subsequent point in the trial ask that a
mistrial be declared. We think it clear that defence counsel elected to proceed
with the trial and that the verdict cannot be impugned on this ground.

[Page 368]

Defence counsel also submitted that the trial
judge erred in permitting Jocelyne Goddette and Arnold George to be sworn. The
determination of this question depends on the interpretation to be placed on
s. 16  of the Canada Evidence Act  which was considered in this Court
by Anglin C.J.C., in Sankey v. The King[3],
where he said:

Now it is quite as much the duty of the
presiding judge to ascertain by appropriate methods whether or not a child
offered as a witness does, or does not, understand the nature of an oath, as it
is to satisfy himself of the intelligence of such child and his appreciation of
the duty of speaking the truth. On both points alike he is required by the
statute to form an opinion; as to both he is entrusted with discretion, to be
exercised judicially and upon reasonable grounds. The term “child of tender
years” is not defined. Of no ordinary child over seven years of age can it be
safely predicted, from his mere appearance, that he does not understand the
nature of an oath. Such a child may be convicted of crime. Crim. Code, section 17-18.
A very brief inquiry may suffice to satisfy the judge on this point. But some
inquiry would seem to be indispensable.

We are of opinion that the learned trial judge
properly exercised the discretion entrusted to him and that there were
reasonable grounds for his concluding that both Jocelyne Goddette and Arnold
George understood the moral obligation of telling the truth.

The reasons of our brother Hall indicate that he
would have ordered a new trial on a number of grounds. Since we feel obliged to
differ from the opinion he has expressed, we think it necessary to state our
view on each of the grounds dealt with in his reasons.

1. Truscott’s admonition to Jocelyne Goddette
to keep the appointment secret.

The judge’s ruling on this point was favourable
to Truscott. He limited the effect which the jury could give to Jocelyne
Goddette’s evidence on the appointment to an explanation of why she was on the
road looking for Truscott.

We think the evidence had a wider relevancy.
According to many witnesses, Truscott was moving about the road between 6.30
and 7 p.m. The suggested inference from this is that he was looking for
Jocelyne Goddette. Then he turned up at the school grounds at 7 p.m. and talked
to

[Page 369]

Lynne Harper. His explanation of the
conversation was that she was looking for a ride to the intersection.

It is said that this was uncontradicted. It
could not be otherwise with an unheard conversation between two persons, one of
whom was dead at the time of the trial.

The conversation between Truscott and the girl
is open to another interpretation. It took place only a few minutes after
Truscott had been on the road looking for Jocelyne Goddette according to the
Crown’s submission. It was open to the Crown to put it to the jury that he was
taking Lynne Harper when Jocelyne Goddette failed to appear, and taking her on
the same errand.

The admonition to Jocelyne Goddette to keep the
matter secret is no more a reflection on Truscott’s character than the
invitation itself. It is part and parcel of the same conversation and one part
cannot be separated from the other. The jury was entitled to know what the
whole conversation was and the witness when testifying to such a conversation
should not be compelled to stop at a certain point. This was early in the
trial. The girl’s credibility was involved. No one knew at this stage whether
Truscott would give evidence at the trial. If she had only been permitted to
tell one part of the conversation, it is impossible to tell how counsel for the
defence would have used that.

We do not think that any of this conversation
between Truscott and Jocelyne Goddette was any reflection on Truscott’s
character. To put it at its worst for Truscott, it means no more than this:
that he had a tentative date arranged with Jocelyne Goddette. He wanted a date
with a girl that night and he took Lynne Harper when Jocelyne Goddette was not
available. We have already mentioned that this has some bearing on the
submission of the prosecution that his story of the ride, the sole purpose of
which was to take her to the intersection, may not have been true. It does not
amount to trying to prove bad character or a disposition to murder and rape.

Counsel at the trial was satisfied with this
instruction given by the trial judge. He had no reason to object and

[Page 370]

there is no ground for saying that on this point
there should be a new trial. Counsel on the reference did not take this
objection.

Maxwell v. The Director of Public
Prosecutions[4] is no authority for the rejection of
the evidence in question here. In that case, a person was charged with manslaughter
as a result of the performance of an abortion. He gave evidence of his good
character. He was cross‑examined about a previous trial for manslaughter
involving another alleged abortion. He had been acquitted at that trial. The
cross-examination was held to be bad on two grounds—as not being relevant to
the issue before the jury and because it did not tend to impair the credibility
of the accused as a witness.

2. The bicycle tracks.

This has to do with the bicycle tire marks which
were found in the field north of Lawson’s bush. Corporal Erskine gave evidence
about these tire marks which he had photographed. Defence counsel did object to
the admissibility of the evidence from the photographs. The tire marks were
similar to the marks that would be made by Truscott’s bicycle.

Defence counsel emphasized that these tire marks
were of little or no significance in the case. He dealt with the matter in the
following extract:

Then there was evidence about marks along
the roadway at the north side of the bush, and Exhibits twelve, thirteen and
fourteen were taken by Corporal Erskine and filed here. These exhibits showed
the dried mud along the north edge of the bush in this little laneway or
driveway. Now, these were taken, according to the note on the back, on the 13th
of June. We heard the evidence of the Sergeant from the R.C.A.F. Station as to
the rainfall. In June there had been a trace of rain on the 1st. No rain from
then until either the 10th or the 11th, when it was .24 or .27 inches, about a
quarter of an inch .24, I think he said. He said if it was .25, it would be a
quarter. However, it makes no difference because it was after the 9th of June,
which is the important date. But we had no rain in June prior to the 9th,
except a trace, and you heard Sergeant Calvert say a few drops or a little
sprinkle you would walk out in without putting a coat on.

Now I suggest to you that it is quite clear
from all these pictures that these tracks were made when the mud was soft. You
can see where the mud squeezed up between the little irregularities in the
tire. It must have been soft to make that mark. It couldn’t possibly happen if
this dirt was in the hard-packed condition that we find it in these conditions.
That dirt must have been baked hard long before the 9th of June. We have the

[Page 371]

temperatures in the eighties, high
temperatures, hot weather. My friend may say to you that May was a rainy month.
You heard Sergeant Calvert go over the rainfall for the last sixteen days of
May, and 25 or 2, so and so of rain. Very light rain. The total
rain in sixteen days, something over three inches. Many of you men are farmers.
You know the effect of these pictures much better than I do. You can use your
own good judgment as to how long it took for that land to become parched like
that, how many days before the pictures were taken the last rainfall had
occurred and these tracks made there.

Immediately afterwards he pointed out that the
evidence showed that Truscott had been along the tractor trail at least three
times, the last one of which was about a week before the 9th of June. He and
his friend were building a tree fort in the bush. Crown counsel dealt with that
in the following way:

The bicycle marks, Gentlemen, I am not
going to linger over. Corporal Erskine’s evidence that he found tire marks,
combinations of the two wheels, but they are in as Exhibits. You will have them
with you. That he made comparison and that he found those marks in the laneway
and you will remember the distance down. I, frankly, don’t. That they compare.
That they are a combination. Now, it is true there could be similar tires,
certainly, but where you get radically different tires—you look at them and you
will find them in combination, it would seem to be fairly strong evidence that
that bicycle was down there.

But gentlemen, as I said about a
circumstantial evidence case, that is the beauty—there is nothing beautiful
about this at all—but that is one of the strong facts about it. You have a pile
of facts and if there is one or two that are not conclusive you still, you
still have the conclusive proof of the facts that are there.

A defence witness was called to say that
Steven and he had a tree house or fort or something, and that Steven was in
with his bicycle. I wouldn’t waste your time by arguing that isn’t a
possibility, but I just put this forward for what it may seem to be worth for
you, that that is more evidence that Steven was down that lane with that
bicycle. By no means conclusive it was that night he was down. The Defence went
to great efforts to counteract those marks.

That soil—or that weather expert, Calvert,
Sergeant Calvert, about the dryness. Now we all know this about farms, if you
get an area near a bush and there are lots of trees in that lane, and that area
will stay a longer time damp. Other things might be quite dry, adjacent
portions, even if you don’t get any rain. There was plenty of rain in May and
none in June, but there could be dampness, I suggest to you what is elementary,
enough to make those marks, but that is only one of the great stack of facts
that are amassing for your assistance.

The trial judge dealt with them as follows:

Nothing belonging to the accused boy was
found in the locality, in the neighbourhood of the body, as you will recall.
There was a tire mark in the field about seventeen feet north of the fence that
ran along this lane, and Constable Erskine, who testified, said that the marks
of the tire were similar, I think that is as high as he put it, were similar to
the tires

[Page 372]

that were put in evidence of the bicycle
belonging to the accused boy, and you are asked to find that those marks were
made by this bicycle. That is what the Crown asks you to find. The bicycle is
not a common one.

If the trial judge’s remarks are taken in
conjunction with the address of Crown counsel and the defence, there could be
no doubt here that the issues were squarely before the jury, and defence
counsel did not see fit to object to the charge on this point.

We cannot agree that it was conclusively shown
that the tire marks must have been made many days preceding June 9th, nor that
the learned trial judge should have directed the jury in the light of the
evidence of the meteorologist Calvert to exclude from their consideration the
evidence relating to the tire marks. It was for the jury to weigh the evidence
of the tire marks in the light of the evidence given as to the weather
conditions. We do not think that anyone took this evidence as a salient feature
of the case. The salient feature of the case is Truscott’s disappearance from
the road after the meeting with Gellatly.

3. The locket

This was worn by Lynne Harper on the evening of
June 9th. It was not found on her body but hanging on the wire fence that ran
along the west side of Lawson’s bush. The inference is open that whoever
murdered Lynne Harper removed the locket from her neck. To do so he had to
unclasp it. It was found unclasped and suspended on the wire fence. Truscott
had described the locket in some detail. The evidence was properly admissible
and the question was one of weight for the jury.

The matter of the locket and its significance to
the jury was raised in the address to the jury of counsel for the defence. His
suggestion to the jury was that the place where the locket was found was the
place where the girl was taken into the bush either alive or dead. This
suggestion is contained in the following extract from his address:

Now the evidence would indicate that if
Lynne Harper were dragged in there, through that wire fence, that she was
dragged in at a point on the County Road about three hundred feet south of the
north edge of the bush. And the reason for saying that is this, that that is
the point where Corporal Sayeau says the locket was found.

Now, we have this locket. Do you remember a
locket was put in as an Exhibit? A locket and chain, and that the chain was
delivered to Mrs.

[Page 373]

Archibald by Sandra. You remember the
little girl, Sandra Archibald. When Sandra gave the locket to her mother, the
mother said the chain was open, and Sandra told you how she found the locket
and chain suspended partly over one wire. Part of it may have been on the
ground and part of it was suspended over the wire on the fence, with the chain
on the outside and the locket on the inside, or vice versa. Probably you will
remember that better than I do. But that appears to be where—the point where
this girl was brought, or her body entered that area. Now, I suggest if
Truscott took Miss Harper in at that point, somebody would have seen it. The
fence there was in much better condition than the fence on the north side. It
is most unlikely that he would drag the bicycle in. If he had dragged it in
there would be, in all likelihood, some mark on the bicycle.

The Crown was entitled to answer this
proposition and we do not regard that answer as theorizing “without one iota of
evidence”, “inflammatory” or a “fanciful theory”.

4. Car bearing Licence No. 981-666

When Truscott was asked by the police what he
had seen on the road when he took Lynne Harper to the intersection as he
said, he mentioned Richard Gellatly and he also said that he had seen on the
road an old model Dodge or Plymouth car bearing licence No. 981-666 but that
the first three digits may have been in a different order. He also said that
there was a man and a woman in this car. There was such a car with licence No.
891-666 belonging to a Mr. Pigun, who was then stationed at Clinton. A
number of people, including Mr. Pigun, who owned cars with licences
bearing some resemblance to the number given, were called to testify and all
said that they were not on the county road on the evening of June 9th. Hall J.
is of opinion that the Crown was not entitled to call these witnesses because
this was a collateral matter and Truscott could not be contradicted on it.

In our view, this was not a collateral matter.
It was strictly relevant to the fact in issue—whether Truscott was on the road
when he said he was. In effect, he said that from leaving the school grounds
with Lynne Harper and until his return, that he was never off the road and that
he saw a car bearing a certain licence number. The owners of all these possible
cars say that they were not on the road.

The inference that the jury was asked to draw in
part from this evidence and from all the other evidence is that Truscott did not
see and could not have seen the car that

[Page 374]

he described; that if he had actually been on
the road all the time he would not have made such a statement because he would
have known better and that, in consequence, he was not where he said he was at
the material time. Facts relevant to this issue are not collateral facts.

5. The Judges’ Instruction

It will be for you to say whether you
accept Doctor Penistan’s theory, an Attorney-General’s Pathologist of many
years’ standing, or do you accept Doctor Brown’s evidence.

The criticism made is that the extract above
quoted was a misdirection and that the jury should have been told that as
between Dr. Penistan and Dr. Brown, if the evidence of Dr. Brown
left a reasonable doubt in their minds as to the time of death, they must
acquit. We disagree with this proposition. The choice was not simply between
Dr. Brown and Dr. Penistan. That evidence had to be considered in
relation to the whole of the evidence, and a reading of the trial judge’s instructions
in full to the jury makes it plain that that is what they were told to do.

These are the instructions that he gave to the
jury, in summary, at the very end of his charge:

Now, Gentlemen, in order to arrive at a
verdict in this case—before I mention that, I wish to say to you this. You will
have to ask yourselves, about each branch of the evidence. Is it consistent
with the boy’s guilt? And is it inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion? But you just can’t separate one piece of evidence from the other from
the rest of the evidence. You will have to ask yourselves on the whole evidence
which you accept, on the whole evidence that you accept, is this evidence
susceptible of any other conclusion than that this boy is the killer of Lynne
Harper? But if you think any other rational conclusion possible on this
evidence, you will acquit him, and if the evidence raises a doubt in your mind,
you will acquit him. When I say raises a doubt in your mind, I mean a
reasonable doubt. Not a foolish doubt or a doubt because you are hesitant about
doing your duty, and I am sure I need not say to a Jury of the County of Huron
that I know you will accept your responsibilities in this matter, come what
may, and that you will bring in a verdict according to your conscience. It must
not be a doubt that is raised by fear, prejudice or caprice, but an honest
doubt of a Juryman endeavouring to do his duty.

In order to bring in a verdict you must all
agree upon it. If you do not agree you cannot bring in a verdict—you disagree.
There is no obligation on any of you to agree. If, after you have discussed it
fully, and considered it dispassionately among yourselves, you should disagree
with your fellows, it is your duty to express your disagreement. Do not forget
what I said about the onus of proof. The onus of proof is entirely on the
Crown. It never shifts. There is no obligation whatever or any duty

[Page 375]

on the prisoner to prove his innocence. It
is for the Crown to prove his guilt and the Crown must prove that guilt beyond
a reasonable doubt. You must feel sure about it.

Now, Gentlemen, as I see this case you may
bring in a verdict of course, of not guilty. The jury is always able to do that
if the Crown has not proved its case or you have even a reasonable doubt about
it. You may bring in a verdict of not guilty or you may bring in a verdict of
guilty as charged. There is no other verdict open to you in this case on this
evidence.

6. Dr. Brooks should not have been
permitted to give his opinion that the sores on Truscott’s penis and the
condition of the body at the scene indicated a very inexpert attempt at
penetration.

Dr. Brooks graduated in medicine in England
in 1943. He was registered to practise in England in 1946. He is a member of
the College of General Practitioners in Canada. He was the Senior Medical
Officer at the R.C.A.F. Station at Clinton, Ontario.

He saw these penial lesions. He had an opinion
as to their cause. He thought they were about three days old. He also had an
opinion about the injuries to the girl which he had seen in the bush and in the
mortuary.

We are of the view that a general practitioner
with this experience is entitled to give his opinion to the jury as to the
cause of the conditions that he found, whether it is a physical cause or any
other cause. This kind of evidence is not limited to specialists. Regina v.
Kuzmack[5] does
not state any such rule.

In Regina v. Kuzmack, the accused was
convicted of murder. It was alleged that he had stabbed a woman and severed her
jugular vein. His defence was that the death was an accident. He said that the
woman attacked him with a butcher knife and that she was killed accidentally
when he was trying to take the knife away from her. The woman also had cuts on
the fingers of the right hand. The doctor who testified as to the cause of
death also said that when the right hand was put up to the neck, the wounds on
the fingers were in the same direction as the wound on the neck. His conclusion
was that the hand was on the neck when the knife was put into the neck. His
conclusion was rejected by the Appellate Division as “a mere guess which

[Page 376]

anyone might have made”. Whether or not this was
a correct ruling in the particular case is of no concern now. But the ruling is
not authority for rejecting the opinion of a general practitioner as to the
cause of lesions which he had personally observed and described.

7. Admissibility of the underpants as
evidence.

These were the garments that Truscott was
wearing at the time of his arrest and were taken from him then. They were very
dirty and showed traces of blood and male sperm. It was open to the jury to
infer that these were the underpants that Truscott was wearing on June 9 and to
decide whether the traces of blood and male sperm had any significance in the
case. The trial judge cannot withdraw consideration of such evidence from the
jury.

8. Extracts from the instructions given to
the jury in relation to the evidence of Philip Burns.

It is said that the trial judge gave
contradictory instructions regarding the evidence of Philip Burns, and the
following extracts are cited in support of this conclusion:

Now the first is that Philip Burns was, of
course, not sworn, and he said he didn’t see Lynne and Steve on the road as he
went north, and no one corroborates him in that respect, so that his evidence
is worthless so far as you can use it in convicting the accused boy.

* *
*

Then you, of course, won’t forget Philip
Burns’ evidence that he left the river around between seven to seven-ten or
thereabouts, seven-fifteen, and walked up the road and saw nothing of Steve and
Lynne as he went up the road. That evidence was given, as I told you before,
without Philip Burns being sworn.

We do not interpret the first extract, when read
in context, as being a direction to the jury that Burns’ evidence was
worthless. The jury had been recalled as a result of objections raised by
counsel to the charge, and in the first sentence of that extract the trial
judge is only stating what that objection was, and not his own ruling upon it.
This is made clear by the next three following sentences:

But you could hardly corroborate a
statement that I didn’t see somebody. You may corroborate that he wasn’t on the
road, and I expect that is what Philip meant, that Steve and Lynne weren’t on
the road as he passed along it.

[Page 377]

Now, of course, he met Jocelyne and he met
Arnold George as he went along that road, and they were sworn, and they said
that they didn’t see Lynne or Steve on that highway, so in that respect their
evidence is capable of corroborating Philip’s.

In our opinion this instruction was correct.

9. Direction regarding the evidence of
Douglas Oats and Gordon Logan.

The learned trial judge dealt with the effect of
the evidence of these two boys in the following passage from his charge:

Now then, it is the theory of the Defence,
and they brought evidence to show that, as I say, this little Douglas Oats saw
them going across the bridge and then, in a few minutes, according to the boy
by the name of Gordon Logan—Gordon Logan also says he saw them going north on
the bridge and in about five minutes he says he saw Steven return alone. Well,
as regards Gordon Logan, it will be for you Gentlemen to say whether you
believe his evidence, and it is very important, Gentlemen, because if you
believe the Defence theory of this matter and believe Steven’s statement to the
Police and to other people, that the girl was driven to Number Eight Highway
and entered an automobile which went east; it is my view that you must acquit
the boy if you believe that story.

In other words, I will put it this way. In
order to convict this boy, you have to completely reject that story as having
no truth in it, as not being true. You have to completely reject that story.

In our opinion this was a clear-cut, positive
direction to the jury as to the impact of the evidence of Oats and Logan, if
accepted by the jury, and there is a positive direction to acquit if Truscott’s
story, supported as it was by that evidence, were believed. The jury is not
directed that they could only acquit if they believed that story, but that, if
they believed it, they must acquit. The continuing onus upon the Crown to prove
its case beyond reasonable doubt, and the absence of any obligation upon the
accused to prove his innocence was clearly stated on more than one occasion, as
shown in the extract from the charge previously quoted.

What this particular passage does, and quite
properly does, is to make clear to the jury the vital importance of the
evidence of Oats and Logan, and to stress that they could not convict Truscott
unless his account of what happened was completely rejected as having no truth
in it.

[Page 378]

10. Reference as to the possibility of
Truscott having returned with Lynne Harper from No. 8 Highway.

In charging the jury the trial judge had two
undisputed facts from which to start. First, that Truscott had ridden Lynne
Harper on his bicycle north on the county road toward No. 8 Highway. Second,
that her raped and dead body was found in Lawson’s bush, and that, in
consequence of that, someone had brought her there, alive or dead. The Crown’s
case was that Truscott had taken her there, and that he had never taken her to
No. 8 Highway. The case for the defence was that Truscott had left her at that
highway, and had returned alone, she having been picked up in a car at the
highway, and that some unknown person had brought her back to Lawson’s bush.
The trial judge apparently felt obligated to discuss all possibilities and
suggested the possibility of her having been brought back from No. 8 Highway by
Truscott.

In our opinion this was unnecessary, but when he
finally dealt with the matter, in answer to a request by the jury for further
direction of evidence, corroborated or otherwise, of Lynne Harper and Steven
Truscott having been seen together on the bridge on the night of June 9, he
made it abundantly clear that there was no witness who said that he had
returned to the bridge with her, and that there were two witnesses, Allan Oats
and Logan, who said he was on the bridge alone.

We cannot agree that the effect of the judge’s
direction on this point withdrew from the jury the most vital issue in
Truscott’s case. It was quite clear from the charge that the jury could not
convict Truscott if they accepted Logan’s evidence.

11. Reference to Truscott’s “calmness and
apathy”.

In his charge the trial judge put the question
“You will ask yourselves and you will ask yourselves the reason if this boy is
guilty, why he has shown such calmness and apathy.”

Counsel for the defence had urged that
Truscott’s demeanour and attitude, when he returned to the school yard and was
seen there by a number of children, was completely

[Page 379]

inconsistent with guilt, and in putting this
question to the jury the trial judge sought to raise this issue in their minds.

What he meant is clearly illustrated in his
original charge, when he said “It is pointed out by the Defence, and very
properly so, and it is something you must consider, and that is his demeanour
when he returned, that he seemed to be natural.”

He then cited the evidence of three children who
had seen him at the school yard, who described his appearance as “normal”.

From time to time in the course of these reasons
we have mentioned the fact that defence counsel took no objection to certain
rulings made by the trial judge, certain evidence that was introduced to which
objection is now taken and certain comments of the trial judge and Crown
counsel made in the course of the proceedings. It should be clearly understood
that it is not suggested that the failure of defence counsel to object to the
admissibility of evidence or to any part of the trial judge’s charge or to any
comments by the judge or counsel in the course of the proceedings constitutes
an answer to any valid objections now made to the conduct of the trial. The
failure of defence counsel to make such objections is only mentioned in these
reasons for the purpose of indicating that counsel who acted on Truscott’s
behalf do not appear to have attached any importance or validity to the
objections in question.

Answer to the question submitted on the
Reference

For all of the foregoing reasons our answer to
the question submitted is that had an appeal by Steven Murray Truscott been
made to the Supreme Court of Canada, as is now permitted by section 597A 
of the Criminal Code  of Canada, on the existing record and the further
evidence this Court would have dismissed such an appeal.

[Page 380]



[Page 381]



[Page 382]

HALL J. (dissenting):—Steven Murray
Truscott, then age 14½ years, was tried before the Honourable Mr. Justice
Ferguson and a jury at Goderich in September 1959 on an indictment as follows:

The Jurors for Our Lady The Queen present
that Steven Murray Truscott on or about the 9th day of June, 1959, at the
Township of Tuckersmith, in the County of Huron, did unlawfully murder Lynne
Harper, contrary to The Criminal Code  of Canada.

On the 30th day of September 1959 the jury
returned a verdict of guilty with a recommendation for mercy. An appeal to the
Court of Appeal for Ontario[6] by
Steven Murray Truscott against his conviction was dismissed on the 21st day of
January 1960. By Order-in-Council P.C., 1960-87, dated the 21st day of January
1960, the sentence of death passed upon Steven Murray Truscott upon his
conviction on the indictment aforesaid was commuted to a term of life
imprisonment in the Kingston Penitentiary. Application for leave to appeal to
this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario was refused on
the 24th day of February 1960.

Section 597A  of the Criminal Code  was
enacted in 1961, providing as follows:

597A. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Act, a person

(a) who has been sentenced to
death and whose conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal, or

(b) who is acquitted of an
offence punishable by death and whose acquittal is set aside by the court of
appeal,

may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
on any ground of law or fact or mixed law and fact. 1960-61, c. 44, s. 11.

By Order-in-Council P.C. 1966-760, dated the
26th day of April 1966, pursuant to s. 55 of the Supreme Court Act, His
Excellency The Governor General referred to the Supreme Court of Canada for
hearing and consideration the following question:

Had an Appeal by Steven Murray Truscott
been made to the Supreme Court of Canada, as is now permitted by section 597A 
of the Criminal Code  of Canada, what disposition would the Court have made of
such an Appeal on a consideration of the existing Record and such further
evidence as the Court, in its discretion, may receive and consider?

[Page 383]

When the application was made in February 1960
for leave to appeal to this Court from the Court of Appeal of Ontario,
s. 597A had not yet been enacted. The application so made was under
s. 597(1) (6) which provided that an appeal lay by leave to the Supreme Court
on a question of law alone. The application then made was restricted to the
following grounds:

1. Was there any evidence of such a
character that the inference of guilt of the Appellant might, and could,
legally and properly be drawn therefrom by the jury?

2. Was the Appellant deprived of a trial
according to law by the remarks made by Crown Counsel in his opening to the
jury?

3. Did the learned trial Judge err in
allowing the Crown witnesses, Jocelyne Goddette, Anold George, and Tom Gillette
to be sworn?

4. Did the learned trial Judge err in
failing to properly define corroboration for the jury?

5. Did the learned trial Judge err in
instructing the jury that certain unsworn witnesses were in fact corroborated?

6. Did the learned trial Judge err in his
charge to the jury in regard to the doctrine of reasonable doubt?

On the reference in this Court, the substantial
grounds upon which the trial and conviction were challenged were materially
different from the foregoing although there were included some elements of the
same grounds, but essentially this is a completely new procedure and the Court
must now deal with law and fact and with questions of mixed law and fact. Much
new evidence was heard in these proceedings under the authority of the
Order-in-Council and the accused himself testified for the first time. He
maintained his innocence as he had done since his conviction in 1959.

Having considered the case fully, I believe that
the conviction should be quashed and a new trial directed. I take the view that
the trial was not conducted according to law. Even the guiltiest criminal must
be tried according to law. That does not mean that I consider Truscott guilty
or innocent. The determination of guilt or innocence was a matter for the jury
and for the jury alone as its dominant function following a trial conducted
according to law.

The case against Truscott was predominantly but
not exclusively one of circumstantial evidence. I recognize fully

[Page 384]

that guilt can be brought home to an accused by
circumstantial evidence; that there are cases where the circumstances can be
said to point inexorably to guilt more reliably than direct evidence; that
direct evidence is subject to the everyday hazards of imperfect recognition or
of imperfect memory or both. The circumstantial evidence case is built piece by
piece until the final evidentiary structure completely entraps the prisoner in
a situation from which he cannot escape. There may be missing from that
structure a piece here and there and certain imperfections may be discernible,
but the entrapping mesh taken as a whole must be continuous and consistent. The
law does not require that the guilt of an accused be established to a
demonstration but is satisfied when the evidence presented to the jury points
conclusively to the accused as the perpetrator of the crime and excludes any
reasonable hypothesis of innocence. The rules of evidence apply with equal
force to proof by circumstantial evidence as to proof by direct evidence. The
evidence in both instances must be equally credible, admissible and relevant

Applying the foregoing to the trial under
review, I find that there were grave errors in the trial brought about
principally by Crown Counsel’s method in trying to establish guilt and by the
learned Trial Judge’s failure to appreciate that the course being followed by
the Crown would necessarily involve the jury being led away from an objective
appraisal of the evidence for and against the prisoner. The Crown approached
the prosecution on the theory or hypothesis that young Truscott had planned to
take Jocelyne Goddette into Lawson’s bush to have some improper relations with
her and when she failed to show he was so intent on taking some girl to
Lawson’s bush that evening that when Lynne Harper came to him in the school yard
he seized upon this accidental meeting to persuade her to go with him and to
her death. This approach is borne out (1) by Crown Counsel’s statement in his
opening address to the jury as follows:

I should deal with the accused, who is in
the same grade, although older than the deceased girl, and at the same school.
He was, at the time, and still is, the son of a Warrant Officer who also lives
in the Married

[Page 385]

Quarters on the Station. Now, in
considering the movements of this accused relative to the crime, you will hear
from one, who may be a very important witness in your estimation, Jocelyne
Goddette. She is a girl from the same grade, and she will tell you of
arrangements she made with Steven Truscott at school on the Monday and the
Tuesday before, in or near this same bush where this body was found, to look
for a certain purpose she will outline. You will hear that better from her lips
as to their arrangement together to go to this bush, and that was at, let us
say in the area of six o’clock, roughly. You will hear better the times from
her and certain things said by way of caution of bringing anyone or telling
anyone.

(The italics are mine.)

and (2) by the questions put to Jocelyne
Goddette which stressed the secrecy of the original arrangement with Jocelyne
for the two to meet at about six o’clock on the county road near the bush area.
The evidence given by Jocelyne Goddette as to her arrangement to meet with
Truscott was as follows:

Q. And on Monday, June 8th, Jocelyne, did
you have a conversation with Steven Truscott?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Will you tell what that conversation
was, please?

A. Well, on Sunday, I had gone to Bob
Lawson’s barn and I had seen a calf there. I mentioned that to Steve on Monday,
and he asked me if I wanted to see two more newborn calves… And I said: “Yes”.
And he asked me if I could make it on Monday and I said: “No”, because I had to
go to Guides.

MR. HAYS:

Q. Make what?

A. If I could go with him to see the calves
and I said: “No”.

Q. Where were you to go with him?

A. Well, he didn’t tell me on Monday.

Q. Well, go ahead?

A. And then he asked me if I could make it
on Tuesday and I said I would try. And then on Tuesday, he told me if I could
go and I just told him I didn’t know, and he said to meet him, if I could go,
on the right-hand side of the County Road, just outside of the fence by the
woods, and he kept on telling me not to tell anybody because Bob didn’t like
a whole bunch of kids on his property.

(The italics are mine.)

Q. Now, that is on Tuesday, June 9th, is
it, that that conversation is, Jocelyne?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And when were you to go? A. Well, at six
o’clock.

Q. On Tuesday?

A. Yes, sir.

[Page 386]

Q. And where—did you see Steven later after
school?

A. Yes, sir. He came to my house at ten
before six and I didn’t answer the door, my brother did, and Steven asked me if
we had any homework and I said we had English for our English test on
Wednesday, and when he was just getting on his bike to go away, I told him I
didn’t think I would be able to make it because we were just starting supper,
but that I would try.

This evidence was admissible and relevant to
establish why Jocelyne said she was looking for Truscott that evening excepting
possibly the words I have put in italics, but reading as it does the phrase was
rather innocuous because it gives the reason for keeping quiet, and with
nothing more the learned judge could have told the jury to ignore it. Even a
failure to do this would not have been serious. However, after some intervening
questions and answers the subject was deliberately reopened and the following
question was put to Jocelyne by Crown Counsel and an answer solicited which
emphasized the secret aspect of the proposed meeting of these two teen-agers:

Q. Was there any more conversation between
you then, on Tuesday?

A. Well, he just kept on telling me to
“don’t tell anybody to come with you”, and that is all.

and this was magnified by the learned judge who,
following this question and answer, said:

His LORDSHIP:

Q. Say that again. He just kept on telling
me what?

A. Not to tell anybody.

This was when the damage was done. These last
two answers were wholly inadmissible. In dealing with this particular item, the
majority opinion says:

The admonition to Jocelyne Goddette to keep
the matter secret is no more a reflection on Truscott’s character than the
invitation itself. It is part and parcel of the same conversation and one part
cannot be separated from the other. The jury is entitled to know what the whole
conversation was and the witness when testifying to such a conversation should
not be compelled to stop at a certain point.

That observation is only partly correct in that
it is incomplete. It expresses the ordinary rule but that rule is subject to a
number of exceptions. It is often the duty of counsel to forewarn a witness not
to volunteer or blurt out as part of the narrative in an answer evidence that
while part of that

[Page 387]

narrative is inadmissible as, for instance,
references to confessions or admissions made by an accused or evidence of bad
character and many others. It is not a case of volunteering or blurting out
that is being dealt with here but a conscious and deliberate drawing from the
witness evidence that was bound to be prejudicial and as an integral part of
establishing the Crown’s theory that Truscott was planning harm to Jocelyne
Goddette.

The evidence had no probative value to prove
Truscott murdered Lynne Harper and should have been rejected when tendered by
the rule which excludes evidence of similar acts which Viscount Sankey said in Maxwell
v. Director of Public Prosecutions[7] was
“one of the most deeply rooted and jealously guarded principles of our Criminal
Law”. Having thus laid this foundation, Crown Counsel elaborated the theory and
put it forward as proof of Truscott’s guilt in his summation to the jury
saying:

Now, there is substantial support for
Jocelyne’s evidence that she went looking for Steven, and support for her
evidence of these conversations. She went on to tell how she couldn’t go with
him on Monday night. Well then, there was a tentative date for six o’clock on
the Tuesday night. And that he, Steven, came to the house and called for her.
He called there at ten minutes to six but she was having her supper, and I
suggest to you, Gentlemen, that if they were late having their supper, it was a
God’s blessing to that girl.

(The italics are mine.)

* *
*

Here is the relevancy of that, Gentlemen.
He missed his first prospect and what more logical and likely person to accept
his proposal to go with him on short notice than a girl he knows is fond of
him, soft on him, whatever you will, and likely to take up his invitation?

Now, we are told—again we come back to
Mrs. Nickerson and Mrs. Bohonus. They talked and she sat on the
bicycle tire and they went—I suggest that they then went down to the bush. I
suggest that is a reasonable inference, that Steven gave Lynne the new‑born
calf invitation that he had previously extended to Jocelyne, and that he gave
her that, either at the school or as they rode—walked or rode, and if it
wouldn’t sound like a good proposition to an adult or to some girls, older
girls, other girls, we must remember, it was coming from a boy that she liked.
She was fond of. That she would want to be with. And, unfortunately, that may
have removed what would otherwise be a little caution. And also, there was
evidence that Lynne was interested in ponies, at least, and

[Page 388]

had gone to this house on the highway, to
see ponies. I don’t think, Gentlemen, I am asking you to make too much of a
deduction but what she would be very likely to fall for the lure of the
new-born calves coming from Steven, and that she went with him to the bush
and to her doom.

(The italics are mine.)

There was no evidence of the conversation
between Truscott and Lynne in the school yard or as they left together
excepting Truscott’s statement to the police that Lynne had asked him for a
ride to No. 8 Highway which from the nature of things was uncontradicted. There
was no suggestion in the evidence of those who saw Truscott and Lynne together in
the school yard from which it could be inferred that Truscott was trying to
induce or persuade Lynne to go anywhere with him. Mrs. Bohonus said it was
Lynne who appeared to her to be doing the talking.

The learned judge in his charge to the jury
recognized the impropriety of this prejudicial and inflammatory appeal but too
late to undo the harm as I shall discuss later. Notwithstanding what the
learned judge said in this regard, it is significant to note that at pp. 54 and
55 of the Crown’s factum on this reference is to be found:

It is submitted that the following
inference may be properly drawn from the evidence adduced at the trial and from
that evidence supplemented by the evidence on the Reference:

(1) Truscott was bent on taking a girl
into Lawson’s Wood on June 9th. His expressed purpose was to look for
new-born calves, but this was coloured by his desire for secrecy;

(The italics are mine.)

The majority opinion also says:

We do not think that any of this
conversation between Truscott and Jocelyne Goddette was any reflection on
Truscott’s character. To put it at its worst for Truscott it means no more than
this: that he had a tentative date arranged with Jocelyne Goddette. He wanted a
date with a girl that night and he took Lynne Harper when Jocelyne Goddette was
not available. We have already mentioned that this has some bearing on the
submission of the prosecution that his story of the ride, the sole purpose of
which was to take her to the intersection, may not have been true. It does not
amount to trying to prove bad character or a disposition to murder and rape.

This appears to ignore the reality of the
situation when considered in the actual setting as it was being developed at
the trial by Crown Counsel and entirely repugnant to what Crown Counsel said in
the extracts from his summation to

[Page 389]

the jury quoted above when he said, referring to
Truscott having called for Jocelyne Goddette “and I suggest to you,
Gentlemen, that if they were late having their supper, it was a God’s blessing
to that girl”, and when he followed that with his reference to Lynne Harper
and said that Truscott gave Lynne the new-born calf invitation and “that she
went with him to the bush and to her doom”.

The majority opinion rightly points out that the
facts in Maxwell v. Director of Public Prosecutions differ materially
from those of the case at bar. It was not the factual situation that Viscount
Sankey was dealing with in the extract that I have quoted. He was stating a
long established principle applicable to many factual situations. Maxwell’s case
was an obvious if not a flagrant violation of the principle. Violations can and
do occur in less obvious instances. The present case is one of those. Crown
Counsel was pursuing a planned course of action that included the subtle
perverting of the jury to the idea that Truscott was sex hungry that Tuesday
evening and determined to have a girl in Lawson’s bush to satisfy his desires,
if not Jocelyne, then Lynne.

It was inevitable that this horrible crime would
arouse the indignation of the whole community. It was inevitable too that
suspicion should fall on Truscott, the last person known to have been seen with
Lynne in the general vicinity of the place where her body was found. The law
has formulated certain principles and safeguards to be applied in the trial of
a person accused of a crime and has throughout the centuries insisted on these
principles and safeguards being observed. In the great majority of cases
adherence to these fundamentals is not difficult but in a case like the present
one, when passions are aroused and the Court is dealing with a crime which
cries out for vengeance, then comes the time of testing. It is especially at
such a time that the judicial machinery must function objectively, devoid of
inflammatory appeals, with the scales of justice held in balance.

This standard was not lived up to in the trial
under review in a number of instances which one by one were

[Page 390]

damaging to Truscott and taken collectively
vitiated the trial Nothing that transpired on the hearing in this Court or any
evidence tendered here can be used to give validity to what was an invalid
trial. A bad trial remains a bad trial. The only remedy for a bad trial is a
new trial. Accordingly, the validity of the trial is, in my view, the dominant
issue. With deference to contrary opinion, I see no purpose in erecting a
massive and detailed structure of evidence, inference and argument confirming a
verdict that has no lawful foundation upon which to rest.

It was the Crown’s theory at the trial that
Truscott took Lynne into Lawson’s bush by way of the tractor trail, having
carried her on the handle bar of his bicycle to a point on the tractor trail
some 350 feet east of the county road and then induced her to enter the bush
through the fence, concealing his bicycle nearby. It must be observed in
passing that at the hearing in this Court Mr. Bowman, of Counsel for the
Crown, advanced the theory that Truscott took Lynne into the bush from the
county road at or near the point where the locket was later found hanging on
the fence. Crown Counsel at the trial had an altogether different theory which
he put forward concerning this locket—but I shall revert to this later.

At the trial the Crown led evidence to show that
Truscott entered the tractor trail with Lynne. This was evidence by Corporal
Erskine, the very first witness called by the Crown, that on the 13th day of
June (two days after Lynne’s body was found) he observed and photographed
certain bicycle tire marks which corresponded with the tread on the tires of
Truscott’s bicycle. Defence Counsel objected to the photograph (Exhibit 13)
being received, but was overruled by the learned judge who said regarding the
photograph:

Mr. Hays seems to think it has
something to do with the case. I don’t think I can rule it out on the grounds
you put forward.

This Exhibit 13 shows conclusively that the tire
marks photographed by Corporal Erskine must have been made many days preceding
June 9th. The marks were made when

[Page 391]

the soil in which they were imprinted was wet
and there had been no rain in the area, with the exception of a trace in the
night of May 31st-June 1st and that throughout the period June 1st to June 9th
the temperature had been in the high 80’s and low 90’s. Perhaps the best way to
illustrate the impossibility of these tire marks having been made on June 9th
is to reproduce Exhibit 13 showing the parched terrain with the wide cracks in
the surface. Here is a reproduction of Exhibit 13:



[Page 392]

Notwithstanding that the evidence completely
negatived the use of these tire marks as evidence implicating Truscott on June
9th, Crown Counsel argued to the jury in his summation as follows:

The bicycle marks, Gentlemen, I am not
going to linger over. Corporal Erskine’s evidence that he found tire marks,
combinations of the two wheels, but they are in as Exhibits. You will have them
with you. That he made comparison and that he found those marks in the laneway
and you will remember the distance down. I, frankly, don’t. That they compare. That
they are a combination. Now it is true there could be similar tires, certainly,
but where you get radically different tires—you look at them and you will find
them in combination, it would seem to be fairly strong evidence that that
bicycle was down there.

But, Gentlemen, as I said about a
circumstantial evidence case, that is the beauty—there is nothing beautiful
about this at all, but that is one of the strong facts about it. You have a
pile of facts and if there is one or two that are not conclusive you still, you
still have the conclusive proof of the facts that are there.

The learned judge should have charged the jury
in the light of the evidence of the meteorologist Calvert and with Exhibit 13
before him that they must exclude from their consideration the evidence
relating to these bicycle tire marks. This he failed to do, but instead, and in
my opinion wrongly, left the jury to understand that they could use that
evidence as part of the proof against Truscott that he had ridden Lynne along
that tractor trail the night she disappeared. He said:

Nothing belonging to the accused boy was
found in the locality, in the neighbourhood of the body, as you will recall.
There was a tire mark in the field about seventeen feet north of the fence that
ran along this lane, and Constable Erskine, who testified, said that the marks
of the tire were similar, I think that is as high as he put it, were similar to
the tires that were put in evidence of the bicycle belonging to the accused
boy, and you are asked to find that those marks were made by this bicycle. That
is what the Crown asks you to find. The bicycle is not a common one.

(The italics are mine.)

That was misdirection on a salient feature of
the evidence for it was part and parcel of the Crown’s case at the trial that
Truscott took Lynne into the bush from the tractor trail and that he had hidden
his bicycle so well that it was not seen by Jocelyne Goddette when, as she
says, she went along the tractor trail looking for Truscott and calling his
name. This presupposes that Truscott had the foresight to anticipate that
Jocelyne would come along the tractor trail looking for him and to conceal his
bicycle against that

[Page 393]

eventuality; a theory that attributed to
Truscott a carefully planned design to harm Lynne and escape detection. The
majority opinion, in dealing with the matter of the bicycle tire marks, says:
“We do not think that anyone took this evidence (the tire marks) as a
salient feature of the case.” I find it difficult to see how this statement can
be substantiated. Who knows what the jury considered salient? This evidence was
regarded as sufficiently important by Crown Counsel as to insist that it be
received.

I referred earlier to Mr. Bowman’s theory
that Truscott took Lynne into the bush from the county road at or near the
place where Lynne’s locket was found on the fence. In his argument to this
Court, Mr. Bowman said:

My submission was, my lord, that they
disappeared from the county road, and my submission was that it might be
reasonably inferred that they went into the wood, and that they got into the
wood through the barbed wire along the county road. It was broken down in two
or three places, and the locket was found there, which could have some
significance. They could have gone in any where, my lord, but I submit that
there is one possible way. Whether or not that is what the jury accepted I
cannot say.

However, at the trial, in dealing with this
locket, Crown Counsel put forward a more sinister theory which, if accepted by
the jury as Crown Counsel intended it should be, made the 14½ year old Truscott
out to be a cunning criminal who, having taken the locket from Lynne when he
strangled her, later and before he was taken into custody planted the locket
where it was found to mislead the police and to lay the foundation for a
defence to be used later if necessary that Lynne was murdered elsewhere and
then brought to where she was found. He said to the jury:

Now, the Defence has raised the matter of a
locket. And do you recall Steve",1967-05-04 00:00:00,CA Supreme Court

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal Law—Charge of non-capital murder
against a juvenile—Application to have trial held in ordinary courts—Juvenile
Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 160, s. 9.

The appellant, a 15 year old juvenile, was
charged under the Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 160, with
non-capital murder. The Crown applied under s. 9 of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act to have the juvenile proceeded against by indictment in the
ordinary courts. The Juvenile Court judge made the order asked after hearing
evidence of a psychiatrist and from the probation officer, some of which was
unsworn. The appellant then applied for a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari
in aid. This application was dismissed. The Court of Appeal upheld the
dismissal. The appellant applied to this Court for leave to appeal. Such leave
in respect of habeas corpus was not required by virtue of s. 691(3) 
of the Criminal Code , but it was granted in so far as it related to the
request for certiorari in aid.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

On the merits of this case, and without
deciding the question of the jurisdiction of this Court, the order made by the
Juvenile Court judge should not be disturbed. It was a discretionary order
which he had jurisdiction to make. There is no rule of law, nor any authority,
to compel a magistrate or a Juvenile Court judge when making an order under
s. 9(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act to base his opinion solely
on sworn testimony.

Droit criminel—Accusation de meurtre non
qualifié contre un enfant—Requête pour avoir le procès devant les cours
ordinaires—Loi sur les Jeunes Délinquants, S.R.C. 1952, c. 160, s. 9.

L’appelant, un enfant de 15 ans, a été accusé
sous le régime de la Loi sur les Jeunes Délinquants, S.R.C. 1952, c.
160, d’un meurtre non qualifié. La Couronne a présenté une requête en vertu de
l’art. 9 de la Loi sur les Jeunes Délinquants pour qu’il soit ordonné
que l’enfant soit poursuivi par voie de mise en accusation dans les cours
ordinaires. Le juge de la Cour pour jeunes délinquants a accordé cette demande
après avoir entendu les témoignages d’un psychiatre et d’un agent de
surveillance. Une partie de ces témoignages n’a pas été prise sous serment. L’appelant
a alors présenté une requête pour obtenir un bref d’habeas corpus avec
certiorari à l’appui. La Cour d’Appel a confirmé le jugement rejetant cette
requête. L’appelant a présenté une requête devant cette Cour pour permission
d’appeler. Quant au bref d’habeas

[Page 299]

corpus, cette
permission n’était pas requise en vertu de l’art. 691(3)  du Code Criminel ,
mais permission a été accordée en autant que la requête se rapportait au bref
de certiorari.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté.

Sur les mérites de la cause, et sans décider
la question de la juridiction de cette Cour, il n’y a pas lieu de changer
l’ordonnance du juge de la Cour pour jeunes délinquants. Cette ordonnance était
discrétionnaire et relevait de sa compétence. Il n’y a aucune règle de droit,
ni aucune autorité, contraignant un magistrat ou un juge de la Cour pour les
jeunes délinquants de baser son opinion seulement sur des témoignages
assermentés lorsqu’il rend une ordonnance sous l’art. 9(1) de la Loi sur les
Jeunes Délinquants.

Manitoba concernant une ordonnance en vertu de l’art. 9 de la Loi sur les
Jeunes Délinquants. Appel rejeté.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Manitoba with respect to an order made under s. 9 of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act. Appeal dismissed.

Murray Tapper, for the appellant.

A.A. Sarchuk, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

HALL J.:—The appellant, Arnold Glenn Shingoose,
a juvenile 15 years of age at the time of commission of the alleged offence,
was charged under an information dated April 10, 1966, in Juvenile Court under
the Juvenile Delinquents Act as follows:

…that Arnold Glenn Shingoose a child did on
or about the 9th day of April, 1966, at the Lizard Point Indian Reserve in the
said Province, commit a delinquency in that he did unlawfully murder George
Clearsky and thereby committed non-capital murder contrary to the form of the
statute in such case made and provided Section 206 (2) C.C. & J.D. Act.

Upon being apprehended, he was brought before
His Honour F.W. Coward, a judge under the Juvenile Delinquents Act. On
May 2, 1966, an application was made to the Juvenile Court judge under
s. 9 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act to order that the child be
proceeded against by indictment in the ordinary courts in accordance with the
provisions of the Criminal Code  in that behalf. Section 9  reads as
follows:

9.(1) Where the act complained of is, under
the provisions of the Criminal Code  or otherwise, an indictable offence, and
the accused child is apparently or actually over the age of fourteen years, the
Court may, in

[Page 300]

its discretion, order the child to be
proceeded against by indictment in the ordinary courts in accordance with the
provisions of the Criminal Code  in that behalf; but such course shall in
no case be followed unless the Court is of the opinion that the good of the
child and the interest of the community demand it.

(2) The Court may, in its discretion, at
any time before any proceeding has been initiated against the child in the ordinary
criminal courts, rescind an order so made.

On the hearing of this application, the Juvenile
Court judge received sworn testimony as to the age of the juvenile which
established that he was born January 5, 1951, and he was, accordingly, over the
age of 14 years. He also heard representations from Crown counsel in which he
was referred to a number of decisions relating to s. 9 aforesaid.
Following that, he asked for a psychiatric report and a psychological report.
He then proceeded to hear representations from the Probation Officer,
Mr. Korzeniowski, who was cross-examined by counsel for the juvenile.
Mr. Korzeniowski was not sworn. The Juvenile Court judge then adjourned
the proceedings until Tuesday, May 24, 1966, at which time the psychiatric and
psychological reports were received. Counsel for the juvenile objected that
these were not given under oath. The Juvenile Court judge then made the Order
complained of.

The appellant applied for a writ of habeas
corpus with certiorari in aid. The application was heard by Bastin J. and
dismissed by him. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal of Manitoba and
that Court, after a full hearing on the merits, upheld the judgment of Bastin
J. The appellant thereupon applied to this Court for leave to appeal from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba. Leave to appeal in respect of habeas
corpus was not required by virtue of s. 691(3)  of the Criminal
Code . Leave to appeal insofar as the application related to the request for
certiorari in aid was granted.

On the hearing in this Court, the jurisdiction
of the Court to interfere with the order made by the learned Juvenile Court
judge in habeas corpus proceedings was questioned, and upon
consideration the Court stated:

Mr. Tapper and Mr. Sarchuk:—We
think the best course is to hear the argument on the merits reserving the
question whether the proceedings taken by the appellant are such that we can
deal with the merits. It goes without saying, Mr. Sarchuk, that you will
be entitled to argue as fully as you please that in view of the form of the
proceedings we cannot deal with the merits.

[Page 301]

Apart altogether from the procedural
difficulties and without passing upon them, I am of the view that on the merits
the order made by the learned Juvenile Court judge should not be disturbed. It
was a discretionary order which he had jurisdiction to make. The appellant’s
contention is that on the hearing preceding the making of the order in question
the Juvenile Court judge heard representations of counsel for the Crown as well
as reports from the Probation officer and from a psychologist and a
psychiatrist which were not given under oath.

In the Court of Appeal, Monnin J.A., speaking
for the Court, said:

The issue before Bastin J., involved the
question whether the juvenile had been properly dealt with by Coward J.C.J.
Reviewing the record in this matter it is apparent that Coward J.C.J. entered
into an extensive enquiry for the purpose of determining whether or not to
grant the Crown’s application for transfer. It is plain that he addressed his
mind both to the facts and to the governing law. He gave specific consideration
to the requirements of sec. 9(1) of The Juvenile Delinquents Act,
supra, requiring that no order of transfer to the adult Court be made
“unless the Court is of the opinion that the good of the child and the interest
of the community demand it”.

Monnin J.A., without referring to the case by
name, was following the decision of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba in Regina
v. Pagee[1], in
which he had participated. In that case, Miller C.J.M., speaking for the Court,
said:

In my opinion if Crown counsel outlines to
the Juvenile Court Judge reasons which indicate that it is for the good of the
child and in the interest of the community that the transfer be made, then the
Juvenile Court Judge, after considering any representation on behalf of the
juvenile, can, in his discretion, act upon such information and material as is
before him. I do not say that sworn evidence could not be given if desired
either by the Crown or the defence or by both in support of or in opposition to
the transfer, but what I want to make clear is that there is no rule of law,
nor any authority, to compel the Magistrate when making an order under
s. 9(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act, to base his opinion solely
on sworn testimony.

With this I agree.

The appeal should, accordingly, be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

vehicle within the meaning of s. 223  of the Criminal Code . At the
time of his apprehension, the appellant was in an impaired condition behind the
steering wheel of his car with the key in the ignition. The car was in a ditch
and could not move under its own power until it was extricated by a tow. The
Crown appealed by way of a stated case. The appeal was allowed and the case
remitted to the magistrate. A further appeal

[Page 285]

to the Court of Appeal was dismissed without
written reasons. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the
following point of law: “Is an automobile, which cannot be set in motion by its
own power, by reason of conditions existing at the time of the alleged offence,
a ‘motor vehicle’ within the meaning of those words where they appear in the
phrase ‘care and control of a motor vehicle’ in section 223  of the Criminal
Code ?”

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The true object of the provisions of ss. 222
and 223 of the Code is to cope with and protect the person and the property
from the danger which is inherent in the driving, care or control of a motor
vehicle by anyone who is intoxicated or under the influence of a drug or whose
ability to drive is impaired by alcohol or a drug. The definition of motor
vehicle in s. 2(25) of the Code refers to the type, the nature and not the
actual operability or effective functioning of the particular vehicle. It is
therefore immaterial if a motor vehicle, at the time of the alleged offence,
cannot be set in motion by its own power by reason of internal or external
conditions.

L’appelant a été acquitté, par un magistrat,
de l’offense d’avoir conduit une automobile alors que sa capacité était
affaiblie, pour le motif que l’automobile n’était pas un véhicule à moteur dans
le sens de l’art. 223  du Code criminel . Lors de son arrestation, les
capacités de conduire de l’appelant étaient affaiblies et il était assis au
volant de son automobile. La clef d’allumage était en place. L’automobile était
dans un fossé et ne pouvait pas se mouvoir de son propre pouvoir jusqu’à ce
qu’elle fut dégagée au moyen d’une remorque. La Couronne en appela par voie
d’un dossier imprimé. L’appel fut maintenu et le dossier renvoyé au magistrat. Un
appel subséquent fut rejeté sans motifs écrits par la Cour d’Appel. L’appelant
a obtenu permission d’en appeler devant cette Cour sur la question de droit
suivante: «Est-ce qu’une automobile, qui ne peut pas être mise en mouvement de
son propre pouvoir, en raison de conditions existantes au temps de l’offense,
est un «véhicule à moteur» dans le sens de ces mots dans la phrase «garde et
contrôle d’un véhicule à moteur» dans l’article 223  du Code criminel ?»

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté.

Le véritable but des dispositions des arts. 222
et 223 du Code est de conjurer le danger et de protéger les personnes et la
propriété contre le danger qui est inhérent à la conduite, à la garde ou au
contrôle d’un véhicule à moteur par toute personne en état d’ivresse ou sous
l’influence d’un narcotique ou dont la capacité de conduire est affaiblie par
l’effet de l’alcool ou d’une drogue. La définition de véhicule à moteur dans

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’Appel de la
province de Saskatchewan, confirmant une décision du Juge Balfour. Appel rejeté.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Saskatchewan, affirming a decision of Balfour J. Appeal dismissed.

Robert Carleton, for the appellant.

Serge Kujawa, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

FAUTEUX J.:—The appellant was charged with
having, on the 6th day of October A.D. 1963, at Herbert District, in the
province of Saskatchewan, the care or control of a motor vehicle while his
ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired, committing thereby the offence
described in s. 223  of the Criminal Code . To this charge, he pleaded not
guilty and was ultimately acquitted by Police Magistrate C.W. Vause.

Dissatisfied with this determination of the
case, as being erroneous in point of law, the Attorney General for the province
appealed to the Court of Queen’s Bench[1], by way
of a stated case. The relevant facts and grounds, as well as the question
submitted for the consideration of the Court, are set forth in the following
terms by the Magistrate:

In the early morning, 1.20 a.m., on the 6th
day of October, 1963, the accused was found in an automobile in the ditch on
the west side of the highway and off the travelled portion thereof. He was
asleep seated behind the steering wheel, the key was in the ignition switch,
and the ignition was turned off. The motor was not running but was capable of
running, as Constable Burch of the R.C.M. Police had attempted to drive the
automobile out of the ditch without success and later, after it had been
extricated by a tow, drove the automobile back to Swift Current, Saskatchewan.
The automobile was at right angles to the highway with the rear wheels in the ditch,
while the two front wheels were on the shoulder of the gravel road. The left
rear wheel of the automobile was completely clear and would spin freely. The
position of the vehicle in the ditch, plus that fact that it was, what is
commonly known as ‘high centered’,

[Page 287]

prevented movement of the automobile under
its own power, and it was absolutely necessary for it to be extricated from its
position in the ditch by means of a winch on a tow truck.

The evidence clearly indicated that the
accused was in an impaired condition at the time of apprehension.

There is no evidence to establish that the
accused did not enter or mount the automobile for the purpose of setting it in
motion.

Part of a case of beer was found in the
rear seat of the automobile.

No evidence was adduced to prove the
condition of the accused when his automobile left the highway. There was no
positive or reliable proof as to the length of time the automobile of the
accused had been in the ditch before the arrival of the police constables or
when or where he had consumed intoxicating liquor.

I found as a fact that the accused was in
an impaired condition at the time of apprehension by the R.C.M. Police.

I found as a fact that the accused had care
or control of the vehicle at the time of his apprehension.

I found as a fact that it was absolutely
necessary to have the vehicle extricated from its position in the ditch by
means of a winch on a tow truck.

I found as a fact that the vehicle in its
position in the ditch was not a danger to the public or property as
contemplated by Section 223  of the Criminal Code .

* *
*

CASE:

(1) The proceeding was questioned on one
ground, namely:

That I erred in my finding of law, namely:
that the automobile was not a motor vehicle within the meaning of Section 223 
of the Criminal Code .

With respect to ground (1), in view of the
fact that I found the vehicle was not a danger to the public or property as
contemplated by Section 223  of the Criminal Code , due to its position in the
ditch and my finding of fact that it was absolutely necessary to have the
automobile extricated from the position in the ditch by means of a winch on a
tow truck, I was of the opinion that the vehicle was not a motor vehicle. I
came to the said conclusion based on the test of whether a vehicle is a motor
vehicle within the meaning of Section 223 , as decided by Rex v. Thornton, 96
C.C.C. The test as stated in the said case was simply whether or not it did
constitute a danger such as was contemplated by Section 223 .

The appeal was heard by Mr. Justice Balfour
of the Court of Queen’s Bench. In his reasons for judgment, the learned judge
referred particularly to and quoted extensively from the reasons of MacDonald
J.A., who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Alberta, in R.
v. Rye[2], and
from the reasons given by Ilsley C.J., and concurred in by the majority, in the
decision of the Court of Appeal for Nova Scotia, in R. v. Wolfe[3]. On the authority of the

[Page 288]

decisions of these two Courts of Appeal,
Mr. Justice Balfour decided that the Magistrate, in the case at bar, did
err in his finding of law that the automobile was not a motor vehicle within
the meaning of s. 223  of the Criminal Code  and hence remitted the
case to the Magistrate for determination in the light of this finding.

An appeal was then entered from this decision to
the Court of Appeal of the province of Saskatchewan. The Court, constituted of
Culliton C.J.A., Hall and Maguire JJ.A., dismissed this appeal, but did not
deliver any written reasons.

Appellant finally sought and obtained leave to
appeal to this Court on the following point of law:

Is an automobile, which cannot be set in
motion by its own power, by reason of conditions existing at the time of the
alleged offence, a ‘motor vehicle’ within the meaning of those words where they
appear in the phrase ‘care and control of a motor vehicle’ in
section 223  of the Criminal Code ?

Having heard counsel for the appellant and
retired to further consider the matter, the Court then informed counsel for
respondent that it was not necessary to hear him and, indicating that reasons
for judgment would be later delivered, the Court dismissed the appeal.

In the consideration of the question, it is
appropriate to note that conditions, preventing an automobile to be set in
motion on its own power, are, according to their nature, conveniently
differentiated as being either internal, such as, for example, a lack of
gasoline, a mechanical breakdown or the like, or external, such as, for
instance, a loss of traction attributable to the miring of the automobile in
snow or mud. The above question, in the scope of which both internal and
external conditions are contemplated, has given rise to conflicting
judicial opinions in cases decided under the former Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1947, c. 36, as well as, though to a much lesser and decreasing degree, in
those decided under the new Criminal Code . Most of the cases are
reviewed in an article mentioned by Mr. Justice Balfour and written by
L.K. Graburn—cf. vol. 1 (1958-59) of The Criminal Law Quarterly,—and
little would be gained by discussing them here. Sufficient it is, I think, to
quote the provisions of s. 2(25)  and the relevant parts of ss. 222  and

[Page 289]

223 of the Criminal Code  and then
indicate and consider the nature and basis of the conflict.

2. In this Act,

(25) “motor vehicle” means a vehicle
that is drawn, propelled or driven by any means other than by muscular power,
but does not include a vehicle of a railway that operates on rails;

* *
*

222. Every one who, while intoxicated or
under the influence of a narcotic drug, drives a motor vehicle or has the care
or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, is guilty of…

223. Every one who, while his ability to
drive a motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or a drug, drives a motor vehicle
or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not,
is guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary
conviction and is liable…

It should be noted that there was no definition
of motor vehicle, in the former Code, and that the present definition
was introduced with and at the time of the coming into force of the new Code,
to wit, on the 1st of April 1955.

Obviously, every one agrees that the true object
of the provisions of ss. 222  and 223  is to cope with and protect the person and
the property from the danger which is inherent in the driving, care or
control of a motor vehicle by anyone who is intoxicated or under the
influence of a drug or whose ability to drive is impaired by alcohol or a drug.
At this point, however, the unanimity ends and the conflict arises.

In one category of cases, it is held that since
protection against the above danger is the true and sole object of the
legislation, it follows that, if, when the involved automobile cannot be set in
motion by its own power by reason of conditions existing at the time of the
alleged offence, there is actually or potentially no such danger, then the
automobile cannot be said to be a motor vehicle within the meaning which
ought to be given to these words in the context of ss. 222  and 223  and, in such
circumstances, these sections have no application. This interpretation is
held to be unaffected by reason of s. 2(25) for, defining as it does, motor
vehicle as a vehicle that is drawn, propelled or driven by any means other than
by muscular power, this definition, it is said, contemplates a motor
vehicle actually free of internal or external conditions preventing it to move
by its own power.

[Page 290]

In the other category of cases, it is held that
the fact that a motor vehicle is not free of such conditions at the time of the
alleged offence, is entirely immaterial. That this is so, since at least the
introduction in the legislation of the statutory definition of motor
vehicle, is uncontrovertible for, it is said, the definition refers to the
type, the nature and not the actual operability or effective functioning of
this particular vehicle.

In my respectful opinion, the holding in the
latter category of cases is the correct one, and R. v. Rye, supra, and R.
v. Wolfe, supra, were rightly decided, as also were, amongst others, the
cases of R. v. Weaver[4] and
R. v. Simpson[5], where
the lack of danger alleged and pleaded in defense, was related, in the first
case, to an internal condition, and in the second case, to an external
condition. The definition of a motor vehicle is in plain and
ordinary language. It contemplates a kind of vehicle, not its actual
operability or functioning. Its application is not confined to a portion of the
Code, it extends uniformly throughout. The definitions of the offences
mentioned in ss. 222  and 223  are also couched in a language that is plain and
simple and in which nothing, either expressed or implied, indicates an intent
of Parliament to exact, in every case, as being one of the ingredients of the
offences, the proof of the presence of some element of actual or potential
danger or to accept, as a valid defense, the absence of any. On the contrary,
these and the other related provisions of the Code manifest the determination
of Parliament to strike at the very root of the evil, to wit: the combination
of alcohol and automobile, that normally breeds this element of danger which
this preventive legislation is meant to anticipate.

We are unanimously of the opinion that the
question, upon which leave to appeal was granted, must receive an affirmative
answer and, for that reason, the appeal, as above indicated, was dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Indecent assault—Doctor
examining female patient in presence of friend, a layman—Friend falsely
described as an intern—Whether consent given to examination—Whether consent
obtained by fraud—Nature and quality of act—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c.
51, ss. 21, 141, 230.

The two appellants, one a medical doctor and
the other a layman friend of the doctor, were convicted of indecent assault,
contrary to s. 141  of the Criminal Code . The doctor represented to
a female patient that his friend was a medical intern in need of further
experience and in this way obtained the patient’s consent to the friend’s
presence in the examining room during the course of an examination of the
patient’s intimate parts. During the examination, the friend stood by and
observed but at no time did he touch the patient. Their convictions were
affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The appellants were granted leave to appeal to
this Court.

Held (Spence
J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and a verdict of acquittal
entered for both appellants.

Per Cartwright,
Fauteux, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: The appellants were not guilty of an indecent
assault within the meaning of s. 141  of the Criminal Code . The
conduct of the doctor was unethical and reprehensible in the extreme. However,
the consent of the patient was not obtained by false and fraudulent
representations as to the nature and quality of the act to be performed by the
doctor. The fraud was as to

[Page 678]

the friend being a medical intern. His
presence as distinct from some overt act by him was not an assault. The friend
was acting as a “peeping tom”, and such conduct is not an offence.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: Under s. 230 of the Criminal Code , the
application of force, however slight, is an assault when it is “without the
consent of another person or with consent when it is obtained by fraud”. In
this case, the patient consented to be touched by the doctor in the presence of
a doctor and not a mere layman. The indecent assault upon her was not the act
to which she consented and therefore the two appellants were guilty under the
provisions of s. 141(1) of the Code when considered with ss. 21 and 230 of
the Code without recourse to the provisions of s. 141(2) .

Droit criminel—Attentat à la pudeur—Docteur
examinant une patiente en la présence d’un ami non du métier—Ami décrit comme
étant un interne—Le consentement a-t-il été donné pour l’examen—Le consentement
a-t-il été obtenu par fraude—Nature et caractère de l’acte—Code criminel ,
1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 21, 141, 230.

Les deux appelants, l’un un médecin et
l’autre un ami non du métier, ont été trouvés coupables d’attentat à la pudeur,
le tout contrairement à l’art. 141  du Code criminel . Le docteur a
représenté à une patiente que son ami était un interne ayant besoin de plus
d’expérience et de la sorte a obtenu le consentement de la patiente à ce que
l’ami soit présent à la salle d’examen lors d’un examen des parties intimes de
la patiente. Durant l’examen, l’ami se contenta de se tenir là et d’observer,
mais à aucun moment a-t-il touché la patiente. Les verdicts de culpabilité ont
été confirmés par la Cour d’Appel. Les appelants ont obtenu permission d’en
appeler devant cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être maintenu et un verdict de non culpabilité doit être rendu en faveur
des deux appelants, le Juge Spence étant dissident.

Les Juges
Cartwright, Fauteux, Ritchie et Hall: Les appelants n’étaient pas coupables
d’attentat à la pudeur dans le sens de l’art. 141  du Code criminel . La
conduite du docteur était moralement répréhensible à l’extrême. Cependant, le
consentement de la patiente n’a pas été obtenu par de fausses et frauduleuses
représentations sur la nature et le caractère de l’acte devant être posé par le
docteur. La fraude avait rapport à la description de l’ami comme étant un
interne. Sa présence en tant qu’elle est distincte d’un acte positif n’était
pas un assaut. L’ami a agi comme un «peeping tom», et une telle conduite n’est
pas une offense.

Le Juge
Spence, dissident: En vertu de l’art. 230  du Code criminel , l’application
de la force, si minime soit-elle, est une attaque lorsqu’elle est appliquée
«sans le consentement d’autrui ou avec son consentement s’il est obtenu par
fraude». Dans le cas présent, la patiente a consenti à ce que le docteur la
touche en présence d’un docteur et non pas d’une personne qui n’était pas du
métier. L’acte auquel elle a donné son consentement n’était pas l’attentat à la
pudeur et par conséquent, sans avoir recours aux dispositions de l’art. 141(2)
du Code, les deux appelants étaient coupables sous l’art. 141(1)  lorsqu’on le
considère avec les arts. 21 et 230 du Code.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’Appel de la
Colombie-Britannique[1], confirmant un verdict de culpabilité pour attentat à la pudeur. Appel maintenu, le Juge Spence étant dissident.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of British Columbia1, affirming the appellants’ conviction for indecent
assault. Appeal allowed, Spence J. dissenting.

Neil M. Fleishman, for the appellant
Bird.

Thomas R. Braidwood, for the appellant
Bolduc.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright, Fauteux, Ritchie and
Hall JJ. was delivered by

HALL J.:—The facts and circumstances relative to
this appeal are fully set out in the judgment of my brother Spence. The
question for decision is whether on those facts and in the circumstances so
described the appellants Bolduc and Bird were guilty of an indecent assault
upon the person of the complainant contrary to s. 141  of the Criminal
Code  which reads:

141. (1) Every one who indecently assaults
a female person is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for five years and to be whipped.

(2) An accused who is charged with an
offence under subsection (1) may be convicted if the evidence establishes
that the accused did anything to the female person with her consent that, but
for her consent, would have been an indecent assault, if her consent was
obtained by false and fraudulent representations as to the nature and quality
of the act.

With respect, I do not agree that an indecent
assault was committed within the meaning of this section. What Bolduc did was
unethical and reprehensible in the extreme and was something no reputable
medical practitioner would have countenanced. However, Bolduc’s unethical
conduct and the fraud practised upon the complainant do not of themselves
necessarily imply an infraction of s. 141 , supra. It is common
ground that the examination and treatment, including the insertion of the
speculum were consented to by the complainant. The question is: ‘Was her
consent obtained by false and fraudulent representations as to the nature and
quality of the act?’ Bolduc did exactly what

[Page 680]

the complainant understood he would do and
intended that he should do, namely, to examine the vaginal tract and to
cauterize the affected parts. Inserting the speculum was necessary for these
purposes. There was no fraud on his part as to what he was supposed to do and
in what he actually did. The complainant knew that Bird was present and
consented to his presence. The fraud that was practised on her was not as to
the nature and quality of what was to be done but was as to Bird’s identity as
a medical intern. His presence as distinct from some overt act by him was not
an assault. However, any overt act either alone or in common with Bolduc would
have transposed the situation into an unlawful assault, but Bird did not touch
the complainant; he merely looked on and listened to Bolduc’s comments on what
was being done because of the condition then apparent in the vaginal tract.
Bird was in a sense a “peeping tom”. Conduct popularly described as that of a
“peeping tom” was not an offence under the Criminal Code  nor was it an
offence at common law: Frey v. Fedoruk et al[2]. Since the decision in Frey v. Fedoruk,
supra, the Code was amended by the inclusion of s. 162  which
first appeared in the 1955 Code. That section reads:

162. Every one who, without lawful excuse,
the proof of which lies upon him, loiters or prowls at night upon the property
of another person near a dwelling house situated on that property is guilty of
an offence punishable on summary conviction.

The act of ‘peeping’ is not of itself made an
offence, but it is the loitering or prowling at night near a dwelling house
without lawful excuse that is made unlawful.

This case differs from Rex v. Harms[3] where the accused was charged with rape
following carnal knowledge of an Indian girl, her consent to the intercourse
having been obtained by false and fraudulent misrepresentations as to the
nature and quality of the act. In that case Harms falsely represented himself
to be a medical doctor, and although the complainant in that case knew that he
was proposing sexual intercourse, she consented thereto because of his
representations that the intercourse was in the nature of a medical treatment
necessitated by a condition which he said he had diagnosed. Harms was not a
medical man at all. He had no medical qualifications. The

[Page 681]

Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction by the
jury that the Indian girl’s consent had been obtained by false and fraudulent
representations as to the nature and quality of the act.

The question of fraud vitiating a woman’s
consent in the case of rape or indecent assault was fully canvassed by Stephen
J. in The Queen v. Clarence[4] and by
the High Court of Australia in Papadimitropoulos v. The Queen[5] where the Court, in concluding a full
review of the relevant law and cases decided up to that time, including the Harms
case, supra, said:

To return to the central point; rape is
carnal knowledge of a woman without her consent: carnal knowledge is the
physical fact of penetration; it is the consent to that which is in question;
such a consent demands a perception as to what is about to take place, as to
the identity of the man and the character of what he is doing. But once the
consent is comprehending and actual the inducing causes cannot destroy its
reality…

The complainant here knew what Bolduc was
proposing to do to her, for this was one in a series of such treatments. Her
consent to the examination and treatment was real and comprehending and it
cannot, therefore, be said that her consent was obtained by false or fraudulent
representations as to the nature and quality of the act to be done, for that
was not the fraud practised on her. The fraud was as to Bird being a medical
intern and it was not represented that he would do anything but observe. It was
intended that the examination and treatment would be done by Bolduc and this he
did without assistance or participation by Bird.

I would, accordingly, allow the appeal, quash
the conviction and direct that a verdict of acquittal be entered for both
appellants.

SPENCE J. (dissenting):—These are appeals
by each accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[6] pronounced on February 6, 1967 whereby that
Court dismissed the appeals of the accused from their convictions by His Honour
Judge Ladner on November 24, 1966, of charges of indecent assault contrary to the
provisions of s. 141  of the Criminal Code . The appeals were argued
together.

[Page 682]

The circumstances are as follows. Bolduc was a
physician and surgeon licensed to practice in the Province of British Columbia.
In the course of such practice he was treating the complainant Diana Elizabeth
Osborne for an erosion of the cervic uteri. During the course of treatment,
after necessary examinations, he had on several occasions cauterized the
affected parts. On a Saturday morning in the month of October or November 1965,
Mrs. Osborne attended Dr. Bolduc’s office for another examination and
treatment, if the latter were required.

The accused Bird was a professional musician in
a night club. He had been for some time a personal friend of the accused
Bolduc. He had obtained an honours degree in chemistry from the university and
he swore that “I was very seriously considering returning to university to go
to medical school”.

On Mrs. Osborne’s attendance at the office,
the receptionist prepared her for the examination and/or treatment and then
attended the accused Bolduc in his office to inform him that his patient was
ready. Present in the office with Bolduc was the accused Bird and upon noticing
that Bolduc was not alone the receptionist simply informed Bolduc that his
patient had been prepared and requested him to notify her when he was ready to
proceed. In a few moments the receptionist was recalled into the office and
Bolduc instructed her to get a white lab coat, such as commonly worn by
doctors, so that Bird might use the same stating to her that Bird was an
intelligent young man and that he intended to pass Bird off as a doctor or
medical intern, adding “this was a good way to learn the facts of life”. The
receptionist protested at what she considered such unethical conduct and
declined to bring the lab coat. Bolduc himself obtained the coat for Bird and
requested that the receptionist give her stethoscope to Bird. The receptionist
simply dropped the instrument in the office and returned to the examining room.

Bolduc and Bird then entered the room together.
Bird was wearing the white lab coat and had in his possession a stethoscope.
Bolduc introduced Bird to Mrs. Osborne as “Dr. Bird”, told
Mrs. Osborne that Bird was a medical intern who had not obtained practical
experience of this type of thing during his internship and asked if she would
mind if Dr. Bird were present during the examina-

[Page 683]

tion. Mrs. Osborne replied in the negative
because he was an intern, that she didn’t mind—“this is fine”.

I have above summarized the evidence of the
receptionist which was accepted by the learned trial judge.

The examination proceeded with Bolduc, the
physician, sitting on a stool at the end of the examining table. He then
proceeded to examine carefully and to touch Mrs. Osborne’s private parts,
and during the course of the treatment he inserted a speculum in the vaginal
canal. Throughout this, the accused Bird stood to one side of Bolduc about a
foot or eighteen inches away from him and Bolduc made comments as to the
patient’s treatment, progress, her condition, and also on the prevalence of
such condition amongst female patients. Bird simply answered by nods and did
not touch the patient at all. It is, of course, the question for decision
whether or not the conduct of Bolduc in the circumstances constituted the
offence of indecent assault.

Before the Court of Appeal and in this Court, it
was immediately admitted, and it could not be otherwise, that if Bolduc’s
conduct did amount to indecent assault Bird was also guilty under the
provisions of s. 21  of the Criminal Code  despite the fact that he
did not touch the patient at any time. Section 141(1)  of the Criminal Code  provides:

141. (1) Every one who indecently assaults
a female person is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for five years and to be whipped.

Section 230  of the Criminal Code  provides:

230. A person commits an assault when,
without the consent of another person or with consent, where it is obtained by
fraud,

(a) he applies force intentionally
to the person of the other, directly or indirectly, or

It is, of course, trite law that the force
applied may be of very slight degree, in fact, may be mere touching.

The courts below were concerned with the
provisions of s. 141(2)  of the Criminal Code  which provides:

(2) An accused who is charged with an
offence under subsection (1) may be convicted if the evidence establishes
that the accused did anything to the female person with her consent that, but
for her consent, would have been an indecent assault, if her consent was
obtained by false and fraudulent representations as to the nature and quality
of the act.

Much argument was directed in this Court to
whether the admittedly fraudulent and false representation made to
Mrs. Osborne was as to “the nature and character of the

[Page 684]

act” so that the consent would be vitiated by
the provisions of the said subsection.

I am of the opinion that this Court need not be
concerned directly with the provisions of s. 141(2) . Under s. 230 the
application of force, however slight, is an assault when it is “without the
consent of another person or with consent when it is obtained by fraud”. Let us
examine for a moment what was the consent obtained from Mrs. Osborne.
Surely upon the evidence to which I have referred above, it was a consent to
the examination by Bolduc of her private parts and the touching of them in the
course of treatment in the presence of a doctor, and not a mere medical student
or a mere layman who was in some vague fashion considering becoming a medical
student.

There was no evidence whatsoever that
Mrs. Osborne knew the accused Bird at all. The name Bird meant nothing to
her. She only gave this consent to such a serious invasion of her privacy on
the basis that Bird was a doctor intending to commence practice and who desired
practical experience in such matters as Bolduc was proposing to engage in. That
was the consent which Mrs. Osborne granted. The indecent assault upon her
was not the act to which she consented and therefore I am of the opinion that
the two accused were guilty under the provisions of s. 141(1)  when
considered with s. 230  and s. 21  of the Criminal Code  without
recourse to the provisions of s. 141(2) . This makes it unnecessary, in my
view, to consider the many authorities cited in the most able argument of
counsel for the accused and which dealt with the problem of the nature and
character of the act under the provisions of the latter subsection.

I would dismiss both appeals.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Dangerous driving—Whether
beyond inadvertent negligence—Whether miscarriage of justice—Criminal Code ,
1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss.
221(4), 592(1)(b)(iii).

The appellant was convicted, before a judge
and jury, of driving in a manner dangerous to the public, contrary to s. 221(4) 
of the Criminal Code . His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal
and he appealed to this Court on the ground that the jury was not properly
instructed. Two questions were raised before this Court: Whether, in

[Page 595]

order to convict under s. 221(4) , it was
necessary for the tribunal of fact to be satisfied that the conduct of the
accused went beyond inadvertent negligence and amounted to advertent negligence,
and secondly, whether the Court of Appeal erred in the circumstances in
applying the provisions of s. 592(1) (b)(iii) of the Code.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Taschereau
C.J. and Judson J.: The distinction between criminal negligence in the
operation of a motor vehicle and dangerous driving is that for the former what
must be shown is advertence or subjective foresight as to the consequences of
one’s conduct, and that for the latter all that must be shown is inadvertence
in the sense of failure to exercise the care that a reasonable person would
exercise in the circumstances. The jury’s task is to determine whether the
driving was in fact dangerous to the public having regard to all the
circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of such place and the
amount of traffic that at the time was or might reasonably be expected to be at
such place. By its very terms s. 221(4)  goes beyond the minimum of civil
negligence and the task of the jury is to consider the actual facts of the
driving in the light of the section. Applying the section to the facts of this
case, the appellant’s conduct brought him within the wording of the section.
There was no error in the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the instruction to
be given to a jury on a charge of dangerous driving under s. 221(4) of the
Code, and the Court of Appeal did not err in applying the provisions of s.
592(1) (b) (iii) of the Code.

Per Cartwright,
Ritchie and Spence JJ.: In Mann v. The Queen, [1966] S.C.R. 238, it was
decided that proof of inadvertent negligence is not sufficient to support a
conviction under s. 221(4) of the Code. In so deciding, the Court was
expressing a legal proposition which was a necessary step to the judgment
pronounced. That proposition should have been accepted by the Court of Appeal
under the principle of stare decisis. Under the circumstances the
instruction given by the trial judge was adequate. In any event, on
consideration of all the record, this was a proper case in which to apply the
provisions of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Code.

Droit criminel—Conduite dangereuse—Est-ce
au-delà de la négligence inattentive—Y a‑t-il eu erreur judiciaire—Code
criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 221(4), 592(1)(b)(iii).

L’appelant a été trouvé coupable par un jury
d’avoir conduit d’une façon dangereuse pour le public, contrairement à l’art.
221(4)  du Code criminel . Le verdict de culpabilité a été confirmé par la
Cour d’Appel et il en appela devant cette Cour pour le motif que les directives
au jury n’avaient pas été les bonnes. Deux questions ont été soulevées devant
cette Cour: A savoir si, en vue d’obtenir un verdict de culpabilité sous l’art.
221(4) , il est nécessaire que le tribunal des faits soit satisfait que la
conduite de l’accusé était au-delà de la négligence inattentive et équivalait à
la négligence intentionnelle, et deuxièmement, à savoir si la Cour d’Appel a
erré dans l’espèce en mettant en jeu les dispositions de l’art. 592(1)(b)(iii)
du Code.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté.

[Page 596]

Le Juge en
Chef Taschereau et le Juge Judson: La distinction entre la négligence
criminelle dans la mise en service d’un véhicule à moteur et la conduite
dangereuse est que dans le cas de la première ce qui doit être établi est une
préméditation intentionnelle ou subjective quant aux conséquences de l’acte, et
que dans le cas de la deuxième tout ce qui doit être établi est l’inattention
dans le sens d’un défaut d’exercer le soin qu’une personne raisonnable
exercerait dans les circonstances. La tâche du jury est de déterminer si la
conduite était en fait dangereuse pour le public, compte tenu de toutes les
circonstances, y compris la nature et l’état de cet endroit, l’utilisation qui
en est faite ainsi que l’intensité de la circulation alors constatable ou
raisonnablement prévisible à cet endroit. De par ses termes même, l’art. 221(4) 
va au-delà du minimum de la négligence civile et la tâche du jury est de
considérer les faits actuels de la conduite à la lumière de l’article.
Appliquant l’article aux faits de cette cause, la conduite de l’appelant l’a
placé dans son langage. Il n’y a eu aucune erreur dans le jugement de la Cour
d’Appel relativement aux directives données au jury sur l’accusation de
conduite dangereuse sous l’art. 221(4) du Code, et la Cour d’Appel n’a pas erré
en mettant en jeu les dispositions de l’art. 592(1)(b)(iii) du Code.

Les Juges Cartwright, Ritchie et Spence:
Dans la cause de Mann v. The Queen, [1966] R.C.S. 238, il a été décidé
que la preuve d’une négligence inattentive n’était pas suffisante pour supporter
un verdict de culpabilité sous l’art. 221(4) du Code. En décidant de cette
façon, la Cour a exprimé une proposition légale qui était un échelon nécessaire
au jugement prononcé. Cette proposition aurait dû être acceptée par la Cour
d’Appel en vertu du principe du stare decisis. Dans l’espèce, les
directives données au jury étaient adéquates. A tout événement, en considérant
tout le dossier, cette cause est une où il est à propos de mettre en jeu les
dispositions de l’art. 592(1) (b) (iii) du Code.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’Appel de
l’Ontario[1], confirmant un verdict de culpabilité à l’égard d’une charge de
conduite dangereuse. Appel rejeté.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario1, affirming a conviction for dangerous driving. Appeal
dismissed.

Robert J. Carter, for the appellant.

R.G. Thomas, for the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Judson J.
was delivered by

[Page 597] 

JUDSON J.:—In O’Grady v. Sparling[2], this Court decided that s. 55(1) of
the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 112, was within the provincial
legislative power. This section read:

55. (1) Every person who drives a motor
vehicle or a trolley bus on a highway without due care and attention or without
reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway is guilty of an
offence.

At that time the Criminal Code  dealt only
with criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle. What had been
formerly s. 285(6)  of the Criminal Code  as enacted by 1938, c. 44,
s. 16 , was omitted when the new Criminal Code  was enacted by 2-3
Eliz. II, c. 51. This dealt with dangerous driving. Dangerous driving was
reintroduced into the Code by 1960-61, c. 43, s. 3 , as s. 221(4) . It reads:

221. (4) Every one who drives a motor
vehicle on a street, road, highway or other public place in a manner that is
dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances including the
nature, condition and use of such place and the amount of traffic that at the
time is or might reasonably be expected to be on such place, is guilty of

(a) an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for two years, or

(b) an offence punishable on summary
conviction.

It differs from s. 285(6) of the old Code in
this respect: The old Code said “recklessly or in a manner which is dangerous
to the public”. The new Code drops “recklessly or” and says only “in a manner
which is dangerous to the public”. The new section may be referred to
conveniently as the “dangerous driving section”.

This was the charge against Horst Binus, the
appellant in this appeal. He was charged that he

on the 15th day of May, 1965 at the
Township of East Gwillimbury, in the County of York, did unlawfully drive a
motor vehicle bearing Ontario licence #385703, upon a road in a manner that is
dangerous to the public having regard to all the circumstances including the
nature, condition and use of such road and the amount of traffic that at the
time is or might reasonably be expected to be on such road, contrary to Section
221(4)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

He was convicted before a judge and jury. His
conviction was affirmed on appeal[3] and he
now appeals to this Court on the ground that the jury was not properly
instructed. He says that the jury must be told that they cannot convict

[Page 598]

of dangerous driving unless there is something
more than that minimum of negligence which may involve a driver in. liability
to pay damages. The submission has been put in a variety of ways: that the
conduct must be of such a nature that it can be considered a breach of duty to
the public and deserving of punishment, or that there should be distinguishing
marks of criminality or proof of a high degree of negligence and a moral
quality carried into the act. It is argued that this type of instruction must
be given because of the combined effect of O’Grady v. Sparling, supra, and
Mann v. The Queen[4]. In
Mann v. The Queen the point involved was whether the provincial Careless
Driving section, similar in effect to the one involved in O’Grady v.
Sparling, could stand after Parliament had introduced again to the Criminal
Code  the offence of “dangerous driving”. This Court held that it could.

All the obiter observations in O’Grady
v. Sparling and Mann v. The Queen have been collected in support of
this submission. If the submission is accepted it means the formalization of a
judge’s charge or self-instruction in these cases. First of all, he must start
with civil negligence, which involves liability if a driver departs from the
standard that may be expected of a reasonably competent driver. Then he must
say something more than is needed for dangerous driving and something more
still for criminal negligence, i.e., recklessness.

We are not concerned with criminal negligence in
the sense of recklessness here. Dangerous driving is an offence of lower
degree. The following passage is a summary of the reasons of the Court of
Appeal in this case:

To convict of dangerous driving under s.
221(4)  (enacted 1960-61, c. 43, s. 3) of the Criminal Code  no proof is
required of mens rea in the sense of either intention to jeopardize the
lives or safety of others or recklessness as to such consequences. It is
sufficient for the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
did not drive with the care that a prudent person would exercise in the circumstances
confronting him having regard to the nature, condition, and use of the place
where the accused was driving and the amount of traffic that was or might
reasonably have been expected to be in such place, and that the accused in
failing to exercise such care in fact endangered the lives or safety of others
whether or not harm resulted. Consideration of the ingredients of the offence
of dangerous driving for the purpose of determining legislative competence of a
provincial Legislature as opposed to Parliament is not controlling for the
purpose of the substantive

[Page 599]

criminal law. Although an examination of
the penalties provided by Parliament for criminally negligent driving, which
does involve mens rea in the sense of recklessness, on the one hand, and
for dangerous driving, on the other, suggests that Parliament envisaged these
two offences as shading into each other, it does not follow that Parliament
intended that dangerous driving involved mens rea and this conclusion is
supported by the language of s. 221(4)  which speaks of the objective factor of
driving in a manner dangerous to the public. The distinction between
criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle and dangerous driving
is that for the former what must be shown is advertence or subjective foresight
as to the consequences of one’s conduct, and that for the latter all that must
be shown is inadvertence in the sense of failure to exercise the care that a
reasonable person would exercise in the circumstances.

I think that this is the correct approach. The
fallacy in the appellant’s submission is this: He wants the Court to say that
unless it does as he suggests, he will be convicted of the crime of dangerous
driving for conduct which may amount to no more than civil negligence, or, to
put it another way, negligence which should involve only civil
consequences—compensation. This is not so. The section itself contains its own
definition. The jury’s task is to determine whether the driving was in fact
dangerous to the public having regard to all the circumstances, including the
nature, condition and use of such place and the amount of traffic that at the
time was or might reasonably be expected to be at such place. By its very terms
the section goes beyond the minimum of civil negligence and the task of the
jury is to consider the actual facts of the driving in the light of the
section. If this is done, there will be no conviction for negligence involving
only civil consequences. To this extent the section does involve a
consideration of the state of mind of the driver towards his task. A motor car
does not drive itself. It responds to the direction which it gets from the
driver within the limits of space and time available to him.

The application of the section to the facts of
this case gives no difficulty. This motorist was driving on a county road. He
came out of an “S” curve and saw ahead of him two boys on a bicycle 150 yards
away. There was no oncoming traffic. He struck the bicycle from the rear. His
defence was that the boys swerved ahead of him. There was evidence given by a
bystander that no such thing happened and that he drove straight into the boys
and did not apply his brakes or swerve until the moment of impact. The jury was
confronted with a very simple situation. What

[Page 600]

did this man do? What should he have done? Did
his conduct bring him within the wording of the section? It obviously did.

I would answer the points in issue in this
appeal generally by saying that there was no error in the judgment of the Court
of Appeal on the instruction to be given to a jury on a charge of dangerous
driving under s. 221(4)  of the Criminal Code  and that the Court of Appeal did
not err in applying the provisions of s. 592(1)  (b) (iii) of the Criminal
Code .

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Cartwright, Ritchie and Spence
JJ. was delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J.:—The facts out of which this
appeal arises and the grounds for the decision of the Court of Appeal[5] are summarized in the reasons of my brother
Judson.

This appeal raises two questions, (i) whether in
order to convict on a charge of dangerous driving under s. 221(4)  of the Criminal
Code  it is necessary for the tribunal of fact to be satisfied that the
conduct of the accused went beyond inadvertent negligence and amounted to advertent
negligence and (ii) whether the Court of Appeal, having reached the conclusion
that the charge of the learned trial Judge was not adequate, erred in the
circumstances of this case in applying the provisions of s. 592(1)  (b)
(iii) of the Criminal Code .

In stating the first question I am using the
terms “inadvertent negligence” and “advertent negligence” in the sense in which
they were employed by all members of this Court in O’Grady v. Sparling[6], adopting the phraseology used in
Kenny’s Outlines of Criminal Law, 17th ed., p. 34, and in Glanville Williams’
Criminal Law, 1953, p. 82.

If the matter were res integra I would
find the reasoning of my brother Judson and that of Laskin J.A. in the case at
bar most persuasive; but it appears to me that in Mann v. The Queen[7] at least five of the seven members
of this

[Page 601]

Court who heard the appeal decided that proof of
inadvertent negligence is not sufficient to support a conviction under s.
221(4)  and that in so deciding they were expressing a legal proposition which
was a necessary step to the judgment pronounced. I find it impossible to treat
what was said in this regard as obiter, and, in my respectful view, that
proposition should have been accepted by the Court of Appeal under the
principle of stare decisis. The binding effect of a proposition of law
enunciated as a necessary step to the judgment pronounced is not lessened by
the circumstance that the Court might have reached the same result for other
reasons.

I do not doubt the power of this Court to depart
from a previous judgment of its own but, where the earlier decision has not
been made per incuriam, and especially in cases in which Parliament or
the Legislature is free to alter the law on the point decided, I think that
such a departure should be made only for compelling reasons. The ancient
warning, repeated by Anglin C.J.C. in Daoust, Lalonde & Cie Ltée v.
Ferland[8], ubi
jus est aut vagum aut incertum, ibi maxima servitus prevalebit, should not
be forgotten.

Turning now to the second question, as to
whether the Court of Appeal erred in applying the provisions of s. 592(1) (b)
(iii) of the Code, I have reached the conclusion that they did not.

Following the charge of the learned trial Judge
to the jury, counsel for the appellant raised certain objections and after some
discussion the jury were recalled for further instructions as follows:

THE COURT: Gentlemen, I thought that
perhaps you might require a little more assistance than I gave you on this word
“dangerous” to be found in Section 221, subsection 4 of the Code.

As you recall, the section speaks of
driving in a manner that is dangerous to the public having regard to all the
circumstances including the nature and condition and use of such place and the
amount of traffic that at that time is or might reasonably be expected to be on
such place. Now, since the word is found in the Criminal Code and this is a
criminal prosecution it’s to be presumed that what we are talking about is
criminal conduct, something that is more than mere civil negligence; that is,
mere inattention from which civil liability might flow. You will in this
case, determine from the evidence the manner in which the accused was driving.
You will determine from the evidence the circumstances which existed at the
time he was driving in this fashion. And after considering the manner in which
he was driving determine whether or not that way he was

[Page 602]

driving is in your opinion dangerous to the
public. Evidence which shows mere failure to exercise reasonable care under
all the circumstances and perhaps resulting in civil liability is not
sufficient to support a conviction for dangerous driving. All right.

Counsel for the defence, rightly as I think,
expressed his satisfaction with this and stated he had no further comments.

Later the jury returned to ask a question. The
record at this point reads as follows:

CLERK OF THE COURT: Gentlemen of the Jury,
I understand you wish to ask the Court a question. Mr. Foreman, will you please
put your question to the Court?

FOREMAN OF THE JURY: Your Honour, I have
been requested to ask you to define for us “dangerous”. Could it be danger ous
without intent? Would you define it?

THE COURT: Yes, if you find on the facts
that the manner of driving was dangerous in your opinion you may disregard the
matter of intent. Does that answer your question?

FOREMAN OF THE JURY: Yes.

On the view of the meaning of s. 221(4) of the
Code which I have expressed above, I incline to think that the instruction
given by the learned trial Judge when the jury were re-called, and particularly
the passages which I have italicized, was adequate in the circumstances of this
case. Be that as it may, on consideration of all the record I agree with the
conclusion of Laskin J.A. that this was a proper case in which to apply the
provisions of s. 592(1)  (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code .

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Accessory—Possession of
house-breaking instruments—Actual physical possession in accused’s
confederates—Possession charge against confederates withdrawn—Effect on
accused’s conviction for possession—Whether s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code  can
support conviction or whether s. 3(4)  exhaustive—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.),
c. 51, ss. 3(4), 21(2), 292(1)(b), 295(1).

The appellant drove two companions to a house
and waited for them while they carried out the admitted common intention to
break and enter. The two companions were arrested as they came out of the house
and were found to have house-breaking instruments. The two companions pleaded
guilty to a charge of breaking and entering, and a second charge of possession
of the instruments was withdrawn. The appellant was acquitted of the charge of
breaking and entering and stealing on a directed verdict because the property
stolen could not be identified as being the property of the owner of the house.
However, he was convicted of possession of the instruments. The conviction was
affirmed by the Court of Appeal. He was granted leave to appeal to this Court
on the questions of law as to whether, in the circumstances, s. 21(2) of the
Code could support the appellant’s conviction or was the prosecution obliged to
rely on s. 3(4) of the Code as being exhaustive.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The Court of Appeal correctly rejected the
submission that, since his confederates were not convicted of the offence of possession,
the appellant could not be convicted of possession because the Crown could not
appeal to s. 21(2) of the Code and was obliged to rely solely upon s. 3(4).
Under s. 21(2), the appellant was a party to the commission of the offence of
possession of house-breaking instruments. The fact that the charge was
withdrawn against the two active principals did not affect the right of the
Crown to proceed against the appellant. There is no requirement in s. 21(2)
that the active participants must have been convicted of the offence. The
question is whether the appellant committed the offence of possession.
Furthermore, the acquittal on a directed verdict did not decide in his favour
any issue in the possession charge that would be inconsistent with the finding
on the evidence that the appellant had formed a common intention with two
others to effect a breaking and to assist in its prosecution. It was open to
the jury to find that the appellant knew or ought to have known that one of his
confederates at least would of necessity be in possession of house-breaking
instruments when the three men drove to the house.

The Court of Appeal was correct in
maintaining that s. 21(2) of the Code may be applied where the facts warrant
the inference that the accused ought to have known that the commission of the
offence—possession

[Page 716]

—would be the probable consequence of
carrying out the common purpose. The Crown was not limited to reliance on the
provisions of s. 3(4) of the Code.

L’appelant a conduit deux compagnons à une
maison et les a attendus pendant qu’ils mettaient en exécution l’intention
commune admise de s’introduire par effraction. Les deux compagnons ont été
appréhendés alors qu’ils sortaient de la maison et des instruments d’effraction
ont été trouvés sur eux. Les deux compagnons ont admis leur culpabilité à une
accusation d’effraction, et une seconde accusation de possession des
instruments a été retirée. L’appelant a été acquitté de l’accusation
d’effraction et d’avoir volé, sur les instructions du juge, parce que la
propriété volée ne pouvait pas être identifiée comme étant la propriété du
propriétaire de la maison. Cependant, il a été trouvé coupable de possession
des instruments d’effraction. Le verdict a été confirmé par la Cour d’Appel. Il
a obtenu la permission d’en appeler devant cette Cour sur les questions de
droit à savoir si, dans les circonstances, l’art. 21(2) du Code pouvait
supporter le verdict de culpabilité ou si la Couronne était obligée de
s’appuyer uniquement sur l’art. 3(4) du Code.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté.

La Cour d’Appel a rejeté avec raison la
prétention que, puisqu’il n’y avait pas eu un verdict de culpabilité contre ses
complices sur l’accusation de possession, l’appelant ne pouvait pas être trouvé
coupable de possession parce que la Couronne ne pouvait pas faire appel à
l’art. 21(2) du Code et était obligée de s’appuyer uniquement sur l’art. 3(4).
Sous l’art. 21(2) , l’appelant était une partie à l’infraction de possession
d’instruments d’effraction. Le fait que l’accusation avait été retirée contre
les deux parties principales n’affectait pas le droit de la Couronne de
procéder contre l’appelant. L’article 21(2)  n’exige nullement que les parties
principales doivent avoir été trouvées coupables de l’offense. La question est
de savoir si l’appelant a commis l’offense de possession. Bien plus,
l’acquittement, en raison des instructions du juge, n’a pas eu pour effet de
décider en sa faveur aucune question sur l’accusation de possession qui
pourrait être incompatible avec la conclusion basée sur la preuve que
l’appelant avait formé une intention commune avec les deux autres pour s’introduire
par effraction et pour aider à la mise en vigueur de cette intention. Le jury
pouvait trouver que l’appelant savait ou aurait dû savoir qu’au moins un de ses
complices aurait nécessairement en sa possession des instruments d’effraction
lorsque les trois hommes se sont dirigés vers la maison.

La Cour d’Appel a eu raison de soutenir que
l’art. 21(2) du Code peut trouver son application lorsque les faits justifient
une inférence que l’accusé devait savoir que la commission de
l’offense—possession—serait la conséquence probable de la mise en exécution du
but commun. La Couronne n’était pas limitée aux seules dispositions de l’art.
3(4) du Code.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’Appel de
l’Ontario1, confirmant un verdict de culpabilité. Appel rejeté.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario1, affirming the appellant’s conviction. Appeal
dismissed.

Stanton Hogg, for the appellant.

D.A. McKenzie, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

JUDSON J.:—The appellant, Bruno Zanini, was
convicted under s. 295(1)  of the Criminal Code  on a charge of unlawful
possession of housebreaking instruments. The Court of Appeal[1] dismissed the appeal. This Court granted
leave to appeal on two questions of law:

(a) whether the provisions of section 21(2) 
can support the conviction of the appellant when there was no conviction of his
confederates for the very offence and no conviction of the accused for breaking
and entering and

(b) even if these circumstances do not
affect the application of section 21(2)  can that provision, in any event, be
invoked for a possession offence or is the prosecution obliged to rely on
section 3(4) as being exhaustive for that purpose.

The facts are that on December 20, 1963, the
appellant drove a car to 780 Spadina Road, Toronto. He had with him two passengers,
Bailey and Hudson. Bailey and Hudson left the car, entered a house at 780 Spadina Road by forcing the back door
with a screwdriver. The police arrested them as they came out of the back door
and found a screwdriver and a flashlight on one of the men.

Zanini was waiting for the men with the engine
of the car running. He denied knowledge of the two other men. The car belonged
to one of these men, and the police a week or ten days before had observed the three
men driving in the vicinity of the house and observing the house.

All three were charged under s. 292(1) (b)
with breaking and entering and stealing four fifty‑cent pieces, the
property of the owner of the house, one Dr. Arnold Iscove, and they were also
charged under s. 295(1)  with possession of

[Page 718]

housebreaking instruments. Bailey and Hudson
pleaded guilty to the charge of breaking and entering. The charge against them
of possession was withdrawn.

Zanini pleaded not guilty to both charges. He
was acquitted of the charge of breaking and entering and stealing on a directed
verdict, since the four fifty-cent coins could not be identified as being the
property of Dr. Iscove.

On the charge of possession of housebreaking
instruments, he was found guilty. The learned trial judge instructed the jury
that if they found that the appellant had formed a common intention with the
other two men to effect an unlawful purpose, that is to say, break into the
house, then they could find that he knew or ought to have known that as a
result of such common intention he knew or ought to have known that the other
men were in possession of instruments of housebreaking and therefore under s.
21  of the Criminal Code , the jury could find that the appellant was in
possession of a screwdriver found on one of the men who entered the house.

Zanini now submits that, since his confederates
were not convicted of the offence of possession, he could not be convicted of
possession because the Crown could not appeal to s. 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code  and was obliged to rely solely upon s. 3(4) . Section 21(2)  reads:

Where two or more persons form an intention
in common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein and
any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an offence, each
of them who knew or ought to have known that the commission of the offence
would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose is a party
to that offence.

Section 3(4) reads:

For the purposes of this Act,

(a) a person has anything in
possession when he has it in his personal possession or knowingly

(i) has it in the actual possession or
custody of another person, or 

(ii) has it in any place, whether or not
that place belongs to or is occupied by him, for the use or benefit of himself
or of another person; and

(b) where one of two or more
persons, with the knowledge and consent of the rest, has anything in his
custody or possession, it shall be deemed to be in the custody and possession
of each and all of them.

The Court of Appeal correctly rejected this
submission. Under s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code , Zanini was a party

[Page 719]

to the commission of the offence of possession
of housebreaking instruments. The judge’s instruction to the jury given
pursuant to s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code  was correct. The fact that the
charge was withdrawn against the two active principals does not affect the
right of the Crown to proceed against this accused. There is no requirement in
s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code  that the active participant or
participants must have been convicted of the offence. The question is whether
Zanini committed the offence, i.e. the possession of instruments for
housebreaking. It cannot be disputed that one of the two confederates was in
fact in possession of instruments for housebreaking. In addition, it was
established (and all the facts were agreed upon for the purpose of this appeal
and in the Court of Appeal) that the appellant had formed an intention in
common with the other two men to break and enter and assist each other for this
purpose. There is no principle of law that unless there is a conviction of the
confederates for the possession offence, the appellant cannot be convicted for
that offence.

On the second question of law on which leave to
appeal was given, in my opinion the Court of Appeal was correct in maintaining
that s. 21(2) of the Code may be applied where the facts warrant the inference
that the accused ought to have known that the commission of the offence, i.e.,
possession of housebreaking instruments would be the probable consequence of
carrying out the common purpose. The Crown is not limited to reliance on the
provisions of s. 3(4) of the Code above quoted. The very point was decided by
the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in Rex v. Harris[2]. The
Ontario Court of Appeal in this case followed the reasoning of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal, correctly in my opinion.

I now return to the second branch of the first
point of law that s. 21(2)  cannot support the conviction for the possession
offence when there was no conviction of the appellant for breaking and
entering. I have already said that the acquittal on the charge of breaking and
entering and stealing four 50-cent pieces, the property of Arnold Iscove, was
the result of a directed verdict because the owner of the premises entered
could not identify the coins.

This acquittal does not decide in favour of the
accused any issue in the possession charge that would be inconsist-

[Page 720]

ent with the finding on the evidence that the
accused had formed a common intention with two others to effect a break-in and
to assist in its prosecution. The accused cannot assert that the effect of the
acquittal on this directed verdict is equivalent to a determination in his
favour that he was not there or that he had no connection with the two active
participants and nothing less than this would assist him.

Notwithstanding the directed acquittal on
breaking and entering, it is clear on the evidence and the admissions that the
accused had formed an intention in common with the other two men to break and
enter the house. The possession of housebreaking instruments was a probable
consequence of the carrying out of the common purpose. The screwdriver was in
fact used to break in by the back door. It was open to the jury to find that
the accused knew or ought to have known that one of his confederates at least
would of necessity be in possession of housebreaking instruments when the three
men drove to the house. There is no “issue estoppel” here on any of these
points.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS

Criminal law—Robbery—Plea of
guilty—Habeas corpus—Warrant of committal.

The applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of robbery. Some
three years later he applied to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time
for leave to appeal in writing against his conviction, and when this
application was refused he applied again to the Court of Appeal for an
extension of time for leave to appeal in writing against his sentence. That
application was also refused. The grounds brought forward by the applicant were
that he had been improperly induced by fraud and threats to elect trial by the
Magistrate and to plead guilty. He then applied to this Court for a writ of
habeas corpus.

Held: The application should be dismissed.

The writ of habeas corpus could not be granted as the warrant
of committal showed that the applicant was confined in execution of a legal
sentence, imposed by a Court having jurisdiction, after conviction and that the
sentence had not expired.

Even if he had sought leave to appeal to this Court, this
relief could not have been granted. This Court has no jurisdiction as regards a
sentence; and as regards the conviction there was no dissenting judgment in the
Court of Appeal and his grounds before that Court did not include any ground of
law in the strict sense.

As no relief could be afforded to him by this Court nothing
could have been gained by adjourning the matter to enable him to make the
necessary arrangements to be brought before this Court as he had requested in a
letter addressed to the Registrar.

[Page 357]

Droit criminel—Vol—Plaidoirie
de culpabilité—Habeas corpus—Mandat de dépôt.

Le requérant a plaidé coupable à une
accusation de vol. Quelques trois ans plus tard il demanda à la Cour d'Appel
une prorogation du délai pour obtenir permission d'appeler par écrit à
I'encontre du verdict de culpabilité, et lorsque cette demande fut refusée il
demanda à la Cour d'Appel une prorogation du délai pour obtenir une permission
d'appeler par écrit à I'encontre de sa sentence. Cette demande fut aussi refusée.
Les motifs d'appel soulevés par le requérant étaient à l'effet qu'il avait été
improprement induit par fraude et menaces à choisir un procès devant le
Magistrat et à plaider coupable. Il demanda alors à cette Cour l'émission d'un
bref d'habeas corpus.

Arrêt: Cette
demande doit être rejetée.

Le bref d'habeas corpus ne peut pas être
accordé vu que le mandat de dépôt démontre que le requérant était détenu en
exécution d'une sentence légale, imposée par une Cour ayant juridiction, après
une déclaration de culpabilité et que la sentence n'était pas expirée.

Même s'il avait demandé permission d'appeler
à cette Cour, ce recours n'aurait pas pu lui être accordé. Cette Cour n'a pas
juridiction relativement à une sentence; et quant à la déclaration de
culpabilité le jugement de la Cour d'Appel ne comportait aucune dissidence et
ses motifs d'appel devant elle ne comprenaient aucun motif de droit dans le
sens strict.

Puisque aucun recours ne pouvait lui être
accordé par cette Cour, il n'y avait pas lieu d'ajourner la cause pour lui
permettre de conclure les arrangements nécessaires pour être amené devant cette
Cour ainsi qu'il l'avait demandé dans une lettre adressée au Registraire.

APPLICATION for a writ of
habeas corpus referred to the Court by the Rota Judge. Application dismissed.

No one appearing for the
applicant.

C. M. Powell, for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J.:—By notice in
writing, dated February 5, 1965, Robert Terry Morrison, hereinafter referred to
as 'the applicant"", applied to this Court for a writ of habeas corpus and
certiorari. The application was referred to the Court by the Rota Judge.

It appears from the certified
copy of the warrant of committal which accompanied the application that the 

[Page 358]

applicant was convicted in the County of York before
the late Magistrate F. W. Bartrem on February 17, 1961, upon a charge of
robbery and that on February 27, 1961, he was sentenced to be imprisoned in the
penitentiary for the term of fifteen years. Pursuant to that warrant of
committal he is now confined in the penitentiary in British Columbia.

At the request of the Court
counsel for the Attorney General for Ontario has furnished us with a copy of
the record of the proceedings in regard to the above charge in the Court of
Appeal for Ontario.

From this it appears that the
applicant pleaded guilty to the charge of robbery, that in August 1964 he
applied to the Court of Appeal for Ontario for an extension of time for leave
to appeal in writing against his conviction, that on October 20, 1964, that
application was refused, that thereafter, in November 1964, he applied to the
Court of Appeal for Ontario for an extension of time for leave to appeal in
writing against his sentence and that on December 1, 1964, that application was
refused.

The grounds put forward by the
applicant in writing in the Court of Appeal were that he was improperly induced
by fraud and threats to elect trial by the Magistrate and to plead guilty.

It is clear from the record that
a writ of habeas corpus cannot be granted as the warrant of committal shews
that the applicant is confined in execution of a legal sentence, imposed by a
court having jurisdiction, after conviction for the offence of robbery and that
the sentence has not expired.

Even if the applicant had sought
leave to appeal to this Court from either of the orders of the Court of Appeal
it is clear that no relief could have been granted to him. The jurisdiction of
this Court in criminal matters is strictly limited. As regards the sentence
this Court has no jurisdiction; as regards the conviction there was no
dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal and the grounds on which in that Court
the applicant sought to question his conviction did not include any ground of
law in the strict sense. In such circumstances this Court has no jurisdiction.
Mention has been made in these reasons only of the conviction on the charge of
robbery; the applicant at the same time as he pleaded guilty to that charge
also pleaded guilty 

[Page 359]

to other charges but the
sentences imposed in regard thereto were made concurrent with that on the
charge of robbery.

By a letter addressed to the
Registrar of the Court the applicant stated that he wished to appear before the
Court in person on this application. As the material, including the statements
of the applicant, makes it clear that no relief could be afforded to him by
this Court nothing would be gained by adjourning the matter to enable him to
make the necessary arrangements to be brought before the Court.

The application for a writ of
habeas corpus and certiorari is dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Indians—Hunting for food on Reserve out of
season—Treaty rights—Whether exempt from provisions of the Migratory Birds
Convention Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 179—Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149, s. 87.

The respondent, an Indian, shot two migratory
wild ducks on a Reserve at a time not during the open season for such birds.
They were to be used for food and were not to be sold. He was acquitted at
trial on a charge of unlawfully hunting laid pursuant to s. 12(1) of the

[Page 268]

Migratory Birds Convention Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 179, on the ground that the Act did not apply to
him. On appeal by the Crown to the Supreme Court of Ontario, the dismissal of
the charge was affirmed and a further appeal to the Court of Appeal was
dismissed by a majority judgment. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this
Court.

Held (Cartwright
J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and a verdict of guilty should be
entered.

Per Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: The object and intent of
s. 87 of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149, is to make Indians,
who are under the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of Parliament by virtue of
s. 91(24) of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, subject to provincial laws of general
application.

Section 87 was not intended to be a
declaration of the paramountcy of treaties over federal legislation. The
reference to treaties was incorporated in a section the purpose of which was to
make provincial laws applicable to Indians, so as to preclude any interference
with rights under treaties resulting from the impact of provincial legislation.
The provisions of s. 87 do not prevent the application to Indians of the Migratory
Birds Convention Act. There was no valid distinction between the present
case and that of Sikyea v. The Queen, [1964] S.C.R. 642, which should be
followed.

Per Cartwright
J., dissenting: The Treaty of 1827 was a treaty within the meaning of
that word as used in s. 87  of the Indian Act . That Treaty assured to the
Indians the right to hunt and fish on the Reserve. That right has not been
effectively destroyed by the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the
Migratory Birds Regulations so far as wild ducks are concerned. The Migratory
Birds Convention Act is a law of general application in force in Ontario and applicable to the respondent,
but by s. 87  its application to him is made subject to the terms of the Treaty
of 1827. Section 87  of the Indian Act  shows that Parliament was careful
to preserve the rights solemnly assured to the Indians by the Treaty of 1827.
Section 87  makes the Indians subject to the laws of general application in
force in the province in which they reside but at the same time it preserves
inviolate to the Indians whatever rights they have under the terms of any
treaty so that in a case of conflict between the provisions of the laws and the
terms of the treaty the latter shall prevail. The question as to whether the
right assured by the Treaty of 1827 has been destroyed by the Migratory
Birds Convention Act has not been decided in favour of the Crown by the
decision of this Court in Sikyea v. The Queen, supra.

la Couronne à la Cour suprême de l’Ontario, le renvoi de l’acte d’accusation
fut confirmé et un appel subséquent à la Cour d’Appel fut rejeté par un jugement
majoritaire. La Couronne a obtenu permission d’appeler devant cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être maintenu et une déclaration de culpabilité doit être enregistrée, le
Juge Cartwright étant dissident.

Les Juges
Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie et Hall: L’article 87 de la Loi
sur les Indiens, S.R.C. 1952, c. 149, a pour objet et but d’assujettir aux
lois provinciales d’application générale les Indiens qui tombent sous la
juridiction législative exclusive du Parlement en vertu de l’art. 91(24)  de l’Acte
de l’Amérique du Nord britannique, 1867 .

Ce n’était pas le but de l’art. 87 de
déclarer la prééminence des traités sur la législation fédérale. La référence
aux traités a été incorporée dans un article dont le but était de rendre les
lois provinciales applicables aux Indiens, pour empêcher toute interférence
avec les droits donnés par traités résultant d’une collision avec la
législation provinciale. Les dispositions de l’art. 87 n’empêchent pas
l’application aux Indiens de la Loi sur la Convention concernant les oiseaux
migrateurs. On ne peut faire aucune distinction valide entre le cas présent
et celui de Sikyea v. The Queen, [1964] S.C.R. 642, qui doit être suivi.

Le Juge
Cartwright, dissident: Le Traité de 1827 était un traité dans le sens de
ce mot tel qu’employé dans l’art. 87  de la Loi sur les Indiens . Ce
Traité assurait aux Indiens le droit de chasser et de faire la pêche dans la
Réserve. Ce droit n’a pas été effectivement détruit par la Loi sur la
Convention concernant les oiseaux migrateurs et les règlements concernant
les oiseaux migrateurs en autant que les canards sauvages sont concernés. La Loi
sur la Convention concernant les oiseaux migrateurs est une loi
d’application générale en vigueur dans l’Ontario et applicable à l’intimé, mais
par le jeu de l’art. 87  l’application de cette loi à l’intimé est sujette aux
dispositions du Traité de 1827. L’art. 87  de la Loi sur les Indiens  démontre
que le Parlement a pris soin de conserver les droits assurés solennellement aux
Indiens par le Traité de 1827. L’art. 87  rend les Indiens sujets aux lois
d’application générale en vigueur dans la province où ils résident, mais en
même temps l’article conserve inviolés aux Indiens tous les droits qu’ils ont
en vertu des dispositions de tout traité, de telle sorte qu’en cas de conflit
entre la loi et le traité, ce dernier aura préséance. La question de savoir si
le droit assuré par le Traité de 1827 a été détruit par la Loi sur la
Convention concernant les oiseaux migrateurs n’a pas été décidée en faveur
de la Couronne par la décision de cette Cour dans Sikyea v. The Queen,
supra.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario1, dismissing an appeal by the Crown. Appeal allowed,
Cartwright J. dissenting.

D.H. Christie, Q.C., for the appellant.

B.J. MacKinnon, Q.C., and Hugh D.
Garrett, Q.C., for the respondent.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—This appeal
is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario1 dismissing an appeal from an order of
McRuer C.J.H.C. which dismissed an appeal from an order of Magistrate Dunlap
acquitting the respondent on a charge that he did on the 5th day of September
1962, at Kettle Point Indian Reserve unlawfully hunt a migratory bird at a time
not during the open season specified for that bird in violation of s. 5(1) (a)
of the Migratory Bird Regulations thereby committing an offence contrary to s.
12(1) of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 179. Gibson
J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal.

There is no dispute as to the facts. The
respondent is an Indian within the meaning of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952,
c. 149. He is a member of the Chippewa Band residing on the Kettle Point
Reserve. On the date stated in the charge he shot two ducks, which were
migratory birds, as defined in the Migratory Birds Convention Act and
the Regulations made thereunder, in an area described in Schedule A of the
Regulations at a time not during the open season for such birds. The ducks were
to be used for food and were not to be sold.

On these facts it would appear that the
respondent was guilty of the offence charged unless, because he is an Indian
and shot the ducks for food on the reserve on which he resided, he is exempt
from the provisions of the Migratory Birds Convention Act and Migratory
Bird Regulations under which he was charged.

The learned Magistrate was of opinion that s. 87 
of the Indian Act  made laws of general application applicable to
Indians, subject to the terms of any treaty, that the Migratory Birds
Convention Act was such a law, that the treaty of July 10, 1827, with the
Chippewa Indians to be referred to hereafter reserved to them the right to hunt
at any time on the lands reserved in that treaty and, conse-

[Page 271]

quently, that the Migratory Birds Convention
Act did not apply to the respondent.

McRuer C.J.H.C. agreed with the view of the
learned Magistrate and was further of opinion that the right of the respondent
to hunt for food on Kettle Point Reserve was preserved not only by the treaty
of 1827 but also by the proclamation of 1763 and that if it is within the power
of Parliament to abrogate that right, a point which the learned Chief Justice
left open, that power could be exercised only by legislation expressly and
directly extinguishing the right and that it certainly could not be
extinguished by order-in-council.

After discussing the case of Dominion of
Canada v. Province of Ontario[2], the
learned Chief Justice said:

This case clearly recognizes that the
‘overlying Indian interest’ in the lands reserved to the Indians is not
something to be disposed of by any general Act of Parliament applicable to all
citizens.

He also said:

I wish to make it quite clear that I am not
called upon to decide, nor do I decide, whether the Parliament of Canada by
legislation specifically applicable to Indians could take away their rights to
hunt for food on the Kettle Point Reserve. There is much to support an argument
that Parliament does not have such power. There may be cases where such
legislation, properly framed, might be considered necessary in the public
interest but a very strong case would have to be made out that would not be a
breach of our national honour.

The judgment of the majority in the Court of
Appeal was delivered by Roach J.A., with whom McLennan J.A. agreed. The learned
Justice of Appeal construed the treaty of 1827, in the light of its historical
background including the terms of the Proclamation of 1763, as preserving and
confirming to the Indians their right to the use of the lands reserved
including those in the Kettle Point Reserve as their “Hunting Grounds”. He held
that the Migratory Birds Convention Act is a law of general application
in force in the Province within the meaning of s. 87  of the Indian Act  so
that its application to the respondent is subject to the terms of the treaty.
The reasons of Roach J.A. conclude as follows:

The treaty does not refer to the
Proclamation in terms but historical implication impels the conclusion that
what was surrendered and conveyed to the Crown by the treaty were the rights
granted to them by the Proclamation to and in respect of the lands described in
the treaty as

[Page 272]

being intended to be thereby conveyed. What
was preserved and confirmed to them were those same rights to and in respect of
the lands reserved by the treaty and without any time limitation thereon.

Since the Migratory Birds Convention Act
is subject to the treaty and since the treaty preserved and confirmed to
the Indians the use of lands, including those in the Kettle Point
Reserve, as their ‘Hunting Grounds’, giving to those words their wide
historical significance, it follows that an Indian while hunting on those lands
for food is not subject to the restrictions or prohibitions contained in that
Act or the regulations.

The essential difference of opinion between
Gibson J.A. and the majority was as to the construction of the treaty of 1827.
As to this, after quoting s. 87  of the Indian Act , Gibson J.A. says:

On behalf of the accused it is argued that
the Treaty of 1827 reserved to the Indians the land of the reserve for their
‘exclusive use and enjoyment’, and that by implication that included the
perpetual right to fish and hunt on the lands. As I have stated before, nothing
contained in the Treaty indicates that questions of hunting and fishing were
ever dealt with or considered when the Treaty was entered into.

With the greatest respect to Gibson J.A. I am
unable to accept this view. For the reasons given by Roach J.A. I agree with
his interpretation of the terms of the treaty. I find it impossible to suppose
that any of the signatories to the treaty would have understood that what was reserved
to the Indians and their posterity was the right merely to occupy the reserved
lands and not the right to hunt and fish thereon which they had enjoyed from
time immemorial.

The question to be decided is whether the right
to hunt on the reserve assured by the treaty to the band of which the
respondent is a member has been effectively destroyed by the Migratory Birds
Convention Act and the Migratory Bird Regulations so far as wild
ducks are concerned.

Counsel for the appellants submits that this
question should be answered in the affirmative on three main grounds, (i) that
the point has been decided in favour of the appellant by the decision of this
Court in Sikyea v. The Queen[3], (ii)
that the words “laws of general application from time to time in force in any
province” in s. 87  of the Indian Act  mean provincial laws and not
federal laws and (iii) that the treaty of July 10, 1827, did not reserve to the
Indians the right to hunt and fish on the reserve. I will deal with these three
grounds in reverse order.

[Page 273]

As to the third ground, counsel for the
appellant concedes that the document of July 10, 1827, is a treaty within the
meaning of that word as used in s. 87  of the Indian Act . I think he was
clearly right in making this concession. In my opinion it is the very sort of
treaty contemplated by the section. On the question of the true construction of
the treaty I have already indicated my agreement with the reasons and
conclusion of Roach J.A. on this branch of the matter. It follows that I would
reject this ground of appeal.

As to the second ground, s. 87  of the Indian
Act  reads as follows:

87. Subject to the terms of any treaty and
any other Act of Parliament of Canada, all laws of general application from
time to time in force in any province are applicable to and in respect of
Indians in the province, except to the extent that such laws are inconsistent
with this Act or any order, rule, regulation or by-law made thereunder, and
except to the extent that such laws make provision for any matter for which
provision is made by or under this Act.

The laws of general application in force in the Province of Ontario
are made up of the common law, pre-confederation statutes which have not been
repealed, Acts of Parliament and Acts of the Legislature. I can find nothing in
the words of the section to permit the meaning of the phrase “laws of general
application from time to time in force in any province” being restricted to
provincial statutes or to laws in relation to matters coming within the classes
of subjects assigned to the Legislature by s. 92 of the British North
America Act. To determine whether any particular law is applicable to an
Indian in Ontario only two
questions need be answered, (i) is it a law of general application? and (ii) is
it in force in the Province? If the answer to both of these questions is in the
affirmative the source of the law is of no importance. In my opinion the Migratory
Birds Convention Act is a law of general application in force in Ontario and applicable to the respondent
but by s. 87  its application to him is made subject to the terms of the treaty
of July 10, 1827. I would reject this ground of appeal.

The first ground presents more difficulty. In Sikyea’s
case, the judgment of Sissons J. acquitting Sikyea after a trial de novo
was pronounced on November 1, 1962, and written reasons for that judgment were delivered on November
8, 1962. The unanimous judgment of the Court of

[Page 274]

Appeal of the Northwest
 Territories was delivered on January 24, 1964. The reasons of the Court were
written by Johnson J.A. The unanimous judgment of this Court upholding that of
the Court of Appeal was delivered on October 6, 1964.

In the case at bar the judgment of McRuer
C.J.H.C. was delivered on May 29, 1963. The learned Chief Justice referred to the judgment of Sissons J.,
which had not then been reversed, as follows:

In Reg. v. Sikyea, 40 W.W.R. 494,
Sissons J.T.C. held that the Migratory Birds Convention Act did not
apply to Indians hunting for food in the Northwest
 Territories. At page 504 he said:

There are no express words or necessary
intendment or implication in the Migratory Birds Convention Act, abrogating,
abridging, or infringing upon the hunting rights of the Indians.

With this I agree but I would go further.
Since the Proclamation of 1763 has the force of a statute, I am satisfied that
whatever power the Parliament of Canada may have to interfere with the treaty
rights of the Indians, the rights conferred on them by the Proclamation cannot
in any case be abrogated, abridged or infringed upon by an order‑in‑council
passed under the Migratory Birds Convention Act.

The appeal to the Court of Appeal in the case at
bar was argued on October 15, 1963, prior to the delivery of judgment by the
Court of Appeal in Sikyea’s case, but judgment was not delivered until
June 24, 1964. The reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal contain no
reference to the judgments in Sikyea’s case.

In order to ascertain whether the question to be
decided in the case at bar has been determined in Sikyea’s case it is
necessary to examine the reasons delivered in that case in some detail but
before doing so it will be convenient to state in summary form the grounds on
which Mr. Mackinnon submits that the cases are distinguishable. These are, (i)
In Sikyea the question was as to the right of Indians to hunt on lands
which they had surrendered while in the present case it is as to their right to
hunt on lands which they reserved and have never surrendered, (ii) In Sikyea
the treaty in question was entered into four years after the Migratory
Birds Convention Act came into force while that in the present case was
almost one hundred years earlier, and (iii) the reasons in Sikyea give
no consideration to the effect of s. 87  of the Indian Act  which in
the

[Page 275]

present case was held by the Court of Appeal to
be decisive. It is to the last of these three grounds of distinction that Mr.
Mackinnon attaches particular importance.

Sissons J. in the course of his reasons reviewed
the legislation which he regarded as applicable. He said in part:

By Sections 1 and 2 of Chapter 20 of the
Statutes of Canada, 1960, assented to 9th June, 1960 the Northwest
Territories Act  was amended to provide that Ordinances by the Commissioner
in Council in relation to the preservation of game in the Territories are
applicable to and in respect of Indians and Eskimos; that this should not be
construed as authorizing the Commissioner in Council to make Ordinances
restricting or prohibiting Indians or Eskimos from hunting for food, on unoccupied
Crown lands, other than game declared by the Governor in Council to be game in
danger of becoming extinct, that from the day on which this Act comes into
force the provisions of the various game ordinances including Chapter 42 R.O.
1956 and Chapter 2 of the Ordinances of 1960, Second Session, have the same
force and effect in relations to Indians and Eskimos as if on that day they had
been re-enacted in the same terms; that all laws of general application in
force in the Territories are, except where otherwise provided, applicable to
and in respect of Eskimos in the Territories.

Section 1(3) of Chapter 20 reads as
follows:

1(3) Nothing in Subsection (2) shall be
construed as authorizing the Commissioner in Council to make Ordinances
restricting or prohibiting Indians or Eskimos from hunting for food, on
unoccupied Crown lands, game other than game declared by the Governor in
Council to be game in danger of becoming extinct.

The following Order in Council, P.C.
1960-1256, was passed the 14th day of September, 1960:

His Excellency the Governor General in
Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Northern Affairs and National
Resources, pursuant to subsection (3)  of Section 14  of the Northwest
Territories Act , is pleased hereby to declare musk-ox, barren-ground
caribou and polar bear as game in danger of becoming extinct.

It is only necessary for the Governor in
Council to ‘declare’ that game is in danger of becoming extinct. This may be
fact or fiction, and may well be fiction.

There is here a recognition and a
preservation by Parliament of the hunting rights of Indians and Eskimos,
unrestricted except as to game in danger of becoming extinct. There is no
mention of the Migratory Birds Convention Act or migratory birds.

This has the effect of nullifying any
application of the Migratory Birds Convention Act to Indians and
Eskimos.

Section 2 of Chapter 20 reads:

17(2) All laws of general application in
force in the Territories, are, except where otherwise provided applicable to
and in respect of Eskimos in the Territories.

It is ‘otherwise provided’, so far as
Indians are concerned, by Section 87  of the Indian Act .

87. Subject to the terms of any treaty and
any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, all laws of general application from
time to

[Page 276]

time in force in any province are
applicable to and in respect of Indians in the province.

I dealt with these amendments to the Northwest
Territories Act  in the case of Re Noah Estate, (1961) 36 W.W.R. 577:

The learned Judge does not make any other
reference to s. 87  of the Indian Act  and does not appear to found his
judgment on its terms. The true ratio of his decision is found later in the
following passage with which his reasons conclude:

The real defence and the important issue in
this case is that the Migratory Birds Convention Act has no application
to Indians engaged in the pursuit of their ancient right to hunt, trap and fish
game and fish for food at all seasons of the year, on all unoccupied Crown
lands.

Reference was made to the Royal
Proclamation of October 7, 1763, cited in the Revised Statutes of Canada, Vol.
VI, 6127, as the first of Canada’s Constitutional Acts and Documents, and
commonly spoken of as the Charter of Indian Rights; and to Treaty No. 11,
made and concluded in 1921 between His Most Gracious Majesty George V, and the
Slave, Dogrib, Loucheux, Hare and other Indians, inhabitants of the Territory;
and to Rex v. Wesley, (1932) 58 C.C.C. 269, Regina v. Kogogoluk (1959)
28 WWR 376 and other cases.

Indians still have their ancient hunting
rights unless, adopting the words used by the Honourable Mr. Justice Gwynne of
the Supreme Court of Canada, in the Ontario Mining Company v. Seybold, (1902)
32 S.C.R. 1, ‘unless the proclamation of 1763 and the pledge of the Crown
therein are considered now to be a dead letter; and unless the grave and solemn
proceedings which ever since the issue of the proclamation until the present
time have been pursued in practice upon the Crown entering into treaties with
the Indians are to be regarded now as a delusive mockery’.

The solemn proceedings surrounding Treaty
No. 11 and the pledge given by the Crown and incorporated in the Treaty would
indeed be delusive mockeries and deceitful in the highest degree if the Migratory
Bird Convention, made just five years previously, had curtailed the hunting
rights of the Indians.

There are no express words or necessary
intendment or implication in the Migratory Birds Convention Act abrogating,
abridging, or infringing upon the hunting rights of the Indians.

The various references in the Convention
and in the Migratory Birds Convention Act and in the Regulations to
Indians and Eskimos and their hunting rights indicate recognition of these
hunting rights.

The fact that Indians and Eskimos are
particularly entitled to take certain migratory game birds and migratory
nongame birds does not indicate an intention to abrogate, abridge or infringe
the hunting rights of these Indians and Eskimos.

I find that the Migratory Birds
Convention Act has no application to Indians hunting for food, and does not
curtail their hunting rights.

I find the accused Not Guilty. The Appeal
is allowed.

On a consideration of the whole of the reasons
of the learned Judge it appears to me that the ground of his decision is that
the general words of the Migratory Birds

[Page 277]

Convention Act and
Regulations should not be construed to take away the special rights to
hunt enjoyed by the Indians from time immemorial and assured to them by the
Proclamation of 1763 and by treaty. He does not say that the provisions of the Migratory
Birds Convention Act and Regulations are, by force of s. 87  of the Indian
Act , in respect of Indians made subject to the terms of any treaty. In
other words, the learned Judge did not find it necessary to deal with the
argument based on s. 87  which was addressed to us in the case at bar.

In the Court of Appeal Johnson J.A. makes no
reference to s. 87 . He differs from Sissons J. as to the true construction of
the Migratory Birds Convention Act. He says:

Sissons J. in his reasons for judgment
says:

There are no express words or necessary
intendment or implication in the Migratory Birds Convention Act abrogating,
abridging or infringing upon the hunting rights of the Indians.

I have quoted section 5(1) of the
regulations which says that ‘no person shall kill a migratory bird at any time
except during an open season…’. It is difficult to see how this language admits
of any exceptions. When, however, we find that reference in both the Convention
and in the regulations to what kind of birds an Indian and Eskimo may ‘take’ at
any time for food, it is impossible for me to say that the hunting rights of
the Indians as to these migratory birds, have not been abrogated, abridged or
infringed upon.

It is, I think, quite clear that the rights
given to the Indians by their treaties as they apply to migratory birds have
been taken away by this Act and its regulations. How are we to explain this
apparent breach of faith on the part of the government, for I cannot think it
can be described in any other terms? This cannot be described as a minor or
insignificant curtailment of these treaty rights, for game birds have always
been a most plentiful, a most reliable and a readily obtainable food in large
areas of Canada. I cannot
believe that the Government of Canada realized that in implementing the
Convention they were at the same time breaching the treaties that they had made
with the Indians. It is much more likely that these obligations under the
treaties were overlooked—a case of the left hand having forgotten what the
right hand had done.

* *
*

I can come to no other conclusion than that
the Indians, notwithstanding the rights given to them by their treaties, are
prohibited by this Act and its regulations from shooting migratory birds out of
season.

The questions of law decided by Johnson J.A.
(and therefore by this Court since it adopted his reasons as well as his
conclusion) in so far as they are relevant to the case at bar were (i) that it
is within the power of Parliament to abrogate the rights of Indians to hunt
whether arising from treaty or under the Proclamation of 1763 or from user from
time immemorial and (ii) that on its true construction the

[Page 278]

Migratory Birds Convention Act shews that it was the intention of Parliament to prohibit Indians
from hunting during the closed seasons subject only to the exceptions in their
favour set out in the Act as, for example, the right to take scoters for food.
I think it clear from reading the whole of the reasons of Johnson J.A. that he
did not direct his mind to the question, so fully argued before us in the case
at bar, whether accepting his decision on these two questions the effect of s.
87  of the Indian Act  was to preserve the Indian’s right to hunt
notwithstanding the provisions of the Migratory Birds Convention Act in
so far as that right was assured to them by “any treaty”. I think that if the
view of the effect of s. 87  which appears to me to be decisive in the case at
bar had been considered in the Court of Appeal or in this Court in Sikyea’s case
it would have been examined and dealt with in the reasons delivered. I do not
propose to enter on the question, which since 1949 has been raised from time to
time by authors, whether this Court now that it has become the final Court of
Appeal for Canada is, as in the case of the House of Lords, bound by its own
previous decisions on questions of law or whether, as in the case of the
Judicial Committee or the Supreme Court of the United States, it is free under
certain circumstance to reconsider them. I find it unnecessary to do this.
Assuming for the purposes of this appeal that we are governed by the rule of stare
decisis, it appears to me that the judgment in Sikyea falls within
one of the exceptions to that rule in that it was given per incuriam.

In Young v. Bristol Aeroplane Co. Ltd.[4], Lord Greene M.R., giving the
unanimous judgment of the full Court, said at pages 728 and 729:

It remains to consider the recent case of Lancaster
Motor Co. (London) v. Bremith Ld., in which a court consisting of the
present Master of the Rolls, Clauson L.J. and Goddard L.J. declined to follow
an earlier decision of a court consisting of Slesser L.J. and Romer L.J. in Gerard
v. Worth of Paris Ld. This was clearly a case where the earlier decision
was given per incuriam. It depended on the true meaning (which in the later
decision was regarded as clear beyond argument) of a rule of the Supreme Court
to which the court was apparently not referred and which it obviously had not
in mind. The Rules of the Supreme Court have statutory force and the court is
bound to give effect to them as to a statute. Where the court has construed a
statute or a rule having the force of a statute its decision stands on the same
footing as any other decision on a question of law, but where the court is
satisfied that an earlier

[Page 279]

decision was given in ignorance of the
terms of a statute or a rule having the force of a statute the position is very
different. It cannot, in our opinion, be right to say that in such a case the
court is entitled to disregard the statutory provision and is bound to follow a
decision of its own given when that provision was not present to its mind.
Cases of this description are examples of decisions given per incuriam.

I do not suggest that in Sikyea’s case
either the Court of Appeal or this Court was ignorant of the existence of s. 87 
of the Indian Act  but, to use the words of Lord Greene, I am satisfied
that that section was not present to the mind of either Court when rendering
judgment, although it does appear to have been dealt with in the argument of
counsel.

Having reached this conclusion it is not
necessary for me to consider the other grounds on which Mr. Mackinnon argued
that Sikyea’s case could be distinguished.

In St. Saviour’s Southwark (Churchwardens)[5] case, Lord Coke said:

If two constructions may be made of the
King’s grant, then the rule is, when it may receive two constructions, and by
force of one construction the grant may according to the rule of law be
adjudged good, and by another it shall by law be adjudged bad; then for the
King’s honour, and for the benefit of the subject, such construction shall be
made that the King’s charter shall take effect, for it was not the King’s
intent to make a void grant, and therewith agrees Sir J. Moleyn’s case
in the sixth part of my reports.

We should, I think, endeavour to construe the
treaty of 1827 and those Acts of Parliament which bear upon the question before
us in such manner that the honour of the Sovereign may be upheld and Parliament
not made subject to the reproach of having taken away by unilateral action and
without consideration the rights solemnly assured to the Indians and their
posterity by treaty. Johnson J.A., with obvious regret, felt bound to hold that
Parliament had taken away those rights, but I am now satisfied that on its true
construction s. 87  of the Indian Act  shews that Parliament was careful
to preserve them. At the risk of repetition I think it clear that the effect of
s. 87  is two-fold. It makes Indians subject to the laws of general application
in force in the province in which they reside but at the same time it preserves
inviolate to the Indians whatever rights they have under the terms of any
treaty so that in a case of conflict between the provisions of the laws and the
terms of the treaty the latter shall prevail.

[Page 280]

For the reasons given by Roach J.A. and those
stated above I would dismiss this appeal with costs.

The judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland,
Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.:—I have had the opportunity to read
the; reasons stated by my brother Cartwright. The facts giving rise to this
appeal are there reviewed and it is unnecessary to repeat them here. With great
respect, I am unable to agree with his interpretation of s. 87 of the Indian
Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149, which provides as follows:

87. Subject to the terms of any treaty and
any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, all laws of general application from
time to time in force in any province are applicable to and in respect of Indians
in the province, except to the extent that such laws are inconsistent with this
Act or any order, rule, regulation or by-law made thereunder, and except to the
extent that such laws make provision for any matter for which provision is made
by or under this Act.

I cannot construe this section as making the
provisions of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 179,
subordinate to the treaty of July 10, 1827. In my opinion, it was not the
purpose of s. 87 to make any legislation of the Parliament of Canada subject to
the terms of any treaty. I understand the object and intent of that section is
to make Indians, who are under the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the
Parliament of Canada, by virtue of s. 91(24) of the British North America
Act, 1867, subject to provincial laws of general application.

The application of provincial laws to Indians
was, however, made subject to “the terms of any treaty and any other Act of
the Parliament of Canada” (the italics are mine). In addition, provincial
laws inconsistent with the Indian Act , or any order, rule, regulation or
by-law made thereunder, or making provision for any matter for which provision
is made under that Act, do not apply.

The incorporation in the section of the words
italicized to me makes it clear that when the section refers to “laws of
general application from time to time in force in any province” it did not
include in that expression the statute law of Canada. If it did, the section,
in so far as federal legislation is concerned, would provide that the statute
law of Canada applies to Indians, subject to the terms of any Act of the
Parliament of Canada, other than the Indian

[Page 281]

Act. This would
be a rather unusual provision, particularly in view of the fact that it did not
require any express provision in the Indian Act  to make Indians subject
to the provisions of federal statutes. In my view the expression refers only to
those rules of law in a province which are provincial in scope, and would
include provincial legislation and any laws which were made a part of the law
of a province, as, for example, in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan,
the laws of England as they existed on July 15, 1870.

This section was not intended to be a
declaration of the paramountcy of treaties over federal legislation. The
reference to treaties was incorporated in a section the purpose of which was to
make provincial laws applicable to Indians, so as to preclude any interference
with rights under treaties resulting from the impact of provincial legislation.

Accordingly, in my opinion, the provisions of s.
87 do not prevent the application to Indians of the provisions of the Migratory
Birds Convention Act. I can see no valid distinction between the present
case and that of Sikyea v. The Queen[6]
and, for the reasons given in that case, I think that this appeal should be
allowed. The judgment of the learned magistrate should be reversed and a fine
of ten dollars be imposed upon the respondent. The Attorney-General of Canada does not ask for costs, and
accordingly there should be no costs in this Court or in the Courts below.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Accused in custody—Notice of
appeal requesting that counsel be appointed by Court—Request refused—Accused
notified only after hearing of appeal.

The appellant, who was in custody, completed
a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal on a form prescribed by the rules
whereby he requested that his case be presented “through counsel to be assigned
by the Court”. The Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal in his absence and
without assigning counsel. He was not notified of the date set for the hearing.
The case came before the Court of Appeal on May 7. He was advised by a letter
dated May 28 that his appeal had been dismissed and by a further letter dated
June 24 that his request for counsel had been refused. He appealed to this
Court.

[Page 258]

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and the record should be referred back to the Court of
Appeal for a hearing in accordance with the Criminal Code .

The failure to notify the appellant that no
counsel had been appointed by the Court and the failure to notify him of the
date of the hearing of the appeal and to give him an opportunity to present his
case either in writing or in person was fatal to the validity of the order of
the Court of Appeal.

Droit criminel—Accusé sous détention—Avis
d’appel demandant qu’un avocat soit nommé par la Cour—Demande refusée—Accusé
notifié seulement après l’audition de Vappel.

L’appelant, qui était sous détention, a
complété un avis d’appel à la Cour d’Appel sur une formule prescrite par les
règles dans laquelle il demandait que sa cause soit présentée par l’entremise
d’un avocat assigné par la Cour. La Cour d’Appel a rejeté l’appel en son
absence et sans lui avoir assigné un avocat. Il n’a pas été notifié de la date
fixée pour l’audition. La cause fut entendue par la Cour d’Appel le 7 mai. Il
fut notifié par une lettre en date du 28 mai que son appel avait été rejeté et
par un autre lettre en date du 24 juin que sa demande pour la nomination d’un
avocat avait été refusée. Il en appela devant cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel doit être maintenu et le
dossier renvoyé à la Cour d’Appel pour une audition conformément au Code
criminel .

Le défaut de notifier l’appelant qu’aucun
avocat n’avait été nommé par la Cour et le défaut de le notifier de la date de
l’audition de l’appel et de lui donner l’occasion de présenter sa cause, soit
par écrit, soit en personne, avait été fatal à la validité de l’ordonnance
rendue par la Cour d’Appel.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’Appel de
l’Ontario. Appel maintenu.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario. Appeal allowed.

Brian Crane, for the appellant.

R.A. Cormack, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

The CHIEF JUSTICE:—In this case, the appellant,
who is in custody, completed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario on Form B prescribed in the Rules
respecting Criminal Proceedings which came into force in Ontario on March 1, 1965.

[Page 259]

This form reads in part as follows:

I desire to present my case and argument
whether it be for leave to appeal or by way of appeal where leave is not
necessary5.

(a) in writing

(b) in person

(c) through counsel to be assigned
by the court.

Marginal note (5) reads as follows:

(5) Stroke out two of (a),
(b) or (c).

The appellant struck out items (a) and (b).

The notice was dated April 14, 1965.

The appellant received no notice of the date set
for the hearing of his appeal.

On May 7, 1965, the Court of Appeal made an
order dismissing his appeal. The appellant was not present and no counsel had
been assigned to present the appeal.

Some time in May the appellant was informed by
the Governor of the jail that his appeal had been dismissed. By letter of May 28, 1965, from the Registrar of the Court of
Appeal, he was sent a copy of the order of the Court of Appeal made on May 7,
1965. By letter dated June 24, 1965, from the Registrar, he was advised that his request to have his
appeal argued through counsel to be assigned by the Court had been refused.

It is obvious that the appellant having
completed his notice of appeal in the manner set out above would assume until
he was advised to the contrary that counsel would be assigned to present his
appeal. The failure to notify the appellant that no counsel was appointed by
the Court and the failure to notify him of the date of the hearing of the
appeal and to give him an opportunity to present his case either in writing or
in person is fatal to the validity of the order of the Court of Appeal.

The Appeal is allowed, the order of the Court of
Appeal of May 7, 1965, is set aside and it is directed that the record be
returned to that Court to hear and determine the application of the appellant
in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code .

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Driving while ability
impaired—Prisoner refused permission to contact lawyer after arrest—“Full
answer and defence”—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 709(1)—Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44, s. 2(e).

Evidence—Admissibility—Breathalizer tests
obtained after arrest—Accused not informed beforehand of arrest—Subsequently
allowed to place a telephone call for legal assistance—Refused further calls
when first proved abortive—Whether violation of s. 2(c) (ii) of Canadian Bill
of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44—Whether evidence of breathalizer admissible.

The accused, who was represented by counsel
at trial, was convicted of impaired driving. The evidence included evidence of
breathalizer tests. The accused was not told that he was under arrest until
after the tests had been taken. When he was so informed, he was allowed to
place a telephone call to his solicitor. When this call proved abortive, he was
refused permission to make a second call to obtain legal assistance. His appeal
by way of a stated case was allowed on the ground that the breathalizer
evidence should not have been admitted. On appeal by the Crown to the Court of
Appeal, the conviction was restored. The accused was granted leave to appeal to
this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 620]

Per Taschereau
C.J., and Fauteux, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: The refusal by the police to allow the
accused to make a second telephone call was not a denial of his right to make
“his full answer and defence” within the meaning of s. 709  of the Criminal
Code . That section relates solely to the procedure at trial.

The accused cannot derive any assistance from
s. 2(c)(ii) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44, which
provides that no law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to deprive a
person who has been arrested or detained of the right to retain and instruct
counsel without delay. The contention that the mere denial to the accused of
his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay of itself automatically
nullifies the subsequent proceedings was rejected. Regina v. Steeves, [1964] 1 C.C.C. 266 at 268,
adopted.

The alternative contention that the evidence
of the breathalizer should be ignored, could not be entertained either. The
facts submitted for the stated case in no way suggested that the presence of
counsel after the tests had been completed could have resulted in his
ascertaining any factors which would have affected the admissibility of this
evidence. The Magistrate did not see fit to draw the inference that had the
accused been informed of the charge against him he would have then and there
decided to obtain and instruct counsel, and therefore no question of law based
upon that inference arose out of the stated case. Furthermore, the decision
that the evidence of the breathalizer tests should be ignored was a decision on
a question of law which did not arise out of the stated case and which did not
form one of the grounds upon which leave to appeal to this Court was granted.

In any event, the evidence of the
breathalizer tests was clearly admissible, even if it had been shown that the
absence of counsel deprived the accused of being advised of his right to refuse
to take the tests.

Per Spence J.:
Under the particular circumstances of this case and on the basis upon which the
case was stated and the questions put therein, the accused’s appeal should be
dismissed. A Court, upon an
appeal by way of stated case upon the questions as put in this case, could not
consider the inference that the accused, had he been informed as he ought to
have been that he was under arrest, would there and then have determined upon
obtaining and instructing counsel.

[Page 621] 

L’appelant, qui était représenté à son procès
par un avocat, a été trouvé coupable d’avoir conduit une automobile pendant que
sa capacité de le faire était affaiblie. La preuve comprenait une preuve d’un
examen d’haleine. L’appelant a été averti qu’il était en état d’arrestation
seulement après que les épreuves d’haleine eurent été prises. C’est alors qu’on
lui a permis de placer un appel téléphonique à son avocat. Lorsque cet appel
s’avéra sans résultat, permission de placer un second appel pour obtenir de
l’aide légale lui fut refusée. Son appel en vertu d’un dossier soumis fut
maintenu pour le motif que la preuve de l’examen d’haleine n’aurait pas dû être
admise. Sur appel par la Couronne à la Cour d’appel, le verdict de culpabilité
fut rétabli. L’appelant a obtenu permission d’appeler devant cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté.

Le Juge en
chef Taschereau et les Juges Fauteux, Ritchie et Hall: Le refus par la police
de permettre à l’appelant de placer un second appel téléphonique n’était pas un
déni de son droit de présenter «une réponse et défense complète» dans le sens
de l’art. 709  du Code criminel . Cet article traite seulement de la
procédure lors du procès.

L’appelant ne peut obtenir aucun bénéfice de
l’art. 2(c)(ii) de la Déclaration canadienne des droits, 1960
(Can.), c. 44, qui prévoit que nulle loi du Canada ne doit s’interpréter ni
s’appliquer comme privant une personne arrêtée ou détenue du droit de retenir
et de constituer un avocat sans délai. La prétention que le seul déni du droit
de retenir et de donner des instructions à un avocat sans délai per se annule
automatiquement les procédures subséquentes doit être rejetée. Regina v.
Steeves, [1964] 1 C.C.C. 266 à la page 268, adoptée.

La prétention alternative que la preuve de
l’examen d’haleine devrait être ignorée ne peut pas être entretenue non plus.
Les fait relatés au dossier soumis ne suggèrent d’aucune façon que la présence
d’un avocat après que les épreuves eurent été complétées aurait eu pour
résultat de faire constater des faits qui auraient affecté l’admissibilité de
cette preuve. Le magistrat n’a pas jugé à propos de tirer la conclusion que, si
l’accusé avait été notifié de l’accusation portée contre lui, il aurait décidé
dès ce moment d’obtenir et de donner des instructions à un avocat, et en
conséquence aucune question de droit basée sur cette déduction n’était soulevée
par le dossier soumis. Bien plus, la décision que la preuve de l’examen
d’haleine devrait être ignorée était une décision sur une question de droit qui
ne se soulevait pas dans le dossier soumis et qui ne formait pas un des motifs
pour lesquels permission d’appeler devant cette Cour avait été accordée.

A tout événement, la preuve de l’examen
d’haleine était clairement admissible, même si on avait pu démontrer que
l’absence d’un avocat avait privé l’appelant d’être avisé de son droit de
refuser de se soumettre à cette épreuve.

Le Juge
Spence: Dans les circonstances particulières de cette cause et vu la base sur
laquelle le dossier a été soumis et les questions ont été posées, l’appel doit
être rejeté. Une Cour, sur appel sur des questions telles que posées dans cette
cause en vertu d’un dossier soumis, ne peut considérer

[Page 622]

I’inférence que l’accusé, s’il avait été
notifié qu’il était en état d’arrestation, tel qu’il aurait dû l’être, aurait
dès ce moment décidé d’obtenir un avocat et de lui donner des instructions.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’appel de
l’Ontario[1], rétablissant un verdict de culpabilité. Appel
rejeté.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario1, restoring a conviction. Appeal dismissed.

E. Patrick Hartt, Q.C., for the
appellant.

W.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux,
Ritchie and Hall J.J. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—This is an appeal brought by leave
of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1
setting aside a judgment of Mr. Justice Haines and ordering that an
affirmative answer should be given to the three questions submitted by
Magistrate F.W. Bartram, Q.C., in the case stated by him at the request of the
appellant’s counsel following the appellant’s conviction of an offence contrary
to s. 223  of the Criminal Code .

As we are limited on this appeal to the facts
stated by the learned Magistrate, I think it desirable to set out the whole of
the case stated by him:

1. On the 5th day of February, 1964, an
information was laid under oath before a Justice of the Peace for the County of
York by the above named Peter Campbell for that the said James Eaton O’Connor
on the 5th day of February, 1964, in the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto,
in the County of York, unlawfully did while his ability to drive a motor
vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug, drive a motor vehicle contrary to
the Criminal Code .

2. On the 20th day of February, 1964, the
said charge was duly heard before me in the presence of the accused and after
hearing the evidence adduced and the submissions made by Counsel on behalf of
the Crown and the accused, I found the said James Eaton O’Connor guilty of the
said offence and convicted him thereof, but at the request of Counsel for the
said James Eaton O’Connor, I state the following case for the consideration of
this Honourable Court:

James Eaton O’Connor was driving a Dodge
motor vehicle south on Weston Road at about 1:20 a.m. on February 5th, 1964, when he was stopped by Constable Graham of the Metropolitan
Toronto Police

[Page 623]

Department. James O’Connor got out of his
car and as a result of his observations of Mr. O’Connor, Constable Graham
formed the opinion that Mr. O’Connor’s ability to drive a motor vehicle
was impaired by alcohol. Constable Graham placed Mr. O’Connor under arrest
on a charge of driving while his ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired
by alcohol but did not tell Mr. O’Connor this.

James O’Connor was interviewed by Constable
Thomas McBrian on February 5th, 1964, at about 1:45 a.m. at the Police Station. As a
result of his observations of Mr. O’Connor and the results of tests
attempted by Mr. O’Connor for Constable McBrian, Constable McBrian formed
the opinion that the accused’s ability to drive a motor vehicle was obviously
impaired by alcohol. A breathalyzer test reading of 2.0 parts per thousand
blood alcohol was recorded at 2:00 a.m. and at 2:15 a.m. a second breathalyzer test
reading of 1.9 parts per thousand blood alcohol was recorded. I found as a fact
that Mr. O’Connor was not told that he was going to be charged and did not
know that he was under arrest until after the breath tests were taken and he
was being placed in a cell for the night. At that time, he requested permission
to contact his solicitor. He was allowed to make one telephone call but when he
was informed that the solicitor was away, he was refused permission to make a
further telephone call to obtain legal assistance. The refusal to telephone was
made after the tests were taken.

Counsel for James Eaton O’Connor desires to
question the validity of the said conviction on the ground that it is erroneous
in point of law, the questions submitted for the judgment of this Honourable
Court being:

(1) Was I right in holding that the refusal
by the police to allow the accused while under arrest to contact a lawyer did
not amount to a denial to the accused to make his full answer and defence?

(2) Was I right in holding that the refusal
by the police to allow the accused while under arrest to contact a lawyer did
not amount to a denial of natural justice?

(3) Was I right in convicting the accused
under the circumstances when I found as a fact, that he, while under arrest,
had been denied the right to contact a lawyer?

It is to be noted that no further questions have
been submitted by the appellant’s counsel at any stage of these proceedings and
that the questions of law upon which the application for leave to appeal to
this Court was based were confined to challenging the answers given by the
Court of Appeal to these three questions, as indeed the grounds upon which such
leave to appeal was granted were also confined.

I take it from reading the reasons for judgment
of Mr. Justice Haines that the negative answer which he gave to the first
question posed by the learned Magistrate was based on his having equated the
refusal by the police to allow the appellant to make a second telephone call,
for the purpose of contacting a lawyer while he was in the cells at

[Page 624]

the Police Station at 2:15 a.m. with a denial of
his right to make “his full answer and defence” within the meaning of s. 709  of
the Criminal Code  which reads as follows:

709(1) The prosecutor is entitled
personally to conduct his case and the defendant is entitled to make his full
answer and defence.

(2) The prosecutor or defendant as the case
may be may examine and cross-examine witnesses personally or by counsel or
agent.

(3) Every witness at a trial in proceedings
in which this Part applies shall be examined under oath.

I think it desirable to dispose of this phase of
the matter at the outset and to say that I am in full agreement with
Mr. Justice Roach that this section “relates solely to the procedure at
trial” and that I accept the statement which he made in the course of the
reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf of the Court of Appeal when
he said:

At the trial the accused was represented by
able, experienced counsel and in the case stated there is no suggestion that
any right given to the accused by that section (i.e. s. 709 ) was withheld
from him.

In my opinion the questions submitted by the
learned Magistrate are to be answered in accordance with the interpretation to
be placed on the relevant provisions of the Canadian Bill of Rights which
read as follows:

1. It is hereby recognized and declared
that in Canada there have existed and shall continue to exist without
discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour, religion or sex, the
following human rights and fundamental freedoms, namely,...

(b) the right of the individual to
equality before the law and the protection of the law;...

2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is
expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate
notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied
as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation,
abridgment or infringement of any of the rights or freedoms herein recognized
and declared, and in particular, no law of Canada shall be construed or applied
so as to...

(c) deprive a person who has
been arrested or detained

(i) of the right to be informed promptly of
the reason for his arrest or detention,

(ii) of the right to retain and instruct
counsel without delay, or...

(e) deprive a person of the
right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice for the determination of his rights and obligations;...

The italics are my own.

In submitting that this appeal should be allowed
and the three questions answered in the negative, counsel for the

[Page 625]

appellant asked that a verdict of acquittal be
entered and, in so far as this request is based on the contention that the mere
denial to the appellant of his “right to retain and instruct counsel without
delay” of itself automatically nullifies the subsequent proceedings, I reject
it. In this regard I adopt the view expressed by Ilsley C.J. in Regina v.
Steeves[2], where
he said:

Nor, in my opinion, is there any general
rule that if a person who has been arrested has been deprived by the police of
the right to instruct counsel without delay, the charge against that person
must be dismissed if he is brought to trial and the accused go forever free.

Reflection on the consequences of such a
rule, if it were to exist in, for example, the case of capital murder, will
indicate, I think, that the relevant provision of the Canadian Bill of
Rights cannot mean that.

Counsel for the appellant, however, asked in the
alternative that the conviction be quashed and “the matter remitted back to the
learned Magistrate to dispose of the case on the other evidence only, ignoring
the evidence of the breathalizer”, in accordance with the order made by Haines
J.

On the facts as stated by the learned Magistrate
it is not suggested that the appellant had been deprived of his rights under s.
2(c) (ii) until after he had voluntarily submitted to the two
breathalizer tests being administered to him and it is a little difficult to
understand the grounds upon which Mr. Justice Haines decided that this
evidence should be excluded.

In the early stages of his reasons for judgment,
the learned judge of first instance observed:

It was only after the taking of two
breathalizer tests that the accused sought permission to contact his solicitor,
and, indeed, it can hardly be gainsaid that the police were under no duty to
advise him of his rights in that respect. One might therefore be prompted to
conclude that all proceedings taken by the police up to and including the
taking of the breath tests were regular and proper, and that the complaints of
the accused, if any, must necessarily be confined to subsequent events.

However, on the basis of the facts placed
before me it is manifest that from the very first two seemingly obvious rights
inherent in an accused person were violated. Mr. O’Connor was not informed
of or made aware of the fact that he was under arrest, and further, and more
importantly, he was not informed of the charge upon which he was arrested. It
was only upon the completion of the breath tests and their analysis that these
things were made known to him, and it was upon the acquisition of this
knowledge that Mr. O’Connor sought permission to contact counsel. I have

[Page 626] 

no doubt but that had the police fulfilled
their very obvious duty in making known to the accused the charge against him
at the time of apprehension that he would there and then have determined upon
the obtaining and instructing of counsel as was his right under sec. 2(c)
(ii) of the Canadian Bill of Rights...

In my opinion, therefore, nothing in this
case turns on the question of when the attempt to retain and instruct counsel
was exercised,...

It would appear from this part of his decision
that the learned judge was expressing the view that the failure of the police
to tell the appellant at the time of his apprehension that he was under arrest
or that he was charged with driving his motor vehicle while his ability to do
so was impaired resulted in his being subjected to the breathalizer tests
before he had any reason to believe that he was in any need of legal assistance
and thus deprived him of his right to retain and instruct counsel before the
tests were administered. This interpretation of the judgment, however, appears
to me to be inconsistent with what the learned judge later said. After he had
expressed the view that there had been a complete violation of the appellant’s
rights he then continued:

And here I am not speaking of the initial
failure of the police to inform the accused of the offence with which he was
charged or of the fact of his arrest. These things of course are as
unacceptable as their apparent notion that persons in custody are permitted
only one phone call completed or otherwise.

My reference for the purposes of deciding
this case is directed solely to the conduct of the police in denying to the
accused the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. Inherent in
that denial was a denial of the right in the accused to confrontation in fact
development at a crucial stage to demonstrate his lack of guilt according to
law. Had counsel been present to gather evidence he might possibly have
ascertained factors which would have determined the innocence of the accused.
For example, and only by way of example, he might have unearthed some physical
disability under which the accused laboured which would have pointed to some
other explanation than impairment by alcohol. Alternatively, he might have
discovered some defect in the breathalizer apparatus and sought the taking of a
blood test which would negate the presence of alcohol. As applied to this case,
having regard to the materials before me, these things are of course
speculation,...

If these speculative considerations formed any
part of the judge’s reasoning in reaching his conclusions that the breathalizer
tests were to be ignored, then I think he was in error in considering them
because, in my opinion, the facts submitted in the stated case in no way
suggest that the

[Page 627]

presence of counsel in the Police Station after
the tests had been completed at 2:15 a.m. could have resulted in his ascertaining any factors which would
have affected the admissibility of this evidence.

If, on the other hand, the breathalizer test
evidence was excluded on the ground that the appellant was deprived of counsel
before the tests were taken by reason of the fact that he was not told of the
charge against him when he was apprehended, then any such ruling must be based
on the assumption that if he had been given this information “he would there
and then have determined upon the obtaining and instructing of counsel”. This
is an inference which the learned Magistrate did not see fit to draw from the
evidence and in my opinion no question of law based upon it arises out of the
stated case.

A judge to whom a stated case is transmitted
under s. 734  of the Criminal Code  is confined to the questions of law
stated by the Magistrate and to any other question of law necessarily arising
out of the facts stated, in the sense that no evidence could alter it. This is
made plain by McRuer C.J.H.C. in the course of his reasons for judgment in Regina
v. C.P.R.[3], where
he said:

On the argument I had some doubt as to
whether I could deal with points of law not stated in the stated case. I have,
however, come to the conclusion that since the matter before me is in the
nature of an appeal and so stated to be, by s. 734  of the Criminal Code , the
respondent is entitled to support the conviction on any matter of law arising
out of the stated case as long as no evidence could alter it:...

The italics are my own.

As I have indicated, I am of opinion that when
Mr. Justice Haines decided that the evidence of the breathalizer tests
should be ignored, he was deciding a question of law which did not arise out of
the stated case and which does not form one of the grounds upon which leave to
appeal to this Court was granted.

In view, however, of the fact that the question
of the admissibility of the evidence of the breathalizer tests was dealt with
in both the Courts below, I think it desirable to say that this evidence in my
opinion was clearly admissible and even if it had been shown that the absence
of the

[Page 628]

appellant’s lawyer deprived him of being advised
of his right to refuse to take the tests, my opinion would be the same having
regard to the provisions of s. 224(3)  of the Criminal Code  which read as
follows:

224(3) In any proceedings under section 222 
or 223 , the result of a chemical analysis of a sample of the blood, urine,
breath or other bodily substance of a person may be admitted in evidence on the
issue whether that person was intoxicated or under the influence of a narcotic
drug or whether his ability to drive was impaired by alcohol or a drug, notwithstanding
that he was not, before he gave the sample, warned that he need not give the
sample or that the results of the analysis of the sample might be used in
evidence.

The italics are my own.

This subsection was considered by this Court in Re
the Validity of s. 92(4) Of the Vehicle Act 1957 (Sask.)[4] and the general law establishing the admissibility of such evidence
was fully reviewed by Mr. Justice Fauteux in the course of his reasons for
judgment in the case of Attorney General for Quebec v. Begin[5].

The evidence in the present case does not, in my
opinion, disclose that the circumstances under which the police refused “to
allow the accused while under arrest to contact a lawyer” were such as to in
any way deprive him “of the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the
principles of fundamental justice” and I am accordingly of opinion that no
question arises as to the effect which the Canadian Bill of Rights might
have upon such circumstances if they did exist.

In view of all the above I would answer each of
the questions submitted by the learned Magistrate in the affirmative and
thereby confirm the conviction.

I would therefore dismiss this appeal.

SPENCE J.:—I have had the privilege of reading
the reasons for judgment of my brother Ritchie. I agree that under the
particular circumstances in this appeal the appeal must be dismissed.

I feel, however, that I must limit my
concurrence strictly to the basis upon which the case was stated by the learned

[Page 629]

magistrate and the questions put by him which
were as follows:

(1) Was I right in holding that the refusal
by the police to allow the accused while under arrest to contact a lawyer did
not amount to a denial to the accused to make his full answer and defence?

(2) Was I right in holding that the refusal
by the police to allow the accused while under arrest to contact a lawyer did
not amount to a denial of natural justice?

(3) Was I right in convicting the accused
under the circumstances when I found as a fact, that he, while under arrest,
had been denied the right to contact a lawyer?

I agree, with respect, that Haines J. had no
basis upon which he could conclude that the accused “would there and then have
determined upon obtaining and instructing counsel” had he been informed as he
ought to have been that he was under arrest on a charge of impaired driving. In
my view, such an inference could not be considered by the court upon an appeal
by way of stated case upon the questions as put therein. It certainly was not
one which could not be altered by evidence. See McRuer C.J.H.C. in Regina v. C.P.R.[6].

There may well be cases where the same failure
to warn the accused that he is under arrest and to state the charge against him
results in the obtaining of evidence which it could not otherwise have been
obtained. It is not my view that we are in any way bound in the consideration
of such cases by the result in the present appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR NORTHWEST TERRITORIES

Eskimos—Criminal law—Game
suitable for human consumption abandoned—Northwest Territories Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 337, s. 13—Game Ordinance O.N.W.T. 1960 (Second Sess.), c. 2, s. 15
(1)(a).

The appellant, an Eskimo, was charged with killing and
abandoning game fit for human consumption contrary to s. 15(1)(a) of the Game
Ordinance, O.N.W.T. 1960 (Second Sess.), c. 2. There is no dispute that the
appellant had killed three caribou and had abandoned parts of them which were
fit for human consumption. The charge was dismissed by the Magistrate on the
ground that the Game Ordinance did not apply to an Eskimo. On an appeal
by way of stated case, the dismissal was confirmed for the same reason. The
Court of Appeal reversed this finding and convicted the appellant. The
appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

The Royal Proclamation of 1763, upon which the appellant
relied, has no application in the region in which the alleged offence took
place.

The Game Ordinance, which was in force and which was
validly enacted by the Commissioner-in-Council pursuant to powers conferred
upon him by the Parliament of Canada, applies to the Eskimos. The caribou which
were killed in this case were game within the meaning of the Game Ordinance
and the offence here was in abandoning parts

[Page 646]

thereof suitable for human consumption even if the appellant
had the legal right to hunt them for food.

In so far as Regina v. Kallooar (1964), 50 W.W.R. 602,
and Regina v. Kogogolak (1959), 28 W.W.R. 376, hold that the Game
Ordinance does not apply to Indians or Eskimos in the Northwest
Territories, they are not good law and must be taken as having been overruled.

Esquimaux—Droit
criminel—Abandon de gibier apte à la consommation humaine—Loi sur les
Territoires du Nord-Ouest, S.R.C. 1952, c. 331, art. 13—Ordonnance sur le
Gibier, O.N.W.T. 1960 (26 Session), c. 2, art. 15(1)(a).

L'appelant, un Esquimau, a été accusé d'avoir
tué et abandonné du gibier apte à la consommation humaine, le tout
contrairement à l'art. 15(1)(a) de l'Ordonnance sur le Gibier, O.N.W.T.
1960 (26 Sess.), c. 2. Il n'est pas contesté que l'appelant avait tué trois
caribous et avait abandonné des parties qui étaient aptes à la consommation
humaine. L'acte d'accusation fut rejeté par le magistrat pour le motif que
l'Ordonnance sur le Gibier ne s'appliquait pas à un Esquimau. Sur appel en
vertu d'un dossier soumis, le rejet de l'accusation fut confirmé pour le même
motif. La Cour d'appel a renversé cette décision et a trouvé l'appelant
coupable. L'appelant a obtenu permission d'en appeler devant cette Cour.

Arrêt: L'appel
doit être rejeté.

La Proclamation royale de 1763, sur laquelle
l'appelant se basait, ne s'applique pas à la région où la présumée offense a
été commise.

L'Ordonnance sur le Gibier, qui était en force et qui avait été validement édictée par le
Commissaire-en-conseil en vertu des pouvoirs qui lui sont conférés par le
Parlement du Canada, s'applique aux Esquimaux. Les caribous qui ont été tués
dans le cas présent étaient du gibier dans le sens de l'Ordonnance sur le
Gibier et l'offense dans l'espèce consistait dans l'abandon de certaines
parties qui étaient aptes à la consommation humaine même si l'appelant avait le
droit légal d'en faire la chasse en vue de se procurer de la nourriture.

En autant que les causes de Regina v.
Kallooar (1964), 50 W.W.R. 602 et Regina v. Kogogolak (1959), 28
W.W.R. 376, décident que l'Ordonnance sur le Gibier ne s'applique pas
aux Indiens ou aux Esquimaux dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest, ces causes ne
reflètent pas la loi et doivent être considérées comme ayant été cassées.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for the Northwest
 Territories[2], reversing a judgment of Sissons J. Appeal
dismissed.

[Page 647]

W. G. Morrow, Q.C., and A.
E. Williams, for the appellant.

D. H. Christie, Q.C., and
J. M. Bentley, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

HALL J.:—The appellant, an
Eskimo, residing at Whale Cove, a settlement on the west coast of Hudson Bay
about midway between Churchill and Chesterfield Inlet, was charged under s.
15(1) (a) of the Game Ordinance, being c. 2 of the Ordinances of the
Northwest Territories, (1960) Second Session, that he, between the 20th day of
July, 1964 and the 31st day of July, 1964 at or near a point two miles from an
abandoned cabin on the north shore at the mouth of the Wilson River, Northwest
Territories, did kill and abandon game fit for human consumption contrary to s.
15(1) (a) of the Game Ordinance.

Section 15(1) (a) referred
to reads as follows:

15.(1) No person who has
killed, taken or acquired game shall 

(a) abandon any part
thereof that is suitable for human consumption;

The Game Ordinance was
enacted by the Commissioner in Council pursuant to powers confered by s. 13 of
the Northwest Territories Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 331. The relevant parts
of s. 13 read:

13. The Commissioner in
Council may, subject to the provisions of this Act and any other Act of the
Parliament of Canada, make ordinances for the government of the Territories in
relation to the following classes of subjects, namely,

***

(q) the preservation of game in the Territories;

By s. 1 of c. 20 of the Statutes
of Canada 1960, s. 14  of the Northwest Territories Act  was amended to
read:

(2) Notwithstanding
subsection (1) but subject to subsection (3), the Commissioner in Council may
make Ordinances for the government of the Territories in relation to the
preservation of game in the Territories that are applicable to and in respect
of Indians and Eskimos, and Ordinances made by the Commissioner in Council in
relation to the preservation of game in the Territories, unless the contrary
intention appears therein, are applicable to and in respect of Indians and
Eskimos.

(3) Nothing in subsection
(2) shall be construed as authorizing the Commissioner in Council to make Ordinances
restricting or prohibiting

[Page 648]

Indians or Eskimos from
hunting for food, on unoccupied Crown lands, game other than game declared by
the Governor in Council to be game in danger of becoming extinct.

and s. 17 was amended by adding
thereto the following:

(2) All laws of general
application in force in the Territories are, except where otherwise provided,
applicable to and in respect of Eskimos in the Territories.

Acting under s. 14(3) above, the
Governor in Council passed an Order in Council on September 14, 1960, reading
as follows:

AT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE AT OTTAWA

WEDNESDAY, the 14th day of SEPTEMBER, 1960.

PRESENT:

HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR GENERAL IN COUNCIL

His Excellency the Governor
General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Northern Affairs
and National Resources, pursuant to subsection (3)  of section 14  of the
Northwest Territories Act , is pleased hereby to declare musk-ox, barren-ground
caribou and polar bear as game in danger of becoming extinct.

(Seal)

Certified to be a true copy.

 (sgd.) D. F. Wall

Assistant Clerk of the Privy Council.

Counsel for the appellant made a
point that this Order in Council was not referred to in the proceedings before
the magistrate. Nothing, however, turns on that fact. The Order in Council was
part of the relevant law applicable to the charge whether referred to or not.

The charge was heard by P. B.
Parker, a police magistrate in and for the Northwest Territories under the
provisions of s. 466 (b) of the Criminal Code  of Canada at Whale
Cove aforesaid on February 26 and 27, 1965. Magistrate Parker, holding that he
was bound by the decision of Sissons J. in Regina v. Kallooar[3]
, dismissed the charge on the ground that the Game Ordinance did not
apply to an Eskimo.

The Attorney General of Canada
applied to Magistrate Parker to state a case under s. 734  of the Criminal
Code  of Canada. The learned magistrate stated the case which
concluded with asking the following question:

Was I right in holding that
the Game Ordinance and particularly Section 15(1) (a) thereof does not apply to
Eskimos?

[Page 649]

The appeal, by way of stated
case, was heard by Sissons J. who, adhering to the views expressed by him in Regina
v. Kogogolak[4] and
in Kallooar answered the question in the affirmative and upheld the
dismissal of the charge. Sissons J. in Regina v. Kogogolak had held at
p. 384:

The Game Ordinance of
the Northwest Territories cannot and does not apply to the Eskimos.

The Attorney General of Canada
appealed by leave to the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories. The
appeal was heard by the Chief Justice, Parker and McDermid JJ.A. The Court of
Appeal[5] reversed
Sissons J. and convicted the appellant, remitting the case to the Summary Conviction Court for the purpose of deciding what penalty should be
imposed on the appellant. The appellant applied for and was given leave to
appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

It was contended by the appellant
that the Royal Proclamation of 1763 applied to Indians and Eskimos in the area
in question here and was still in effect notwithstanding the Northwest
Territories Act  and the Game Ordinance. Sissons J. so held in Kogogolak
and in Kallooar. Johnson J.A. in Regina v. Sikyea[6]
, whose judgment was adopted in this Court[7] ,
expressed himself to the contrary. There is no need for any doubt on the point.
The Proclamation, insofar as it related to Indians, declared:

And whereas it is just and
reasonable, and essential to our Interest, and the security of our Colonies,
that the several Nations or Tribes of Indians with whom We are connected, and
who live under our Protection, should not be molested or disturbed in the
Possession of such Parts of Our Dominions and Territories as, not having been
ceded to or purchased by Us, are reserved to them or any of them, as their
Hunting Grounds—We do therefore, with the Advice of our Privy Council, declare
it to be our Royal Will and Pleasure, that no Governor or Commander in Chief in
any of our Colonies of Quebec, East Florida, or West Florida, do presume, upon
any Pretence whatever, to grant Warrants of Survey, or pass any Patents for
Lands beyond the Bounds of their respective Governments, as described in their
Commissions; as also that no Governor or Commander in Chief in any of our other
Colonies or Plantations in America do presume for the present, and until our
further Pleasure be Known, to grant Warrants of Survey, or pass Patents for any
Lands beyond the Heads or Sources of any of the Rivers which fall into the
Atlantic Ocean

[Page 650]

from the West and North
West, or upon any Lands whatever, which, not having been ceded to or purchased
by Us as aforesaid, are reserved to the said Indians, or any of them.

And We do further declare it
to be Our Royal Will and Pleasure, for the present as aforesaid, to reserve
under our Sovereignty, Protection, and Dominion, for the use of the said
Indians, all the Lands and Territories not included within the Limits of Our
Said Three New Governments, or within the Limits of the Territory granted to
the Hudson's Bay Company, as also all the Lands and Territories lying to
the Westward of the Sources of the Rivers which fall into the Sea from the
West and North West as aforesaid; (The italics are mine.)

The term ""Indians""
includes Eskimos: Reference as to whether the term ""Indians"" in
Head 24 of Section 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, includes Eskimo
inhabitants of the Province of
 Quebec[8] .

The Letters Patent granted in
1670 to the Governor and Company of Adventurers of England, trading into Hudson's Bay,
gave:

…unto the said company and
their successors the sole trade and commerce of all those seas, straits, bays,
rivers, lakes, creeks and sounds in whatsoever latitude they should be, that
lay within the entrance of the straits commonly called Hudson's Straits together
with all the lands and territories upon the countries, coasts, and confines of
the seas, bays, lakes, rivers, creeks, and sounds aforesaid….

The Proclamation specifically
excludes territory granted to the Hudson's Bay Company and there can be no question that the
region in question was within the area granted to Hudson's Bay
Company. Accordingly the Proclamation does not and never did apply in the
region in question and the judgments to the contrary are not good law.

The substantive question which was
fully and ably argued by counsel was whether the Game Ordinance and
particularly s. 15(1)(a) thereof apply to Eskimos. In summary, the learned
magistrate found as follows as set out in more detail in the stated case:

(1) That the appellant, an
Eskimo, on the 20th day of July and the 31st day of July, 1964, killed three
caribou being game within the meaning of the Game Ordinance and he took
possession of them and removed the skin and rear parts of two caribou and the
tongue of the third.

(2) That he showed intention to
abandon and did abandon the parts of the three caribou he had killed and

[Page 651]

which he did not take, and that
the meat abandoned was at that time fit for human consumption.

It was not questioned that the
Whale Cove settlement is in the Barren Land region of the Northwest Territories, being a part of
Canada under the legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.
Parliament, by s. 13  of the Northwest Territories Act , conferred
legislative powers upon the Commissioner in Council to enact laws for the
preservation of game in the Territories. The Commissioner in Council enacted
the Game Ordinance. Parliament by c. 20 of the Statutes of Canada, 1960,
enacted by s. 2  thereof as follows:

From the day on which this
Act comes into force, the provisions of the Ordinances entitled

(a) ""An
Ordinance respecting the Preservation of Game in the Northwest Territories"", being chapter 42 of the Revised Ordinances of the Northwest Territories, 1956;

(b) ""An
Ordinance to amend the Game Ordinance"", being chapter 2 of the Ordinances
of the Northwest Territories, 1956, 2nd Session;

(c) ""An
Ordinance to amend the Game Ordinance"", being chapter 1 of the Ordinances
of the Northwest Territories, 1957, 1st Session;

(d) ""An
Ordinance to amend the Game Ordinance"", being chapter 1 of the Ordinances
of the Northwest Territories, 1958, 1st Session; and

(e) ""An
Ordinance to amend the Game Ordinance"", being chapter 4 of the Ordinances
of the Northwest Territories, 1959, 1st Session,

have the same force and
effect in relation to Indians and Eskimos as if on that day they had been re-enacted
in the same terms.

and also provided that:

(3) Nothing in subsection
(2) shall be construed as authorizing the Commissioner in Council to make
Ordinances restricting or prohibiting Indians or Eskimos from hunting for food,
on unoccupied Crown lands, game other than game declared by the Governor in
Council to be game in danger of becoming extinct.

The Governor in Council then
passed the Order in Council of September 14, 1960 previously quoted, declaring
barren-ground caribou as game in danger of becoming extinct.

The power of Parliament to enact
the Northwest Territories Act  and the amendments thereto is not questioned nor
is the power of the Commissioner in Council to enact the Game Ordinance.
It is not in dispute that the appellant abandoned parts of game as defined in
s. 2 of the Game Ordinance then suitable for human consumption. The only
factual issue pressed by the appellant was that it had not

[Page 652]

been shown that the three caribou
which he killed and abandoned in part were barren-ground caribou. I have no
doubt that this Court can and should take judicial notice of the fact that the
caribou in question here were barren-ground caribou. The Whale Cove region is
deep in the Barren Lands of Northern
 Canada and no suggestion is made in any
of the literature to which the Court was referred that any caribou other than
barren-ground caribou are to be found that far north. In any event, the caribou
he killed were game within the meaning of the Game Ordinance and the
offence here was in abandoning parts thereof suitable for human consumption
even if he had the legal right to hunt them for food.

I am of opinion that the question
put by Magistrate Parker in the case stated by him must be answered in the
negative, the conviction of the appellant by the Court of Appeal affirmed and
the direction remitting the case to the Summary
 Conviction Court upheld.

I think it desirable to say
specifically that insofar as Regina v. Kallooar and Regina v.
Kogogolak hold that the Game Ordinance does not apply to Indians or
Eskimos in the Northwest Territories, they are not good law and must be taken as having
been overruled.

The appeal should, accordingly,
be dismissed. The Attorney General states in his factum that he does not ask
for costs. There will, therefore, be no Order as to costs.

Appeal dismissed; no
order as to costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Capital murder—Instruction
to jury regarding clemency—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51,
ss. 206, 597A, 642A.

The appellant was convicted of capital murder. The only issue
raised by the defence at trial was that the jury should make a recommendation
in favour of clemency. Defence counsel's whole address to the jury was devoted
to this issue. The trial judge made no reference to it in his address to the
jury before they retired to consider the verdict, but after the verdict of
guilty had been rendered, he addressed the jury on s. 642A of the Code and read
them a summary of the evidence of one psychiatrist. The jury returned an eleven
to one recommendation against clemency. The appeal against sentence and
conviction was dismissed by a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal. An
appeal was launched to this Court.

Before this Court and the Court of Appeal, the appellant
argued that there had been a miscarriage of justice in that:

(1) The trial judge failed to explain adequately to the jury
the considerations that they could apply in arriving at a decision on the
question of clemency;

(2) The trial judge erred in failing to define and explain
what clemency is, and the extent of the right that the jury had to recommend
it; 

(3) The trial judge erred by directing the jury on the
evidence given by only one of the witnesses on that issue.

In this Court, the Crown raised the question of jurisdiction
on the ground that the appeal referred not to the conviction but to the
question of sentence.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia,[1] affirming
a conviction for capital murder. Appeal dismissed.

Samuel Martin Toy, for the
appellant.

W. G. Burke-Robertson,
Q.C., for the respondent.

[Page 403]

At the conclusion of the argument
of counsel for the appellant, the following judgment was delivered:

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (orally for
the Court):—We are all of opinion that there is no merit in the present
appeal. In a capital case the trial must be conducted without regard to s. 642A 
of the Criminal Code . After a verdict of guilty is given, all that the
judge is required to do, and all that he should do, is to put to the jury the
question in the terms of that section. In the light of this conclusion, it is
not necessary to deal with the issue of jurisdiction raised by counsel for the
respondent.

The appeal is dismissed.

Droit criminel—Meurtre
qualifié—Adresse du juge au jury concernant la clémence—Code criminel , 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, arts. 206, 597A, 642A.

L'appelant a été trouvé coupable de meurtre
qualifié. Lors du procès, la défense n'a soulevé qu'un seul point, à savoir que
le jury devait faire une recommandation à la clémence. Toute I'adresse du
procureur de I'appelant au jury fut consacrée à cette question. Le juge au
procès n'a pas référé à cette question dans son adresse au jury avant qu'il se
retire pour considérer le verdict, mais après la déclaration de culpabilité, le
juge, dans une nouvelle adresse au jury, a traité de l'art. 642A du Code et a
lu un sommaire du témoignage d'un psychiatre. Onze des jurés ont déclaré qu'ils
s'opposaient à une recommandation à la clémence. Un appel contre la sentence et
contre la déclaration de culpabilité a été rejeté par un jugement unanime de la
Cour d'Appel. D'où le pourvoi devant cette Cour.

Devant cette Cour et la Cour d'Appel,
l'appelant a soumis qu'il y avait eu erreur judiciaire lorsque:

1) Le juge au procès n'a pas expliqué
adéquatement au jury les questions qu'il pouvait considérer pour en arriver à
une décision sur la question de clémence;

2) Le juge au procès a erré en ne définissant
pas et en n'expliquant pas ce qu'était la clémence, ainsi que l'étendue du
droit que le jury avait de la recommander;

3) Le juge au procès a erré en référant le
jury au témoignage donné par un seul des témoins sur cette question.

Devant cette Cour, la Couronne a soulevé la
question de juridiction en se basant sur le fait que l'appel portait non pas
sur la déclaration de culpabilité mais sur la question de sentence.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN

Criminal law—Coroner's
inquest—Examination of person charged with murder at inquest into the death in
question—Whether compellable witness—Coroners Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 106, ss. 8,
8a, 15, 20, as amended by 1960 (Sask.), c. 14—Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1952,
c. 307, ss. 2, 4, 5—Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44, s. 2(d), (e)—Criminal
Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 448, 488(3).

Constitutional law—Validity
of legislation—Provincial legislation compelling person accused of murder to
testify at coroner's inquest—Whether intra vires—Coroners Act, R.S.S. 1953, c.
106, ss. 8, 8a, 15, 20, as amended by 1960 (Sask.), c. 14—B.N.A. Act, 1867,
ss. 91(27), 92(14).

On the same day that the coroner was holding an inquest into
the death of one Thomas, the appellant and eight others were arrested and each
of them was separately charged with the non-capital murder of Thomas. The
coroner immediately closed the inquest. Subsequently, on the order of the
Attorney-General, made pursuant to s. 8a of the Coroners Act, R.S.S.
1953, c. 106, as amended in 1960, the inquest was re-opened. On the fourth day
of the inquest, counsel for the Crown stated his intention to call and examine
as witnesses the appellant and the eight others who were present, they having
been served with a subpoena. The coroner ruled that each of them was a
compellable witness. The appellant applied for a writ of prohibition. The writ
was refused by the trial judge, and his judgment was affirmed by the Court of
Appeal. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held (Fauteux J. dissenting): The appeal should be
allowed.

Per Taschereau C.J. and Cartwright, Martland, Judson,
Ritchie and Spence JJ.: The criminal law in force in Saskatchewan is that of
England as it existed on July 15, 1870, except as altered, varied, modified or
affected by the Criminal Code  or any other Act of the Parliament of
Canada. Under that law as it existed on that date, a person charged with murder
and awaiting trial could not be compelled to testify at an inquest into the
death of the deceased with whose murder he was charged. No alteration has been
made in this state of the law by the combined effect of ss. 2 , 4(1)  and 5  of
the Canada Evidence Act  and ss. 448  and 488(3)  of the Criminal Code .
These sections of the Canada Evidence Act  do not have the effect of
rendering an accused a compellable witness at the coroner's inquest. It would
require clear words to bring about so complete a change in the law as it
existed in 1870. It would be a strange inconsistency if the law which carefully
protects an accused from being compelled to make any statement at a preliminary
inquiry should permit that inquiry to be adjourned in order that the
prosecution be permitted to take the accused before a coroner and submit him
against his will to examination and cross-examination as to his supposed guilt.
In the absence of clear words in

[Page 466]

an Act of Parliament or other compelling authority, that is
not the state of the law. The case of R. v. Barnes, 36 C.C.C. 40, not
followed. By enacting s. 15 of the Coroners Act in its present form, the
Legislature intended to change the law and to render a person charged with
murder compellable to give evidence at the inquest on the body of his alleged
victim. Such legislation trenches upon the rule expressed in the maxim nemo
tenetur seipsum accusare. Any legislation purporting to make such a change
in the law or to abrogate or alter the existing rules which protect a person
charged with a crime from being compelled to testify against himself, is
legislation in relation to the Criminal Law including the Procedure in Criminal
Matters and therefore within the exclusive legislative authority of the
Parliament under s. 91(27) of the B.N.A. Act.

Per Fauteux J., dissenting. The proposition that
the competency and compellability of a person to be called as a witness must be
determined with reference solely to the particular proceeding in which it is
proposed to call the person as a witness is a rule that receives an application
even in criminal trials where several persons, though jointly indicted, are
proceeded against separately. In such cases, it is the settled law that neither
one is regarded as an accused person or a party in the trial against the
others. Under our law, there is no party, no accused in a coroner's inquest and
it is only at the conclusion of the inquest that may arise the possibility of a
person being alleged to have committed murder and then compelled, by a
coroner's warrant, to appear in the criminal Courts. The rule nemo tenetur
seipsum accusare has, through the years, been modified or trenched upon by
statute and the privileges to which it gave rise have, in certain cases, been
conditioned or abrogated. The word ""charged"" in s. 4(1)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  makes it clear that the privilege mentioned in that section is
conferred to no other than a person charged with an offence, to whom it becomes
available on no occasion and time other than when the prosecution against him
for that offence is actually proceeded with in the criminal Courts. The
provisions of s. 5(1)  and (2)  of the Canada Evidence Act  are unqualified
and of general application. Subject only to some exceptions which do not apply
at a coroner's inquest, no one—other than a person charged of an offence, on
the occasion and at the time at which he is actually proceeded against for that
offence—is excused on the ground that the answers he might give may tend to
incriminate him. If a co-accused, of which the prosecution is not actually
proceeded with in the criminal Courts, is a compellable and competent witness
when called to testify in the prosecution of another co-accused, a fortiori
a person, whether charged or not with an offence is a compellable and competent
witness at a coroner's inquest where no one is regarded by law as an accused.

The appellant could not be excused and was bound by s. 5(1)  of
the Canada Evidence Act , but was entitled to the protection of subs. 2.
He was also protected by s. 2(d) of the Canadian Bill of Rights.

Le Juge en Chef Taschereau et les Juges
Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie et Spence: Le droit criminel en force
dans la Saskatchewan est celui de l'Angleterre tel qu'il existait le 15 juillet
1870, excepté tel qu'amendé, varié, modifié ou affecté par le Code criminel 
ou tout autre statut du parlement du Canada. Sous le régime de ce droit tel
qu'il existait à cette date, une personne accusée de meurtre et attendant son
procès ne pouvait pas être contrainte de témoigner à l'enquête relativement au
décès de la personne dont elle était accusée d'avoir causé la mort. Aucun
changement n'a été fait à ce droit par l'effet combiné des arts. 2, 4(1) et 5
de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada  et des arts. 448 et 488(3) du Code
criminel . Ces articles de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada  n'ont pas
l'effet de rendre un accusé un témoin contraignable à l'enquête du coroner. Il
faudrait des mots précis pour apporter un changement aussi complet au droit tel
qu'il existait en 1870. Ce serait une étrange inconsistance si la loi qui
protège soigneusement un accusé contre la contrainte de faire une déclaration à
l'enquête préliminaire, permettait que cette enquête soit ajournée pour que la
poursuite ait l'opportunité d'amener l'accusé devant un coroner et de la
soumettre contre sa volonté à un interrogatoire et contre-interrogatoire sur sa
prétendue culpabilité. En l'absence de mots précis dans une loi du parlement ou
autre autorité irrésistible, ceci n'est pas la loi. La cause de R. v.
Barnes, 36 C.C.C. 40, non suivie.

En promulguant l'art. 15 du Coroner's Act
dans son état présent, la législature avait l'intention de changer la loi et de
rendre une personne accusée de meurtre contraignable à rendre témoignage à
l'enquête relativement au décès de sa prétendue victime. Une telle législation
empiète sur la règle exprimée dans la maxime nemo tenetur seipsum accusare.
Toute législation dont le but est de faire un tel changement dans la loi ou
d'abroger ou de modifier les règles existantes qui protègent une personne
accusée d'un crime contre la contrainte de témoigner contre elle-même est une
législation concernant le droit criminel, y compris la procédure en matières
criminelles, et conséquemment de l'autorité législative exclusive du parlement
en vertu de l'art. 91(27) de la Loi de l'Amérique britannique du Nord.

[Page 468]

Le Juge Fauteux, dissident: La proposition
que la compétence et la contraignabilité d'une personne d'être assignée comme
témoin doivent être déterminées en référant seulement à l'instance particulière
dans laquelle on se propose d'assigner la personne comme témoin, est une règle
qui reçoit son application même dans un procès criminel où plusieurs personnes,
quoique accusées conjointement, subissent leur procès séparément. Dans de tels
cas, il est de règle bien arrêtée qu'aucune de ces personnes n'est considérée
comme une personne accusée ou une partie au procès des autres. Sous le régime
de notre droit, il n'y a aucune partie, aucun accusé à l'enquête du coroner, et
c'est seulement à la conclusion de l'enquête que peut survenir la possibilité
qu'une personne soit accusée d'avoir commis un meurtre et alors contrainte, par
mandat du coroner, de se présenter devant les Cours criminelles. Avec les
années, la règle nemo tenetur seipsum accusare a été modifiée ou
empiétée par les statuts, et les privilèges qui en découlent ont en certains
cas été conditionnés ou abrogés. L'expression « accusé » dans l'art.
4(1)  de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada  démontre clairement que le
privilège mentionné dans cet article est conféré à nulle autre personne que la
personne accusée d'un crime, à qui il devient accessible à nulle autre occasion
et temps que lorsqu'elle est actuellement poursuivie pour ce crime devant les
Cours criminelles. Les dispositions de l'art. 5(1)  et (2)  de la Loi sur la
preuve au Canada  sont absolues et d'application générale. Sujet seulement à
quelques exceptions qui n'ont pas d'application à l'enquête du coroner, aucune
personne—autre qu'une personne accusée d'un crime, à l'occasion et au temps où
elle est actuellement poursuivie pour ce crime—est exemptée pour le motif que
les réponses qu'elle pourrait donner pourraient tendre à l'incriminer. Si un co-accusé,
qui n'est pas actuellement poursuivi devant les Cours criminelles, est un
témoin contraignable et compétent lorsqu'il est assigné à témoigner au procès
de son co-accusé, a fortiori une personne, qu'elle soit accusée ou non
d'un crime est un témoin contraignable et compétent à l'enquête du coroner où
personne n'est considéré par la loi comme étant un accusé.

L'appelant ne pouvait pas être exempté et
était lié par l'art. 5(1)  de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada , mais avait
droit à la protection de l'alinéa (2). Il était aussi protégé par l'art. 2(d)
de la Loi sur la déclaration canadienne des droits.

Attorney General for Alberta.

The judgment of Taschereau C. J.
and Cartwright, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J.:—This appeal is
brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the Court
of Appeal for Saskatchewan[3] dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Bence
C.J.Q.B. whereby the appellant's application for an order or writ of
prohibition was dismissed.

The facts are not in dispute.

One Allan Thomas died at Glaslyn, Saskatchewan, on May 12,
 1963. On the same day the Coroner, J.
E. Nunn, commenced the holding of an inquest into the death. Later on the same
day the appellant and eight other men were arrested and each of them was
separately charged with the non-capital murder of Thomas. The Coroner then
discharged the jury and closed the inquest as he was required to do by the
terms of s.8(a) (2) of The Coroners Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 106, as amended
by Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1960, c. 14. Subsequently, on a date not given in
the record, the Attorney General for Saskatchewan directed, pursuant to the last mentioned sub-section,
that the inquest be reopened. On May 18,
 1963, the appellant and the eight
others charged were granted bail. June 12, 1963,
was set for the preliminary hearing of the charges against the appellant and
the other eight persons also charged. The Coroner fixed the same date for the
commencement of the reopened inquest. On June 12, 1963,
at the request of the Attorney General, the preliminary hearings were adjourned
until after the conclusion of the inquest.

The inquest opened on June 12, 1963, and
continued on June 13 and June 14. During this time twenty-two witnesses were
called and examined. The appellant and each of the other persons charged with
the murder of Thomas had been served with a Coroner's subpoena requiring
attendance at the inquest and all were present. On June 14, counsel

[Page 470]

appointed by the Attorney General
to act for the Crown at the inquest stated that he intended to call the
appellant and each of the other accused persons as witnesses at the inquest.
Counsel for all of the accused objected that neither the Coroner nor the Crown
could compel a person already charged with the murder of Thomas, whose death
was being investigated, to be sworn as a witness at the inquest. After hearing
argument the Coroner ruled that each of the accused was a compellable witness
at the inquest and must give evidence. In his brief reasons the Coroner stated
that he was bound to rule as he did by the Saskatchewan legislation. His
reasons do not indicate whether the constitutional validity of that legislation
had been questioned in argument before him.

Following this ruling, at the
request of counsel for the appellant, the Coroner adjourned the inquest sine
die to permit the bringing of an application for prohibition. While this
application was pending Mr. Nunn, the Coroner, died and the proceedings have
been continued with the Attorney General for Saskatchewan substituted as
respondent.

The application for prohibition
came in due couse before Bence C.J.Q.B. and was dismissed. There is nothing in
the material filed in support of the application or in the reasons of the
learned Chief Justice to indicate that the validity of any provision of The
Coroners Act was questioned.

The learned Chief Justice
followed the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Rex v. Barnes[4]
in which it was held, affirming the decision of Orde J., that Barnes who was
charged with manslaughter in the death of one Rossiter was a compellable
witness at an inquest being held to inquire into Rossiter's death. In the Court
of Appeal Meredith C.J.C.P. expressed the opinion that while Barnes was
compellable to be sworn as a witness at the inquest it would not be lawful to
examine him in any way regarding the charge pending against him; this view was
not shared by any other member of the Court of Appeal or by Orde J.

Having quoted ss. 8(a) and 15 of The
Coroners Act and s. 5  of The Canada Evidence Act , Bence, C.J. Q.B.
said in part:

The provisions of The Coroners
Act, which I have quoted, and Section 5  of the Canada Evidence Act  seem to me
to be quite clear.

[Page 471]

The applicant herein is
called as a witness to give evidence as to his knowledge of what took place.
Authority to call him is contained in The Coroners Act and the Canada Evidence
Act  stipulates that he shall not be excused.

In my view there should be
no such limitations on the questions put to him as were suggested by Meredith,
C.J., in the Barnes case, which I have quoted.

The appellant appealed to the
Court of Appeal; paragraph 2 of the notice of appeal reads as follows:

The Coroner's Court is a
Criminal Court of Record and Sections 8a and 15 of The Coroners Act, R.S.S.
1953, as amended by chapter 14 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1960, on which
the said judgment is wholly, or partly, based, were and are ultra vires of the
Province, being enactments dealing with Criminal Law and Procedure.

The unanimous judgment of the
Court of Appeal[5] was
delivered by Culliton C. J. S. holding (i) that the impugned sections of The
Coroners Act are intra vires of the legislature as being in relation
to the administration of justice in the province rather than in relation to the
criminal law or the procedure in criminal matters, (ii) that, even if the
impugned sections were held to be invalid, the combined effect of ss. 2  and
5(1)  of the Canada Evidence Act  would render the appellant a compellable
witness at the inquest; and (iii) that the provisions of the Canadian Bill
of Rights were not contravened, because the appellant, although compelled
to testify at the inquest, would be entitled to the protection afforded by s.
5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act . In the result the appeal was dismissed.

It will be convenient to consider
first what the position of the appellant, when called upon to take the witness
stand at the inquest in Saskatchewan, would be under the existing law apart from the
provisions of the impugned sections of The Coroners Act.

By the combined effect of s. 7,
of the Criminal Code , 1954, 2-3- Eliz. II, c. 51, s. 16 of the Saskatchewan
Act, Statutes of Canada, 1905, 4-5- Ed. VII, c. 42 and s. 11 of the Northwest
Territories Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 50, the criminal law in force in
Saskatchewan is that of England as it existed on July 15, 1870, except as altered,
varied, modified or affected by the Criminal Code  or any other act of
the Parliament of Canada.

In 1870 a person accused of crime
and the spouse of such person were incompetent to testify at trial either for
or

[Page 472]

against the accused. This incompetency
was done away with as to some offences by s. 216 of The Criminal Procedure
Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 174, but as to most offences, including that of
murder, it was preserved by s. 217 of that Act and continued until the coming
into force of The Canada Evidence Act , 1893, 56 Vict., c. 31. That Act
came into force on July 1, 1893, and on the same day The Criminal Procedure
Act was repealed.

Section 4  of The Canada
Evidence Act  as originally enacted read as follows:

4. Every person charged with
an offence, and the wife or husband, as the case may be, of the person so
charged, shall be a competent witness, whether the person so charged is charged
solely or jointly with any other person. Provided, however, that no husband
shall be competent to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during
their marriage, and no wife shall be competent to disclose any communication
made to her by her husband during their marriage.

2. The failure of the person
charged, or of the wife or husband of such person, to testify, shall not be
made the subject of comment by the judge or by counsel for the prosecution in
addressing the jury.

In Gosselin v. The King[6]
, the majority of the Court expressed the opinion that the effect of this
section, read with s. 5 , was to render an accused and his spouse not merely
competent but compellable. We need not pause to inquire whether this opinion
was well-founded as the Act was amended by 1906, 6 Ed. VII, c. 10,
s. 1, by the insertion of the words ""for the defence"" after the word
""witness"".

The present form of s. 4(1)  is as
follows:

4 (1) Every person charged
with an offence, and, except as in this section otherwise provided, the wife or
husband, as the case may be, of the person so charged, is a competent witness
for the defence, whether the person so charged is charged solely or jointly
with any other person.

Section 5  is as follows:

5. (1) No witness shall be
excused from answering any question upon the ground that the answer to such
question may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a
civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person.

(2) Where with respect to
any question a witness objects to answer upon the ground that his answer may
tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil
proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person, and if but for this
Act, or the Act of any provincial legislature, the witness would therefore have
been excused from answering such question, then although the witness is by
reason of this Act, or by reason of such provincial Act, compelled to answer,
the answer so given shall not be used or receivable in evidence against him in
any criminal trial, or other criminal proceeding against him thereafter taking
place, other than a prosecution for perjury in the giving of such evidence.

[Page 473]

It is now clear that a person who
is being tried on a criminal charge is a competent witness if he decides to
testify but that he cannot be compelled by the prosecution to enter the witness
box. If he decides to testify he is subject to cross-examination and
compellable to answer any relevant questions put to him on cross-examination
although his answers may tend to establish his guilt of the charge on which he
is being tried.

It seems equally clear that where
two or more persons are. either jointly or separately, indicted for one offence
and are tried separately one of those indicted who is not on trial is a
compellable witness, for either the prosecution or the defence, at the trial of
any of his co-accused. On this point it is sufficient to refer to the case of Re
Regan[7]
where the history and reasons of the rule are fully covered in the arguments of
counsel and in the judgments.

In the case at bar, it is clear
that had the preliminary hearing of the charge against the appellant proceeded
he could not have been compelled to testify, and that it would have been the
duty of the presiding justice to warn him, in the terms prescribed by s. 454(1) 
of the Criminal Code , that he was not bound to say anything.

We have not been referred to any
case in England in which an accused awaiting trial on a charge of
the murder of the person whose death was under investigation was compelled to
give evidence at the inquest. It is unlikely that such a case would arise after
the passing of s. 20 of the Coroners (Amendment) Act 1926, 16 and 17
Geo. V, c. 59; but if the power to compel such an accused person to testify
existed previously it would seem strange that it was never exercised. In Ex
parte Cook[8] ,
an application was made to the Court of Queen's Bench at the instance of the
Coroner who was conducting an inquest on the body of one Hannah Moore for a
writ to bring before the Coroner and jury one Cook who was in custody in
Newgate awaiting trial on a charge of having wilfully murdered her. His
presence was stated to be required for two purposes, (i) to give evidence as to
the deceased's state of mind, it being alleged that Cook and the deceased had
entered into a suicide pact and that Cook was the only person who knew her and
(ii) so that the witnesses called at the inquest could identify Cook. The

[Page 474]

writ was refused. In commenting
on this case it is suggested in Jervis on Coroners, 4th ed., (1880), at
page 214 that an order of the nature sought ""will generally be made if the
prisoner is not the party under accusation; or, if he is accused or suspected,
then when he is desirous of making a statement, and perhaps also when his
presence is requisite for the purpose of identification"".

In the course of the argument
Patteson J, at page 658, asked counsel the question:—""Have you an instance
where a writ has been granted to bring up a prisoner before a Coroner?""
and the answer was ""None has been found"".

Earlier in the argument,
Coleridge J. had said at page 657:

I think it is usual, on a
motion of this nature, to state the readiness of the party to come: at all
events when he is to come as a witness.

Williams J. said at page 660:

No case of inconvenience has
existed in the Coroner's: Court for centuries, by reason of no such writ having
been granted.

In each of the cases of The
King v. Scorey[9]
and Wakley v. Cooke[10] ,
referred to by counsel for the respondent, the Coroner was criticized for
having refused to hear evidence tendered on behalf of a person suspected of
being criminally responsible for the death of the person which was under
investigation. In the latter case at page 518, Alderson B. said:

Then comes the question
whether the other part of the direction was correct. The direction had
reference to the practice which prevailed in the examination of persons before
inquests held in Middlesex, in refusing to examine parties whose conduct might
afterwards become the subject of a criminal inquiry. I quite agree with what my
Brother Parke has said upon the matter. I hope that the practice will be
discontinued, for it is highly improper, and that persons will be permitted to
make any statements they may wish, when they have any material information to
communicate. The refusal to accept a person's testimony casts a gross imputation
upon him. A person who comes before a coroner cannot be considered as being a
party accused, and he is not so until after a verdict has been found. Such a
practice is monstrous and most harassing, and I hope it will be discontinued
for the future, and that people will be allowed to make statements. They are
not bound to criminate themselves, and ought to be told so at the time.

There is nothing in the judgments
in either of these cases to suggest that a person charged with the murder of a
person into whose death an inquest was being held could be compelled to testify
at such inquest.

[Page 475]

In Stephen's History of the
Criminal Law of England, (1883), vol. 1, at pp. 440 and 441, the learned author
after pointing out that soon after the revolution of 1688 the practice of
questioning the prisoner died out continues at page 441:

…the statutes of Philip and
Mary already referred to, repealed and re-enacted in 1826 by 7 Geo. 4, c. 64
authorized committing magistrates to ""take the examination"" of the
person suspected. This examination (unless it was taken upon oath, which was
regarded as moral compulsion) might be given in evidence against the prisoner.

This state of the law
continued till the year 1848, when by the 11 and 12 Vic. c. 42, the present
system was established, under which the prisoner is asked whether he wishes to
say anything, and is warned that if he chooses to do so what he says will be
taken down and may be given in evidence on his trial. The result of the whole
is that as matters stand the prisoner is absolutely protected against all
judicial questioning before or at the trial, and that, on the other hand, he
and his wife are prevented from giving evidence in their own behalf. He is
often permitted, however, to make any statement he pleases at the very end of
the trial, when it is difficult for any one to test the correctness of what is
said.

On a consideration of the cases
and works of text-writers referred to above and of numerous others which were
referred to in the full and helpful arguments of counsel I have reached the
conclusion that under the law of England as of July 15, 1870, a person charged
with murder and awaiting trial could not be compelled to testify at an inquest
into the death of the deceased with whose murder he was charged and it is
necessary to consider whether this state of the law has been altered by any Act
of the Parliament of Canada.

It has been submitted that an
alteration has been made by the combined effect of ss. 2 , 4(1)  and 5  of the Canada
Evidence Act  and ss. 448  and 488(3)  of the Criminal Code .

Sections 4(1)  and 5  of the Canada
Evidence Act  have already been quoted. Section 2  is as follows:

2. This Part applies to all
criminal proceedings, and to all civil proceedings and other matters whatsoever
respecting which the Parliament of Canada has jurisdiction in this behalf.

Sections 448  and 488(3)  of the Criminal
Code  are as follows:

448. (1) Where a person is
alleged, by a verdict upon a coroner's inquisition, to have committed murder or
manslaughter but he has not been charged with the offence, the coroner shall

(a) direct, by warrant under
his hand, that the person be taken into custody and be conveyed, as soon as
possible before a justice, or

(b) direct the person to
enter into a recognizance before him with or without sureties, to appear before
a justice. 

[Page 476]

(2) Where a coroner makes a
direction under subsection (1) he shall transmit to the justice the evidence
taken before him in the matter.

488. (3) …

No person shall be tried
upon a coroner's inquisition.

The effect of the sections of the
Canada Evidence Act , referred to above, was to give to a person charged
with crime the right to be a witness in his own defence, it was not to enable
the prosecution to call him as a witness. The choice as to whether or not he
would give evidence was given to the accused alone and if he chose not to
testify comment by the judge or by counsel for the prosecution was forbidden.
None of this is challenged; but it is said that the sections have the effect of
rendering the accused a compellable witness at the inquest into the death which
he is charged with having caused by his criminal act.

If I am right in the view, which
I have already expressed, that in 1870 the accused would not have been a
compellable witness at such an inquest, it would, in my opinion, require clear
words to bring about so complete a change in the law. Section 5  does not
purport to say who shall or shall not be compelled to take the witness stand.
It deals with the rights and obligations of a witness who is already on the
stand. It does not protect him from the use against him of the answers he makes
in the proceeding in which he makes them but only in ""proceedings
thereafter taking place"". Let it be supposed that the only evidence given
before the coroner which in any way implicated the accused was that of the
accused himself; such evidence would warrant the jury in bringing in a verdict
alleging that the accused had committed murder or manslaughter. It is true that
such a verdict would not constitute an adjudication that the accused was guilty
but equally the decision of the justice presiding at the preliminary hearing
that the accused should be committed for trial is not such an adjudication. It
would be a strange inconsistency if the law which carefully protects an accused
from being compelled to make any statement at a preliminary inquiry should
permit that inquiry to be adjourned in order that the prosecution be permitted
to take the accused before a coroner and submit him against his will to
examination and cross-examination as to his supposed guilt. In the absence of
clear words in an Act of Parliament or other compelling authority I am unable
to agree that that is the state of the law.

[Page 477]

The conclusion which I have
reached necessarily involves the view that Rex v. Barnes, supra, was
wrongly decided and ought not to be followed.

All that I have so far said is as
to the applicable law apart from the provisions of the impugned sections of The
Coroners Act. These are as follows:

8a. (1) Where a person has
been charged with a criminal offence arising out of a death, an inquest
touching the death shall be held only upon the direction of the Attorney
General.

(2) Where during an inquest
any person is charged with a criminal offence arising out of the death, the
coroner shall discharge the jury and close the inquest, and shall then proceed
as if he had determined that an inquest was unnecessary, provided that the
Attorney General may direct that the inquest be reopened.

***

15. (1) The coroner and jury
shall at the first sitting of the inquest view the body unless a view has been
dispensed with under section 9 or 10, and the coroner shall examine on oath,
touching the death, all persons who tender their evidence respecting the facts
and all persons who in his opinion are likely to have knowledge of relevant
facts.

(2) Subject to subsection
(3), no person giving evidence at the inquest shall be excused from answering a
question upon the ground that the answer thereto may tend to criminate him or
may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of
the Crown or of any person or to a prosecution under any Act of the
Legislature, but if he objects to answering the question upon any such ground
he shall be entitled to the protection afforded by section 5  of the Canada
Evidence Act  and by section 33 of the Saskatchewan Evidence Act.

(3) Before a person gives
evidence at the inquest subsection (2) shall be read to him by the coroner.

(4) A person giving evidence
at the inquest may be represented by counsel who may examine and cross-examine
witnesses called at the inquest and may on behalf of his client take the
objection mentioned in subsection (2).

***

20. Counsel appointed by the
Attorney General to act for the Crown, at an inquest may attend thereat and may
examine or cross-examine the witnesses called, and the coroner shall summon any
witness required on behalf of the Crown.

Considered by themselves, without
regard to the history of the Act, and bearing in mind the rule that the
intention to legislate outside its allotted field is not lightly to be imputed
to the legislature, these sections could, I think, be construed as not
rendering a person charged with an offence arising out of the death compellable
to give evidence at the inquest; but when s. 15 as it now reads is contrasted
with its predecessor s. 15 which was repealed by Statutes of Saskatchewan,
1960, c. 14, s. 3, this construction scarcely seems possible.

[Page 478]

The earlier s. 15 read as
follows:

The coroner and jury shall,
at the first sitting of the inquest, view the body, unless a view has been
dispensed with under section 9 or 10, and the coroner shall examine on oath,
touching the death, all persons who tender their evidence respecting the facts
and all persons whom he thinks it expedient to examine as being likely to have
knowledge of relevant facts; provided that a person who is suspected of causing
the death, or who has been charged or is likely to be charged with an offence
relating to the death, shall not be compellable to give evidence at the
inquest, and if he does so shall not be cross-examined and provided further
that before such person gives any evidence this section shall be read to him by
the coroner.

I think the conclusion
inescapable that by enacting s. 15 in its present form the legislature intended
to change the law and to render a person charged with murder compellable to
give evidence at the inquest on the body of his alleged victim. Such
legislation trenches upon the rule expressed in the maxim nemo tenetur seipsum
accusare which has been described (by Coleridge J. in R. v. Scott[11]
) as ""a maxim of our law as settled, as important and as wise as
almost any other in it."" This rule has long formed part of the criminal
law of England and of this country. With great respect for the
contrary view expressed in the Court of Appeal, I am of opinion that any
legislation, purporting to make the change in the law referred to in the first
sentence of this paragraph or to abrogate or alter the existing rules which
protect a person charged with crime from being compelled to testify against
himself, is legislation in relation to the Criminal Law including the Procedure
in Criminal Matters and so within the exclusive legislative authority of the
Parliament of Canada under head 27 of s. 91 of the British North America
Act.

Questions other than those with
which I have dealt above were raised in the course of the argument but I do not
find it necessary to deal with them.

I would allow the appeal, set
aside the judgments in the courts below and direct that an order issue
prohibiting any coroner in the Province
 of Saskatchewan from requiring the appellant to attend as a witness
or to give evidence at any inquest or at the continuation of any inquest into
the death of Allan Thomas. I would make no order as to costs.

FAUTEUX J. (dissenting):—This is
an appeal, with leave of this Court, from a unanimous judgment of the Court of

[Page 479]

Appeal of Saskatchewan[12] dismissing the appeal of the appellant from the
judgment of Bence C.J. Q.B. denying appellant's application for a Writ of
Prohibition against Coroner J. E. Nunn of Saskatchewan.

The material facts may be
summarized. One Allan Thomas died at Glaslyn, Saskatchewan, on May 12, 1963 and, on the same
day, Coroner Nunn opened an inquest into his death. Later in the day, appellant
and eight other persons were arrested and separately charged with the non-capital
murder of Thomas. The Coroner then discharged the jury and closed his inquest,
as he was required by s. 8a(2) of the Coroners Act, R.S.S. 1953, c. 106,
as amended by c. 14 of the 1960 Statutes of Saskatchewan. The following day,
May 13, each of the accused was separately arraigned and remanded in custody to
await Preliminary Inquiry which, contrary to s. 451 (b) of the Criminal Code ,
was then set at a time exceeding eight clear days, to wit, to June 12, 1963. On
May 18, each of the accused was admitted to bail by an order of Disbery J. On
the date fixed for the Preliminary Inquiry, June 12, 1963, the Coroner's
inquest was reopened by direction of the Attorney General for Saskatchewan and,
on the same day, the Preliminary Inquiry was adjourned to an undetermined date,
to wit, to the date following the conclusion of the inquest, which, because of
the present proceedings, was and now stands adjourned sine die. Whether,
in the circumstances, jurisdiction to proceed with the particular
""information"" laid against appellant on May 12, 1963, has been lost as
a result of these adjournments of the Preliminary Inquiry, is a question which
remains open and one which, if answered affirmatively, destroys the very basis
upon which the application for Prohibition is predicated However, and in view
of the conclusion I have reached on the other aspects of the case, it is
unnecessary to determine this particular question of jurisdiction.

The Coroner's inquest, reopened
on June 12, 1963, had proceeded for three days during which twenty-three
witnesses were examined when, on the fourth day, counsel then acting for the
Crown, declared his intention to call and examine as witnesses, pursuant to s.
20 of the Coroners Act, appellant and the other accused who, having been
summoned as witnesses, were present before the Coroner.

[Page 480]

Counsel acting for appellant and
the other accused objected to the right of the Coroner or the Crown to compel
appellant or any of these persons to give evidence, in view of the fact that
each of them had been accused of the murder of Thomas. Having heard the
argument related to the merits of this submission, the Coroner eventually ruled
that each of them was a compellable witness at his inquest. Hence the
application for Prohibition which, as above indicated, was dismissed by Bench
C. J. Q.B., as was the appeal entered against this dismissal.

Bence C.J. Q.B. relied mainly on Rex
v. Barnes[13].
This case being the leading case in the matter, it is pertinent to consider its
circumstances and the views expressed in the various reasons for judgment.

Barnes was charged with
manslaughter in the death of one Rossiter and, after Preliminary Inquiry, was
committed to trial by a magistrate. Shortly thereafter,—and not prior to any
committal or even the beginning of a Preliminary Inquiry, as in the present
case where there was only an ""information"" laid against appellant—,Barnes
was subpoenaed to attend a Coroner's inquest into Rossiter's death. Appearing
at the inquest, he refused to give evidence or to hold himself bound by the
subpoena, on the ground that he was neither a competent nor compellable witness
at the inquest at the instance of the Crown, there being pending against him a
charge of manslaughter upon which he had been committed to trial. He applied
for an Order prohibiting the Coroner from issuing any further process or
warrant to compel him to give evidence at the inquest. Orde J., to whom this
application was directed in first instance, wrote a considered judgment. He
noted particularly the admission made by counsel for Barnes that had the latter
been called upon to give evidence before the criminal charge had been laid
against him, he would have been bound by reason of the provisions of s. 5  of
the Canada Evidence Act  to answer any questions put to him,
notwithstanding that his answers might tend to criminate him, the only
protection afforded him being that his answers could not be used or received in
evidence against him in any criminal trial or criminal procedure. Orde J. then
said he could find no ground to support the submission that the fact that
Barnes was not a compellable witness in the

[Page 481]

criminal proceedings pending
against him exempted him from being compelled to give evidence at the inquest
of the Coroner. He said:

The competency or the
compellability of a person to be called as a witness must be governed by the
nature of the proceeding in which that question arises. There is here no real
connection between the proceedings before the coroner and those before the
Magistrate or the Supreme Court of Ontario in the criminal proceedings.

The proceedings therein are
entirely distinct. If a civil action were now proceeding, in which the question
of the responsibility for the accident in which Rossiter was killed was
involved, Barnes could be compelled to give evidence and to answer even though
his answers tended to criminate him: Re Ginsberg (1917), 38 D.L.R. 261, 40
O.L.R. 136. And I am unable to see how the fact that he is a defendant in
certain criminal proceedings, in which he is not a compellable witness, can
entitle him to exemption in all other proceedings. The question of competency
or compellability must be determined with reference to the particular
proceeding in which it is proposed to call the person as a witness, and not
with reference to some other proceeding. And I can see no distinction in
principle between the coroner's Court and any other Court in this respect. I cannot,
therefore, discover any ground upon which Barnes is entitled to claim exemption
from giving evidence upon the inquest now pending.

With this view of the law, I am
in respectful agreement. The proposition that the competency and compellability
of a person to be called as a witness must be determined with reference to the
particular proceeding in which it is proposed to call the person as a witness,
and not with reference to some other proceeding, is a rule that receives an
application even in criminal trials where several persons, though jointly
indicted, are proceeded against separately. In such cases, it is settled law
that neither one is regarded as an accused person or a party in the trial
against the others. This question was particularly considered by the Nova
Scotia Supreme Court (in banco) in Re Regan[14] .
At page 598, the Court said:

Regan is not an accused
person in the proceedings against Tanner, and the provisions of the Common
Law and statute rendering an accused person on his trial not compellable as a
witness for the prosecution against himself are therefore not applicable to
him. Insofar as any prosecution against Regan himself is concerned, he can
avail himself of the provisions of sec. 5  of The Canada Evidence Act  R.S. Can.,
1927, C. 59) and thus any evidence given by him on the proceedings against
Tanner cannot be used against him in the proceedings against himself.

A similar matter was recently
considered by the Court of Appeal in England in William Gerald Boal, Roger John

[Page 482]

Cordrey[15]
. B. and C. were jointly indicated
for, inter alia, conspiracy to stop and rob a mail train and for robbery
with aggravation. On both counts, B. pleaded not guilty, and C. pleaded guilty
to the count of conspiracy but not guilty to the count of robbery. The Court
directed that the count of robbery should not be proceeded with with respect to
C. without leave of the Court. B. was found guilty on both counts. In appeal,
B. sought leave to call what was alleged to be ""fresh evidence"", to
wit, the evidence of C. who was said to be then prepared to testify that B. had
played the minor part in the affair. The submission that C. would have been a
competent but not a compellable witness at the trial of B. under the Criminal
Evidence Act, 1898, was rejected. The ratio of the decision is
formulated as follows at page 345:

This court takes the view
that Cordrey was a competent and compellable witness at the trial and that, not
being charged with an offence actually within the consideration of the jury
at the time, he was not to be regarded as a ""person charged""
within the meaning of section 1 of the Act of 1898.

The italics are mine.

That this has long been the law
in England is shown in Winsor v. The Queen[16] ,
where it was said that where two prisoners are jointly indicted for felony and
plead not guilty, but one only is ""given in charge"" to the jury, the
other is an admissible witness although his plea of not guilty remains in the
record undisposed of. Thus it appears that, under these provisions of the Criminal
Evidence Act and of the Canada Evidence Act  which deal with the
question of compellability and of competency of a witness, a person
""charged"" is no other than a person who, being accused of an offence,
is, at the time when the question arises, actually proceeded against for the
offence. In England, a Coroner's inquisition is a mode of criminal
prosecution, the finding of a Coroner's inquest accusing a person of causing
the death of another, when held by a jury, is equivalent to the preferment and
signing of a bill of indictment and the prisoner may be prosecuted upon such
inquisition. Archbold, Criminal Pleading Evidence and Practice, Thirty-fifth
edition 314. Such is not the case in Canada; and this, with

[Page 483]

respect to the compellability and
competency of a witness, is a fundamental difference. Sections 488  and 448  of
the Criminal Code  provide:

488. (1) Except as provided
in this Part no bill of indictment shall be preferred.

(2) No criminal information
shall be laid or granted.

(3) No person shall be tried
upon a coroner's inquisition.

448. (1) Where a person is
alleged, by a verdict upon a coroner's inquisition, to have committed murder or
manslaughter, but he has not been charged with the offence, the coroner shall

(a) direct, by
warrant under his hand, that the person be taken into custody and be conveyed,
as soon as possible, before a justice, or

(b) direct the person
to enter into a recognizance before him with or without sureties, to appear
before a justice.

(2) Where a coroner makes a
direction under subsection (1) he shall transmit to the justice the evidence
taken before him in the matter.

The predecessor to s. 448  was s.
667, the opening words of which were:

667. Every coroner, upon any
inquisition taken before him whereby any person is charged with
manslaughter or murder …

It is significant that in the
1955 Revision of the Criminal Code , the word ""charged""
appearing in the former section has been replaced in the new by the words
""alleged … to have committed manslaughter or murder."" Under our law,
there is no party, no accused in a Coroner's inquest and it is only at the
conclusion of the inquest that may arise the possibility of a person being
alleged to have committed murder or manslaughter and then be compelled, by a
Coroner's warrant, to appear in the Criminal Courts. Notwithstanding these
fundamental differences between the Coroner's inquest in Canada and in
England, it is interesting to note the decision rendered in England in Re
Cook[17] .
In that case, an application was made to the Court of Queen's Bench, at the
instance of the Coroner who was conducting an inquest on the body of one Hannah
Moore, for a writ to bring Cook before a Coroner and a jury so that the latter
could be identified and give evidence before the Court. At the time of this application,
Cook stood committed upon a charge of having wilfully murdered Hannah Moore.
The writ was refused. However, this refusal was not founded on the reason that
Cook was not a compellable or competent witness, but on the inconveniences
attending upon his

[Page 484]

removal from the place of custody
and the lack of sufficient ground being shown for his attendance before the
Coroner. Coleridge J., as he then was, said:

I presume the Court decides
that it has power to grant the writ but that no necessity is made out on the
present occasion.

Had the Court been of opinion
that Cook was not a compellable and a competent witness, this would have been a
peremptory reason and there would have been no occasion to rest the decision on
the two grounds of inconvenience or lack of necessity for Cook's appearance at
the inquest.

The appeal in Rex v. Barnes,
supra, was heard by Meredith C.J. C.P. and Riddell, Latchford, Middleton
and Lennox JJ. Meredith C.J. C.P. said, at page 51:

On principle, therefore, it
is not lawful, or proper, to examine the appellant in the coroner's Court in
any way regarding the charge which is pending against him, as long as he is in
jeopardy in respect of it. But he may, in my opinion, be examined as a witness
in regard to the guilt of any other person, so long as the examination does not
touch in any way the charge against him.

and at page 52:

The result is that the
appellant was wrong in disobeying his subpoena: he may be examined as to the
guilt of others so long as the examination does not encroach upon his rights as
a person charged with crime.

With the exception of Lennox J.,
who left the question open, none of the other Judges accepted the limitation of
the examination suggested by Meredith C.J. C.P. Riddell J., at page 53, stated:

I can find nothing in our
legislation preventing the calling of any one as a witness before the coroner—had
Parliament intended to make an exception in the case of one accused or supposed
to be accused in some other Court or thought to be guilty of causing the death,
no doubt such a provision would have been made in the Code.

And, at page 56, he added:

Much has been said as to the
alleged hardship upon Barnes' in being compelled to give evidence—it is,
however, to be hoped that we have not yet arrived at the point that one accused
of crime has so many and so high rights that the people have none. The
administration of our law is not a game in which the cleverer and more astute
is to win, but a serious proceeding by a people in earnest to discover the
actual facts for the sake of public safety, the interest of the public
generally. It is the duty of every citizen to tell all he knows for the sake of
the people at large, their interest and security, and I am not inclined to
stretch in any way rules which are directed to permitting any one to escape
from the duties which all others admit and perform—it is for Parliament to
frame rules and exceptions, not for the Court.

[Page 485]

Middleton J., with the
concurrence of Latchford J., dealing particularly with s. 5  of the Canada
Evidence Act , said at page 57:

Section 5  deals with this
common law privilege and changes the Law, and now no witness shall be excused
from answering any question put to him upon the ground that his answering might
tend to criminate him. He is, however, granted some degree of protection, for
the evidence that he may give shall not be used or receivable in evidence
against him. That this protection is by no means as wide as that under the
common law rule is obvious, and the change in our law no doubt shocks those
whose mental inclination and training leads them to regard the common law
privilege as a sacred thing. See, for example, the statement of the late Chief
Justice of the King's Bench in Re Ginsberg, (1917) 27 Can. Cr. Cas. 447 where
he points out that the protection afforded by the Legislature does not in his
view, afford sufficient immunity, as the prosecutors are enabled to get
information from the accused which would enable them to get convicting evidence
aliunde without using his own evidence against him at all—that in fact the
proceedings amount to an examination for discovery in a criminal case,
""which cannot be"". The Appellate Division, 38 D.L.R. 261, did not
agree with this view, and in very fully considered judgments upheld not only the
validity but the effectiveness of the change in the law.

Finally Lennox J., having said
particularly, at page 59, that he had no right to advise or comment upon the
action or attitude of the Crown, concluded that he saw no reason to doubt the
correctness of the order appealed against.

Relying on these various excerpts
from the reasons of the Court of Appeal in the Barnes case, supra,
Bence C. J. Q.B., who heard the present case in first instance, added that the
authority to call the appellant and the other accused as witnesses to give
evidence as to their knowledge of what took place was contained in s. 8 (a) and
s. 15 of the Coroners Act and also that s. 5  of the Canada Evidence
Act  stipulated that they should not be excused. He also expressed his
disagreement with the limitation suggested by Meredith C. J. C.P. in the Barnes
case, supra.

The appeal in the Court of Appeal
of the Province of Saskatchewan
was heard by Culliton C.J.A. and Brownridge, Hall and Maguire JJ. A. At that
stage of the proceeding, appellant questioned the validity of ss. 8(a), 15 and
20 of the Coroners Act of Saskatchewan submitting that they were beyond the powers of the
provincial legislature in that such sections related to criminal law and
procedure. Chief Justice Culliton rendered the judgment for the Court. With
respect to the words ""Procedure in Criminal Matters"" 

[Page 486]

appearing in s. 91(27) of the B.N.A.
Act, he adopted the meaning ascribed thereto by Macdonald C.J.A., at
page 238, in In Re Public Inquiries Act[18] ,
to wit:

""Criminal Matters""
are, in my opinion, proceedings in the criminal Courts, and
""procedure"" means the steps to be taken in prosecutions or other
criminal proceedings in such Courts.

and he concluded:

In my opinion, the impugned
sections do not relate to steps to be taken in a prosecution or other criminal
proceeding, but rather, in pith and substance, relate to the administration of
justice within the province and are thus within the competence of the
Provincial Legislature.

He then said:

Even if I should be wrong in
this conclusion, the position of the appellant would not be improved. The
Coroner's Court being a criminal court, the provisions of the Canada Evidence
Act  apply to its proceedings.

***

While the Coroner's Court is
a criminal Court of record, it is a court of inquiry, not of accusation, and
the verdict of a coroner's jury does not bind any person whose conduct may be
involved in its findings and does not, in any way, constitute any adjudication
of rights affecting either person or property. There is no accused and there
are no parties. Wolfe v. Robinson (supra). Notwithstanding that the
accused has been charged of an offence arising out of the death being
investigated, he appears at the inquest as a witness and, as such, is bound by
the provisions of s. 5(1)  of the Canada Evidence Act . Rex v. Barnes (supra).
In giving evidence he is entitled to the protection given to him by subsection
2  of section 5  and by the corresponding provision of the Saskatchewan Evidence
Act.

Wolfe v. Robinson[19] was decided by Wells J. in a very fully considered
judgment.

Finally and with respect to the
submission of counsel for the appellant that an application of the law such as
the one contended for by respondent would be in contravention of s. 2(e)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights, Culliton C.J.A. said that the foregoing
section had no application and that s. 2(d) of the Canadian Bill of
Rights recognizes the right to compel a person to give evidence if he is
represented by counsel and given protection against self-incrimination and
that, inasmuch as appellant was represented by counsel at the inquest, he was
given the protection envisaged by the Canadian Bill of Rights.

The rule nemo tenetur seipsum
accusare, invoked on behalf of appellant, has, through the years, been modified
or

[Page 487]

trenched upon by statute and the
privileges to which it gave rise have, in certain cases, been conditioned or
abrogated. This is illustrated particularly in Walker
v. The King[20] and in Re Frilegh[21].
In the Walker case, supra, the Court had to consider the
validity of a provincial enactment compelling the person in charge of a
vehicle, directly or indirectly involved in an accident, to give certain
informations in relation thereto. Sir Lyman Duff C.J., relying particularly on Rex
v. Coote[22] ,
considered the impugned enactment as

a measure for securing
information which may be employed for the purposes of legal proceedings,
instituted either privately or ad vindicatam publicam

and stated that

there was no rule of law
that statements made by an accused under compulsion of statute are, because of
such compulsion alone, inadmissible against him in criminal proceedings.
Generally speaking, such statements are admissible unless they fall under the
scope of some specific enactment or rule excluding them.

In Re Frilegh, supra, a
debtor objected to submit to an examination, as any questions to be answered
might tend to incriminate him on a criminal charge preferred against him for an
offence under the Bankruptcy Act. The objection was rejected. The Court
relied on an amendment made in 1933, c. 31, s. 33(2), adding subs. (9), and
added that even prior to this amendment, a debtor was not entitled to object on
the alleged ground in view of Re Ginsberg[23]
and in view of the provisions of ss. 2  and 5  of the Canada
Evidence Act .

The relevant sections of the Canada
Evidence Act  to be here considered are s. 4(1)  and s. 5(1)  and (2) .

4. (1) Every person charged
with an offence, and, except as in this section otherwise provided, the
wife or husband, as the case may be, of the person so charged, is a
competent witness for the defence, whether the person so charged is
charged solely or jointly with any other person.

The words of s. 4(1) , here
italicized, make it clear that the privilege therein mentioned is conferred to
no other than a person charged with an offence, to whom it becomes available on
no occasion and time other than when the prosecution against him for that
offence is actually proceeded with under the Criminal Code , in the
criminal Courts.

[Page 488]

5. (1) No witness shall be
excused from answering any question upon the ground that the answer to such
question may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a
civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person.

(2) Where with respect to
any question a witness objects to answer upon the ground that his answer may
tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil
proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person, and if but for this
Act, or the Act of any provincial legislature, the witness would therefore have
been excused from answering such question, then although the witness is by
reason of this Act, or by reason of such provincial Act, compelled to answer,
the answer so given shall not be used or receivable in evidence against him in
any criminal trial, or other criminal proceeding against him thereafter taking
place, other than a prosecution for perjury in the giving of such evidence,
R.S., c. 59, s. 5.

By these provisions, the Canada
Evidence Act  removes the safeguard a person had at Common Law to refuse to
answer any questions that might criminate him. He is now obliged to do so but
such evidence may not be used against him if he claims the protection of the
Act. The provisions of s. 5 (1)  and (2)  are unqualified and of general
application. Subject only to some specific statutory exceptions of which none
applies at a Coroner's inquest, no one—other than a person charged of an
offence, on the occasion and at the time at which he is actually proceeded
against for that offence—is excused from being called to give evidence on the
ground that the answers he might give may tend to incriminate him. If a co-accused,
of which the prosecution is not actually proceeded with, under the Criminal
Code , in the criminal Courts, is a compellable and competent witness when
called to testify in the prosecution of another co-accused, a fortiori a
person, whether charged or not with an offence, is a compellable and competent
witness at a Coroner's inquest where no one is regarded by law as an accused,
at and for the purpose of that inquest, prior to the very time of its
conclusion. Being present and represented by counsel before the Coroner when
called to the witness stand, appellant's objection to testify could not obtain.

With deference to those who
entertain a contrary opinion, I am in respectful agreement with the conclusion
reached by Orde J. and the Court of Appeal for Ontario in the Barnes
case, supra, and with the conclusion reached by Bence C.J. Q.B. and the
Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, in the present case, with respect to the
application and effect of s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act .

[Page 489]

I also agree with the opinion
expressed in this case, in the Court below, as to appellant's submission based
on the Canadian Bill of Rights; and as to this, I only want to add the
following statement of our brother Ritchie, then speaking for the majority of
the Court, in Robertson and Rosetanni v. The Queen[24]
:

It is to be remembered that
the human rights and fundamental freedoms recognized by the Courts of Canada
before the enactment of the Canadian Bill of Rights and guaranteed by
that statute were the rights and freedoms of men living together in an
organized society subject to a rational, developed and civilized system of law
which imposed limitations on the absolute liberty of the individual.

In these views, it is unnecessary
to consider the arguments related to the constitutionality of the impugned
sections of the Coroners Act of Saskatchewan.

I would dismiss the appeal.

APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Habitual criminal—Notice of
application to have accused given preventive detention “in addition to”
sentence for substantive offence—Whether notice defective to the extent of nullity—Criminal
Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 660(1), 662(1)(a), 667.

Criminal law—Habitual
criminal—Procedure—County Court Judges’ Criminal Court—Application for sentence
of preventive detention—Application traversed to next sittings of Court in
January—Application finally heard in June—No adjournments meanwhile—Whether
proceedings had come to an end because of postponements and delay—Whether
County Court Judges’ Criminal Court a continuing Court.

The appellant was convicted in February 1962
on a charge of trafficking in drugs and was sentenced to ten years
imprisonment. While his appeal was pending he was served in May 1962 with an
application asking the Court to impose a sentence of preventive detention “in
addition to” the sentence imposed on the ground that he was a habitual
criminal. His appeal on the substantive offence was dismissed and this Court
refused to grant leave to appeal in October 1962. In December 1962, the Crown’s
request to have the application for preventive detention traversed to the next
Court of competent jurisdiction was granted. Because of lack of accommodation
at the Court house, the application was not heard until June 1963 despite
repeated efforts of Crown counsel to have it heard sooner. The application was
quashed by a judge of the County Court Judges’ Criminal Court on the grounds
that the notice was defective to the extent of nullity and that the application
had expired when it was not dealt with in January. The Court of Appeal held
that the application could be amended and that the County Court Judges’
Criminal Court was a continuing Court and adjournments from time to time were
not necessary to keep the application alive. The application was ordered
remitted to a judge of the County Court Judges’ Criminal Court. The accused was
granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held (Cartwright
J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Taschereau
C.J. and Fauteux, Judson and Spence JJ.: Section 660(1)  of the Criminal
Code , as amended by 1960-61 (Can.), c. 43, s. 33(1), leaves no room for
doubt that the only sentence of preventive detention which could be imposed is
“in lieu of” any other sentence, not “in addition to”. The essence of the
notice is that a sentence of preventive detention would be sought. This could
only be under the existing law. The error in the notice was contained in
something that was superfluous. The nullity was to be found in the error and
not in the essential function of the notice. There was no need to amend the
notice. The contention that the notice was given under a repealed
section of the Code could not be accepted.

[Page 313]

The application had not come to an end
because of repeated postponements and delay. The delays were justified in this
case. The County Court Judges’ Criminal Court is a continuing Court before
which the application was pending until it was heard.

The fact that an accused may have
unsuccessfully appealed against the sentence imposed upon him for a substantive
offence could not operate as a bar to proceeding against him as a habitual
criminal.

Although the Court of Appeal had power under
s. 667(2) (b) of the Code to impose a sentence of preventive
detention, it could not take such action because the application had not been
heard. It could, in these circumstances, only say that the quashing of the
notice was erroneous.

Per Cartwright
J., dissenting: The notice served upon the appellant was fatally
defective. The argument that the notice was sufficient and that the words “in
addition to” were mere surplusage, could not be accepted. A notice that the
Court will be asked to do something which is clearly illegal and beyond its
powers could not form a valid foundation for a criminal proceeding of the most
serious sort, in which it is sought to deprive a man of his liberty for the
rest of his life. The amendment ordered by the Court of Appeal was ineffective
as it was not made until long after the period of three months fixed by the s.
662 had expired. It has long been the settled policy of English criminal law
that as against a prisoner every rule in his favour must be observed.

L’appelant fut trouvé coupable en février
1962 d’avoir fait le trafic de stupéfiants et a été condamné à dix ans
d’emprisonnement. Alors que son appel était devant la Cour d’Appel, il reçut
signification en mai 1962 d’une demande demandant à la Cour d’imposer une
sentence de détention préventive «en plus de» la sentence déjà imposée pour le
motif qu’il était un repris de justice. Son appel contre le verdict pour
l’offense originale fut rejeté et cette Cour refusa permission d’appeler en
octobre 1962. La Couronne fit application en décembre 1962 pour remettre la
demande de détention préventive à la prochaine Cour de juridiction compétente.
Cette demande fut accordée. Dû à un manque d’aménagement au palais de justice,
la demande ne fut pas entendue avant le 6 de juin 1963 malgré les efforts du
procureur de la Couronne pour qu’elle soit entendue plus tôt. La demande fut
rejetée par le juge de la County Court Judges’ Criminal Court pour le
motif que l’avis était défectueux jusqu’au point de nullité et que la demande
avait

[Page 314]

expiré lorsqu’elle n’avait pas été entendue
au mois de janvier. La Cour d’Appel jugea que la demande pouvait être amendée
et que la County Court Judges’ Criminal Court était une Cour continuelle
et que des ajournements de temps à autre n’étaient pas nécessaires pour que la
demande demeure active. Il fut alors ordonné que la demande soit retournée à un
juge de la County Court Judges’ Criminal Court. L’appelant obtint
permission d’appeler devant cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté, le Juge Cartwright étant dissident.

Le Juge en Chef Taschereau et les Juges
Fauteux, Judson et Spence: L’article 660(1)  du Code criminel , tel
qu’amendé par 1960-61 (Can.), c. 43, art. 33(1), ne laisse aucun doute que la
seule sentence de détention préventive qui peut être imposée est une «au lieu
de» toute autre sentence, et non «en plus de». Qu’une sentence de détention
préventive serait recherchée, telle était la qualité substantielle de l’avis.
Ceci ne pouvait avoir lieu que sous le régime de la loi alors existante. L’erreur
dans l’avis était contenue dans quelque chose qui était superflu. La nullité
portait sur l’erreur et non sur la fonction essentielle de l’avis. L’avis
n’avait pas besoin d’être amendé. La proposition que l’avis avait été donné
sous un article du Code abrogé ne peut pas être acceptée.

Les retards et délais n’avaient pas mis fin à
la demande; les délais étaient justifiés dans l’espèce. La County Court
Judges’ Criminal Court est une Cour continuelle devant laquelle la demande
était en souffrance jusqu’à ce qu’elle soit entendue. Le fait que l’accusé
pouvait avoir appelé sans succès de la sentence imposée pour l’offense
originale ne pouvait servir en fin de non-recevoir contre la poursuite prise
contre lui comme repris de justice.

Quoique la Cour d’Appel avait le pouvoir en
vertu de l’art. 667(2) (b) du Code d’imposer une sentence de détention
préventive, elle ne pouvait le faire parce que la demande n’avait pas été
entendue. Tout ce que la Cour pouvait faire, dans les circonstances, était de
déclarer que le rejet de l’avis était erroné.

Le Juge Cartwright, dissident: L’avis qui a
été signifié à l’appelant était fatalement défectueux. L’argument que l’avis
était suffisant et que les mots «en plus de» étaient simplement du surplus, ne
peut pas être accepté. Un avis que la Cour sera requise de faire quelque chose
qui est clairement illégal et au-delà de ses pouvoirs ne peut pas former un
fondement valide pour une poursuite criminelle de la plus sérieuse nature, dans
laquelle on cherche à supprimer la liberté d’un homme pour le reste de sa vie.
L’amendement ordonné par la Cour d’Appel est inefficace parce qu’il n’a été
fait que longtemps après l’expiration de la période de trois mois fixée par
l’art. 662. Dans le droit criminel anglais la ligne de conduite qui est établie
depuis longtemps est à l’effet que toutes les règles en faveur du prisonnier
doivent être observées.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’Appel de
l’Ontario, renversant une décision du Juge de comté Rogers qui avait rejeté une
demande pour sentence de détention préventive sous l’art. 660  du Code
criminel . Appel rejeté, le Juge Cartwright étant dissident.

[Page 315]

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], reversing an order
of Rogers, Co. Ct. J., quashing
an application for sentence of preventive detention under s. 660  of the Criminal
Code . Appeal dismissed, Cartwright J. dissenting.

Miss Vera L. Parsons, Q.C., for the
appellant.

D.H. Christie, Q.C., and J.H. Buntain,
for the respondent.

The judgement of Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Judson
and Spence JJ. was delivered by

JUDSON J.:—After the accused had been found
guilty of trafficking in drugs contrary to s. 4(3) (a) of the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 201, the Crown took proceedings
against him as an habitual criminal. This application was quashed by a Judge of
the County Court Judges’ Criminal Court for the County of York for two reasons:
first, that the notice was defective to the extent of nullity, and second, that
the proceedings had come to an end because of delay. On appeal to the Court of
Appeal1 both these reasons were rejected and the matter was remitted
to a Judge of the same Court for enquiry and disposal. Leave to appeal was
granted to this Court. In my opinion the appeal fails.

The grounds of appeal make it necessary to set
out in some detail the proceedings that were taken against the accused. He was
convicted on February 14, 1962, on the charge of trafficking and sentenced to
ten years’ imprisonment. His appeal against conviction and sentence was heard and
dismissed on June 20, 1962. An
application for leave to appeal to this Court was dismissed on October 2, 1962.
This ended the proceedings for the offence itself.

In the meantime, on May 8, 1962, the Crown served the appellant
with notice of intention to seek a sentence of preventive detention against him
as an habitual criminal. On June 5, 1963, the appellant filed a notice of
motion to quash the application. It was this motion which was granted on June 20, 1963.

On July 17, 1963, the Crown prepared a notice of
appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal from the order quashing

[Page 316]

the application. Time for service of this notice
was extended by ex parte order made by Mr. Justice Hughes on July 24, 1963. It was served and filed on July
25, 1963. This appeal was heard in February, 1964, and judgment was given in
March, 1964, referring the matter back to the County Court Judges’ Criminal
Court. Leave to appeal was granted to this Court in April 1964.

The main ground of appeal is that the notice of
application, dated May 8, 1962,
to have the appellant declared an habitual criminal, was a nullity because it
asked for a sentence of preventive detention in addition to the sentence of 10
years. By s. 660(1) of the Criminal Code , enacted by 1960-61 (Can.), c. 43, s. 33(1), the only sentence
of preventive detention which could be imposed in the circumstances of this
case was one in lieu of the sentence that had been imposed. The statute leaves
no room for doubt on this point. It reads:

660. (1) Where an accused has been
convicted of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a
sentence of preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that might be
imposed for the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed for such
offence, or in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such offence if
the sentence has expired, if

(a) the accused is found to be an habitual
criminal, and

(b) the court is of the
opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for
the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.

The former law embodied in the 1953-1954 statute
was that the sentence of preventive detention would be’ in addition to any
sentence that had been imposed. From this it is argued that the notice of
application was given under a repealed statute and was therefore a nullity.

I agree with the Court of Appeal that the
essence of the notice is that a sentence of preventive detention will be
sought. This could only be under the existing law. The error in the notice is
contained in something that is superfluous. The nullity is to be found in the
error not in the essential function of the notice. I do not think there was any
need to amend by substituting “in lieu of” for “in addition to”.

These proceedings were authorized by the
Attorney General in these terms:

Pursuant to section 662(1)  (a)(1)
of the Criminal Code , I consent to an application being made to have a sentence
of preventive detention imposed upon Douglas Gordon.

[Page 317]

The consent itself is attacked on the ground
that it cannot be applicable to a notice given under a repealed section of
the Criminal Code . This objection presupposes the correctness of the
first submission. What the Attorney General was consenting to was an
application under the Code as it stood at the date of the consent.

All that the Crown’s notice needed to say was
that a sentence of preventive detention would be sought against the appellant.
The Code would then have spoken. The appellant’s sentence had not expired.
Therefore, the sentence of preventive detention could only be imposed in lieu
of the 10 year sentence that he was already serving. There could be no
ambiguity or doubt about the situation. The words “in addition to the sentence
of 10 years” which appear in the notice are, on the face of them, erroneous.
But this does not mean that the Crown was seeking this sentence under the
provisions of a repealed section of the Code or that the notice was given
pursuant to a repealed section.

The other ground on which the application was
quashed in the County Court Judges’ Criminal Court was that because of the
repeated postponements and delay, the application, even if it were ever a valid
one, had come to an end.

First of all, nothing could be done with this
application until this Court had dismissed on October 2, 1962, the application
for leave to appeal from the original conviction. The notice had been served on
May 8, 1962. On December 10,
1962, counsel for the Attorney General of Canada asked that the application for
preventive detention be traversed to the next Court of competent jurisdiction.
This request was granted, counsel for the accused neither objecting nor
consenting. Because of lack of accommodation at the Courthouse, the application
was not heard in the spring of 1963 despite repeated efforts of Crown counsel
to have it heard. It finally came on on June 20, 1963, when it was quashed. The
second of the reasons given by the learned trial judge was that he was deprived
of jurisdiction because the matter had not been dealt with by the County Court
Judges’ Criminal Court for the County of York in January, 1963, and that consequently, the application
had expired. I agree with the Court of Appeal that the County Court Judges’

[Page 318]

Criminal Court is a continuing Court before
which this application was pending until it was heard and that any reference to
this Court in an unofficial guide as holding weekly sittings does not affect
the question.

Up to this point I have dealt with the first
four grounds on which leave to appeal was sought. The fifth ground is that
there could not be an application for preventive detention because the original
conviction and sentence had been appealed to the Court of Appeal and confirmed
by that Court. Therefore, no County Court Judge sitting in the County Court
Judges’ Criminal Court could do anything which would in any way modify what the
Court of Appeal had done. This argument is contrary to the express provisions
of s. 660 . The fact that an accused may have unsuccessfully appealed against the
sentence imposed upon him for the substantive offence cannot operate as a bar
to proceeding against him as an habitual criminal.

The sixth ground of appeal has to do with the
powers of the Court of Appeal under Part XXI dealing with preventive detention.
Section 667 provides:

667. (1) A person who is sentenced to
preventive detention under this Part may appeal to the court of appeal against
that sentence on any ground of law or fact or mixed law and fact.

(2) The Attorney General may appeal to the
court of appeal against the dismissal of an application for an order under this
Part on any ground of law.

(2a) On an appeal against a sentence of
preventive detention the court of appeal may

(a) quash such sentence and
impose any sentence that might have been imposed in respect of the offence for
which the appellant was convicted, or

(b) dismiss the appeal.

(2b) On an appeal against the
dismissal of an application for an order under this Part the court of appeal
may

(a) allow the appeal, set aside any
sentence imposed in respect of the offence for which the respondent was
convicted and impose a sentence of preventive detention, or

(b) dismiss the appeal.

In this case the County Court Judge quashed the
notice of application. He took no evidence and did not embark upon any enquiry
under s. 660 . The Court of Appeal, although it has power under s. 667(2) (b)
to impose a sentence of preventive detention, could not take any such action
because the case had not been heard. It could, in the circumstances, only say
that the quashing of the notice

[Page 319]

was erroneous. The consequence was that there
was still an application pending before the County Court Judges’ Criminal
Court. The order of the Court of Appeal simply « tells this Court to proceed
with the hearing.

The remaining grounds of appeal are concerned
with technicalities. They were fully argued and I repeat them merely for the
purpose of stating that I have considered and rejected them as having no merit.
The remission of the matter to the County Court does not result in a new
application which is out of time under s. 662(1) (a)(ii). The notice of
application signed by the Special Crown Prosecutor was in order. It was
addressed to the appellant and its validity is not affected by the fact that it
is not headed “Her Majesty The Queen, Applicant and Douglas Gordon,
Respondent.” Mr. Justice Hughes had jurisdiction to make the order of July 24, 1963, extending the time for service of
the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal.

I would dismiss the appeal.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—This appeal
is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] which
allowed an appeal by the Attorney General of Canada from an order of His Honour
Judge Rogers quashing an application for the imposition of a sentence of
preventive detention upon the present appellant. The Court of Appeal ordered
that the notice which had been served upon the appellant be amended and that
the application for the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention be
remitted to a Judge of the County Court Judges Criminal Court of the County of York for inquiry and disposal.

There is no dispute as to the facts which are
relevant to the determination of this appeal.

The appellant was convicted at Toronto on February
14, 1962, before His Honour Judge Forsyth and a jury on a charge of trafficking
in drugs contrary to s. 4(3) (a) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 201. On February 16, 1962, he was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment. By Notice of Appeal
dated March 7, 1962, he appealed against his conviction and sentence to the
Court of Appeal.

[Page 320]

This appeal was heard and dismissed on June 20, 1962. An application for leave to appeal
to this Court was dismissed on October 2, 1962.

On May 8, 1962, the appellant was served with a notice of intention to ask that a
sentence of preventive detention be imposed upon him on the ground that he is a
habitual criminal. On June 5, 1963, the appellant filed a notice of motion to
quash the application. This motion was allowed by His Honour Judge Rogers on June 20, 1963.

On July 17, 1963, the Attorney General for Canada prepared a notice of appeal to the
Court of Appeal from the order of His Honour Judge Rogers. On July 24, 1963, Hughes J., on an ex parte application,
extended the time for serving and filing the notice until July 29, 1963. The
notice was served and filed on July 25, 1963. The appeal came on for hearing before the Court of Appeal on
February 24 and 25, 1964. Judgment was reserved until March 10, 1964, when the
appeal was allowed. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted pursuant to s. 41
of the Supreme Court Act, on April 28, 1964.

A number of grounds in support of the appeal to
this Court were fully argued but I find it necessary to deal with only one of
them, which is that the notice, dated May 8, 1962, served upon the appellant
was fatally defective.

The notice, dated and served May 8, 1962,
recited the conviction of the appellant before His Honour Judge Forsyth, his
sentence to ten years’ imprisonment and the giving of consent by the Attorney
General of Ontario to the making of the application for the imposition of a
sentence of preventive detention and continued:

TAKE NOTICE, THEREFORE, that having been
convicted on the aforesaid charge under Section 4(3) (a) of The
Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, Revised Statutes of Canada 1952, Chapter 201
and amendments thereto, of unlawfully trafficking in a drug, to wit
Diacetylmorphine, that an application will be made on June 11, 1962, before the
Presiding Judge in the County Court Judge’s Criminal Court for the County of
York, at the City Hall, Toronto, at 10.00 o’clock in the forenoon to impose
upon you a sentence of preventive detention, in addition to the sentence of ten
years imposed by His Honour Judge Forsyth on February 16, 1962, on the ground
that you are an habitual criminal and that because you are an habitual criminal
it is expedient for the protection of the public to sentence you to such
preventive detention.

[Page 321]

The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code  conferring
jurisdiction on the County Court Judge to hear and determine the application
and prescribing the procedure to be followed are s.660(1)  and s.662(1)  (a).
These read as follows:

660(1) Where an accused has been convicted
of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of
preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that might be imposed for
the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed for such offence, or
in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such offence if the sentence
has expired, if

(a) the accused is found to be an
habitual criminal, and

(b) the court is of the
opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient for
the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.

662(1) The following provisions apply with
respect to applications under this Part, namely,

(a) an application under
subsection (1) of section 660  shall not be heard unless

(i) the Attorney General of the province in
which the accused is to be tried consents,

(ii) seven clear days’ notice has been
given to the accused by the prosecutor, either before or after conviction or
sentence but within three months after the passing of sentence and before the
sentence has expired, specifying the previous convictions and the other
circumstances, if any, upon which it is intended to found the application, and

(iii) a copy of the notice has been filed
with the clerk of the court or the magistrate, as the case may be;

Section 660(1) in its present form was
enacted by Statutes of Canada 1960-1961, c.43 and came into force on September
1, 1961. Prior thereto that part of the subsection preceding paragraph (a)
had read as follows:

660(1) Where an accused is convicted of an
indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence of
preventive detention in addition to any sentence that is imposed for the
offence of which he is convicted if

The amendment made in 1961 brought about a
substantial change in the law. Prior thereto a sentence of preventive detention
commenced immediately upon the determination of the sentence imposed for the
substantive offence; since the amendment it takes the place of the last
mentioned sentence.

It appears therefore that the notice served upon
the appellant stated that the Judge before whom the application would come was
to be asked to do something which

[Page 322]

he had no power to do and which was contrary to
law. It is argued for the appellant that this is a defect in substance and is
fatal to the Attorney General’s application.

It is clear from the wording of s. 662(1)  (a),
quoted above, that the giving of a sufficient notice within three months after
the passing of sentence is a condition precedent to the hearing of the
application. This is not disputed; but counsel for the respondent argues that
the notice given was sufficient and that the words “in addition to the sentence
of ten years imposed by His Honour Judge Forsyth on February 16, 1962” can and
should be regarded as mere surplusage. This argument found favour with the
Court of Appeal but I am unable to accept it.

The question is whether the notice, when it was
served, constituted a sufficient compliance with the statutory condition
precedent prescribed by s. 662. If it did not the amendment ordered by the
Court of Appeal would be ineffective as it was not made until long after the
period of three months fixed by the section had expired.

No special form of notice is required by the
section but I have reached the conclusion that a notice that the Court
will be asked to do that which is clearly illegal and beyond its powers cannot
form a valid foundation for a criminal proceeding of the most serious sort, in
which it is sought to deprive a man of his liberty for the rest of his life.

It is said, on behalf of the respondent, that no
real prejudice has been caused to the appellant but it has long been the
settled policy of English criminal law that as against the prisoner every rule
in his favour is observed.

In R. v. Triffitt[3], the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed a
finding that the appellant was a habitual criminal because of an irregularity
of procedure although, in the words of Humphreys J. who gave the unanimous
judgment of the Court, “the appeal has otherwise no merits whatsoever”.

In Parkes v. The Queen[4], this Court set aside a finding that the
appellant was a habitual criminal. At pages 773 and 774, Rand J. said:

There seems to be a tendency to treat a
proceeding under the section as one in which strict compliance with the
express requirements of the Code is not to be insisted on. That is altogether a
mistake. Under such a determination a person can be detained in prison for the
rest of his life with

[Page 323]

his liberty dependent on the favourable
discretion of a minister of the Crown. The adjudication is a most serious step
in the administration of the criminal law in relation to which it is well to
recall the words of the Lord Chief Justice of England in Martin v.
Mackonochie (1878) 3 Q.B.D. 730 at 775-6.

It seems to me, I must say, a strange
argument in a court of justice, to say that when, as the law stands, formal
proceedings are in strict law required, yet if no substantial injustice has
been done by dealing summarily with a defendant, the proceeding should be
upheld. In a court of law such an argument à convenienti is surely
inadmissible. In a criminal proceeding the question is not alone whether
substantial justice has been done, but whether justice has been done according
to law. All proceedings in poenam are it need scarcely be observed,
strictissimi juris; nor should it be forgotten that the formalities of law,
though here and there they may lead to the escape of an offender, are intended
on the whole to insure the safe administration of justice and the protection of
innocence, and must be observed. A party accused has the right to insist upon
them as a matter of right, of which he cannot be deprived against his will; and
the judge must see that they are followed. He cannot set himself above the law
which he has to administer, or make or mould it to suit the exigencies of a
particular occasion. Though a murderer should be taken red-handed in the act,
if there is a flaw in the indictment the criminal must have the benefit of it.
If the law is imperfect, it is for the legislature to amend. The judge must
administer it as he finds it. And the procedure by which an offender is to be
tried, though but ancillary to the application of the substantive law and to
the ends of justice, is as much part of the law as the substantive law itself.

Having reached the conclusion, for the reasons
stated above, that the notice served upon the accused was fatally defective, it
becomes unnecessary for me to examine the other grounds in support of the
appeal which were argued before us.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal and restore that of His Honour Judge Rogers quashing the
application for the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME
COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA

Malicious prosecution—Defendant
laying information and withdrawing same at later date—Nothing done during
interval by magistrate before whom information sworn—Whether a prosecution
commenced so as to entitle plaintiff to claim against defendant for malicious
prosecution.

One C, the general sales manager of the defendant company, was
instructed to lay a charge of theft against the plaintiff. In the information
it was stated that the informant had reasonable and probable

[Page 608]

grounds to believe that the plaintiff did unlawfully steal
twenty-six Renault Dauphine automobiles of a value exceeding fifty dollars, the
property of the defendant company, contrary to the provisions of s. 280 (a) of
the Criminal Code . Following the laying of the information, on November 19, 1960, it remained in the office of the magistrate before whom it was sworn,
and nothing further was done about it until December 13, when the magistrate
received a letter, dated December 7, from C. In this letter C requested that
the charge be withdrawn. The magistrate then wrote on the face of the
information, ""Withdrawn Dec. 13/60 at request of informant"".

In an action for damages for malicious prosecution, judgment
was given in favour of the plaintiff. On appeal, this decision was reversed.
The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in banco, allowed the appeal after
hearing argument on only one of the points raised by the defendant company,
namely, that, in law, the prosecution upon which the action was based was never
instituted or commenced. From this judgment the plaintiff appealed to this
Court.

Held (Judson J. dissenting): The appeal should be
allowed.

Per Cartwright, Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ.: The
mere presentation of a false complaint would not necessarily be a basis for a
suit for malicious prosecution, but, if a complaint was made which disclosed an
offence with which the magistrate had jurisdiction to deal and he took
cognizance of it, that was a sufficient foundation for the action.

Mohamed Amin v. Bannerjee, [1947] A.C. 322, followed.

Under s. 439 (1) of the Criminal Code , the magistrate
could only receive the information provided it alleged those matters which
would bring it within his jurisdiction, but, if it did, he was obligated to
receive it. Having received the information, the magistrate was obliged to
carry out the duties imposed upon him by s. 440(1) of the Code. In the present
case, the magistrate received the information. It was obvious that he must have
heard and considered the allegations made by the informant. He proceeded no
further because the informant asked to withdraw the information. As in Mohamed
Amin v. Bannerjee, supra, the essence of the matter here was the filing of
an information to deal with which was within the magistrate's jurisdiction. At
that point, in each case, the informant had done all he could do to launch
criminal proceedings against the accused.

As the defendant had caused everything to be done which could
be done unlawfully to set the law in motion against the plaintiff on a criminal
charge, an action for malicious prosecution lay against the defendant, the
other required elements of that tort having been established.

Yates v. The Queen (1885), 14 Q.B.D. 648; Thorpe v.
Priestnall, [1897] 1 Q.B. 159, distinguished; Quartz Hill Consolidated
Gold Mining Co. v. Eyre (1833), 11 Q.B.D. 674, referred to.

Per Judson J., dissenting: For the reasons given
by the Court below, the appeal should be dismissed.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in banco[1],
allowing an appeal from a judgment given by Coffin J., following a trial by
jury, whereby

[Page 609]

damages were awarded to the plaintiff
for malicious prosecution. Appeal allowed, Judson J. dissenting.

J.J. Robinette, Q.C., and
L.O. Clarke, for the plaintiff, appellant.

J.H. Dickey, Q.C., and
L.J. Hayes, for the defendant, respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright,
Martland, Ritchie and Spence JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.:—This case is
concerned with an action for damages for malicious prosecution brought by the
appellant against the respondent. It was tried by a judge and jury. On the
basis of the answers given by the jury to questions submitted by the learned
trial judge, judgment was given in favour of the appellant awarding him damages
in the amount of $28,000 and costs. On appeal, this decision was reversed. The
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in banco, allowed the appeal after hearing
argument on only one of the points raised by the defendant company, namely,
that, in law, the prosecution upon which the action was based was never
instituted or commenced.

From this judgment the appellant
has appealed to this Court. In argument before us the respondent submitted
additional grounds upon which it was submitted the appellant's action ought to
have been dismissed, and these points were fully argued.

The facts which gave rise to the
action are as follows. Maritime Import Autos Limited (hereinafter referred to
as ""Maritime""), a Nova Scotia corporation, with its principal place
of business in Amherst, in that province, was the distributor for the Maritime
Provinces for the respondent, a Canadian corporation, with its head office in
Montreal, which is engaged in the sale and distribution of Renault automobiles
in Canada. The appellant resides at Amherst and is engaged in the automobile business. He
organized various companies which distributed automobiles, including Maritime.
At the times material to this action the appellant was the principal
shareholder of Maritime, but was not an officer or director of that company.

In the spring of 1960 a meeting
was held at Moncton by representatives of the respondent and of
Maritime. The latter company was represented by the appellant, and by 

[Page 610]

Mr. L. J. Kiley, its president,
and Mr. T. A. Giles, its solicitor. At that meeting it was agreed that Maritime
would store in Amherst some 120 Renault automobiles provided by the
respondent, under a bailee agreement.

That agreement, which is dated
June 2, 1960, acknowledges receipt from the respondent in good order and
condition for storage at Maritime's premises in Amherst of a number of
automobiles each individually described in the agreement.

It concluded with a paragraph
reading:

I/we, as Bailee, agree (a)
to hold and store safely the Chattels free of charge for the Company which is
the sole and absolute owner thereof (b) on demand of the Company to promptly
deliver the Chattels, or any of them as may be specified by the Company to it
or to its order, and (c) that the Chattels are not in my/our possession for
purpose of sale and that I/we have no authority to encumber sell, operate or in
any way dispose the Chattels and (d) to have the cars insured against the risks
of fire, theft and damages directly caused by person acting maliciously.

Under the heading ""Signature
of Bailee"" appeared the signature ""L. J. Kiley"". Below his
signature appeared the words ""Dealer Name"" and beneath that appeared
the stamped name ""Maritime Import Autos Ltd. Amherst, N.S.""

Giles testified at the trial that
:

Maritime Import Autos were
told that they could use the cars from the bailee stock provided they notified
Montreal Head Office so that they could be invoiced for them. As a matter of
fact, I know from my examination of the records of the company, Maritime Import
Autos Limited, that cars were taken from the bailee stock, were reported to
Montreal, and were paid for by the company prior to the 26 that were taken
sometime in October.

It appears that, subsequent to
the meeting in Moncton, three cars were removed from storage by Maritime
and sold and an invoice was sent by the respondent to Maritime for these.
Later, in October, a further 10 cars were removed and sold, and by letter dated
October 7, 1960, Maritime requested the respondent to send invoices
for the same. Following this, a further 26 cars were removed. Maritime was
unable to pay for the cars which had been removed.

Mr. Giles was sent to Montreal in
November 1960, armed with a cheque for $3,000 and instructed to discuss
arrangements for payment of the balance owing by Maritime to the respondent. On
November 16 he met with Mr. LeBouedec, the general manager of the respondent,
and with other 

[Page 611]

officers of that company. He was
told that the respondent insisted on the appellant's personal guarantee of
payment of the amount owing by Maritime.

Giles testified that at this
meeting LeBouedec said to him: ""This man Casey is nothing but a common
thief and we are going to put him in his place."" Giles replied to this by
saying that the appellant knew nothing about the sale of the cars until after
they were sold and that he was acting in good faith in trying to settle the
matter.

Mr. Clement, the secretary-treasurer
of the respondent, called as a witness for the defence, heard LeBouedec say
that this was a technical theft committed by Casey.

This witness said that after
Giles' departure, the meeting continued with LeBouedec and himself present and
Mr. MacKay, the respondent's solicitor. They discussed the matter of payment
for the 26 missing cars, and Clement said, in evidence:

And, according to the
discussion that had just happened with Mr. Giles, we had the impression that we
will never get paid, and Mr. MacKay immediately suggested that an information
be laid immediately against Mr. D. A. Casey.

Neither LeBouedec nor MacKay gave
evidence at the trial.

Following this, George Coleman,
the general sales manager of the respondent, was instructed to proceed to Amherst to
lay a charge of theft against the appellant, which he did. He attended upon a
stipendiary magistrate there, Mr. Alfred C. Milner. Apparently upon the basis
of what Coleman told him the magistrate drafted the information, which was
signed by Coleman and sworn before the magistrate. That information was as
follows:

CANADA

PROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA

MAGISTERIAL DISTRICT OF THE 

PROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA

COUNTY OF CUMBERLAND

This is the information and
complaint of George F. Coleman of Montreal in the Province
 of Quebec, General Sales Manager,
hereinafter called the Informant.

The informant says that he
has reasonable and probable grounds to believe and does believe that D. A.
Casey of Amherst in the County of Cumberland at or near Amherst in the County
of Cumberland in the Magisterial District of the Province of Nova Scotia
between the 8th day of October, A.D. 1960 and the 25th day of October, A.D.
1960,

[Page 612]

did unlawfully steal twenty-six
Renault Dauphine automobiles of a value exceeding fifty dollars, the
property of Automobiles Renault Canada Limited, contrary to the provisions of
Section 280  (a) of the Criminal Code . 


 
  
  Sworn before me this 19th
  day of
  
  
   
  
 
 
  
  November, A.D. 1960, at Amherst in
  the
  
  
   
  
 
 
  
  County of Cumberland
  
  
  (Sgd.) Geo. F. Coleman
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
  Informant
  
 
 
  
  (Sgd.) Alfred C. Milner
  
  
   
  
 
 
  
  A Stipendiary Magistrate
  in and for the
  
  
   
  
 
 
  
  County of Cumberland.
  
  
   
  
 


The magistrate testified that he
did not instruct Coleman to lay the information. Following the laying of the
information, on November 19, 1960, it remained in his office, and nothing further was
done about it until December 13, when the magistrate received a letter, dated
December 7, from Coleman, reading as follows:

I wish to inform you that it
is my desire to withdraw the charge which was against D. A. Casey on November 19th, 1960.

When the charge was laid,
the evidence, on the basis of facts then known, appeared to be sufficient.
However the information now available and the correspondence have been
carefully reviewed and, on advice of counsel, it appears that at the present
time there is insufficient evidence available to proceed with the complaint
against Mr. Casey.

I request therefore that the
charge be withdrawn.

The magistrate then wrote, on the
face of the information, ""Withdrawn Dec. 13/60 at request of
informant"".

Prior to the withdrawal of the
information, on November 23, Giles was visited by Mr. Myrand, the
administrative secretary of the Toronto branch of the respondent. Giles' evidence as to his
meeting with Myrand is as follows:

I then asked him if he was
authorized to act for Automobiles Renault Canada Limited in settling this
problem over the payment for the cars. He said that he was. I asked him if he
was in a position to withdraw the information if we would pay—by ""we""
I mean Mr. Casey—would pay them a certain number of dollars, and I said to him
again ""If we will pay you X number of dollars—10—$20,000.00, or
thereabouts, you will withdraw the information?"" and he said
""Yes"". I then said to him, ""It is true, is it not, that the only
reason you laid this information against Casey was to try and extract from him
a certain amount of money?"" and his answer was ""Yes, just a little
more pressure. Ha! Ha!"". I then asked him if he would confirm by telephone
with Montreal that he was actually authorized to act. A phone call
was put through to Montreal, and, as a result of the phone call, or following
it, he again reiterated he was in a position to act and that if we would pay
him for the cars, or a certain amount of money, and $20,000.00 was a figure
that was used quite a lot, that he would then withdraw the information
immediately.

[Page 613]

There was evidence that,
following the laying of the information, the fact that the appellant had been
charged with theft became widely known among people in the automobile business
in Nova Scotia. Three witnesses testified that they had been
advised that Casey had been charged with theft by persons employed by the
respondent.

The learned trial judge submitted
questions to the jury, in two series, the jury being charged in relation to the
second set of questions after they had answered the first ones. The relevant
questions and answers are as follows:

(1) Did the Defendants
during 1960 look to the Plaintiff, D. A. Casey, as the person with whom they
dealt in matters of importance in their dealings with Maritime Import Autos
Ltd.? ""No"".

(2) Did the Defendants
believe that Maritime Import Autos Ltd. had no right to sell any of the cars
listed in the Bailee Receipt? ""No"".

(1) Was there a prosecution
of the Plaintiff, Douglas A. Casey, by the Defendants? ""Yes"".

(2)(a) Did the Defendant,
Automobile Renault (Canada) Ltd., act maliciously? ""Yes"".

(3) What damages did the
Plaintiff, Douglas A. Casey, suffer?

""Twenty-eight thousand
dollars ($28,000.00)"".

On the basis of the answers given
to the first series of questions the learned trial judge found that there was
not reasonable and probable cause for the prosecution. On the basis of the
answers given to the second series of questions he gave judgment in favour of
the appellant.

I have not reviewed the evidence
in great detail, and have set out mainly the evidence which was favourable to
the appellant. The reason for this is that, apart from the main issue of law on
which the appeal was allowed by the Court below, nearly all of the points urged
by the respondent were on the basis of there being no evidence to support the
findings of the jury. On the issue of law dealt with in the reasons below,
there is no conflict as to the evidence.

In my opinion there was evidence
upon which the jury could give the answers which it made to the questions put
to it, and, on the basis of the first two answers given, the learned trial
judge properly found lack of reasonable and probable cause for the laying of
the information.

The instruction given to the jury
by the learned trial judge regarding the respondent's contention that the
respondent had acted on the advice of counsel in laying the 

[Page 614]

charge and that this was strong
evidence that it did not act maliciously, was sufficient. As has already been
pointed out, the respondent's officer chiefly responsible in the matter of
laying the information, LeBouedec, and the solicitor who was consulted, MacKay,
did not give evidence.

I would not be prepared, in the
circumstances of this case, to interfere with the jury's assessment of damages.

It was not contended before us
that there had been no termination of the proceedings in favour of the
appellant. In this connection we were referred to the proposition stated in
Salmond on Torts, 13th ed., p. 726:

If the prosecution has
actually determined in any manner in favour of the plaintiff it matters nothing
in what way this has taken place. There need not have been any acquittal on the
merits. What the plaintiff requires for his action is not a judicial
determination of his innocence but merely the absence of any judicial
determination of his guilt. Thus it is enough if the prosecution has been
discontinued, or if the accused has been acquitted by reason of some formal
defect in the indictment, or if a conviction has been quashed, even if for some
technical defect in the proceedings.

The important issue of law raised
in this appeal is that which was decided in the respondent's favour in the
Court below, as to whether a prosecution had been commenced against the
appellant so as to entitle him to claim against the respondent for malicious
prosecution.

The question thus raised is a
difficult one. There is certainly authority in support of the position taken by
the Court below, which is well summarized in para. 654 of vol. III of Restatement
of the Law of Torts promulgated by the American Law Institute. That paragraph
states, in relation to the tort of wrongful prosecution, that criminal
proceedings are instituted when

process is issued for the
purpose of bringing the person accused of a criminal offense before an official
or tribunal whose function is to determine whether the accused

(i) shall be held for later
determination of his guilt or innocence, or 

(ii) is guilty of the
offense charged.

MacDonald J. in the Court below
quotes an excerpt from Stephen on Malicious Prosecution (published in 1888), at
p. 5:

In order to be liable to an
action for malicious prosecution a defendant must have prosecuted the
plaintiff, and it therefore becomes necessary to determine what constitutes a
prosecution.

The only definition which,
so far as I know, has been explicitly suggested, is that given by Mr. Justice
Lopes in Danby v. Beardsley, 43 L.T. 

[Page 615]

603 (1881):—""…this
might be a definition of a prosecutor—a man actively instrumental in putting
the criminal law in force."" (This, however, requires to be qualified by
the observation, that not merely the ministerial but the judicial functions of
the criminal law must be put in motion, that is, some judicial officer must be
made to act in his judicial capacity.)

I feel, however, that the
starting point in considering this issue must be the leading case of Mohamed
Amin v. Bannerjee[2],
a decision of the Privy Council, on appeal from the High Court of Calcutta. In
that case the respondents, who had been involved in a dispute of a civil
character with the appellant, caused a petition of complaint to be filed
against the appellant in a Police Magistrate's Court, which was registered as a
charge of cheating under s. 420 of the Indian Penal Code. The magistrate,
having taken cognizance of the case, subsequently held an inquiry, in open
court, pursuant to s. 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, of which
notice was given to the appellant, who attended and who was represented by
counsel. After completion of the inquiry, the magistrate dismissed the
complaint under s. 203 of that Code.

The relevant sections of the Code
of Criminal Procedure provided as follows:

Section 200. A Magistrate
taking cognizance of an offence on complaint shall at once examine the complainant
upon oath, and the substance of the examination shall be reduced to writing and
shall be signed by the complainant, and also by the magistrate:

Section 202. (1.) Any
Magistrate, on receipt of a complaint of an offence of which he is authorized
to take cognizance, or which has been transferred to him under s. 192, may, if
he thinks fit, for reasons to be recorded in writing, postpone the issue of
process for compelling the attendance of the person complained against, and
either inquire into the case himself or, if he is a Magistrate other than a
Magistrate of the third class, direct an inquiry or investigation to be made by
any Magistrate subordinate to him, or by a police-officer, or by such other
person as he thinks fit, for the purpose of ascertaining the truth or falsehood
of the complaint:

Provided that, save where
the complaint has been made by a court, no such direction shall be made unless
the complainant has been examined on oath under the provisions of s. 200.

(2a.) Any Magistrate
inquiring into a case under this section may, if he thinks fit, take evidence
of witnesses on oath.

Section 203. The Magistrate
before whom a complaint is made or to whom it has been transferred, may dismiss
the complaint, if, after considering the statement on oath (if any) of the
complainant and the result of the investigation or inquiry (if any) under s.
202, there is in his judgment no sufficient ground for proceeding. In such case
he shall briefly record his reasons for so doing.

[Page 616]

These sections were contained in
Chapter 16, headed ""Of complaints to Magistrates"". Chapter 17, which
followed, was headed ""Of the commencement of Proceedings before
Magistrates"" and laid down the procedure when the magistrate decided to
issue process on the complaint.

The appellant sued for damages
for malicious prosecution. The respondents contended that the stage of
prosecution had not been reached, and that it would not be reached until the
magistrate said he was satisfied that there was a prima facie case and
that a summons would issue for the attendance of the accused. They relied upon Yates
v. The Queen[3].

The appeal was allowed by the
Privy Council, holding that the proceedings had reached a stage sufficient to
found an action for malicious prosecution.

In the judgment, there were
reviewed two conflicting lines of authority, one of which commenced with the
case of Golap Jan v. Bholanath Khettry[4],
in which, in an action for malicious prosecution, it appeared that a complaint
before a magistrate had been referred by him to the police for inquiry, and had
been dismissed by the magistrate following receipt of the police report. It was
held that no prosecution had been commenced and that the action failed.
Reliance was placed on Yates v. The Queen, supra. The other line of
authority included the case of Bishun Persad Narain Singh v. Phulman Singh[5],
which stated the proposition that the prosecution commenced when the prosecutor
had taken the initial step; namely, making the complaint to the magistrate.

The judgment then proceeds as follows:

The action for damages for
malicious prosecution is part of the common law of England, administered by the
High Court at Calcutta under its letters patent. The foundation of the
action lies in abuse of the process of the court by wrongfully setting the law
in motion, and it is designed to discourage the perversion of the machinery of
justice for an improper purpose. The plaintiff must prove that the proceedings
instituted against him were malicious, without reasonable and probable cause,
that they terminated in his favour (if that be possible), and that he has
suffered damage. As long ago as 1698 it was held by Holt C.J. in Savile v.
Roberts, (1698) 1 Ld. Raym. 374, that damages might be claimed in an action
under three heads, (1.) damage to the person, (2.) damage to property, and (3.)
damage to reputation, and that rule has prevailed ever

[Page 617]

since. That the word
""prosecution"" in the title of the action is not used in the technical
sense which it bears in criminal law is shown by the fact that the action lies
for the malicious prosecution of certain classes of civil proceedings, for
instance, falsely and maliciously presenting a petition in bankruptcy or a
petition to wind up a company (Quartz Hill Consolidated Gold Mining Co. v.
Eyre, (1883) 11 Q.B.D. 674). The reason why the action does not lie for
falsely and maliciously prosecuting an ordinary civil action is, as explained
by Bowen L.J. in the last mentioned case, that such a case does not necessarily
and naturally involve damage to the party sued. A civil action which is false
will be dismissed at the hearing. The defendant's reputation will be cleared of
any imputations made against him, and he will be indemnified against his
expenses by the award of costs against his opponent. The law does not award
damages for mental anxiety, or for extra costs incurred beyond those imposed on
the unsuccessful party. But a criminal charge involving scandal to reputation
or the possible loss of life or liberty to the party charged does necessarily
and naturally involve damage, and in such a case damage to reputation will be
presumed.

From this consideration of
the nature of an action for damages for malicious prosecution emerges the
answer to the problem before the Board. To found an action for damages for
malicious prosecution based on criminal proceedings the test is not whether the
criminal proceedings have reached a stage at which they may be correctly
described as a prosecution; the test is whether such proceedings have reached a
stage at which damage to the plaintiff results. Their Lordships are not
prepared to go as far as some of the courts in India in saying that the mere
presentation of a false complaint which first seeks to set the criminal law in
motion will per se found an action for damages for malicious prosecution. If
the magistrate dismisses the complaint as disclosing no offence with which he
can deal, it may well be that there has been nothing but an unsuccessful
attempt to set the criminal law in motion, and no damage to the plaintiff results.
But in this case the magistrate took cognizance of the complaint, examined the
complainant on oath, held an inquiry in open court under s. 202 which the
plaintiff attended, and at which, as the learned judge has found, he incurred
costs in defending himself. The plaint alleged the institution of criminal
proceedings of a character necessarily involving damage to reputation and gave
particulars of special damage alleged to have been suffered by the plaintiff.
Their Lordships think that the action was well founded, and on the findings at
the trial the plaintiff is entitled to judgment.

Before dealing with the effect of
this judgment, MacDonald J., in the Court below, made reference to Yates v.
The Queen, supra, and, in particular, the following extracts from the
judgments in that case:

For my own part I consider
that laying the information before the magistrate would not be the commencement
of the prosecution, because the magistrate might refuse to grant a summons, and
if no summons, how could it be said that a prosecution against any one ever
commenced? (Per Brett M.R., at p. 657.)

On behalf of the plaintiff
in error it has been said that the first application for the rule nisi is such
commencement, but how can it be said that a prosecution is commenced before a
person is summoned to answer a complaint. (Per Cotton LJ. at p. 661.)

[Page 618]

However, as is pointed out in the
Mohamed Amin case, Yates v. The Queen was not concerned with an
action for malicious prosecution, but with the question as to whether the fiat
of the Director of Public Prosecutions was required before commencing a
prosecution by information for libel in a newspaper by virtue of s. 3 of the Newspaper
Libel and Registration Act, 1881.

Reference was then made to, and
considerable reliance placed upon, Thorpe v. Priestnall[6],
and, in particular, a passage from the judgment of Wills J., at p. 162. I quote
from the reasons for judgment of MacDonald J., including his quotation from
that case. The insertion of the capital letters and of the italics was made by
MacDonald J., for greater ease of reference.

(A) On looking at the words
of the (Statute) it is clear that the institution of a prosecution is something
which may be done by the chief constable as well as with his consent. The chief
constable cannot grant a summons, nor when a summons is once granted has he any
discretion to exercise as to whether it shall be served or not. Neither of
those things, therefore, is the institution of the prosecution, which is a
matter within his discretion. The institution of the prosecution must,
therefore, be the laying of the information … (B) The passages in the judgment
in Yates v. Reg., supra, only amount to dicta, … (C) It
may be that the magistrate does not act upon the information, and in that case
no prosecution follows, and there is nothing to which the phrase
""commencement of a prosecution"" is applicable. (D) But where there
is a prosecution, I cannot see any reason why the laying of the information
(which started it) is not the commencement of the prosecution; and I
certainly think this has been the meaning of the phrase commonly accepted in
the profession.

Concerning these passages
four points are important in this case. Passage (A) holds that for the purposes
of the statute in question the laying of the information was the institution of
the prosecution which resulted in the conviction; for the reason specified in
passage (D). As to passage (B), it is to be noted that though the passages
quoted earlier from Yates v. Reg. are referred to correctly as amounting
only to dicta, they do form the substance of proposition (C) relating to
a case which stopped at the information stage (as did the case before us); and
that a distinctly different proposition (D) was enunciated as to the
commencement of a prosecution which continued beyond that stage, as it had in
the case itself.

It would appear, therefore,
that many of the decisions, relating to limitation and other statutes, have
been in error in the uncritical acceptance of Thorpe v. Priestnall as
implying that in all cases the institution of a prosecution is to be equated
with the laying of the information, whereas cases in which nothing followed
from that bare fact are to be excepted from that broad proposition.

[Page 619]

In my view the distinction
drawn therein is one upon which this case may well turn. That distinction is
(D) that when there has been a prosecution (beyond the information) the laying
of the information, which started that prosecution, is to be held to be
""the commencement of the prosecution"" and that this is the meaning
commonly accepted by the profession as to this most common situation; but (C),
if the magistrate does not act upon the information there has been no such
commencement.

Again it is pertinent to observe
that this case was not concerned with an action for malicious prosecution. The
question in issue was as to when a prosecution had been instituted within the
meaning of the Sunday Observance Prosecution Act, 1871, which provided
that no prosecution should be instituted for any offence under the Sunday
Observance Act, 1676, except with the written consent of the chief officer
of police of the police district in which the offence was committed. The
appellant had been convicted under the Sunday Observance Act, but the
written consent had not been given until after the information was laid. The
case held that the prosecution was instituted when the information was laid and
therefore the conviction was bad. The argument in support of the conviction
relied upon Yates v. The Queen.

With great respect, I cannot
regard the passages from the judgment of Wills J., marked by MacDonald J. as
(C) and (D), as being anything more than an attempt to reconcile the dicta
in the Yates case with the conclusion he himself had reached on the
issue involved in the case before him. Both cases involved the interpretation
of specific statutes, and the judgments were not directed to the point in issue
here.

MacDonald J. suggests that the
Privy Council, in Mohamed Amin, inferentially adopted passage (C) from
the judgment of Wills J. when it was said:

Their Lordships are not
prepared to go as far as some of the courts in India in saying that the mere
presentation of a false complaint which first seeks to set the criminal law in
motion will per se found an action for damages for malicious prosecution.

With respect, I do not agree that
this is so. In Mohamed Amin the complaint was dismissed by the
magistrate, and no prosecution followed the making of the complaint. It is true
that the magistrate made an inquiry under s. 202 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, but the result of that was the dismissal of the complaint. No
process was ever issued to bring the accused before the magistrate.

[Page 620]

I think it is important to read
the passage from the Privy Council, just quoted, together with the sentence
which immediately follows it:

If the magistrate dismisses
the complaint as disclosing no offence with which he can deal, it may
well be that there has been nothing but an unsuccessful attempt to set the
criminal law in motion, and no damage to the plaintiff results.

(The italics are mine.)

Read together, they would appear
to mean that the mere presentation of a false complaint will not necessarily be
a basis for a suit for malicious prosecution, but that, if a complaint is made
disclosing an offence with which the magistrate has jurisdiction to deal and he
takes cognizance of it, that is a sufficient foundation for the action.

I turn now to consider s. 439(1) 
of the Criminal Code . It provides as follows:

439.(1) Any one who, upon
reasonable and probable grounds, believes that a person has committed an
indictable offence may lay an information in writing and under oath before a
justice, and the justice shall receive the information where it is alleged that

(a) the person has committed,
anywhere, an indictable offence that may be tried in the province in which the
justice resides, and that the person

(i) is or is believed to be,
or

(ii) resides or is believed
to reside, within the territorial jurisdiction of the justice;

(b) the person, wherever he
may be, has committed an indictable offence within the territorial jurisdiction
of the justice;

(c) the person has anywhere
unlawfully received property that was unlawfully obtained within the
territorial jurisdiction of the justice; or

(d) the person has in his
possession stolen property within the territorial jurisdiction of the justice.

The magistrate could only receive
the information provided it alleged those matters which would bring it within
his jurisdiction, but, if it did, he was obligated to receive it.

Having received the information,
the magistrate is obliged to carry out the duties imposed upon him by s. 440(1)
of the Code:

440.(1) A justice who
receives an information shall

(a) hear and consider, ex
parte,

(i) the allegations of the
informant, and

(ii) the evidence of
witnesses, where he considers it desirable or necessary to do so; and

(b) issue, where he
considers that a case for so doing is made out, a summons or warrant, as the
case may be, to compel the accused to attend before him.

[Page 621]

In the present case, the
magistrate received the information. He obviously must have heard and
considered the allegations which had been made by Coleman. According to his own
evidence, he had not taken any further steps before he received the letter
which requested the withdrawal of the information, following which he made a
notation upon the information to the effect that it had been withdrawn at the
request of the informant. It is clear that he had not taken any further steps
thereafter because of the request made in the informant's letter asking for
such withdrawal.

In Mohamed Amin, the
magistrate postponed the issue of process until he had made an inquiry,
following which he dismissed the complaint. MacDonald J. distinguishes the Mohamed
Amin case from the present one on the basis that, in the former, the
magistrate had performed a judicial function, comparable to what would have
occurred, in the present case, if the magistrate had elected to hear evidence
under s. 440(1) (a) (ii), but it is significant that the inquiry to be
conducted under s. 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure could, on the
direction of the magistrate, have been made by a police officer.

With respect, though recognizing
the factual difference between the two cases, I do not see any valid
distinction in principle. In neither case did the matter proceed to the stage
of issuing process to compel the attendance of the accused. In the one case,
the matter stopped before that point because the magistrate, after an inquiry
as to the truth or falsehood of the complaint, dismissed it. In the other, if
he was fulfilling his duty, which in the absence of evidence to the contrary we
must assume he did, the magistrate considered the allegations of the informant,
and proceeded no further, not because he considered no case had been made out,
but because the informant asked to withdraw the information.

In my opinion, the essence of the
matter, in each case, was the filing of an information to deal with which was
within the magistrate's jurisdiction. At that point, in each case, the
informant had done all he could do to launch criminal proceedings against the
accused.

I do not interpret the Mohamed
Amin case as authority for the proposition that a case of malicious
prosecution can never be founded on the laying of an information, but rather 

[Page 622]

as establishing that the
information must be one which discloses an offense with which the magistrate
can deal. The essence of the matter, in that case, was not that the magistrate
acted ""judicially"" by conducting an inquiry, but that, on the
evidence, the magistrate had taken cognizance of the complaint. The proceedings
in the present case had progressed just as far, so far as the accused was
concerned, as they had in the case of Mohamed Amin.

I find support for the view which
I have taken in the case of Quartz Hill Consolidated Gold Mining Company v.
Eyre[7],
which is referred to in the judgment in Mohamed Amin, but which was not
discussed in the Court below. The issue in that case was as to whether the
presentation, falsely and maliciously, of a petition to wind up a trading
company would justify an action for damages by the company. The Court of Appeal
held that it would. In that case, the petition had been presented, and the
required advertising done, but it had never been served upon the company prior
to its withdrawal by the petitioner. One of the judgments is written by Brett,
M.R., who sat in the Yates case, two years later.

It is true that, in determining
whether the proceedings instituted by the petitioner were akin to ordinary
civil proceedings (in respect of which, though malicious, no action would lie)
or to a bankruptcy petition, stress was laid upon the publicity attendant upon
the petition because of the requirement of public advertising before the
petition was heard. This, however, only went to the issue of whether an action
would lie at all in relation to malicious proceedings for winding up. The
important feature of the case is that it was the institution of proceedings which
were never served which gave rise to the action.

The real principle involved in
the case was stated by Bowen L.J., at p. 692:

In the present instance we
have to consider whether a petition to wind up a company falls upon the one
side of the line or the other—whether, as the Master of the Rolls has said, it
is more like an action which does not necessarily involve damage, and therefore
will not, however maliciously and wrongfully brought, justify an action for
malicious prosecution, or whether it is more like a bankruptcy petition. I do
not see how a petition to wind up a company can be presented and advertised in
the newspapers without striking a blow at its credit. I suppose that most of
the lawyers of the present day have seen a great increase of

[Page 623]

three kinds of abuses, all
of which are indulged in for the purpose of extorting the payment of some debt,
which ought to be the subject of some civil redress. There is the abuse of the
police courts when their process is used to extort money; there is the abuse of
the bankruptcy law; and there is the abuse of the provisions in the Companies
Act, 1862, for winding up companies. In all these three forms of abuse the aim
is to wreck credit, and I should be sorry to think that since they all involve
a blow at the credit of those against whom they are instituted, the law did not
afterwards place in the hands of the injured and aggrieved persons who have
been wrongfully assailed, a means of righting themselves and recouping
themselves, as far as can be, for the mischief done to them.

That publicity attended the
laying of the information in this case is clear. The evidence established that
employees of the respondent were not only aware of it, but passed the
information on to others.

I am therefore of the opinion,
with great respect to the views expressed in the Court below, that, as the
respondent had caused everything to be done which could be done wrongfully to
set the law in motion against the appellant on a criminal charge, an action for
malicious prosecution lay against the respondent, the other required elements
of that tort being established.

In my opinion the appeal should
be allowed and the judgment at trial restored, with costs to the appellant in
this Court and in the Court below.

JUDSON J. (dissenting):—I
would dismiss this appeal. I agree completely with the reasons delivered by the
Nova Scotia Supreme Court, in banco[8].

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Appeals—Jurisdiction—Finding
of habitual criminal affirmed in Court of Appeal, but sentence of preventive
detention set aside—Whether Supreme Court of Canada has jurisdiction to
entertain appeal by Crown—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 667—Supreme
Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, s. 41.

Following his conviction on a charge of theft, the respondent
was found to be an habitual criminal, and a sentence of preventive detention

[Page 832]

was imposed in lieu of the sentence imposed for the
substantive offence. The Court of Appeal affirmed the finding that the
respondent was an habitual criminal, but set aside the sentence of preventive
detention and restored the sentence of one year imposed upon him by the
Magistrate. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court. The only
question raised was whether a sentence of preventive detention should be
imposed. At the hearing of the appeal the question of the jurisdiction of this
Court was raised for the first time from the Bench. The contention of the Crown
was that there was an appeal to this Court under the provisions of s. 41 of the
Supreme Court Act.

Held (Taschereau C.J. and Martland J. dissenting): The
appeal should be quashed.

Per Cartwright J.: Since the decisions of this Court in
Brusch v. The Queen, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 373 and Parkes v. The Queen
[1956] S.C.R. 134, it could not be said that any right of appeal to this Court
was conferred by the Criminal Code . An order made under Part XXI of the
Code is neither a conviction nor an acquittal of an indictable offence. If the
Crown has a right of appeal it must be found in s. 41(1) of the Supreme
Court Act. However, the power to grant the right of appeal sought by the Crown
in this case is not conferred by the general words of s. 41(1) although on
their literal meaning they would appear wide enough to comprehend it. The
construction of s. 41(1), for which the Crown contends in this case would
result in an incongruity. The case of The King v. Robinson (or Robertson),
[1951] S.C.R. 522, could not now be regarded as an authority for the existence
of jurisdiction in this Court to entertain an appeal by the Crown from a
judgment of a Court of Appeal setting aside a sentence of preventive detention.

Per Abbott, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.: This Court
was without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. Neither the Crown nor the
accused is given any right under the Criminal Code  to appeal to this
Court from the disposition made of an application for preventive detention by
the Court of Appeal of a province. The sentence of preventive detention could
only have been imposed on a man who had been found to have the status of an
habitual criminal, but it was the conviction of an indictable offence which
afforded the occasion for its imposition and as this appeal is from the
sentence—the finding as to status not being an issue—it is governed by the
decision of this Court in Goldhar v. The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 60, where
it was held that this Court has not jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against
sentence. Parliament could not have intended the anomaly which would result
from the provisions of s. 667(2)  of the Criminal Code  and s. 41(1) of
the Supreme Court Act, if there was an appeal to this Court at the
instance of the Crown from an order of the Court of Appeal setting aside a
sentence of preventive detention.

Per Taschereau C.J. and Martland J., dissenting:
It is clear that no appeal lies to this Court from a sentence imposed under s.
660  of the Criminal Code  by virtue of the provisions of the Criminal
Code  governing appeals in respect of indictable offences, for such appeals
are limited to judgments respecting convictions or acquittal of an indictable
offence. However, all the necessary elements of s. 41(1) of the Supreme
Court Act are met in this case. The decisions in Goldhar v. The Queen,
supra, and in The Queen v. Alepin Frères Ltée, [1965] S.C.R. 359, do
not preclude an appeal in the present case. A sentence under s. 660  is not
imposed as a punishment for the indictable offence, but 

[Page 833]

is imposed because the accused is an habitual criminal and it
is expedient that the public be protected from him. The contention that, while
an appeal to this Court might lie in relation to the finding that the accused
is an habitual criminal, it could not lie in respect of the question as to
whether it was expedient for the protection of the public that he be sentenced,
could not be supported. There is no incongruity in permitting an appeal by the
Crown in this case. Section 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act was a means
provided by Parliament to enable this Court to deal with a situation such as
the one in this case. There is no valid reason for reading into s. 41(1) of the
Supreme Court Act a limitation as to an appeal by the Crown when a right
of appeal by the accused is well recognized. Leave having been granted, this
Court did have jurisdiction to entertain the present appeal.

As to the merits, the Court of Appeal erred when it ruled that
it could not impose a preventive sentence unless there was evidence on which a
magistrate could find beyond a reasonable doubt that it was expedient for the
protection of the public to so sentence the accused. A standard which is
applied in weighing proof of the guilt of the accused has no application to the
formulation of an opinion as to what is expedient to protect the public.

déclaration que l'intimé était un repris de justice, mais mit de côté la
sentence de détention préventive et rétablit la sentence d'un an qui avait été
imposée par le magistrat. La Couronne a obtenu permission d'en appeler devant
cette Cour. La seule question soulevée était de savoir si une sentence de
détention préventive pouvait être imposée. Lors de l'audition de l'appel, la
question de la juridiction de cette Cour a été soulevée pour la première fois
par la Cour. La prétention de la Couronne était qu'il y avait appel devant cette
Cour en vertu des dispositions de l'art. 41 de la Loi la Cour suprême.

Arrêt: L'appel
doit être rejeté, le Juge en Chef Taschereau et le Juge Martland étant
dissidents.

Le Juge
Cartwright: Depuis les jugements de cette Cour dans Brusch v. The Queen,
[1953] 1 R.C.S. 373 et Parkes v. The Queen, [1956] R.C.S. 134, on ne
peut pas dire qu'un droit d'appel devant cette Cour est attribué par le Code
criminel . Une ordonnance passée en vertu de la partie XXI du Code est ni
une déclaration de culpabilité ni un acquittement d'un acte criminel. Si la
Couronne a un droit d'appel, ce droit doit se trouver dans l'art. 41(1) de la Loi
sur la Cour suprême. Cependant, le pouvoir d'accorder le droit d'appel
recherché par la Couronne dans cette cause ne se trouve pas dans les mots 

[Page 834 ]

généraux de l'art. 41(1) quoique en regard de
leur sens littéral ces mots semblent avoir une étendue assez grande pour
englober ce pouvoir. L'interprétation de l'art. 41(1) telle que soutenue par la
Couronne dans cette cause aurait le résultat de créer une incongruité. La cause
de The King v. Robinson (or Robertson), [1951] R.C.S. 522, ne peut pas
maintenant être considérée comme une autorité pour l'existence de la
juridiction de cette Cour d'entendre un appel par la Couronne d'un jugement de
la Cour d'Appel mettant de côté une sentence de détention préventive.

Les Juges
Abbott, Judson, Ritchie et Hall: Cette Cour n'avait pas la juridiction
d'entendre l'appel. Le Code criminel  ne donne ni à la Couronne ni à
l'accusé le droit d'en appeler devant cette Cour de la disposition faite par la
Cour d'Appel d'une province de la demande pour détention préventive. La
sentence de détention préventive ne peut être imposée qu'à une personne dont la
statut a été déclaré être celui d'un repris de justice, mais c'est la
déclaration de culpabilité d'un acte criminel qui donne ouverture à
l'imposition de cette sentence, et comme cet appel est de la sentence—la
déclaration relativement au statut n'étant pas en litige—l'appel est gouverné
par la décision de cette Cour dans Goldhar v. The Queen, [1960] R.C.S.
60, où il a été jugé que cette Cour n'avait pas juridiction d'entendre un appel
de la sentence. Le parlement n'a pas pu avoir eu l'intention de créer
l'anomalie qui résulterait des dispositions de l'art. 667(2)  du Code
criminel  et de l'art. 41(1) de la Loi sur la Cour suprême, s'il
existait un appel devant cette Cour de la part de la Couronne d'une ordonnance
de la Cour d'Appel mettant de côté une sentence de détention préventive.

Le Juge en
Chef Taschereau et le Juge Martland, dissidents: Il n'existe aucun appel
devant cette Cour d'une sentence imposée en vertu de l'art. 660  du Code
criminel  en vertu des dispositions du Code criminel  gouvernant les
appels relativement aux actes criminels, de tels appels étant limités aux
jugements relativement à une déclaration de culpabilité ou un acquittement d'un
acte criminel. Cependant, tous les éléments nécessaires de l'art. 41(1) de la Loi
sur la Cour suprême se rencontrent dans cette cause. Les décisions de Goldhar
v. The Queen, supra, et de The Queen v. Alepin Frères Ltée, [1965]
R.C.S. 359, n'empêchent pas un appel dans cette cause. Une sentence en vertu de
l'art. 660  n'est pas imposée comme punition pour un acte criminel, mais est
imposée parce que l'accusé est un repris de justice et qu'il est opportun que
le public soit protégé contre lui. La prétention à l'effet que, quoiqu'un appel
puisse exister relativement à une déclaration que l'accusé est un repris de
justice, un appel ne peut exister relativement à la question de savoir s'il est
opportun pour la protection du public qu'une sentence soit imposée, ne peut pas
être supportée. Il n'y a aucune incongruité de permettre un appel par la
Couronne dans cette cause. L'art. 41(1) de la Loi sur la Cour suprême est
un moyen prévu par le parlement pour permettre à cette Cour de disposer d'une
situation telle que celle qui se présente dans cette cause. Il n'y a en
conséquence aucune raison valide pour voir dans l'art. 41(1) de la Loi sur
la Cour suprême une restriction quant à un appel par la Couronne lorsqu'un
droit d'appel par l'accusé est reconnu. Permission d'appeler ayant été
accordée, cette Cour avait juridiction d'entendre l'appel.

[Page 835]

Quant aux mérites, la Cour d'Appel a erré
quand elle a décidé qu'elle ne pouvait imposer une sentence préventive à moins
qu'elle ne trouve une preuve sur laquelle un magistrat pourrait déclarer hors
de tout doute raisonnable qu'il était opportun pour la protection du public que
l'accusé reçoive une telle sentence. On ne peut se servir pour formuler une
opinion relativement à l'opportunité de protéger le public d'une norme dont on
se sert pour évaluer la preuve relativement à la culpabilité de l'accusé.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia, setting aside a sentence of preventive detention.
Appeal quashed, Taschereau C.J. and Martland J. dissenting.

W. G. Burke-Robertson,
Q.C., for the appellant.

Angus Carmichael, Q.C.,
for the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau C.J.
and of Martland J. was delivered by

MARTLAND J. (dissenting):—This
is an appeal, brought by the Crown, pursuant to leave granted by this Court,
from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, which reversed
the decision of a magistrate, who had imposed a sentence of preventive
detention on the respondent pursuant to s. 660  of the Criminal Code ,
which provides:

660. (1) Where an accused
has been convicted of an indictable offence the court may, upon application,
impose a sentence of preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that
might be imposed for the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed
for such offence, or in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such
offence if the sentence has expired, if

(a) the accused is
found to be an habitual criminal, and

(b) the court is of
the opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient
for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.

(2) For the purposes of
subsection (1), an accused is an habitual criminal if

(a) he has
previously, since attaining the age of eighteen years, on at least three
separate and independent occasions been convicted of an indictable offence for
which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more and is leading
persistently a criminal life, or 

(b) he has been
previously sentenced to preventive detention.

[Page 836]

(3) At the hearing of an
application under subsection (1), the accused is entitled to be present.

This section deals exclusively
with the matter of sentence, as is made clear by the opening words of s.
667(1), which deals with the right of appeal of the accused:

A person who is sentenced to
preventive detention under this Part may appeal to the court of appeal. …

Before a sentence of preventive
detention can be imposed the court must reach a decision on two matters,
defined in paras. (a) and (b) of subs. (1); i.e.,

(a) That the accused is an habitual criminal; and

(b) That because of that fact, it is expedient for the
protection of the public that he should be sentenced to preventive detention.

A decision in favour of the accused
on each of these matters was the basis of the dissenting judgment of MacQuarrie
J., in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in Mulcahy v. The Queen[1]
, which was adopted by this Court[2] when
the appeal of the accused was allowed.

These matters are, I think, of
importance in considering the first issue raised by the respondent as to the
jurisdiction of this Court to hear this appeal.

It is clear that no appeal lies
to this Court from a sentence imposed under s. 660  by virtue of the provisions
of the Criminal Code  governing appeals in respect of indictable
offences, for such appeals are limited to judgments respecting conviction or
acquittal of an indictable offence.

Appeals to this Court, in respect
of a sentence under s. 660 , have been brought, with leave pursuant to s. 41(1)
of the Supreme Court Act, which provides:

41. (1) Subject to
subsection (3), an appeal lies to the Supreme Court with leave of that Court
from any final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a
province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular
case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal
to the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court.

As my brother Cartwright points
out, in the present case, all of the necessary elements of that subsection are
here met. The judgment of the Court of Appeal is a final judgment, and it is
the judgment of the highest court of final resort in which judgment could be
had in this case.

[Page 837]

This being so, on what basis can
it be contended that this Court lacks jurisdiction? In my opinion the decisions
in Goldhar v. The Queen[3]
and in The Queen[4] v.
Alepin Frères Ltée and Clément Alepin[5] do
not preclude an appeal in the present case. Each case was concerned solely with
the matter of sentence in respect of an offence imposed in consequence of a
conviction of such offence. A sentence under s. 660 , while it is made following
conviction of an indictable offence, is not imposed as a punishment for that
offence, but is imposed because the accused is an habitual criminal and it is
expedient that the public be protected from him. In Parkes v. The Queen[6]
, Cartwright J., who delivered the judgment of the Court, said, at p. 135:

It appears to me that the
majority of this Court decided in Brusch v. The Queen, (1953) 1 S.C.R.
373, that the ""charge"" of being an habitual criminal is not a charge
of an offence or crime but is merely an assertion of the existence of a status
or condition in the accused which, if established, enables the Court to deal
with the accused in a certain manner. In so deciding the majority followed the
reasoning of the English courts in Rex v. Hunter, (1921) 1 K.B. 555,
approved by a court of thirteen judges precided over by Lord Hewart L.C.J. in Rex
v. Norman, (1924) 18 Cr. App. R. 81.

It is, therefore, established
that a sentence under s. 660  is not one which is imposed in relation to a
charge of an offence or crime, but is a disposition which may be made by the
court, if it is expedient for the protection of the public, with relation to a
person in a particular status or condition.

Appeals from a sentence under s.
660  have been determined in this Court on a number of occasions, one of the
most recent being the Mulcahy case previously mentioned, in which Chief
Justice Taschereau commenced his judgment with the words: ""We are all of
the opinion that the appeal against sentence of preventive detention should be
allowed …""

It is contended that, while an
appeal to this Court might lie in relation to the finding of the accused to be
an habitual criminal, it could not lie in respect of the question as to whether
it was expedient for the protection of the public that he be sentenced. If a
finding as to the status of the accused, on the first point, is not a judgment
acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or

[Page 838]

acquittal of an indictable
offence, within s. 41(3) of the Supreme Court Act, as was held in the Parkes
case, I find it hard to understand how the decision on the second point as to
expedience can fall within it. Furthermore, I do not agree that the appeal to
this Court respecting matters under s. 660  can be arbitrarily divided in
respect of the two items under paras. (a) and (b) of subs. (1).
Any appeal in relation to s. 660  is an appeal from sentence, but it is not
within s. 41(3) of the Supreme Court Act because, as was said in Parkes,
it does not relate to conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence, but to
a method of dealing with people of a particular status.

Another ground for contending
that no appeal lies in the present case is because this appeal is by the Crown,
and the Crown is limited, in respect of its right of appeal to the court of
appeal, to matters of law, and consequently the general words of s. 41(1) of
the Supreme Court Act should be narrowed in respect of the nature of
this subject-matter. It is said that it would be incongruous to permit an open
appeal by the Crown to this Court, when it has only a limited right in the
court below.

The Crown's right to appeal to
the court of appeal, while limited to a question of law, is absolute, whereas
there is no appeal to this Court under s. 41(1) without leave.

The limitation upon the position
of the Crown in the court of appeal is only in those cases in which the accused
has succeeded in the court of first instance. In a case of that kind, if the
Crown's appeal to the court of appeal failed, it is clear that, if it were to
obtain leave to appeal to this Court, its appeal, of necessity, could only lie
in relation to the question of law which had been determined adversely to it in
the court of appeal. Under s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act, this Court
could only dismiss the appeal or give the judgment which should have been given
in the court below, i.e., on a question of law.

In the case of an appeal to the
court of appeal by an accused who has been sentenced under s. 660 , it would be
open to the Crown to raise any ground for contending that the initial decision
should be maintained, and in respect of that kind of an appeal the position of
the Crown is unrestricted. That being so, I do not find it incongruous that it 

[Page 839]

should be entitled to seek leave
to appeal to this Court on any ground taken by it before the court of appeal.

In the present case, the ground
for seeking leave was solely with respect to an important question of law on
which it was contended that the Court of Appeal had erred. If the Crown can
appeal on a matter of law to the Court of Appeal, and if the accused can seek
leave to appeal to this Court upon any ground, I see no basis for limiting the
words of s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act so as to preclude any right
of appeal by the Crown to this Court, upon a question of law. To deny such a
right is to make it possible for differing applications of s. 660  in different
provinces, with no power in this Court to determine the matter. Section 41(1)
was a means provided by Parliament to enable this Court to deal with a
situation of that kind.

I can, therefore, see no valid
reason for reading into s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act a limitation
as to an appeal by the Crown when a right of appeal to this Court by the
accused is well recognized.

I am, therefore, of the opinion
that this Court does have jurisdiction to entertain the present appeal, leave
having been granted.

The decision of the Court of
Appeal, that, although the respondent was an habitual criminal, yet it was not
expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive
detention, was stated to be based on the proposition that a court, under s.
660 , cannot impose that sentence unless there is evidence ""on which a
magistrate could find beyond a reasonable doubt that it was expedient for the
protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.""

Proof beyond reasonable doubt is
the well-recognized standard applied in the criminal law in respect of the
establishing of the guilt of an accused person. In my opinion it has no
application to the matter of the imposition of sentence. A court, under s. 660 ,
having determined that an accused person is an habitual criminal, is required
to exercise its judgment as to whether it is expedient for the protection of
the public to impose a sentence of preventive detention. Section 660(1) (b)
states specifically that this is a matter of opinion. That opinion must be as
to expediency for public protection. In my view, a standard which is

[Page 840]

applied in weighing proof of a
fact, i.e., guilt of the accused, has no application to the formulation of an
opinion as to what is expedient to protect the public.

I would allow the appeal and
restore the judgment of the magistrate.

CARTWRIGHT J.:—An account of the
proceedings in the courts below is given in the reasons of my brother Ritchie.

On March 15, 1965, an order was
made by this Court the operative part of which reads as follows:

THIS COURT DID ORDER AND
ADJUDGE that leave to appeal from the Judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province of British Columbia pronounced on the 24th day of February, 1965 be and the same is
granted.

No question as to the
jurisdiction of this Court was raised or considered when this order granting
leave was made. The question of our jurisdiction was raised for the first time
from the bench during the argument of the appeal.

It is well settled that a person
who has been sentenced to preventive detention and whose appeal against that
sentence has been dismissed by the Court of Appeal may be granted leave to
appeal to this Court under s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act. On this
point it is sufficient to refer to the unanimous judgment of the Court in Parkes
v. The Queen[7] .
As is pointed out by my brother Ritchie, a number of such appeals have been
allowed by this Court.

As far as I am aware, subject to
something to be said later as to Robinson's case, infra, the
question whether this Court has jurisdiction to grant leave to the Attorney
General to appeal to this Court against the dismissal of an application for an
order that a person be sentenced to preventive detention has not previously
been considered by this Court. The answer to this question depends upon the
proper construction of the relevant statutory provisions.

Little assistance is to be found
in the comparatively short history of the legislation in this country relating
to preventive detention. The predecessors of the group of sections which now
form Part XXI of the Criminal Code  were first enacted by Statutes of
Canada, 1947, 11 Geo. VI, c. 55 and

[Page 841]

were numbered 575A to 575H.
Section 575E corresponded to the present s. 667, which is set out in full in the
reasons of my brother Ritchie. It was silent as to any right of the Attorney
General to appeal. It read as follows:

575E. A person convicted and
sentenced to preventive detention, may appeal against his conviction and
sentence, and the provisions of this Act relating to an appeal from a
conviction for an indictable offence shall be applicable thereto.

The first alteration in the
provisions as to appeal was made when the present Criminal Code , 2-3
Eliz. II, c. 51, came into force on April 1, 1955,
at which time s. 667  read as follows:

667(1) A person who is
sentenced to preventive detention under this Part may appeal to the Court of
Appeal against the sentence.

(2) The Attorney General may
appeal to the court of appeal against the dismissal of an application for an
order under this Part.

(3) The provisions of Part
XVIII with respect to procedure on appeals apply, mutatis mutandis, to
appeals under this section.

Section 667, in its present form
was enacted by Statutes of Canada, 1960-61, 9-10 Eliz. II, c. 43, s. 40.

It is clear that the provisions
quoted above deal only with the right of appeal to the Court of Appeal from a
decision of the tribunal of first instance. It cannot be said that sub-section
(3) of s. 667, providing that ""the provisions of Part XVIII with respect
to procedure on appeals apply, mutatis mutandis to appeals under this
section"", has the effect of conferring jurisdiction on this Court. Part
XVIII deals only with appeals in regard to convictions or acquittals of
indictable offences.

Since the decisions of this Court
in Brusch v. The Queen[8]
and Parkes v. The Queen[9] ,
it cannot be said that any right of appeal to this Court is conferred by the Criminal
Code . An order made under Part XXI is neither a conviction nor an acquittal
of an indictable offence. If the Attorney General has a right of appeal to this
Court it must be found in s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act. It is clear
that if on its true construction subs. (1) confers the right of appeal which
the Attorney General seeks to assert that right is not taken

[Page 842]

away by the terms of subs. (3)
for we are not here concerned with the judgment of any court acquitting or
convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an
indictable offence or of any offence.

Section 41(1) reads a follows:

41(1) Subject to subsection
(3), an appeal lies to the Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any
final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, or
a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to
be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme
Court has been refused by any other court.

Applying these words to the
circumstances of the case before us it appears: (i) that the judgment from which
the Attorney General appeals is a final judgment, it finally determines that
the sentence of preventive detention imposed upon the respondent by the learned
Magistrate is set aside; and (ii) that it is a judgment of the highest court of
final resort in the Province of British Columbia in which judgment can be had
in this particular case. That being so, the application for leave to appeal
made by the Attorney General would appear to be warranted by the literal
meaning of the words of the sub-section and prima facie this Court would
seem to have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal unless it appears by the
application of the rules which guide the Court in the interpretation of
statutes that Parliament did not intend to confer a right of appeal from a
judgment such as that pronounced by the Court of Appeal in this case.

The words of s. 41(1) are general
and it is necessary to consider the possible application of the rule expressed
in the maxim ""Verba generalia restringuntur ad habilitatem rei vel
personae"" (Bac. Max. reg. 10) Broom's Legal Maxims, 10th ed. 438. The
maxim was applied in Cox v. Hakes[10] .
It was held in that case by the House of Lords that the following words in s.
19 of the Judicature Act, 36 and 37 Vict., c. 66:

19. The said Court of Appeal
shall have jurisdiction and power to hear and determine appeals from any
judgment or order …of Her Majesty's High Court of Justice, or of any Judges or
Judge thereof

[Page 843]

did not confer a right of appeal
from an order of the High Court directing the discharge of a prisoner on habeas
corpus, although as was said by Lord Herschell at page 428:

It cannot be denied that an
order for the discharge of a person in custody, such as was made in the present
case, is, prima facie, an order to which this section applies.

Lord Bramwell, at page 527,
concluded his speech with the following sentence:

I think if an order of
discharge is a judgment or order of judicature, and so within the very words of
section 19, a limitation must be put upon them to avoid futility, inconvenience,
and incongruity which would otherwise result.

The construction of s. 41(1), for
which the Attorney General contends in the case at bar would result in an
incongruity pointed out in the reasons of my brother Ritchie to which further
reference will be made.

I am able to derive little
assistance in the solution of the question before us from the judgments of this
Court in Goldhar v. The Queen[11]
or in The Queen v. Alepin Frères Ltée and Clément Alepin[12]
. They establish only that this Court is without jurisdiction to entertain
an appeal, even on a question of law in the strict sense, against a judgment of
the Court of Appeal affirming or quashing a sentence imposed following
conviction of an indictable offence or of an offence other than an indictable offence;
and it is well settled that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal
against the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention. There is
something to be said for the view that the Court should have a corresponding
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against an order dismissing an application
for the imposition of such a sentence, but in dealing with a similar argument
in Cox v. Hakes, supra, Lord Herschell said at pages 535 and 536:

It will be seen that the
reasoning which has led me to the conclusion that an appeal will not lie from
an order discharging a person from custody under a writ of habeas corpus has no
application to an appeal from an order refusing to discharge the applicant. I
intend to express no opinion whether there is an appeal in such a case. That
question does not arise here, and any opinion expressed upon it would be extra-judicial.
I refer

[Page 844]

to it only because it was
suggested that if there was an appeal in the one case, it was scarcely to be
conceived that there should not be an appeal in the other. I do not think so.
There would be to my mind nothing surprising if it should turn out that an
appeal lay by one whose discharge had been refused, but that there was no
appeal against a discharge from custody. It would be in strict analogy to that
which has long been the law. The discharge could never be reviewed or
interfered with; the refusal to discharge, on the other hand, was always open
to review; and although this review was not properly speaking, by way of appeal
its practical effect was precisely the same as if it had been.

My brother Ritchie points out
that if we should uphold the Attorney General's right of appeal in this case it
would have the anomalous result which he describes as follows:

It would mean that although
the Crown is restricted to ""any ground of law"" when appealing to the
Court of Appeal of a province against the dismissal of an application for
preventive detention by a trial judge, it can obtain access to this Court on
unrestricted grounds when appealing from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
which has the same effect.

The unlikelihood of Parliament
intending such a result appears to me to be a sufficient reason for applying
the maxim quoted above and holding that power to grant the right of appeal
sought by the Attorney General in this case is not conferred by the general
words of s. 41(1) although on their literal meaning they would appear wide
enough to comprehend it.

Before parting with the matter I
wish to refer to the case of The King v. Robinson (or Robertson)[13]
, which, on its face, appears inconsistent with the conclusion at which I
have arrived. The respondent in that case was found to be a habitual criminal
and was sentenced by Whittaker J. to preventive detention. On appeal to the Court
of Appeal for British Columbia[14] the sentence of preventive detention was set aside.
The Attorney General applied to a single judge of this Court under s. 1025  of
the Criminal Code  then in force for leave to appeal on a question of
law. Leave was granted and the full Court allowed the appeal, set aside the
judgment of the Court of Appeal and referred the matter back to that Court to
deal with other grounds which had been raised in the notice of appeal but which
the Court had found it unnecessary to consider in view of its decision on the
point

[Page 845]

of law. I was a member of the
Court which heard the appeal and took part in the judgment allowing the appeal
of the Attorney General. I have confirmed my recollection by examining the
record and consulting the Judge who gave leave and it is clear that our
jurisdiction was not questioned at any stage of the proceedings in this Court.
The Court and all counsel concerned appear to have proceeded on the view that
an appeal to this Court lay as if the finding that the respondent was a
habitual criminal was tantamount to his conviction of an indictable offence.
This view may have been induced by the following expressions found in the
sections then in force which no longer appear in Part XXI: in s. 575 C(3) ""unless
he thereafter pleads guilty to being a habitual criminal""; in s. 575 C.(4)
""A person shall not be tried on a charge of being a habitual criminal
unless""; in s. 575 E, ""a person convicted and sentenced to preventive
detention, may appeal against his conviction and sentence, and the provisions
of this Act relating to an appeal from a conviction for an indictable offence
shall be applicable thereto""; and in s. 575 G(1) ""The sentence of
preventive detention shall take effect immediately on the conviction of a
person on a charge that he is a habitual criminal"".

It is, I think, a tenable view
that under the wording of the relevant sections then in force the procedure
followed in Robinson's case was correct. The question of a right of
appeal to this Court was not discussed in Brusch v. The Queen, supra,
and by the time Parkes v. The Queen, supra, was decided Part XXI had
been enacted in substantially its present form. In view of the changes in
wording made when the new Code came into force and the decision of this Court
in Parkes v. The Queen, supra, it is my opinion that Robinson's
case cannot now be regarded as an authority for the existence of jurisdiction
in this Court to entertain an appeal by the Attorney General from a judgment of
a Court of Appeal setting aside a sentence of preventive detention.

I would dispose of the appeal as
proposed by my brother Ritchie.

The judgment of Abbott, Judson,
Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by

[Page 846]

RITCHIE J.:—This is an appeal
brought at the instance of Attorney General of British Columbia and with leave
of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. The order for judgment of that court reads, in part, as follows:

THIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND
ADJUDGE that the Appeal of the above-named Appellant from the finding that the
Appellant is an habitual criminal be and the same is hereby dismissed, the
Appeal of the above-named Appellant from the sentence of preventive detention
imposed on him be and the same is hereby allowed, the sentence of preventive
detention imposed on him as aforesaid be and the same is hereby set aside, and
pursuant to section 667  of the Criminal Code , a sentence of imprisonment in
Oakalla Prison Farm, Burnaby, British Columbia, for a term of one year be and
the same is hereby imposed in respect of the said conviction by Magistrate L.
H. Jackson entered on the 20th day of May 1964 on the above-described charge,
such sentence to run from the 20th day of May, 1964.

No appeal has been asserted from
the finding that the respondent, Robert MacDonald is an habitual criminal and
the Crown seeks to confine its appeal to that part of the judgment which
allowed the appellant's appeal from the sentence of preventive detention
imposed on him by Magistrate Cyril White of Vancouver on December 29, 1964.

Robert MacDonald was tried and
convicted before Magistrate Jackson on the charge that he ""unlawfully did
commit theft of one case containing 50 cartons of DuMaurier cigarettes of a
value in excess of $50.00 …"" and for this crime he was sentenced to
imprisonment for a term of one year. Having regard to the respondent's past
criminal record, an application was made with the consent of the Attorney
General of British Columbia for the imposition of a sentence of preventive
detention in lieu of the sentence imposed upon him by Magistrate Jackson.

Applications for preventive
detention are governed by s. 660  of the Criminal Code  which reads as
follow:

660. (1) Where an accused
has been convicted of an indictable offence the court may, upon application, impose
a sentence of preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that might be
imposed for the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed for such
offence, or in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such offence if
the sentence has expired, if

(a) The accused is
found to be an habitual criminal, and

[Page 847]

(b) the court is of
the opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is expedient
for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention.

(2) For the purposes of
subsection (1), an accused is an habitual criminal if

(a) he has
previously, since attaining the age of eighteen years, on at least three
separate and independent occasions been convicted of an indictable offence for
which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more and is leading
persistently a criminal life, or

(b) he has been
previously sentenced to preventive detention.

(3) At the hearing of an
application under subsection (1), the accused is entitled to be present.

It is to be observed that the
finding that an accused is an habitual criminal is a necessary prerequisite to
the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention but that it does not
result in the imposition of such a sentence unless the court is of opinion that
it is expedient for the protection of the public that it should be imposed. As
has been indicated, the only question raised on this appeal is whether a
sentence of preventive detention should have been imposed in the present case.

The only provision in the Criminal
Code  for an appeal from the disposition of an application made under s. 660 
is contained in s. 667  and it was pursuant to the provisions of this section
that the respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia. This section reads as follows:

667.(1) A person who is
sentenced to preventive detention under this Part may appeal to the court of
appeal against that sentence on any ground of law or fact or mixed law and
fact.

(2) The Attorney General may
appeal to the court of appeal against the dismissal of an application for an
order under this Part on any ground of law.

(2a) On an appeal against a
sentence of preventive detention the court of appeal may

(a) quash such
sentence and impose any sentence that might have been imposed in respect of the
offence for which the appellant was convicted, or

(b) dismiss the
appeal.

(2b) On an appeal against
the dismissal of an application for an order under this Part the court of
appeal may

(a) allow the appeal,
set aside any sentence imposed in respect of the offence for which the
respondent was convicted and impose a sentence of preventive detention, or

(b) dismiss the
appeal.

[Page 848]

(2c) A judgment of the court
of appeal imposing a sentence pursuant to this section has the same force and
effect as if it were a sentence passed by the trial court.

(3) The provisions of Part
XVIII with respect to procedure on appeals apply, mutatis mutandis, to
appeals under this section.

Under this section the right of
the Attorney General to appeal against the dismissal of an applicaiton for
preventive detention is strictly limited to ""any ground of law"" and
it is to be observed also that neither the Crown nor the accused is given any
right under the Criminal Code  to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
from the disposition made of such an application by the Court of Appeal of a
province. It is contended, however, on behalf of the Attorney General of
British Columbia that an appeal lies to this Court under the provisions of s.
41 of the Supreme Court Act which reads, in part, a follows:

41(1) Subject to subsection
(3), an appeal lies to the Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any
final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, or
a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to
be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme
Court has been refused by any other court.

***

(3) No appeal to the Supreme
Court lies under this section from the judgment of any court acquitting or
convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an
indictable offence or, except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction,
of an offence other than an indictable offence.

Counsel for the appellant
concedes that it has been decided in the case of Goldhar v. The Queen[15]
that criminal offences and sentences imposed therefor are excluded from the
operation of s. 41(1) by the terms of s. 41(3), but he contends that a sentence
of preventive detention is imposed as a result of a finding that the accused
has the status of an habitual criminal which this Court has held not to be a
criminal offence (see Brusch v. The Queen[16] ).
It is therefore argued that the judgment of the Court of Appeal setting aside
the sentence of preventive detention is unaffected by s. 41(3) and is a
judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province determining the
rights of an individual and

[Page 849]

accordingly a proper subject for
appeal under section 41(1).

There have been a number of cases
in this Court in which leave to appeal has been granted pursuant to s. 41(1)
from the granting of an application for the imposition of a sentence of
preventive detention under s. 660 , but each of these cases involved an appeal
from the finding that the person seeking leave to appeal was an habitual
criminal, and that finding was in each instance set aside with the result that
the sentence of preventive detention for which it was a prerequisite was also
set aside. As has been indicated, it is upon the ground that the finding that a
man is an habitual criminal is a determination of status and not a conviction
of a criminal offence that leave to appeal has been granted in the past and
counsel were unable to cite any case except the present one in which the
finding of status was not in issue and the entire appeal has been limited to
the question of sentence.

Reference was made to the case of
Mulcahy v. The Queen[17]
where the judgment of this Court is reported as follows:

We are all of opinion that
the appeal against the sentence of preventive detention should be allowed for
the reasons given by MacQuarrie J. and that the record should be returned to
the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco to impose a sentence for the
substantive offence of which the appellant was convicted.

It must be noted, however, that
in that case MacQuarrie J. had concluded his reasons for judgment by saying:

I would allow the appeal, quash
the finding that the appellant was an habitual criminal and the sentence
that he be held in preventive detention, and impose a sentence of three years
in Dorchester Penitentiary for the substantive offence"".

The italics are my own.

It is true that the finding of
the appellant's status in the present case was not a conviction of a criminal
offence, but the sentence of preventive detention imposed by Magistrate White
was ""in lieu of the sentence of one year imposed earlier upon the said
Robert Cecil MacDonald …"" upon his conviction for an indictable offence.
The sentence of preventive detention could only have been imposed on a man who
had been found to have the status of an habitual criminal,

[Page 850]

but it was the conviction of an
indictable offence which afforded the occasion for its imposition and as this
appeal is from the sentence and the finding as to status is not an issue, it
is, in my opinion, governed by the decision of this Court in Goldhar v. The
Queen, supra.

The effect of the Goldhar
case is summarized in the judgment of Taschereau J., as he then was, in Paul
v. The Queen[18] ,
where he says at 457 speaking of s. 41(3):

In matters of indictable
offences, it confers no jurisdiction on this Court, and we must find in the Criminal
Code  the rules that govern such appeals. In summary matters, on the other
hand, jurisdiction to appeal to this Court is given in s. 41(3). It was held in
Goldhar v. The Queen that if an appeal from a sentence was not given by
41(3), nor the Criminal Code , we could not find any authority in 41(1)
to review a sentence imposed by the Courts below. In that case it was stated by
Fauteux J. with whom all the members of the Court agreed, Cartwright J.
dissenting, that in order to determine if a convicted person could appeal
against a sentence in a matter of indictable offence, it was not permissible to
look to s. 41(1) for the authority to intervene, but only in the Criminal
Code  which does not permit an appeal against a sentence.

In the recent case of Her
Majesty the Queen v. J. Alepin Frères Ltéé and Clément Alepin[19]
, the Crown sought to appeal the quashing of a sentence by the court below on
jurisdictional grounds and Fauteux J., speaking on behalf of the Court, had
occasion to comment on the effect of s. 41(1) and 41(3) of the Supreme Court
Act, saying:

It is clear from the terms
of subsection (3) that, unless the judgment sought to be appealed is a judgment
""acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or
acquittal"" of either an indictable offence or an offence other than an
indictable offence, there is no jurisdiction in this Court under that
subsection to entertain this appeal. The judgment here sought to be appealed
does not come within that description. It is not a judgment related to an
acquittal or a conviction of an offence and, while an important question of
jurisdiction is involved therein, this question does not relate to an
acquittal or a conviction within the meaning of subsection (3) but to sentence.
Neither can jurisdiction of this Court be found in subsection (1). The general
proposition that matters which are not mentioned in s. 41(3) must be held to be
comprised in s. 41(1), with the consequence that this Court would have
jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from a judgment of a nature similar to the
one here considered, is ruled out by what was said by this Court in Goldhar
v. The Queen and Paul v. The Queen. It may be a matter of regret
that this Court has no jurisdiction to decide the important question which gave
rise to conflicting

[Page 851]

opinions in the Court below,
but strong as my views may be with respect to that question, I am clearly of
opinion that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.

The italics are my own.

As has been pointed out, the Criminal
Code  makes express provision under s. 667  for appealing to the court of
appeal of a province from the disposition made by a trial judge of an
application for preventive detention and by s. 667(2)  the Attorney General is
limited to ""any ground of law"" in appealing from the dismissal of
such an application. If counsel for the appellant were right in his contention
that an appeal can be had to this Court under s. 41(1), at the instance of the
Crown, from an order of the court of appeal setting aside a sentence of
preventive detention, it would mean that although the Crown is restricted to
""any ground of law"" when appealing to the Court of Appeal of a
province against the dismissal of an application for preventive detention by a
trial judge, it can obtain access to this Court on unrestricted grounds when
appealing from a judgment of the Court of Appeal which has the same effect. I
cannot think that Parliament intended such an anomaly to result from the
provisions of s. 667(2)  of the Criminal Code  and s. 41(1) of the Supreme
Court Act.

The limitation to ""any
ground of law"" of the right of the Attorney General to appeal to the Court
of Appeal was first enacted by Chapter 43 of the Statutes of Canada,
1960-61, and s. 667(2)  in its present form has not been previously considered
by this Court.

In view of the above, I am of
opinion that this Court is without jurisdiction in the circumstances and I
would accordingly quash this appeal.

Appeal quashed, TASCHEREAU C.J. and MARTLAND J. dissenting.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO

Criminal law—Notice of appeal
to Court of Appeal expressing appellant's wish to be present and argue orally—Appellant
not present and not represented—Jurisdiction of Court of Appeal to hear and
dismiss appeal—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 549(1).

[Page 659]

Following his conviction for the offence of having possession
of instruments for house-breaking, the appellant gave notice of his intention
to appeal on a printed form in which he expressly stated his wish to be present
and to present oral argument. When the matter came before the Court of Appeal,
the appellant was not present; he was still in custody; he was not represented
by counsel and had not been notified of the date on which the appeal was to be
heard. The Court of Appeal nevertheless dismissed his appeal from conviction
and increased his sentence from two to five years. He was granted leave to
appeal to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be allowed and the record
should be referred back to the Court of Appeal for a hearing in accordance with
the Criminal Code .

Under s. 594(1) of the Code, the appellant had a statutory
right to be present and to submit his case by oral argument. When it appeared
that he had expressed his desire to be present, that he was not present and
that he had received no notice of the date of the hearing, the Court of Appeal
had no right to enter upon the hearing and should have adjourned the case to
enable the appellant to be present. To proceed in his absence was error in law.

Droit Criminel—Avis
d'appel à la Cour d'Appel exprimant le désir de l'appelant d'être présent et de
plaider oralement—L'appelant non présent et non représenté—Juridiction de la
Cour d'Appel d'entendre et de rejeter I'appel—Code criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c.
51, art. 549(1).

À la suite de sa condamnation pour I'offense
d'avoir eu en sa possession des instruments d'effraction, I'appelant a donné
avis de son intention d'appeler sur une formule imprimée dans laquelle il a
expressément déclaré son désir d'être présent et de présenter une plaidoirie
orale. Lorsque I'appel vint devant la Cour d'Appel, I'appelant n'était pas
présent; il était encore sous garde; il n'était pas représenté par un avocat et
n'avait pas été notifié de la date que I'appel devait être entendu. La Cour
d'Appel a quand même rejeté son appel contre la condamnation et a augmenté sa
sentence de deux à cinq ans. Il a obtenu permission d'appeler devant cette
Cour.

Arrêt: L'appel
doit être maintenu et le dossier renvoyé à la Cour d'Appel pour une audition
conformément au Code criminel .

En vertu de I'art. 594(1) du Code, I'appelant
avait un droit statutaire d'être présent et de soumettre son appel par un
plaidoyer oral. Lorsqu'il apparut qu'il avait exprimé le désir d'être présent,
qu'il n'était pas présent et qu'il n'avait pas reçu notification de la date de
l'audition, la Cour d'Appel n'avait pas le droit d'entendre la cause et aurait
dû ajourner I'appel pour permettre à I'appelant d'être présent. Ce fut une
erreur de droit que de procéder en son absence.

APPEL d'un jugement
de la Cour d'Appel de l'Ontario, confirmant la condamnation de l'appelant.
Appel maintenu.

[Page 660]

APPEAL from a judgment from
the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the appellant's conviction. Appeal
allowed.

B.Carter, for the
appellant.

C.Powell, for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J.:—This appeal from a
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario is brought pursuant to leave granted by this court
on April 27, 1965, on the following question of law:

Had the Court of Appeal
jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing of the application to that Court when
the appellant, who had given notice that he desired to be present at the
hearing of his appeal, was in custody, was not represented by counsel, was not
present at the hearing of the appeal and had not been notified of the time of
the hearing of his appeal?

The appellant was convicted
before His Honour Judge Moore at Toronto on April 16,
 1964, of the offence of having
possession of instruments for house-breaking, without lawful excuse, contrary
to s. 295  of the Criminal Code , and was sentenced on the same day to two
years imprisonment.

The appellant who was then in
custody in the Toronto jail gave a notice dated May 7, 1964, on a printed
form headed: ""Form of Notice of Appeal or Application for leave to
Appeal.""

Following the heading giving the
appellant's name and particulars of the conviction and sentence as contemplated
by the printed form, the notice reads as follows:

I hereby give you notice that
I desire to appeal (or apply for leave to appeal, as the case may be) to the
Court of Appeal against my conviction (or against my sentence) on the
grounds following:—

See Attached sheets.

I desire to present my case
and argument ""By Oral Argument"" (Fill in either ""in
writing"" or ""by oral argument,"" as the case may be)

If a new trial is directed I
""Desire""

(""desire"" or
""do not desire"" as the case may be)

that such new trial be
before a jury.

My address for service is 550 Gerrard Street East, Toronto,
 Ontario. 

(Fill in carefully, as this
is important)

Dated this 7th day of May,
1964. 

Bradford L. Smith

(Signature of the appellant
or of his solicitor or counsel)

[Page 661]

The ""Attached sheets""
referred to in the notice set out eleven numbered grounds none of which
involves a question of law alone.

The matter came before the Court
of Appeal on June 23, 1964. The appellant was not present; he was still in
custody; he was not represented by counsel and he had been given no notice of
the date on which the appeal was to be heard. That this is so was stated before
us by counsel for the appellant and by counsel for the Attorney General.

At the conclusion of the hearing
the Court of Appeal delivered oral reasons in which no reference is made to the
absence of the accused. The formal judgment of the Court reads as follows:

This is to certify that the
application for leave to appeal and the appeal in writing of the above named
Bradford Leonard Smith against his conviction and sentence, having come on to
be heard before this Court this day in the presence of Counsel for the Crown,
and upon having read the Notice of Application for leave to appeal and Judge's
Report, and upon hearing what was alleged by Counsel for the Crown, aforesaid,

This Court did order that
the said appeal against conviction should be and the same was thereby dismissed
as frivolous.

And this Court did further
order that the application for leave to appeal against sentence should be and
the same was thereby granted, and that the sentence of two (2) years be set
aside and a sentence of five (5) years in penitentiary substituted therefor.

Rule 16 of the Criminal Appeal
Rules in force in Ontario at the time the matter was dealt with by the Court
of Appeal, read as follows:

16. If it is not the
intention of the appellant to present his case before the Court orally he shall
be at liberty to make his argument in writing, in which case notice of his
intention shall be embodied in the notice of appeal or notice of application
for leave to appeal, and a copy of the written argument shall be left with the
Registrar when the appeal is set down or within seven days thereafter.

The appellant's notice quoted
above made it clear that he intended to present his case before the Court
orally and not to make his argument in writing.

Rule 17 of the same rules read as
follows:

17. When the appeal or
application for leave to appeal is ready for hearing the Registrar shall give
notice to the appellant and to the Attorney General of the date that has been
fixed for the hearing of the application and shall place the case upon the list
for hearing upon that date.

The Registrar did not give to the
appellant the notice required by this rule.

[Page 662]

Section 594  of the Criminal
Code  reads as follows:

594 (1) Subject to
subsection (2), an appellant who is in custody is entitled, if he desires, to
be present at the hearing of the appeal.

(2) An appellant who is in
custody and who is represented by counsel is not entitled to be present

(a) at the hearing of
the appeal, where the appeal is on a ground involving a question of law alone,

(b) on an application
for leave to appeal, or

(c) on any proceedings that
are preliminary or incidental to an appeal,

unless rules of court
provide that he is entitled to be present or the court of appeal or a judge
thereof gives him leave to be present.

(3) A convicted person who
is an appellant may present his case on appeal and his argument in writing
instead of orally, and the court of appeal shall consider any case or argument
so presented.

(4) The power of a court of
appeal to impose sentence may be exercised notwithstanding that the appellant
is not present.

In the circumstances of this case
we are concerned only with subs. (1). Subsection (2) has no application because
the accused was not represented by counsel.

Under this section the appellant
had a statutory right to be present and to submit his case to the Court by oral
argument. When it appeared (i) that he had expressed his desire to be present
(ii) that he was not present and (iii) that he had received no notice of the
date of the hearing, I think it clear that the Court had no right to enter upon
the hearing and should have adjourned the case to enable the appellant to be
present. To proceed in his absence was, in my opinion, error in law.

A similar situation arose in England in
the case of The King v. Dunleavey[1].

Section 11(1) of the Criminal
Appeal Act, (1907),7 Edward VII, c.23, read as follows:

An appellant,
notwithstanding that he is in custody, shall be entitled to be present, if he
desires it, on the hearing of his appeal, except where the appeal is on some
ground involving a question of law alone, but, in that case and on an
application for leave to appeal and on any proceedings preliminary or
incidental to an appeal, shall not be entitled to be present, except where
rules of Court provide that he shall have the right to be present, or where the
Court gives him leave to be present.

The appeal involved questions of
fact. The prisoner was unable to be present owing to illness but had stated he
desired to be present. The report at pages 200 and 201 reads as follows:

[Page 663]

F. T. Bingham, for the
prisoner. Sect. 11, sub-s. 1, of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907(1) appears to
place a difficulty in the way of the appeal being heard in the absence of the
prisoner who desires to be present, unless the Court think that the discretion
of the prisoner as to whether he should be present passes to counsel. The
presence of the prisoner would not aid the conduct of the appeal. The question
is whether counsel can, on behalf of the prisoner, waive the right to be
present.

The judgment of the Court
(Lord Alverstone C.J. and Phillimore and Walton JJ.) was delivered by

Lord Alverstone, C.J.—The
case must stand over. Sect. 11, sub-s. 1, of the Criminal Appeal Act is
imperative; the prisoner has a right to be present unless the ground of appeal
is on law alone, and in the present case the appeal involves questions of fact.

I agree with this decision and
the case for the present appellant is even stronger as he was without counsel.

Under s. 600(1) of the Criminal
Code  this Court may on this appeal make any order that the Court of Appeal
might have made. I have already expressed the view that the order it should
have made was that the case should stand over to permit the appellant to be
present.

I would allow the appeal, set
aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal of June 23, 1964, and direct that the
record be returned to that Court to set a date for the hearing and to hear and
determine the application of the appellant in accordance with the provisions of
the Criminal Code .

Appeal allowed.

appellant: R. J. Carter, Toronto.

WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS

Criminal law—Habeas corpus—Whether
warrant of committal discloses offence—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 15,
s. 288(d).

The petitioner was convicted of armed robbery. The Court of
Appeal increased his sentence from two to six years. His application for leave
to appeal to this Court was dismissed. He then applied to this Court for a writ
of habeas corpus on the ground that the warrant of committal disclosed no
offence known to the law.

Held: The application should be dismissed.

The warrant of committal reading ""…unlawfully did steal
from employees of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, while armed with an
offensive weapon, thereby committing robbery, contrary to the Criminal
Code "", sufficiently identified the proper grounds for committal, being
in the precised wording of s. 288  (d) of the Criminal Code .

Droit criminel—Habeas corpus—Le
mandat de dépôt dévoile-t-il une offense—Code criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51
art. 288(d).

Le requérant a été trouvé coupable de vol à main armée. La
Cour d'Appel a augmenté sa sentence de deux à six ans. Sa requête pour
permission d'appeler devant cette Cour a été rejetée. Il présenta alors une
requête devant cette Cour pour obtenir un bref d'habeas corpus pour le motif
que le mandat de dépôt ne dévoilait aucune offense connue de la loi.

Arrêt: La requête doit être rejetée.

Le mandat de dépôt se
lisant « …a illégalement volé des employés de la Banque canadienne
impériale de commerce, alors qu'il était muni d'une arme offensive, commettant
alors un vol, contrairement au Code criminel  », identifie
suffisamment les motifs de détention, étant la phraséologie précise de l'art. 288 (d)
du Code criminel .

REQUÊTE pour obtenir
un bref d'habeas corpus. Requête
rejetée.

APPLICATION for a writ of
habeas corpus. Application dismissed.

Claude R. Thomson, for the
petitioner.

James W. Austin, for the
respondent.

[Page 658]

The judgment of Cartwright,
Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ. was delivered by

JUDSON J.: On June 6, 1963, the
applicant Patricks was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to a term of
two years and six months. On an appeal by the Attorney General against this
sentence, the Court of Appeal increased it to six years. He is now in prison on
a Warrant of Committal reading that he:

At the City of St. Thomas,
in the County of Elgin, on
the 27th day of November, in the year 1962 unlawfully did steal from employees
of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, while armed with an offensive
weapon, thereby committing robbery, contrary to the Criminal Code .

The applicant was represented by
counsel at trial. The Court of Appeal dismissed his application for leave to
appeal and a further application for leave to appeal to this Court was
dismissed. He now applies for a Writ of Habeas Corpus on the ground that the Warrant
of Committal discloses no offence known to the law. In my opinion it
sufficiently identifies the proper grounds for committal, being in the precise
wording of s. 288 (d) of the Criminal Code  which provides that

288. Every one commits
robbery who

(d) steals from any person
while armed with an offensive weapon or imitation thereof.

I would dismiss the application.

HALL J.:—I agree with my brother
Judson that the Warrant of Committal upon which the applicant is being held in
custody is sufficient to answer the contention that he is now being held
unlawfully and I would dismiss the application.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW
BRUNSWICK, 

APPEAL DIVISION

1965, June, 2, 3, June 24

PRESENT: Taschereau C.J. and Cartwright,
Abbott, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.

Criminal law—Capital murder—Misdirection by
trial judge—Theory of the defence not put to the jury—Canada Evidence Act,
R.S.C. 1952, c. 307, s. 12(1)—Criminal
Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 61, s. 592(1)(b)(iii).

Following the slaying of a guard at
a prison where he was an inmate, the appellant was convicted of capital murder.
On the morning immediately following the slaying, he called for the mounted
police and made a series of statements in which he made a complete and detailed
con­fession of the crime. At the trial, the appellant gave evidence on his own
behalf and claimed that the statements made immediately after the crime were
false, that they had been made to protect a friend and that he had not killed
the guard. His conviction was affirmed by a majority judgment in the Court of
Appeal. All the members of the Court were of the opinion that the judge's
charge to the jury was inadequate, but the majority was of the opinion that there
had been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice and applied s. 592(1) 
(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code . The appellant appealed to this Court.

Held (Taschereau C.J. and Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting) : The appeal
should be allowed and a new trial directed.

Per Cartwright
and Hall JJ.: The trial judge failed to present the theory of the defence to
the jury, and the verdict could not be upheld by the application of s. 592 (1) (b)
(iii) of the Code. The onus was upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that
the verdict would necessarily have been the same if the errors had not
occurred. The construction of s. 592 (1)(b)(iii) of the Code contended
for by the Crown in this case would transfer from the jury to the Court of
Appeal the question whether the evidence established the guilt of the accused
beyond a reasonable doubt. It was impossible to affirm from a reading of the
written record that the testimony of the accused might not have left a properly
instructed jury in a state of doubt.

In this view of the case it was not
necessary to consider the ground of appeal which was based on the allegedly
improper cross-examination of the accused.

As to the first two grounds of
appeal, they were properly rejected by the Court of Appeal.

[Page 740]

Per Ritchie
J.: The trial judge erred in failing to fairly put to the jury the defence made
by the accused. It was impossible to say that the verdict would necessarily
have been the same if the charge had been correct and, applying the test
established in the authorities, this was not a case in which the provisions of
s. 592(1)(b) (iii) of
the Code should be invoked. The errors in this case were not of a minor
character.

Per Spence
J.: The first ground of appeal that the trial judge erred in allowing the trial
while the accused was dressed as a prison inmate, and the second ground that
the trial judge should not have admitted in evidence a tape recording, were
both properly rejected by the Court of Appeal.

As to the ground that the trial
judge had erred in allowing the admission, on cross-examination of the accused,
of evidence of his previous conduct and criminal offences, there had been no
prejudice to the accused. Even if the questions put upon cross-examination were
inadmissible and prejudicial, the answers resulted in the only evidence being
that the accused had never been convicted or charged with a crime in which he
carried or wielded a knife.

The ground of appeal that the trial
judge failed to fairly put to the jury the defence made by the accused should
be upheld. It is the duty of the trial judge to outline to the jury the theory
of the defence and to give to the jury matters of evidence essential in
arriving at a just conclusion in reference to that defence. The charge in the
present case, in its failure to state the theory of the defence, and
particularly in the partial statement of it accompanied by the inferential
disbelief of it and not accompanied by any reference to evidence which bore
upon it, was a failure to properly instruct the jury and was prejudicial to the
accused.

Under s. 592(1)(b) (iii) of the Criminal Code , the onus was on the Crown
to satisfy the Court that the jury, charged as it should have been, could not,
as reasonable men, have done otherwise than to find the appellant guilty. This
Court could not place itself in the position of a. jury and weigh the various
pieces of evidence which it was the duty of the trial judge to submit to the
jury and which he failed to do. There was a possibility that the jury, properly
charged, would have had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused.
Therefore, this Court could not apply the provisions of s. 592 (1) (b) (iii) to affirm the
conviction.

Per Taschereau
C.J. and Abbott and Judson JJ., dissenting: The charge to the jury was adequate in the circumstances of this
case. The defence which was merely that the accused had lied in his confessions
and had told the truth at the trial, was put to the jury and they were fully
instructed on the subject of reasonable doubt. Such error as there may have
been in the conduct of the trial was of a minor character, and the Court of
Appeal was justified in applying s. 592 (1) (b) (iii) of the Code.

Droit criminel—Meurtre qualifié—Mauvaise
direction par le juge au procès—Théorie de la défense non présentée au jury—Loi
sur la Preuve au Canada, S.R.C. 1952, c. 307, s. 12(1)—Code Criminel , 1953-54
(Can.), c. 61, art. 592(1)(b)(iii).

A la suite du meurtre d'un gardien
de la prison où l'appelant était détenu, ce dernier fut trouvé coupable de
meurtre qualifié. Le matin immédiatement après le meurtre, il a demandé à voir
la police et a fait plusieurs déclarations avouant le crime d'une façon
complète et détaillée. Lors du procès, l'appelant a témoigné en sa propre
faveur, et a allégué que les déclarations qu'il avait faites immédiatement
après le crime étaient fausses, qu'il les avait faites pour protéger un ami et
qu'il n'avait pas tué le gardien. Le verdict de culpabilité fut confirmé par un
jugement majoritaire de la Cour d'Appel. Tous les membres de la Cour furent
d'opinion que l'adresse du juge au jury avait été inadéquate, mais la majorité
fut d'opinion qu'il n'y avait eu aucun tort important ou erreur judiciaire
grave et, appliquèrent l'art. 592(1) (b)(iii) du Code criminel . L'appelant
en appela devant cette Cour.

Arrêt: L'appel doit être maintenu et un nouveau procès doit être ordonné,
le Juge en Chef Taschereau et les Juges Abbott et Judson étant dissidents.

Les Juges
Cartwright et Hall: Le juge au procès n'a pas présenté au jury la théorie de la
défense, et le verdict ne pouvait pas être maintenu en appliquant l'art.
592(1) (b)(iii) du Code criminel . La Couronne avait le fardeau de
satisfaire la Cour que le verdict aurait été néces­sairement le même si des
erreurs n'avaient pas été commises. L'inter­prétation que la Couronne veut
donner à l'art. 592 (1)(b)(iii) du Code aurait pour effet de
transférer du jury à la Cour d'Appel la question de savoir si la preuve établit
la culpabilité de l'accusé hors de tout doute raisonnable. Il était impossible
d'affirmer à la lecture du dossier que le témoignage de l'accusé n'aurait pas
laissé un jury, régulièrement instruit, dans un état de doute, et en
conséquence le verdict devait être mis de côté.

Dans ces vues, il n'était pas
nécessaire de considérer le grief d'appel qui était basé sur le
contre-interrogatoire illégal de l'accusé.

Quant aux deux premiers griefs
d'appel, ils avaient été correctement rejetés par la Cour d'Appel.

Le Juge
Ritchie: Le juge au procès a erré en n'exposant pas équitablement au jury la
défense soumise par l'accusé. II était impossible de dire que le verdict aurait
été nécessairement le même si l'adresse du juge avait été équitable et,
appliquant le critère établi par les autorités, cette cause n'était pas de
celles où les dispositions de l'art. 592 (1)(b)(iii) du Code devaient être
invoquées. Les erreurs dans cette cause n'avaient pas un caractère mineur.

Le Juge
Spence: La Cour d'Appel a eu raison de rejeter le premier grief d'appel à
l'effet que le juge au procès avait erré en permettant le procès alors que l'accusé
était habillé comme un détenu de prison

[Page 742]

et le second grief que le juge au
procès n'aurait pas dû permettre la preuve d'un enregistrement sur
magnétophone.

Quant au grief que le juge au
procès a erré en permettant l'introduction, sur contre-interrogatoire de
l'accusé, d'une preuve de sa conduite et de ses offenses criminelles
antérieures, il n'y a eu aucun préjudice pour l'accusé. Même si les questions
posées en contre-interrogatoire n'étaient pas admissibles et étaient
préjudiciables, la seule preuve qui a résulté de ces réponses fut que l'accusé
n'avait jamais été trouvé coupable ou accusé d'un crime pour lequel il aurait
porté ou manié un couteau.

Le grief d'appel que le juge au
procès n'a pas mis adéquatement devant le jury la défense faite par l'accusé
doit être maintenu. Il est du devoir du juge au procès d'exposer au jury la
théorie de la défense et de donner au jury tous les extraits de la preuve qui
sont essentiels pour arriver à un conclusion juste concernant cette défense.
L'adresse du juge dans la présente cause, dans son défaut d'énumérer la théorie
de la défense et particulièrement dans son exposé partiel accompagné d'une
inférence d'incrédibilité et non accompagné des références à la preuve portant
sur cette défense, a été un manque d'instruire régu­lièrement le jury et a été
préjudiciable à l'accusé.

En vertu de l'art. 592(1) (b)(iii)
du Code criminel , la Couronne avait le fardeau de satisfaire la Cour que
le jury, instruit comme il devait l'être, n'aurait pu, comme hommes raisonnables,
faire autre chose que de trouver l'accusé coupable. Cette Cour ne peut pas se
placer dans le position du jury et évaluer les différents renvois à la preuve
qu'il était du devoir du juge au procès de soumettre au jury et qu'il n'a pas
fait. Il y avait une possibilité que le jury régulièrement instruit aurait eu
un doute raisonnable sur la culpabilité de l'accusé. En con­séquence, cette
Cour ne pouvait pas se servir des dispositions de l'art. 592 (1) (b)(iii) pour
confirmer le verdict.

Le Juge
en Chef Taschereau et les Juges Abbott et Judson, dissidents: L'adresse
au jury était adéquate dans les circonstances. La défense qui était simplement
que l'accusé avait menti lorsqu'il avait fait ses aveux et qu'il avait dit la
vérité au procès, a été mise devant le jury qui a été instruit complètement sur
le doute raisonnable. S'il y avait eu des erreurs dans la conduite du procès
ces erreurs avaient un caractère mineur, et la Cour d'Appel était justifiée
d'avoir appliqué l'art. 592(1) (b) (iii) du Code.

APPEL d'un jugement majoritaire de la Cour
suprême du Nouveau-Brunswick, confirmant un verdict de culpabilité pour meurtre
qualifié. Appel maintenu, le Juge en Chef Taschereau et les Juges Abbott et Judson
étant dissidents.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of New Brunswick, affirming a conviction of capital murder. Appeal

[Page 743]

allowed, Taschereau C.J. and Abbott and
Judson JJ. dis­senting.

P. S. Creaghan, for
the appellant.

L. D. D'Arcy, for
the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau
C.J. and Abbott and Judson JJ. was delivered by

ABBOTT J. (dissenting) :—With deference to
those who hold the opposite view, in my opinion the charge to the jury was
adequate in the circumstances of this case.

The theory of the
defence was a simple one. It was merely that the accused had lied in the three
confessions made by him and had told the truth in his evidence at the trial.
That defence was put to the jury and they were fully instructed on the subject
of reasonable doubt.

Such error as there may
have been in the conduct of the trial was of a minor character and for the
reasons given by Bridges C.J., the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New
Brunswick, in my opinion, was justified in applying the provisions of s. 592(1) 
(b) (iii) of the Criminal Code .

I would dismiss the
appeal.

The judgment of
Cartwright and Hall JJ. was delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J.:—The relevant facts and the course of
the proceedings in the courts below are set out in the rea­sons of my brother
Spence. I agree with his conclusion that the learned trial judge failed to
present the theory of the defence to the jury and with his reasons for reaching
that conclusion; but since we are differing from the opinion of the majority in
the Court of Appeal I propose to set out shortly in my own words my reasons for
holding that in this case the verdict of guilty cannot be upheld by the
application of s. 592(1)  (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code .

Section 592(1)  (a) (ii) of the
Criminal Code  reads:

592 (1) On the hearing of an appeal against
a conviction, the court of appeal

[Page 744]

(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the
opinion that ... .

(ii) the judgment of the trial court should
be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or ... .

Section 592(1)  (b)
(iii) reads:

(b) may dismiss the appeal where ... .

(iii) notwithstanding that, the court is of
the opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a)
the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion
that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred;

A number of authorities
which should guide the Court of Appeal in deciding whether, misdirection having
been shewn, it can safely be affirmed that no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice has occurred are quoted in the rea­sons of my brother Spence. Upon
reading these it will be observed that, once error in law has been found to
have occurred at the trial, the onus resting upon the Crown is to satisfy the
Court that the verdict would necessarily have been the same if such error had
not occurred. The satisfac­tion of this onus is a condition precedent to the
right of the Appellate Court to apply the terms of the subsection at all. The
Court is not bound to apply the subsection merely because this onus is
discharged.

Under our system of law
a man on trial for his life is entitled to the verdict of a jury which has been
accurately and adequately instructed as to the law. The construction of s.
592(1)  (b) (iii) contended for by the Crown in this case would transfer from the
jury to the Court of Appeal the question whether the evidence established the
guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. To adapt the words of Lord Herschell
in Makin v. Attorney General for New South Wales[1], the judges would in truth be substituted
for the jury, the verdict would become theirs and theirs alone, and would be
arrived at upon a perusal of the evidence without any opportunity of seeing the
demeanour of the wit­nesses and weighing the evidence with the assistance which
this affords.

[Page 745]

In the case at bar
every judge in the Court of Appeal was of the same opinion as my brother Spence
that the charge of the learned trial judge to the jury was inadequate. The
evidence of the accused given at the trial, if it were believed by the jury,
established his innocence; if it left the jury in a state of doubt it
necessitated his acquittal. I find it impossi­ble to affirm from a reading of
the written record that the testimony of the accused might not have left a
properly instructed jury in a state of doubt, and consequently, in my view, the
verdict must be set aside.

The conclusion at which
I have arrived on this ground of appeal renders it unnecessary for me to
consider the fourth ground of appeal, which was based on the allegedly improp­er
cross-examination of the accused, and I express no opin­ion upon it.

I agree with my brother
Spence that grounds (1) and (2), set out at the commencement of his reasons,
were properly rejected.

I would dispose of the
appeal as proposed by my brother Spence.

RITCHIE J.:—I have had
the benefit of reading the rea­sons for judgment of my brothers Cartwright and
Spence and I agree with them that this appeal should be allowed on the ground
that ""the learned trial judge erred in failing to fairly put to the jury
the defence made by the accused"".

Even if it be conceded
to be improbable that the decision of any juror was affected by the errors
which all the judges of the court of appeal have found to have existed in the
charge of the learned trial judge, I am nevertheless unable to say that the
verdict would necessarily have been the same if the charge had been
correct and, applying the test established in the authorities referred to by my
brother Spence, I do not consider this to be a case in which the provisions of
s. 592(1)  (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code  should be invoked. I do not
share the view that the errors referred to were of a minor character.

[Page 746]

I would accordingly
dispose of this appeal as proposed by my brother Spence.

SPENCE J.:—This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appeal Division
of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick which, by a majority of two to one,
dismissed the appeal of the appellant from his conviction upon a charge of
capital murder. The appellant in this Court submitted in his notice of appeal
five grounds as follows:

(1) The learned Trial Judge erred in allowing
the Trial to commence and proceed while the accused was present before the Jury
attired and identifiable as a convicted criminal or a person of bad repute.

(2) The learned Trial Judge erred in allowing
to be admitted in evidence a tape recording allegedly reproducing a confession
made by the accused and solicited by the police.

(3) The learned Trial Judge erred in failing
to fairly put to the Jury the defence made by the accused.

(4) The learned Trial Judge erred in allowing
the admission, on cross-examination of the accused, of evidence of his previous
conduct and criminal offences,

(5) The Supreme Court of New Brunswick,
Appeal Division, erred in dismissing the appeal by the appellant herein to that
Honourable Court.

The first four of those
grounds were presented to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New
Brunswick. As' to grounds 1 and 2, the judgment of Limerick J.A., although
dissenting on other grounds, was adopted by the majority of the Court, and I am of the
opinion that I need not add anything to the very convincing reasons delivered
by ' the learned justice in appeal in reference to those grounds.

I turn next to consider
ground 4, i.e.:

The learned Trial Judge erred in allowing
the admission, on cross-examina­tion of the accused, of evidence of his
previous conduct and criminal offences.

The appellant's
objection is to his cross-examination. Since it is very short, it is my
intention to quote it completely:

Q. Now how long have you been in the — how
many times have you been in the — an inmate at the penitentiary? A. This is the
second time.

[Page 747]

Q. The second time? A. Yes.

Q. And what are you in for this time? A.
Armed robbery. Q. Armed robbery? A. Right.

Q. And how were you armed on that occasion?
A. With a gun.

Q. And what was the first time you served
penitentiary — what was that for? A. For escaping gaol, car theft, and breaking
and enter.

Q. And had you served any sentence besides
penitentiary? A. Yes. Q. And where did you serve these? A. County Gaol.

Q. When did you first serve time in the
County Gaol? A. 1962. 

Q, Did you use a knife in any offence before?
A. No.

Q. Were you not involved in the Friar's
hold-up? A. Mmmm. Q. Was not a knife used there? A. Prove I used it.

Q. Pardon? A. Prove I used it. I didn't use
it.

Q. Did you have a knife? A. No.

Q. What weapon did you have? A. I had
nothing.

Q, Did you plead guilty to a charge of armed
robbery? A. Mmmm, but I didn't plead guilty to having a knife.

Q. What were you armed with? A. I was armed
with nothing. My accomplice was armed.

The Canada Evidence
Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 307, provides in s. 12(1):

A witness may be questioned as to whether
he has been convicted of any offence, and upon being so questioned, if he
either denies the fact or refuses to answer, the opposite party may prove such
conviction.

Here counsel for the
Crown went much farther.

Cartwright J. in Lizotte
v. The King[2],
quoted with approval the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Noor Mohamed
v. The King[3],
as follows:

In Makin v. Attorney General for New
South Wales (1894) A.C. 57, 65, Lord Herschell L.C. delivering the judgment
of the Board, laid down two principles which must be observed in a case of this
character. Of these the first was that ""it is undoubtedly not competent
for the prosecution to adduce evidence tending to show that the accused has
been guilty of criminal acts other than those covered by the indictment, for
the purpose of leading to the conclusion that the accused is a person likely
from his

[Page 748]

criminal conduct or character to have committed
the offence for which he is being tried"". In 1934 this principle was said
by Lord Sankey L.C., with the concurrence of all the noble and learned Lords
who sat with him, to be ""one of the most deeply rooted and jealously
guarded principles of our criminal law"" and to be ""fundamental in the
law of evidence as conceived in this country"". (Maxwell v. The Director
of Public Prosecutions [1935] A.C. 309, 317, 320.)

That statement, however,
was made in reference to cross-examination by the Crown counsel of a defence
witness who was not the accused person.

In Rex v. MacDonald[4],
the Ontario Court of
Appeal was considering an appeal from the conviction of the appellant for
murder. Objection was made to the Crown's examina­tion-in-chief of a Crown
witness who was a person closely associated with the accused and who had, after
the accused was alleged to have committed the crime, given the accused shelter
in his residence. It was objected that such examina­tion was irrelevant and
that it was harmful to the appellant in that it tended to show that the
appellant was associated with confirmed criminals. Robertson C.J.O. said at pp.
196-7:

With respect to all the evidence of the
kind objected to, the rules are well established. On the trial of a criminal
charge the character and record in general of the accused are not matters in
issue, and are not proper subjects of evidence against him. If evidence of good
character is given on behalf of the accused, then certain evidence of bad
character may be given, but that is not of importance in this case for the
appellant offered no evidence of good character.

Further, if the accused becomes a witness,
as he has the right to do, he may be cross-examined as to any previous
conviction, and if he does not admit it, it may be proved against him. As a
witness, the accused is also subject to cross-examination as to matters
affecting his credibility in the same way as another witness. Except for this,
the character and record of the accused are not proper subjects of attack by
the Crown, and it is clearly improper for the Crown to adduce evidence, by
cross-examination or otherwise, with a view to putting it before the jury that
the accused has been ""associated with others in a long and serious
criminal career"". The accused person is to be convicted, if at all, upon
evidence relevant to the crime with which he is charged, and not upon his
character or past record.

It must be noted that
this statement was made not upon an occasion when the cross-examination of the
accused

[Page 749]

person was being
considered but rather when the examina­tion-in-chief of a Crown witness was
being considered and, with respect, I view the learned Chief Justice's
inclusion of the former situation by his words ""by cross-examination or
otherwise"" as being obiter. I am further of the opinion that a
cross-examination of an accused person which indicated that he had been
""associated with others in a long and serious criminal career"" would
be perfectly admissible cross-examination upon the issue of the credibility of
that accused person. However, I am of the opinion that permission to
cross-examine the accused person as to his character on the issue of the
accused person's credibility is within the discre­tion of the trial judge and
the trial judge should exercise that discretion with caution and should exclude
evidence, even if it were relevant upon the credibility of the accused, if its
prejudicial effect far outweighs its probative value.

I am further of the
opinion that in the particular case the issue does not arise for the reason
that even if the questions put upon cross-examination by the Crown counsel were
inadmissible and prejudicial the answers resulted in the only evidence being
that the accused man had never been con­victed or charged with a crime in which
he carried or wielded a knife and, further, the accused man invited the Crown
to prove otherwise, an invitation which the Crown did not deem it advisable to
accept. There was, therefore, in the particular case, no prejudice to the
accused.

The third ground of
appeal :

The learned Trial Judge erred in failing to
fairly put to the jury the defence made by the accused.

is a much more
substantial one. The appellant, on the morning immediately following the
slaying of the prison guard for which he was charged with capital murder, had
called for the attendance of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and had made a
series of statements, some in his own handwriting, some in answer to questions,
and one, the tape recording, which was the subject of ground of appeal no. 2.
In these statements, the appellant had made a complete and detailed confession
of the crime in such a fashion that if these statements were not explained,
they would constitute

[Page 750]

a sound basis for his
conviction upon the offence as charged. The appellant gave evidence at trial on
his own behalf, under circumstances to which I shall refer hereafter. In that
evidence, he admitted the voluntary nature of all the statements aforesaid. But
he denied their truth. In reply to questions by his own counsel, he said that
he had not killed the guard and that he had given the statements ""to
protect a friend"", and continued, ""and that certain friend gave
evidence against me and I don't see no reason for protecting him now. I seen
that certain person do that. I was standing no more than four feet away from
him at the time"". In cross-examination, the accused repeated that
explanation and gave great detail saying, inter alia, ""I was going to protect
him even to the point of hanging for him until he tried to hang me"".

Although the appellant
refused to name that other person, it would appear from his evidence, taken
with the other evidence at trial, that it could only have been his fellow
inmate Westerberg, who had testified as a Crown witness.

Upon the
cross-examination of the appellant having been completed, the trial was
adjourned from 5.49 p.m. until 10.00 a.m., the next morning. At that time
counsel for the appellant addressed the jury and in a very brief address
mentioned that the appellant denied killing the prison guard but would not
incriminate others. He failed to make any reference to the appellant's
explanation of his confes­sions to the police. The Crown counsel followed with
an address in which he analyzed the evidence in very considera­ble detail but
again I find no reference to the reasons assigned by the appellant in his
evidence for what he alleged in that evidence were the false confessions he had
given to the police officers.

The learned trial judge
in his charge to the jury dealt with the theory of the defence in the following
fashion:

I take it, as one of the theories of the
defence anyway, that the accused does not wish you to believe these statements
as being true. That is what he said on the stand—he denies them; he said he was
not telling the truth when he gave those statements.

[Page 751]

And :

In other words all the statements he made,
including the tape recording—and this is in the evidence as well—the oral
statements that he made to the R.C.M.P., according to the evidence that Colpitts
gave yesterday if you believe it,—all this is a pack of lies, according to Colpitts.

Now gentlemen, it
is up to you, because you are the sole masters of the facts. You use your good
judgment that the Lord gave you, your knowledge of human nature, to say which
of the two alternatives is the more logical one, in order to ascertain if Colpitts
was lying yesterday on the stand or if he was lying when he made those
statements in a con­tinuous operation the very morning after the stabbing of
the guard.

And further:

And the Crown prosecutor has asked you—is
it logical to believe that, after having called for the Mounted Police, as you
know he did—if you believe the evidence—that he would lie, and lie, and lie
throughout these written statements, throughout the tape recording, throughout
the oral statements, throughout the visit he made to the prison yard when he
showed the constables those details of the occurrence. Well, it is for you to
say, gentlemen, if it is logical or not. Isn't it more logical that he would
have told the truth on that occasion and that after two months of deliberation
he would have concocted the story that he insisted on telling you yesterday? I
am not going to give you my opinion on it. You are the men to decide which is
the more logical of those two alternatives. You are the twelve men who will
decide this.

To summarize the above,
the learned trial judge put it as the theory of the appellant that he had made
a false confession, and never mentioned the reason which the appellant gave in
his evidence for having done so, a reason to which the appellant held fast
through a vigorous cross-examination. It must be remembered that counsel for
the appellant, before calling the appellant as the only witness for the
defence, stated to the learned trial judge, in the presence of the jury:

MR. O'NEILL: My Lord, yes, I am
going to call one witness for the defence; and that will be Reginald Colpitts,
the accused. And, Sir, I must—as a matter of professional ethics—do assert that
this is going to happen against my better judgment and counsel. But Mr. Colpitts
has decided to take the stand, and I—of couse [sic] —will act as examiner.

THE COURT: All
right. I understand your position.

As I have pointed out
above, the learned trial judge in his charge gave to the jury two conclusions
suggesting that they

[Page 752]

choose the more
logical, and one of them was framed in the words ""and that after two
months of deliberation he would have concocted the story that he insisted
on telling you yesterday"". I am of the opinion that that portion of
the charge, when considered in the light of the remarks of the then counsel for
the appellant which I have quoted, could only suggest, and strongly suggest, to
the jury that they could place no reliance upon the evidence given by the
appellant in his defence. Moreover, the learned trial judge failed to discuss
any of the evidence adduced by the Crown which might be related to that
defence. As Limerick J.A. in his reasons has referred to the many instances of
evidence which are related to the theory of the defence, I need not repeat
them. None of these instances were discussed in that light in the charge of the
learned trial judge.

It is trite law that it
is the duty of the trial judge to outline to the jury the theory of the defence
and that even in cases where the accused person does not give evidence on his
own behalf : Kelsey v. The Queen[5],
where it was held that the trial judge had done so; Derek Clayton-Wright[6], per Goddard L.C.J. at
29.

Recent decisions in
this Court and elsewhere have also emphasized the duty of the trial judge in
his charge to go further and to not only outline the theory of the defence but
to give to the jury matters of evidence essential in arriving at a just
conclusion in reference to that defence.

In Lizotte v. The
King[7], Cartwright J., giving
judgment for the Court, said at p. 131:

I do respectfully venture to suggest that
in this case it would have been well to follow the usual practice of indicating
to the jury the nature of the evidence put forward in support of the alibi and
telling them that, even if they are not satisfied that the alibi has been
proved, if the evidence in support of it raises in their minds a reasonable
doubt of the appellant's guilt, it is their duty to acquit him.

In Azoulay v. The
Queen[8],
the present Chief Justice of this Court said:

[Page 753]

On the second point, I agree with the Chief
Justice of the Court of King's Bench. The rule which has been laid down, and
consistently followed is that in a jury trial the presiding judge must, except
in rare cases where it would be needless to do so, review the substantial parts
of the evidence, and give the jury the theory of the defence, so that they may
appreciate the value and effect of that evidence, and how the law is to be
applied to the facts as they find them.

In Lizotte v. The
Queen[9],
the present Chief Justice of this Court said:

Au cours de sa charge aux jurés, le juge
présidant au procès, après avoir récité certains faits saillants de cette
triste aventure, semble avoir omis quelques éléments de preuve, essentiels pour
arriver à une juste conclusion. Sans doute, il n'est pas impératif que le juge
décrive en détail toutes et chacune des circonstances qui ont entouré un crime,
mais encore faut-il qu'il place devant le jury tout ce qui est révélé par les
témoignages, soit de la Couronne ou de la défense, qui peut être un moyen
sérieux de disculper l'accusé. (Le Roi v. Azoulay, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495);
(Le Roi v, Kelsey, [19531 1 S.C.R. 220); (Vide Lord Goddard in Dereck
Clayton-Wright (1948), 33 C.A.R. 22 at 29.)

In Regina v. Hladiy[10], Pickup C.J.O. said:

The learned trial judge then went on to
discuss the evidence as to motive and also discussed the statements made by the
accused, but no—where in his charge, in discussing that evidence, did he put it
plainly to the jury that, in considering the statements made by the accused, or
such of them as the jury believed, they should consider whether they had any
reasonable doubt as to whether or not what actually took place that night
before the body was thrown into the water was murder.

In Markadonis v. The
King[11],
Davis J. said at p. 665:

Moreover, I cannot escape from the view
that the charge of the learned trial judge did not present certain aspects of
the case in favour of the accused that should have been dealt with and
considered.

In the light of these
authorities, I agree with the conten­tion of counsel for the appellant that the
charge by the learned trial judge, in its failure to state the theory of the
defence, and particularly in the partial statement of it accompanied by the
inferential disbelief of it and not accompanied by any reference to evidence
which bore upon it, was a failure to properly instruct the jury and was prejudicial
to the accused. All the members of the Supreme

[Page 754]

Court of New Brunswick,
Appeal Side, were of the same view. Bridges C.J., said:

The instructions which the learned judge
gave to the jury to use their good judgment in deciding which of two alternatives
was the more logical, namely, whether the defendant told the truth in his
statements and on the tape recording or in his evidence at the trial, did not
put the defence properly before the jury as such direction did not make it
clear to them that if they were in doubt or believed the testimony of the
defendant might reasonably be true they should acquit him.

Ritchie J.A. said:

I also am of the opinion the theory of the
defence as expressed in the appellant's evidence at trial was not adequately
put to the jury …

And Limerick J.A. said
:

This would seem to be a very inadequate
presentation of the defence as well as a very negative approach thereto. Use of
the words ""does not wish you to believe"" thereby, by inference,
implying he, the learned Judge, thought the statements were true constitutes an
opinion of guilt not a presentation of the defence.

The first two named
justices, however, were of the opin­ion that the provisions of s. 592(1)  (b)
(iii) of the Criminal Code  should be applied and that there had been ""no
sub­stantial wrong or miscarriage of justice"" and therefore that the
appeal should be dismissed.

It is the contention of
the appellant in his fifth ground of appeal that that decision was not a
correct one. The applica­tion of the subsection, as pointed out by the learned
justice in appeal, has been considered frequently in this Court and I think it
may be said that the decisions in Allen v. The King[12], Gouin v. The King[13], Brooks v. The King[14], Lizotte v. The King[15], and Schmidt v. The
King[16],
are authoritative.

The proposition in Allen
v. The King as stated by Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, C.J., at p. 339, in
reference to the section of the Code then if effect, was:

I cannot agree that the effect of the section is
to do more than, as I said before, give the judges on an appeal a discretion
which they may be trusted to exercise only where the illegal evidence or other
irregularities 

[Page 755]

are so trivial that it may safely be
assumed that the jury was not influenced by it.

That proposition has
been considered in subsequent au­thorities.

In Brooks v. The
King, supra, in the judgment of the Court at p. 636, it is said:

Misdirection in a material matter having
been shewn, the onus was upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that the jury,
charged as it should have been, could not, as reasonable men, have done
otherwise than find the appellant guilty.

In Schmidt v. The
King, supra, Kerwin J., at p. 440, put it this way :

The meaning of these words has been
considered in this Court in several cases, one of which is Gouin v. The King
[1926] S.C.R. 539, from all of which it is clear that the onus rests on the
Crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict would necessarily have been the
same if the charge had been correct or if no evidence has been improperly
admitted.

In Lizotte v. The
King, supra, Cartwright J. giving the judgment for the Court, held that it
was within the jurisdic­tion of this Court to allow an appeal and refuse to
apply the provisions of the present s. 592(1)  (b) (iii) despite the fact that
the Court of Appeal in the province had dismissed the appeal from the
conviction upon the application of the said subsection.

Therefore, this Court
must apply the test set out in the aforesaid cases and, to quote again from Brooks
v. The King:

The onus is upon the Crown to satisfy the
Court that the jury, charged as it should have been, could not, as reasonable
men, have done otherwise than find the appellant guilty.

In an attempt to
persuade this Court that upon such a test being applied the Court could not do
otherwise than to find that a jury properly charged would hold the appellant
guilty, counsel for the respondent cited many pieces of evidence which would
tend to show that the appellant had told the truth when he made the statements
to the police and had lied when he testified in court. As pointed out by the
various learned justices in appeal in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, this,
even if true, would not be sufficient

[Page 756]

because if the evidence
of the appellant at trial, although the jury is not convinced of its truth,
raises a reasonable doubt in their minds, that reasonable doubt must be
resolved in favour of the accused. Moreover, as pointed out by Limerick J.A. in
his dissenting judgment in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division,
there are a very considerable number of items of evidence which point toward
the possibility that the appellant might be telling the truth in his evidence
at trial. In my view, it was the duty of the judge to submit all that evidence,
not only that in favour of the accused but that against him, to the jury so
that they might weigh it and come to the conclusion whether, on all of the
evidence, they had any reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant.

I am of the opinion
that this Court cannot place itself in the position of a jury and weigh these
various pieces of evidence. If there is any possibility that twelve reasonable
men, properly charged, would have a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the
accused, then this Court should not apply the provisions of s. 592(1)  (b) (iii)
to affirm a conviction.

I am of the opinion
that there is such a possibility and I, therefore, would allow the appeal, set
aside the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division, and
direct a new trial of the appellant upon the charge of capital murder.

Appeal allowed, new trial directed, Taschereau
C.J. and Abbott and Judson JJ. dissenting.

Solicitor for the appellant: P. S. Creaghan,

EN APPEL DE LA COUR DU BANC DE LA REINE,
PROVINCE DE QUEBEC.

Droit criminel—Meurtre qualifié—Crime
commis à l'occasion d'un vol qualifié—Adresse du juge—Reproche de ne pas avoir soumis un moyen de défense basé sur l'ivresse—Reproche de ne pas avoir fait la distinction
entre le meurtre qualifié et le meurtre simple—Tort important ou erreur judiciaire grave—Nouveau procès ordonné par la Cour d'Appel—Code Criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 21(2), 202(a)(i), 202A(2)(b)(i), 592(1)(b)(iii), 598(1)(a).

[Page 359]

L'intimé et un nommé Dumas se sont introduits de
nuit dans la résidence d'un octogénaire pour le voler. A la faveur d'une
obscurité relative, Dumas se dirigea à la chambre où se trouvait une valise
dans laquelle ils avaient appris que la victime gardait de l'argent, pendant
que l'intimé entrait dans la chambre où couchait le vieillard. Dumas témoigna
qu'il entendit un bruit de lutte et qu'il fut appelé par l'intimé. Lorsque
Dumas se rendit à cet appel, la victime était debout et résistait alors que
l'intimé la retenait contre lui avec une main sur la bouche. Dumas bâillonna le
vieillard, lui attacha les mains derrière le dos et lui ligota les pieds. Après
quoi, l'intimé coucha la victime sur son lit, et les deux s'emparèrent de la
valise et se sauvèrent. Dumas déclara de plus qu'après avoir bâillonné la
victime, il sentit sur ses mains quelque chose de liquide et chaud qu'il réalisa
une fois dehors être du sang. Au moment de leur départ, le vieillard gémissait à
travers son bâillon. Deux jours plus tard, le vieillard fut trouvé gisant près
de son lit, horriblement blessé et sans vie, ayant des liens, particulièrement
aux pieds et à la main gauche. L'autopsie révéla que la victime avait été
sauvagement attaquée et que l'hémorragie et l'asphyxie avaient été la cause
conjuguée de la mort.

La preuve de ces faits ainsi que celle des événements
qui ont précédé et suivi l'attentat n'a pas été contredite par les témoins
produits par la défense. La défense a suggéré au jury la possibilité qu'après
le vol d'autres personnes se seraient introduites dans la maison pour commettre
l'assaut qui entraîna la mort de la victime. L'intimé ne s'est pas fait
entendre comme témoin.

L'intimé a été trouvé coupable de meurtre
qualifié. Par une décision majoritaire, la Cour d'Appel infirma le verdict et
ordonna un nouveau procès sur l'accusation telle que portée. La Cour d'Appel a
retenu deux griefs contre l'adresse du juge: (1) Une défense basée sur l'ivresse aurait dû être soumise aux jurés; (2) le juge aurait par une application non
qualifiée de l'art. 21(2) omis de
préciser les rôles respectifs de l'intimé et de Dumas pour décider s'il y avait
eu meurtre simple ou qualifié. D'où l'appel de la Couronne devant cette Cour en
vertu des dispositions de l'art. 598(1) (a) du Code Criminel .

Arrêt: L'appel doit être
maintenu et le verdict des jurés rétabli, les Juges Cartwright, Hall et Spence étant
dissidents.

Par la Cour: Aucune preuve de fait ne suggère
que la boisson consommée par l'intimé et Dumas les ait rendus incapables de
former et exécuter l'intention spécifique ou d'avoir la volonté de causer des lésions
corporelles aux fins de faciliter la perpétration du vol ou leur fuite après
l'avoir commis. En l'absence de cette preuve, le juge au procès n'avait pas à
inviter les jurés à considérer l'ivresse comme moyen de défense. D'ailleurs le
procureur de l'accusé n'a même pas soulevé ce moyen devant les jurés.

Le Juge en Chef Taschereau et les Juges Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland, Judson et Ritchie: Ne peut être retenue, l'objection que le juge au procès aurait laissé
les jurés sous l'impression que même si les blessures mortelles avaient été
causées par Dumas seul, sans aucune assistance de l'intimé, ils pouvaient
trouver ce dernier coupable de meurtre qualifié. Appliquant les directives que
l'on trouve dans Director of Public
Prosecutions v. Beard, [1920] A.C.
479, à l'effet que les paroles du
juge au procès doivent être considérées en regard des faits spéciaux qui sont
alors soumis au jury, et considérant la charge comme un tout, ce grief n'est
pas bien fondé. L'entraide de l'intimé et de

[Page 360]

Dumas pour assaillir, bâillonner et ligoter la
victime était un facteur inséparablement inhérent à la théorie de la Couronne
fondée sur la condition dans laquelle fut trouvée la victime et sur le témoignage
non contredit de Dumas. Plus d'une fois, le juge au procès a insisté sur
l'obligation de la Couronne de prouver que la mort du vieillard avait été causée
par des coups donnés par l'intimé et son compagnon. Aussi bien est-il
impossible de dire que les jurés ont pu avoir l'impression qu'ils pouvaient
trouver l'intimé coupable de meurtre qualifié sans être convaincus hors de tout
doute raisonnable qu'il avait, par son propre fait, causé ou aidé à causer les
blessures entraînant la mort du vieillard.

Dans les circonstances de cette cause, le juge
au procès a validement écarté, comme
possible en droit, un verdict de coupable de meurtre simple. Ayant accepté,
comme ils en avaient le droit, le témoignage de Dumas sur l'attentat, les jurés
étaient inévitablement conduits à accepter que ce qui s'était passé ne pouvait être
en fait que l'œuvre des deux agresseurs et que Côté avait, par son propre fait,
soit causé ou aidé à causer les blessures, ce qui faisait du meurtre commis un
meurtre qualifié.

Les Juges Cartwright, Hall et Spence,
dissidents: Le juge au procès a erré en laissant les jurés sous l'impression
que si les blessures avaient été infligées soit par l'intimé ou soit par Dumas,
il importait peu qui des deux les avait infligées, ils pouvaient trouver
l'accusé coupable de meurtre qualifié. Dans toutes les parties de la charge
invoquées par le procureur de la Couronne comme supprimant de l'esprit des jurés
l'effet de cette erreur, le juge
attirait l'attention des jurés sur la théorie de la défense à l'effet que le
meurtre avait été commis par une tierce personne, après que l'accusé et Dumas
aient laissé la victime, peut-être blessée, mais non mourante. Ces parties de
la charge n'étaient pas destinées à changer l'impression antérieure qui avait été
donnée aux jurés. A l'endroit où se trouvent ces passages, l'esprit des jurés était
dirigé sur la question de savoir si les blessures avaient été causées par
l'intimé et Dumas ou par une tierce personne. On ne trouve dans la charge
aucune directive clairement exprimée à l'effet que les jurés pouvaient trouver
l'intimé coupable de meurtre qualifié, en opposition à un meurtre simple,
seulement dans le cas où ils étaient satisfaits que l'intimé par son propre
fait avait Causé ou aidé à causer les blessures qui avaient entraîné la mort.

Les dispositions de l'art. 592(1) (b)(iii) du
Code Criminel  ne peuvent être invoquées avec succès dans une cause où les jurés
ont été erronément dirigés sur un élément essentiel de la charge qu'ils avaient
à juger.

Criminal law—Capital murder—Crime committed during commission
of burglary—Trial judge's charge—Whether jury should have been charged as to
suggested drunkenness of accused—Whether jury properly instructed as to the
distinction between capital and non-capital murder—Whether substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice—New trial ordered by Court of Appeal—Criminal Code ,
1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 21(2), 202(a)(i), 202A(2)(b)(i), 592(1)(b)(iii),
598(1)(a).

The accused and one Dumas broke into the dwelling-house of an
elderly man with the intent to steal. Dumas entered the room containing a
valise in which they had learned the victim kept his money. At the same time,
the accused went into the room where the victim was sleeping. Dumas testified
that he heard noises of a struggle and that

[Page 361]

the accused called for his help. When Dumas entered that room,
the victim was standing and struggling with the accused who was holding him and
had a hand on his mouth. Dumas gagged the victim and tied his hands and feet.
The accused then laid the victim on his bed and the two companions grabbed the
valise and fled. Dumas further declared that after gagging the victim, he felt
something liquid and hot on his hands which, when outside, he realized was
blood. When they left, the victim was moaning. Two days later the victim was
found dead near his bed with his feet and left hand tied. The autopsy revealed
that he had been savagely attacked and had died from hemorrhage and
asphyxiation.

That evidence and the evidence of other incidents which
preceded and followed the crime were not contradicted by any defence witnesses.
The defence suggested to the jury that the murder was committed by third
persons who later came on the scene. The accused was not heard as a witness.

The accused was found guilty of capital murder. By a majority
judgment, the Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on the charge as laid. The
Court of Appeal found (1) that the trial judge should have charged the jury as
to drunkenness; and (2) that in applying art. 21(2) of the Code the trial judge
failed to define the respective parts played by the accused and Dumas in Older
for the jury to decide whether there had been capital or non-capital
murder. The Crown appealed to this Court pursuant to s. 598(1)(a) of the
Code.

Held (Cartwright, Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting): The
appeal should be allowed and the verdict of the jury restored.

Per Curiam: There was no evidence to suggest that the
alcoholic liquor consumed by the accused and Dumas prevented them from forming
and executing the specific intention or from having the will to cause bodily
harm in order to facilitate the burglary or their subsequent escape. In the absence
of such evidence, the trial judge did not have to draw to the attention of the
jury the defence of drunkenness. Furthermore, defence counsel did not even
raise that defence at the trial.

Per Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and
Ritchie JJ.: The objection that the trial judge had left the jury under the
impression that even if the bodily harm which caused the death of the victim
was inflicted by Dumas alone, without any assistance from the accused, they
could find the latter guilty of capital murder, could not be sustained.
Applying the directives found in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard,
[1920] A.C. 479, that the language of the trial judge must always be considered
with regard to the special facts then before the jury, and considering the
charge as a whole, this objection was not founded. The mutual aid of the
accused and Dumas to assault, gag, and bind the victim was a factor
unseparately inherent in the Crown's theory based as it was on the state in
which the victim was found and on the uncontradicted testimony of Dumas. More
than once, the trial judge insisted on the obligation of the Crown to establish
that the death of the victim had been caused by the injuries inflicted by the
accused and Dumas. Hence it is impossible to say that the jury could have had
the impression that they could find the accused guilty of capital murder
without being convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he had, by his own act,
caused or assisted in causing the bodily harm from which death ensued.

[Page 362]

In the circumstances of this case, the trial judge rightly
omitted to mention, as possible in law, a verdict of guilty of non-capital
murder. Having accepted, as they had the right to do, the testimony of Dumas,
the jury were inevitably driven to accept that what had happened was the result
of the deeds of both aggressors and that Côté had, by his own act, either
caused or assisted in causing the injuries, which made the murder a capital
murder.

Per Cartwright, Hall and Spence JJ., dissenting: The
trial judge erred in leaving the jury with the impression that if the injuries
which proved fatal were inflicted by either the respondent or Dumas it was of
no importance by which of the two they were inflicted, and they could find the
accused guilty of capital murder. In all the passages of the charge referred to
by counsel for the Crown, as removing from the minds of the jury the effect of
this error, the attention of the jury was being directed to the theory of the
defence that the murder was committed by a third person after the accused and
Dumas had left the victim, perhaps injured, but not dying. These passages were
not intended to alter the previous impression given to the jury. At the stage
where these passages occurred, the minds of the jury were being directed to the
question whether the fatal injuries were caused by the accused and Dumas or by
a third person. Nowhere in the charge was there a clear direction to the jury
that they could find the respondent guilty of capital murder, as distinguished from non-capital murder, only if they were
satisfied that the accused by his own act had caused or assisted in causing the
injuries from which the death of the victim ensued.

The provisions of s. 592(1) (b)(iii) of The Criminal Code  could
not be successfully invoked in a case in which the jury have been misdirected
as to an essential element of the charge which they were trying.

APPEAL d'un jugement de la Cour du Banc de
la Reine, Province de Québec1,
ordonnant un nouveau procès sur une charge de meurtre qualifié. Appel maintenu,
les Juges Cartwright, Hall et Spence dissidents.

Laurent Trottier, C.R., et Yvan Mignault, pour l'appelante.

Gilles Bélanger, pour l'intimé.

Le jugement du Juge en chef Taschereau et des
Juges Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson et Ritchie fut rendu par

Le Juge
Fauteux:—L'intimé, Marcel Côté, a été
accusé et trouvé coupable d'avoir, dans la nuit du 25 au 26 octobre 1961, à St-Nicéphore, dans la province de Québec,
causé la mort de Philippe Raymond, à l'occasion et aux fins de la perpétration
d'un vol qualifié, commettant, dans les circonstances, l'offense de meurtre
qualifié décrite à l'art. 202A(2) (b)(i) du Code Criminel .

[Page 363]

Par une décision majoritaire, la Cour d'Appel2 infirma ce verdict et ordonna un
nouveau procès sur l'accusation telle que portée.

Cette divergence de vues en Cour d'Appel porte
sur les instructions données aux jurés par le Juge au procès. Deux des Juges
majoritaires, M. le Juge en chef et M. le Juge Hyde, lui font le reproche d'avoir, par une application non qualifiée de
l'art. 21(2)  du Code Criminel ,
omis de préciser les rôles respectifs de Côté et Dumas, son complice, pour décider
s'il y avait eu meurtre simple ou qualifié. M. le Juge Hyde
est de plus d'avis, avec M. le Juge Casey également de la majorité, qu'une défense
basée sur l'ivresse aurait dû être soumise aux jurés. Quant aux Juges
minoritaires, M. le Juge Choquette déclare que les faits et questions en litige
sont exposés de façon complète par M. le Juge Rivard et que, d'accord avec lui,
il est d'avis que (i), sur le fait, le verdict ne saurait être infirmé pour le
motif qu'il est déraisonnable ou non supporté par la preuve et (ii), sur le
droit, aucun tort important, aucune erreur judiciaire grave ne s'est produite;
M. le Juge Rivard écarte comme non fondés tous les griefs soulevés à l'adresse
du Juge et ajoute qu'après avoir fait un examen du dossier pour y déceler la présence
d'erreurs ou d'illégalités préjudiciables, il n'en a trouvé aucune.

Se prévalant des dispositions de l'art. 598(1) (a), l'appelant en appelle de cette décision
majoritaire.

Sur les faits, M. le Juge Rivard est le seul
de tous les Juges à relater la preuve. Le récit qu'il donne sur le fait même de
l'attentat, ainsi que des événements pertinents qui l'ont précédé et suivi,
n'est pas contesté. Sur le fait même de l'attentat commis dans la nuit du 25 au 26 octobre 1961, en la résidence
de la victime, Dumas est le seul à témoigner. Voici la substance de son témoignage: Lui et Côté, sachant que Philippe Raymond, un
octogénaire vivant seul dans sa maison, y gardait de l'argent dans une valise,
se sont introduits de nuit dans sa résidence pour le voler. La disposition des
lieux leur était connue. A la faveur d'une obscurité relative, Dumas se dirigea
à la chambre où se trouvait la valise; il heurta une chaise près de la valise et entendit alors du bruit dans
la chambre opposée, où couchait le vieillard. Côté entra dans cette chambre.
Alors que, dans l'autre pièce, Dumas tentait d'ouvrir la valise avec un
couteau, il entendit «un bruit de lutte». Le vieillard appela à l'aide en
criant à

[Page 364]

deux ou trois reprises: «Omer». D'autre part,
Côté cria à Dumas: «Viens ici». Dumas se rendit à la chambre à coucher; la
victime était debout et résistait alors que Côté la retenait contre lui et
avait une main appuyée sur sa bouche. Côté ayant dit à Dumas: «Il faut
l'attacher», celui-ci se fit des liens en déchirant un des vêtements portés par
la victime, une taie d'oreiller et un coussin qu'il alla chercher sur un sofa
dans la cuisine. Puis, il bâillonna le vieillard, lui attacha les mains derrière
le dos et lui ligota les pieds. Après quoi, Côté coucha la victime sur son lit,
et les deux s'emparèrent de la valise et déguerpirent. Dumas déclare de plus
qu'après avoir bâillonné la victime, il sentit sur ses mains quelque chose de
liquide et chaud, qu'une fois à l'extérieur, il réalisa être du sang. Au moment
de leur départ, le vieillard gémissait à travers son bâillon.

Deux jours plus tard, le 28 octobre 1961, Dolorès Raymond, nièce de la victime, s'étant
rendue à la demeure de son oncle, le trouva gisant près de son lit,
horriblement blessé et sans vie, ayant des liens, particulièrement aux pieds et
à la main gauche. Elle alerta les autorités policières qui, arrivées sur les
lieux, constatèrent la mort de Raymond et la disparition de la valise.
L'autopsie révéla que Raymond avait été sauvagement attaqué; outre de
nombreuses éraflures, tous les os de la face, ou à peu près, étaient fracturés
en plusieurs morceaux de même que
plusieurs côtes de chaque côté du thorax. La trachée, les bronches et l'estomac
étaient remplis de sang. Le pathologiste en conclut que l'hémorragie et
l'asphyxie avaient été la cause conjuguée de la mort.

A cette preuve sur les détails du fait de
l'attentat s'ajoute celle des événements qui l'ont précédé et suivi, dont,
particulièrement, les suivants:— Bien
avant le mois d'octobre, Côté avait été informé par un nommé Gauthier du fait
que la victime gardait plusieurs milliers de dollars dans une valise en sa résidence; pour cette information, Côté promit à
Gauthier une commission de dix pour cent sur le produit du vol envisagé, ainsi
qu'en a témoigné Denis McMahon, garçon de table de l'hôtel Normandie, qui
entendit la conversation entre Côté et Gauthier sur le sujet; le soir du crime,
Dumas, accompagné de Côté, loua d'Yvan Gagnon, à Granby, l'automobile dans
laquelle ils se rendirent de cet endroit à la résidence de Raymond, à St-Nicéphore; avant leur départ, comme durant les quelques
arrêts faits au cours

[Page 365]

de ce voyage de plusieurs milles, des boissons
alcooliques furent consommées; en cours de route, Dumas revêtit des vêtements
trouvés dans l'automobile de Gagnon et que celui-ci avait oublié d'enlever;
arrivés à St-Nicéphore, ils stationnèrent la voiture à quelque distance de la
maison de Raymond où ils entrèrent après avoir enjambé une clôture. Dumas témoigne
qu'après l'attentat, la valise vidée de l'argent ainsi que les vêtements qu'il
avait revêtus furent abandonnés à divers endroits le long d'un chemin de terre
pris pour le retour à Granby; après la découverte du
crime, on retouva ces effets aux différents endroits indiqués par Dumas. Sur
les vêtements, identifiés par Gagnon, comme sur la porte avant droite de son automobile,
on trouva du sang humain; le 26 octobre, Côté visita le
docteur Dubé pour traitement d'un bleu et d'un œdème à la main droite; enfin,
le 26 octobre également, Côté paya, tel que convenu, une
commission à Gauthier.

Aucun des faits ci-dessus rapportés par les témoins
produits par la poursuite n'a été contredit par les témoins produits par la défense.
La preuve offerte par ceux-ci avait pour objet, suivant la déclaration faite
aux jurés par l'avocat de l'accusé avant de procéder à la leur faire entendre,
de tendre à démontrer la possibilité d'un doute raisonnable en faveur de
l'accusé. Bref, cette preuve rapporte ce qui suit. D'une part, une chicane
intervenue en juillet 1960 entre le vieillard et son
neveu, Roland Raymond, et, d'autre part, l'opinion d'un médecin sur un certain «état
psychique et psychologique» de l'accusé. Par le premier de ces faits, la défense
entendait suggérer aux jurés la possibilité qu'après le vol, ce neveu ou
d'autres personnes soient—par une étrange coïncidence—entrés dans la maison, entre le 26 et le 28 octobre, pour commettre sur la personne du vieillard l'assaut qui entraîna
sa mort. Par l'opinion du médecin, on voulut prouver que Côté était facilement
influençable. Cette preuve offerte par la défense a été soumise par le Juge aux
jurés qui, manifestement, ont refusé de l'accepter ou d'y donner suite. Enfin,
nonobstant la preuve accablante faite contre lui, l'accusé lui-même se s'est
pas fait entendre comme témoin.

Différant, pour l'insant, la considération des
deux seuls griefs retenus en appel sur l'adresse du Juge, notons qu'après avoir
instruit les jurés que Dumas et Gauthier étaient des complices, le Juge a plus
d'une fois insisté pour les prévenir

[Page 366]

du danger qu'il y avait d'accepter leurs témoignages
et surtout celui de Dumas. Il leur a de plus expliqué les raisons de ce danger.
Dans la dernière partie de son adresse il a précisé les verdicts qui pouvaient être
rendus. Il leur a dit qu'à moins d'être convaincus hors de tout doute
raisonnable de la culpabilité de l'accusé, ils devaient l'acquitter. S'il a, à
mon avis, vu l'accusation, erronément indiqué, comme possible en droit, un
verdict de coupable de vol qualifié—ce dont l'accusé ne
saurait se plaindre—, il a validement,
dans les circonstances de cette cause et pour les raisons
qui suivent, écarté, comme possible en droit, un verdict de coupable de meurtre
simple. Comme l'a déclaré le procureur de l'accusé à l'audition de cet appel,
la preuve des faits antérieurs et subséquents à l'attentat ne permet pas, à
elle seule et sans le témoignage de Dumas, de savoir ce qui s'est passé entre
la victime et celui ou ceux qui l'ont assaillie, même si, dans cette preuve, on
trouve par ailleurs une corroboration du témoignage de
Dumas. De toute évidence, les jurés, pour pouvoir, comme ils l'ont fait,
trouver l'accusé coupable, ont accepté, comme ils en avaient le droit, le témoignage
de Dumas sur le fait circonstancié de l'attentat. Suivant ce témoignage:—Côté et Dumas étaient les agresseurs de la victime; une bataille entre celle-ci et Côté était déjà engagée quand
l'assistance de Dumas fut requise par Côté; étant alors intervenu pour aider Côté,
Dumas se procura les liens dont il se servit pour bâillonner et ligoter le
vieillard qui, encore debout, résistait et criait à l'aide pendant que Côté le
retenait. Ces mêmes liens on les trouva par la suite attachés aux pieds et à la
main gauche de la victime. Les jurés pouvaient-ils raisonnablement concevoir
que, pendant que l'un des agresseurs se procurait les liens, qu'il bâillonnait
et ligotait les mains et les pieds de la victime, l'autre demeurait inactif et
n'apportait aucune participation en l'affaire. Il reste que les deux se sont
entraidés dans cet assaut pour maîtriser, blesser, bâillonner, garrotter et
abandonner, dans cette condition, le vieillard seul dans la nuit, le tout à
l'occasion et aux fins d'un vol, et que l'un comme l'autre a par son fait soit
causé ou, à tout le moins, aidé l'autre à causer les blessures, l'hémorragie,
l'asphyxie entraînant la mort. Dans les circonstances, l'acceptation par les
jurés du témoignage de Dumas ne pouvait justifier et ne pouvait autoriser le
Juge à suggérer, comme possible en droit, un verdict de meurtre simple, mais
uniquement un

[Page 367]

verdict de meurtre qualifié, tel que défini
aux dispositions pertinentes des arts. 202, 202A et 288
du Code Criminel . Les jurés ne pouvaient rendre un verdict de
meurtre simple sous l'art. 202  sans accepter le témoignage
de Dumas où seulement ils pouvaient trouver les éléments de cette offense. De là,
ils étaient inévitablement conduits à accepter que l'assaut, l'application de bâillon
et de liens, et l'abandon du vieillard, ne pouvaient être en fait que l'œuvre
des deux agresseurs et que Côté avait, par son propre fait, soit causé ou aidé à
causer les blessures entraînant la mort, ce qui faisait du meurtre commis un
meurtre qualifié, en vertu de l'art. 202A .

En Cour d'Appel3,
on a reproché au Juge d'avoir, dans son adresse aux jurés, omis (i) de leur
soumettre un moyen de défense basé sur l'ivresse et (ii) de les inviter à se préoccuper
des rôles respectifs de Côté et Dumas dans l'assaut sur le vieillard pour décider
s'il y avait eu meurtre simple ou qualifié. M. le Juge Hyde est le seul à retenir ces deux reproches; le Juge en chef retient le second
et M. le Juge Casey, le premier.

Premier grief: Côté et Dumas ont quitté Granby
vers 8.30 heures et sont arrivés à St-Nicéphore environ
quatre heures plus tard. Peu de temps avant leur départ de Granby, comme lors
d'un arrêt fait à Roxton Falls et un
autre à Actonvale au cours de ce trajet de plusieurs milles, on a pris quelques
consommations de boissons alcooliques. Loin d'indiquer qu'il en soit résulté
chez Côté ou Dumas un état d'ébriété susceptible de supporter un moyen de défense,
la preuve manifeste, au contraire, qu'ils ont poursuivi et exécuté leur projet
nonobstant la résistance prévisible qu'ils ont rencontrée, qu'après s'être
emparés de l'argent, ils se sont débarrassés de la valise et des vêtements en
abandonnant ces effets à différents endroits le long du chemin de terre emprunté
pour le retour et qu'ils ont retourné l'automobile de Gagnon, à Granby, à
l'heure dont ils avaient convenu avec lui au début de la soirée. Aucune preuve
de fait ne suggère que la boisson consommée les ait rendus incapables de former
et exécuter l'intention spécifique ou d'avoir la volonté de causer des lésions
corporelles aux fins de faciliter la perpétration du vol ou leur fuite après
l'avoir commis. En l'absence de cette preuve, le Juge au procès n'avait pas à
inviter les jurés à considérer l'ivresse comme moyen de

[Page 368]

défense. Le procureur de l'accusé n'a même pas
soulevé ce moyen devant les jurés. A une question posée par un des membres de
cette Cour, il a candidement déclaré qu'il s'était délibérément abstenu de ce
faire pour pouvoir soulever ce moyen en Cour d'Appel. C'est là une technique
dont la justice ne saurait s'inspirer.

Deuxième grief: Le Juge au procès, dit-on,
aurait laissé les jurés sous l'impression que même si les blessures entraînant
la mort de Raymond avaient été causées par Dumas seul, sans aucune assistance
de Côté, ils pouvaient trouver ce dernier coupable de meurtre qualifié. Les
parties de la charge invoquées au soutien de ce reproche sont reproduites aux
raisons de notre collègue M. le Juge Cartwright. Certes, ainsi isolée du
contexte entier de la charge et du contexte de la cause soumise en l'espèce aux
jurés, et considérée in abstracto comme
proposition générale de droit, la teneur de certains de ces extraits ne peut être
acceptée comme conforme à la loi. Dans la critique adéquate d'une charge aux
jurés, il importe cependant, comme l'a noté M. le Juge Rivard dans ses raisons
de jugement, de retenir et donner effet aux directives suivantes de Lord
Birkenhead dans Director of Public Prosecutions
v. Beard4:

In examining the language used in these and later oases it
is extremely necessary to bear in mind that the judge when directing the jury
with reference to the facts and circumstances of a particular case is not
writing in abstracto a treatise upon the criminal law, and
that his words must always be considered with regard to the special facts then
before the jury.

Appliquant ces directives à l'espèce et considérant la charge comme Un tout en rattachant la
somme des instructions données par le Juge aux jurés aux faits et circonstances
placés devant eux, tant par la poursuite que par la défense, et à la substance
véritable des questions en découlant, je ne puis, en tout respect pour les
tenants de l'opinion contraire, conclure au bien-fondé de ce grief. L'entraide,
en fait, de Côté et Dumas pour assaillir, bâillonner, ligoter la victime
abandonnée seule dans la nuit, était un facteur inséparablement inhérent à la
théorie de la Couronne fondée sur la condition dans laquelle fut trouvée la
victime le 28 octobre et sur le témoignage non contredit
de Dumas. Plus d'une fois après avoir dit ce qu'on lui reproche, le Juge au
procès a insisté sur l'obligation de la Couronne de prouver que la

[Page 369]

mort de Raymond avait été causée par des
coups donnés par Côté ou par des coups donnés par Côté et son compagnon. Aussi
bien m'est-il impossible de dire que les jurés aient pu avoir l'impression
qu'il était en leur pouvoir de trouver Côté coupable de meurtre qualifié sans être
convaincus hors de tout doute raisonnable qu'il avait, par son propre fait,
causé ou aidé à causer les blessures entraînant la mort de Raymond.

A l'audition, bien qu'invité à ce faire s'il y
avait lieu, le procureur de l'intimé ne formula aucun grief additionnel pour
supporter le jugement majoritaire de la Cour du banc de la reine. De plus,
alors que la cause était en délibéré, la Cour lui permit, à sa demande, de
fournir un factum supplémentaire,
dans lequel, cependant, je n'ai trouvé aucun motif de modifier l'opinion
ci-dessus exprimée.

Dans les circonstances, je maintiendrais
l'appel et rétablirais le verdict des jurés.

The judgment of Cartwright, Hall and Spence
JJ. was delivered by

Cartwright J.
(dissenting):— The relevant facts out of which this appeal
arises and the manner in which the matter was dealt with in the Court of
Queen's Bench (Appeal Side)5
are set out in the reasons of my brother Fauteux, which I have had the
advantage of reading.

For the reasons given by my brother Fauteux I agree with his
conclusion that the learned trial judge did not err in omitting to charge the
jury in regard to the effect in law of the suggested drunkenness of the
respondent.

The other ground on which the Court of Queen's Bench held
that the conviction of the respondent should be quashed and a new trial
directed is set out in the reasons of Tremblay C.J. P.Q. I
find myself so fully in accord with the reasons of the learned Chief Justice
that I would be content simply to adopt them. However, in view of the
differences of opinion in the Court of Queen's Bench and in this Court I shall
state my reasons, as briefly as possible.

The theory of the Crown was that the respondent was guilty
of capital murder by the combined effect of s. 202 (a)(i) and s. 202A(2) (6)(i)
of the Criminal Code , in that Côté and Dumas acting
together had decided to break into the dwelling-house of Philippe Raymond by
night and

[Page 370]

to steal the money which they had learned was in a valise in
the victim's house, that for the purpose of facilitating the commission of this
offence and meaning to cause bodily harm to the victim they had inflicted the
injuries from ' which his death ensued, and that Côté by
his own act caused or assisted Dumas in causing the bodily harm from which the
death ensued.

The error in the charge of the learned trial judge which Tremblay C.J. found to be fatal to the validity of the
conviction was that the jury were given to understand that if they were
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Dumas and Côté had
formed the intention in common to carry out the burglary mentioned above and to
assist each other therein and that Côté knew or ought to
have known that the infliction of bodily harm on the victim would be a probable
consequence of carrying out that common purpose then Côté would
be guilty of capital murder even if the bodily harm which caused the death was
inflicted by Dumas alone and Côté neither inflicted it nor
aided in its infliction.

That this was the effect of the charge of the learned trial
judge appears from the following passages:

Je dois vous lire à ce sujet, ce que dit
l'article 21 au paragraphe (deux) du Code Criminel : «Quand
deux ou plusieurs personnes forment ensemble le projet de poursuivre une fin
illégale», le vol est une fin illégale «et de s'y entraider et que l'une d'entre
elles commet une infraction» en l'occurrence c'est un assaut avec violence, «en
réalisant cette fin commune, chacune d'elles qui savait ou devait savoir que la
réalisation de l'intention commune aurait pour conséquence probable la perpétration
de l'infraction, chacune est partie à cette infraction».

Quand on va commettre un vol dans une résidence
privée, évidemment on peut bien espérer le faire sans que la personne ou les
personnes qui sont là ne se réveillent, c'est évident, ça, seulement, je pense
bien qu'on peut dire que c'est toujours possible et même probable que quelqu'un
se réveille et alors, évidemment il y a deux choses qu'on peut faire, que peut
faire le voleur, déguerpir au plus vite s'il a fini son ouvrage ou bien prendre
les moyens pour que la personne ou les personnes qui sont là ne soient pas des
obstacles.

C'est à vous messieurs, de dire si l'assaut
commis sur le vieillard Raymond était une conséquence probable, si l'un comme
l'autre de ceux qui y sont allés pouvait prévoir la probabilité qu'ils auraient
à maîtriser le vieillard qui pouvait être réveillé à leur arrivée ou qui
pouvait se réveiller pendant qu'ils étaient dans la maison.

Et, il n'y a pas de problème dans le fait
qu'ils soient deux. S'ils étaient deux et que vous en venez à la conclusion
qu'ils ont fait ce qu'on leur reproche, que ça ait été fait par Côté ou que ça
ait été fait par Dumas quand ils étaient ensemble, ça n'a aucune importance.

[Page 371]

Dumas, au point de vue du Code Criminel  serait
responsable de tout ce qu'a pu faire Côté, et Côté serait responsable de tout
ce qu'a pu faire Dumas.

Vous savez c'est la consécration du vieux
dicton: celui qui tient le sac est aussi coupable que
celui qui commet le vol.

* * *

Vous avez le droit d'asseoir votre verdict
uniquement sur la preuve directe faite par Dumas, du moment que vous êtes
convaincus qu'il a dit la vérité quand il nous dit qu'ils sont allés chez
Eaymond ce soir-là, qu'ils ont volé, qu'il y a eu des coups de donnés évidemment,
Dumas nous dit qu'il y en a eu plus de donnés par l'accusé que par lui-même,
c'est un détail, ça, mais qu'il y a eu des coups de donnés.

* * *

En regard de la preuve de circonstances, sans
tenir compte de la preuve directe, si cette preuve vous satisfait que Côté et
Dumas sont allés chez Raymond, y ont commis un vol et au cours du vol que l'un
ou l'autre ou les deux ensemble, ont blessé le vieillard avec la conséquence
que la mort a été le résultat des coups portés, et si cette preuve est telle
que dans vos esprits, elle exclut toute possibilité raisonnable que d'autres
ont pu faire le coup.

Alors vous pouvez rendre un verdict contre
l'accusé.

Et, combien de verdicts messieurs pouvez-vous
rendre.

L'Article 202A, je vous l'ai lu, dit:— «Que le meurtre est dit qualifié» lorsqu'il tombe, à l'égard de toute
personne, lorsqu'il tombe sous le coup de l'Article 202 .» L'Article,
sous paragraphe (3) dit: «Tout meurtre autre qu'un meurtre
qualifié est un meurtre non qualifié». Mais le premier alinéa du 202A nous
parle du meurtre qualifié: «celui qui est projeté et commis de propos délibéré.»

Ce meurtre, ce n'est pas celui que vous avez à
juger. Si c'était celui-là, je vous dirais que vous pouvez rendre un verdict de
meurtre non qualifié, dans le cas par exemple où vous ne seriez pas satisfaits
que l'accusé aurait eu une préméditation suffisante pour constituer un meurtre
qualifié.

Seulement, comme il s'agit ici, d'après la
preuve apportée par la Couronne, d'un meurtre non qualifié qui tombe sous
l'Article 202  et qu'il suffit qu'il y ait eu blessures et
mort en résultant le tout accompagné d'un vol qualifié pour que le meurtre soit
le meurtre qualifié, je crois qu'il n'y a pas de place ici pour un verdict de
meurtre ordinaire.

For the appellant it is said that the charge must, of
course, be read as a whole and that it contains other passages which would
remove from the minds of the jury the effect of the error, if error there was,
in the passages which I have just quoted.

The following portions of the charge are referred to and
particular emphasis is laid upon the phrases which I have italicized:

Par ailleurs messieurs, je
dois tenir compte, je dois dire que j'y ai pensé pas mal, je dois tenir compte
de la théorie prouvée par la défense, théorie qui serait celle-ci et sur
laquelle évidemment je vous l'ai dit la défense a droit au bénéfice du doute
raisonnable.

[Page 372]

La Couronne est obligée de prouver que la mort
est le résultat des coups portés par l'accusé et son compagnon. Là-dessus, vous
avez le médecin, et vous avez évidemment le fait que le vieux était un
vieillard qui était tout seul, qui vivait solitaire, il n'y a pas de toute,
qu'il a été attaché, ligoté enfin.

La suggestion que l'on vous fait, basée sur
une certaine preuve du moins, c'est qu'on aurait laissé le vieillard bien
vivant, non pas en danger de mort et que ça serait une autre personne qui
serait venue le tuer, disons le mot …

Là-dessus, si vous avez un doute raisonnable,
après avoir bien pesé la preuve et que vous pensez qu'il y a place pour un
doute raisonnable làdedans, c'est votre affaire, et bien, je crois qu'il y
aurait lieu, dans ce cas-là seulement, j'insiste, dans ce cas-là seulement, la
Couronne n'aurait pas satisfait vos esprits hors de tout doute raisonnable que
la mort à résulté des coups donnés par l'accusé.

Et il faudrait que vous en veniez à la
conclusion qu'il y a quelque chose dans la théorie de la défense, qu'un autre
serait venu le finir.

Si vous êtes de l'opinion que le vieillard est
resté seul dans la maison et que personne n'est allé lui donner d'autres coups
pour le tuer et qu'il est mort soit au bout d'une heure, ou deux heures, ou
d'une journée, ça n'a pas d'importance, des suites, quand bien même qu'il
serait mort de faim, parce qu'il était attaché, ou de la perte de son sang, des
suites des coups donnés par l'accusé, messieurs, ça c'est du meurtre.

* * *

Mais si vous entretenez un doute sur la théorie
apportée par la défense, un doute raisonnable que quelqu'un est allé après,
alors que le vieillard n'était pas en danger de mort, qu'il avait été laissé
blessé, évidemment, mais rien de grave, qu'il ne serait pas mort, et que cette
autre personne est venue le finir, bien alors là, il faudrait en conclure que
la mort n'est pas résultée des coups donnés par l'accusé, dans le cas présent,
mais que la mort est résultée des coups donnés par une tierce personne.

* * *

Si vous avez un doute quant à la suggestion
apportée par la défense, et vous pouvez en tenir compte de cette suggestion-là
en autant que dans la preuve vous trouvez des éléments pour vous baser, alors
si vous avez un doute là-dessus, ce serait que la Couronne n'a pas prouvé à
votre satisfaction que la mort est le résultat des coups donnés par l'accusé et
dans ce cas-là, il resterait quoi? Il resterait le fait qu'on est allé voler le
vieillard qu'on l'a frappé mais que possiblement ce sont d'autres qui sont allés
le finir.

Si c'est là, votre sentiment, messieurs, vous
avez le droit de rapporter un verdict de vol qualifié.

* * *

Coupable de vol qualifié ce serait si vous n'êtes
pas satisfaits hors de tout doute raisonnable que la mort est le résultat … mais là-dessus par exemple j'ai bien dit si vous êtes
convaincus hors de tout doute raisonnable qu'aucun étranger n'est intervenu après
les coups portés par l'accusé et son compagnon, pour finir le vieillard.…

(The suggestion in the two last quoted passages that the
respondent could be convicted of robbery is wrong in law, being contrary to the
provisions of s. 569(2) of the Criminal

[Page 373]

Code, but this error is not relevant to the question now
under discussion.)

I am unable to accept this argument of the appellant. In all
these passages the attention of the jury is being directed to the theory of the
defence that the murder was committed by third persons who came on the scene
after Côté and Dumas had left the victim, perhaps injured,
but not dying.

I am not satisfied that these portions of the charge would
alter the impression previously given to the jury that if the injuries which
proved fatal were inflicted by either Côte or Dumas it was
of no importance by which of the two they were inflicted. As I read the charge,
they were not intended to have this effect; at this stage of the charge, the
minds of the jury were being directed to the question whether the fatal
injuries were caused (i) as the Crown submitted, by Côté and
Dumas or (ii) as the defence suggested, by third persons.

It was in the part of his charge dealing with the theory of
the defence that the learned trial judge said:

Si vous croyez que personne n'est intervenu,
je ne crois pas qu'il y ait de place pour un verdict de meurtre ordinaire parce
que l'intention n'a rien à faire dans ça.

Nowhere in the charge was there a
clear direction to the jury that they could find the
respondent guilty of capital murder, as distinguished from non-capital murder,
only if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he, Côté,
by his own act either caused or assisted in causing the injuries from which
the death of the victim ensued. This was, in my opinion, a fatal omission.

On the question whether, notwithstanding the errors in the
charge to the jury, it can be affirmed that no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice occurred I agree with what was said by Tremblay C.J.
The provisions of s. 592(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  cannot, in my opinion,
be successfully invoked in a case in which the jury have been misdirected as to
an essential element of the charge which they are trying. To hold otherwise
would be to substitute, in a capital case, the decision of an appellate Court
for the verdict of a properly instructed jury.

[Page 374]

For the reasons given by Tremblay C.J.
and those set out above, I would dismiss the appeal.

Present: Cartwright, Fauteux, Martland, Ritchie and Hall JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.

Criminal law—Sunday observance—Non-profit film society
providing dues-paying members with showings of films in a theatre on Sunday—No
charge made for admission—Whether a performance elsewhere than in a church at
which a fee was charged directly or indirectly contrary to the Lord's Day Act,
R.S.C. 1952, c. 171, s. 6(1).

The appellant film society, a non-profit organization whose
main function was to provide its members with the opportunity to enjoy films of
a character not usually shown at commercial theatres, provided a
""performance"" by the showing of two films elsewhere than in a church
on a Sunday. The society was convicted of violating s. 6(1) of the Lord's
Lay Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171. An appeal from the conviction was dismissed
in the County Court and a further appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.

The society's membership dues, which were determined in
accordance with its financial position and the anticipated expenses of the
coming year, were fixed for the year 1961-62 at $6, in exchange for which the
members were entitled to attend the showings of the society's films without
payment of any admission charge and to participate in the affairs of the
society generally.

On appeal to this Court, the main question to be determined
was whether the appellant by providing its dues-paying members with showings of
films in a theatre on Sunday without making a charge for admission at such
theatre did unlawfully provide a performance elsewhere than in a church at
which a fee was charged directly or indirectly for admission to such
performance.

[Page 281]

Held: The appeal should be allowed and the conviction
quashed.

There was nothing in the Lord's Day Act to prevent the
society from providing any kind of performance anywhere on Sunday provided that
it was not one at which a fee was charged directly or indirectly.

The Court was of the opinion that the fee charged for annual
membership in the society bore no relationship to the number of times the
individual members actually attended the performances which the society
provided, and having regard to all the circumstances, these payments had more
of the character of ""membership"" than of ""admission"" fees.
This would not, however, necessarily conclude the matter if it had been shown
that the performance provided by the appellant was one at which any kind
of fee was charged directly or indirectly which entitled the person paying it
to admission to the performance.

This was not a case where money or money's worth was paid at
the performance under some device intended to give the payment the
appearance of being charged for something other than admission (Recreation
Operators Ltd. v. R. (1952), 15 C.R. 360), nor was it a case in which the
admission charge was defrayed by the tender of money's worth in the form of a
ticket purchased in advance (Marin v. United Amusement Corporation Ltd. (1929),
47 Que. K.B. 1).

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba1,
affirming a judgment of Philp Co. Ct. J. whereby
appellant's appeal from its conviction by Dubienski P.M. for a violation of s.
6(1) of the Lord's Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171, was dismissed. Appeal
allowed.

M. J. Arpin, Q.C., for the appellant.

J. J. Enns, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Ritchie J.:—This
is an appeal brought by leave of this Court from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal of Manitoba2
which affirmed a judgment of Judge Philp of the County Court of Winnipeg
whereby the learned County Court Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal from
its conviction by Magistrate Dubienski at the Winnipeg Magistrate's Court on
the charge that it

On the Lord's Day, to wit: the 7th day of January, A.D.
1962, at the City of Winnipeg aforesaid did unlawfully provide a performance
elsewhere than in a church at which a fee was charged, directly or indirectly,
for admission to such performance, contrary to the provisions of the statute in
such case made and provided …

[Page 282]

The statutory provisions which the appellant is alleged
to have contravened are those contained in s. 6(1) of the Lord's Day Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 171, which read as follows:

It is not lawful for any person, on the Lord's Day, except
as provided in any provincial Act or law now or hereafter in force, to engage
in any public game or contest for gain or for any prize or reward, or to be
present thereat, or to provide, engage in, or be present at any performance or
public meeting, elsewhere than in a church, at which any fee is charged,
directly or indirectly, either for admission to such performance or meeting, or
to any place within which the same is provided, or for any service or privilege
thereat.

A breach of this section exposes the offender to the penalty
provided by s. 12 of the Act and upon conviction the appellant in the present
case was sentenced to pay a fine of twenty-five dollars and costs and in
default to have distress levied upon it for the said fine and costs.

It is not disputed that the appellant was duly incorporated
in January of 1960 under the provisions of The Companies Act, R.S.M.
1954, c. 43, for the purposes of carrying on without pecuniary gain, objects of
a national, patriotic, philanthropic, scientific, artistic or social character
or the like and it. is admitted that this society provided a
""performance"" by the showing of two films elsewhere than in a church
on Sunday, January 7, 1962.

The main function of the society is to provide its members
with the opportunity to enjoy films of a character not usually shown at
commercial theatres; it is affiliated with the Canadian Federation of Film
Societies and the work of its unpaid executive includes obtaining such films as
the membership may desire, renting the premises where the films can be
displayed, advising the membership of the nature of available film material and
attending to the financial and social affairs of the society. The annual
membership dues, which are determined in accordance with the financial position
of the society and the anticipated expenses of the coming year, were fixed for
the year 1961-62 at six dollars, in exchange for which the members were
entitled to attend the showings of the society's films without payment of any
admission charge and to participate in the affairs of the society generally.
Membership in the society also included the privilege of bringing guests to the
theatre if seats were available, but no fee of any kind was charged to anyone
at the performance. It is relevant to note that

[Page 283]

many members of the society did not attend all film showings
during any year and that some did not attend any at all.

Leave to appeal to this Court was granted in general terms
and twelve grounds of appeal are set out in the notice of appeal, but the main question
to be determined is whether the appellant by providing its dues-paying members
with showings of films in a theatre on Sunday without making any charge for
admission at such theatre ""did"" to employ the words of the charge
""unlawfully provide a performance elsewhere than in a church at which a
fee was charged directly or indirectly for admission to such performance"".

The final paragraph of the reasons for judgment delivered by
Schultz J.A. on behalf of himself and Miller C.J.M., reads
as follows:

The evidence is clear that in the instant case the society
provided a showing of films for 850 of its members on Sunday, January 7, 1962,
at a place other than a church; that no persons other than members of the
society could, or did, obtain admission thereto; that such showing was paid for
from the proceeds of the society's annual membership fees. In my opinion this
constituted payment of an indirect charge and was a breach of sec. 6(1) of the
Lord's Day Act.

Monnin J.A., whose reasons for judgment were concurred in by
Guy J.A., concluded by saying:

The society, under the umbrella of the duly incorporated
non-profit organization was attempting to do what was forbidden to commercial
organizations and to other individuals or groups of individuals. The annual membership
fee for all practical purposes is a season ticket but for an undetermined
number of performances. The membership fee, being an indirect fee, is a
violation of sec. 6(1) of the Lord's Day Act.

The question of whether an annual membership fee entitling
the member to repeated and general use of the facilities of a club or society
is to be treated, for taxation purposes, as an ""admission fee"" for
each occasion of actual use of those facilities, was considered in the case of Executives
Club of Louisville v. Glen3,
in which Circuit Court Judge Miller had occasion to refer to the test of
what constitutes a ""due or membership fee"" laid down by Mr. Justice
Jackson in the Supreme Court of the United States in White v. Winchester Club4 in the following terms:

Consideration of the nature of club activity is a necessary
preliminary to the formulation of a test of what constitutes a ""due or
membership fee."" So far as finances go, the fundamental notion of club
activity is that operating expenses are shared without insistence upon
equivalence between

[Page 284]

the proportion of an individual's contributions and the
proportion of the benefits he receives. Thus, on the one hand, payment of the
price of an individual dinner at the club dining room or of a single round of
golf lacks the element of making common cause inherent in the idea of club
activity. But, on the other hand, payment for the right to repeated and general
use of a common club facility for an appreciable period of time has that
element and amounts to a ""due or membership fee"" if the payment is
not fixed by each occasion of actual use.

The same test was applied in Merion Cricket Club v.
United States5.

The appellant is a bona fide non-profit organization
with national associations, the members of which, in addition to being admitted
without charge to its performances, enjoy many of the intangible benefits to be
derived from the sharing of common interests with fellow club members and from
participating in guiding the administrative policy of the organization,
including the selection of its films.

I am satisfied that the charge of six dollars for annual
membership in the Winnipeg Film Society bears no relationship to the number of
times the individual members actually attend the performances which the society
provides, and having regard to all the circumstances, I think that these
payments have more of the character of ""membership"" than of
""admission"" fees. This would not, however, in my view, necessarily
conclude the matter if it had been shown that the performance provided by the
appellant on January 7, 1962, was one at which any kind of fee was
charged directly or indirectly which entitled the person paying it to admission
to the performance.

It is to be noted that s. 6(1) of the Lord's Day Act does
not make it unlawful for any person to provide ""a performance""
elsewhere than in a church on Sunday, and there is nothing in the Lord's Day
Act to prevent any society from providing any kind of performance anywhere
on Sunday provided that it is not one ""at which any fee is charged
directly or indirectly"".

It appears to me that s. 6(1) of the Lord's Day Act has
its origin in the statute entitled ""An Act for preventing certain Abuses and
Profanations on the Lord's Day, called Sunday"" which was passed in England
in 1781 as 23 Geo. III, c. 49, and it is interesting to note that no offence is
created by s. 1 of that statute for keeping open a place of

[Page 285]

entertainment on Sunday unless it be an entertainment
""to which persons shall be admitted by the payment of money or by tickets
sold for money"". The section in question reads in part:

That, from and after the passing of this present Act, any
house, room or other place, which shall be opened or used for public
entertainment or amusement, or for publicly debating on any subject whatsoever,
upon any part of the Lord's Day called Sunday, and to which persons shall be
admitted by the payment of money, or by tickets sold for money, shall be deemed
a disorderly house or place; and the keeper of such house, room, or place,
shall forfeit the sum of two hundred pounds for every day that such house,
room, or place, shall be opened or used as aforesaid. …

It is clear that payment of money or money's worth for
admission to a Sunday performance was an essential ingredient of the offence so
created, but the meaning of the words ""admitted by the payment of
money"" as used in this section was expressly extended by s. 2 of the same
statute which reads, in part, as follows:

… any house, room, or place, which shall be opened or used
for any public entertainment or amusement, or for public debate, on the Lord's
Day at the expense of any number of subscribers or contributors to the carrying
on any such entertainment or amusement, or debate, on the Lord's Day, and to
which persons shall be admitted by tickets, to which the subscribers or
contributors shall be entitled, shall be deemed a house, room, or place, to
which persons are admitted by the payment of money, within the meaning of this
Act.

The Parliament of Canada has, however, not seen fit to
extend the meaning of the words ""any performance … at which any fee is
charged directly or indirectly for admission …"" as they occur in s. 6(1)
of the Lord's Day Act, and it appears to me that these words are clearly
open to the interpretation that the charging of a fee either directly or
indirectly at the performance is an essential ingredient of the offence
here charged. It is contended on behalf of the respondent that the language of
the charge and of the statute refers not only to a fee which is charged directly
or indirectly at the performance, but also to an annual subscription which
is charged at a place other than the performance in exchange for the privilege
of belonging to the society which provides the performance. This appears to me
to be tantamount to saying that a performance for which a fee is charged
indirectly at another place and not necessarily on Sunday shall be treated for
the purposes of the Lord's Day Act as being "" … a performance … at
which a fee is charged … indirectly"" on Sunday.

[Page 286]

This latter construction does not appear to me to reflect
the primary meaning of the language used in the charge by which the appellant
is accused that it ""did unlawfully provide a performance elsewhere than in
a church at which a fee was charged directly or indirectly for admission
…"". If these words were capable of the extended meaning sought to be
placed upon them by the respondent they would, in my opinion, at best be
ambiguous and if the two interpretations could both be sustained, the penal
character of the statute would entitle the appellant to the benefit of the
construction more favourable to it.

The relevant rule governing the construction of penal
statutes is well summarized in Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd ed.,
vol. 36 at p. 415:

It is a general rule that penal enactments are to be
construed strictly and not extended beyond their clear meaning. At the present
day, this general rule means no more than that if, after the ordinary rules of
construction have first been applied, as they must be, there remains any doubt
or ambiguity, the person against whom the penalty is sought to be enforced is
entitled to the benefit of the doubt.

The matter was succinctly stated by Lord Simonds in London
and North Eastern Ry. Co. v. Berriman6,
where he said:

A man is not to be put in peril upon an ambiguity, however
much or little the purpose of the Act appeals to the predilection of the court.

This is not a case where money or money's worth was paid at
the performance under some device intended to give the payment the
appearance of being charged for something other than admission (e.g. food, see Recreation
Operators Ltd. v. The Queen6),
nor is it a case in which the admission charge was defrayed by the tender
of money's worth in the form of a ticket purchased in advance (Marin v.
United Amusement Corporation Ltd.7).

Under all these circumstances it cannot in my opinion be
said that the language of s. 6(1) of the Lord's Day Act and of the
charge here laid is such as to apply without doubt or ambiguity to the
performance provided by the appellant on Sunday, January 7, 1962.

[Page 287]

I would accordingly allow this appeal with costs throughout
and direct that the conviction of the appellant be quashed.

Appeal allowed with costs and conviction
quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN.

Criminal law—Arson—Whether bunkhouses mounted on wheels
""buildings or structures"" within the meaning of s. 374(1) (a) of the
Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51.

The accused was convicted of arson under s. 374(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code . The case for the Crown was that he had counselled another man to set
fire to his construction camp consisting of mobile or portable equipment,
namely, inter alia, two bunkhouses and a combined bunkhouse and office.
It was admitted that these were mounted on wheels for the purpose of ready
movement from place to place. The Court of Appeal, by a majority judgment, held
that, although some of the equipment was not a building or structure within s.
374(1)(a) of the Code, the bunkhouses fell within that meaning. The
accused appealed to this Court, the appeal being limited as to the bunkhouses
only.

Held: The appeal should be allowed and the conviction
quashed.

The items in question were not buildings or structures within
the meaning of s. 374(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . To fall within
the section, a building or structure must be an unmovable property. In the
present case the equipment was fundamentally movable property, without fixed or
permanent foundations.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Saskatchewan1,
affirming the conviction of the appellant for arson. Appeal allowed.

George J. D. Taylor, Q.C. and Calvin F.
Tallis, for the appellant.

S. Kujawa, for the respondent.

[Page 268]

The Chief Justice:—The
appellant Philip Springman, formerly of Nipawin, Saskatchewan, now of
Vancouver, B.C., was on April 2, 1963, convicted by His Honour Judge Forbes at Regina on the following charge:

That he, the said Philip Springman, did on or about the 16th
day of September, 1961, in the Davin District, Saskatchewan, without legal
justification or excuse and without colour of right, unlawfully and wilfully
set fire to the Nipawin Construction Company Limited camp, and did thereby
commit arson, contrary to section 374(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .

The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of
two years. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal against both the
conviction and the sentence. Both appeals were dismissed.

The charge was laid under s. 374(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code  which says that every one who wilfully sets fire to a building or
structure, whether completed or not, is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for 14 years.

The evidence reveals that the Nipawin Construction Company
Limited, owned by the appellant and his wife, had a substantial amount of
equipment and that, during the summer of 1961, this equipment was situated near
Davin. The company was engaged in supplying sand, gravel and crushed rock, and
the equipment that was burnt was being made use of in this operation. It
consisted of a crusher, loaders, trucks, bunkhouses and work-shops. It is the
contention of the respondent that all this equipment was within the meaning of
s. 374(1) (a) and was a building or structure, whether completed or not.
The appellant contends that the Courts below erred in holding that this
equipment should thus be classified because it was completely mobile, being
either self-propelled or mounted on wheels and designed to be moved by power
Units. It is therefore contended on behalf of the appellant that if he did set
fire to this equipment, he should have been prosecuted under s. 374(2)  of the Criminal
Code  which is in the following terms:

(2) Every one who wilfully and for a fraudulent purpose sets
fire to personal property not mentioned in subsection (1) is guilty of an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for five years.

The maximum punishment if the appellant is found guilty
under s. 374(1) (a) is 14 years, and 5 years if convicted under s.
374(2) .

[Page 269]

Parliament has carefully divided s. 374 in two groups, and I
am satisfied that subs, (a) of s. 374 ""a building or
structure"" covers immovable property and that the balance of subs. (1)
also covers property which has a more considerable value than all that is
contained in the residuary clause s. 374(2)  (the whole subject to s. 375).

In the present case, as previously stated, the equipment to
which the fire was set could be easily moved from one place to another. I think
that fundamentally this equipment was movable property.

This I believe is the law in the common law provinces and in
the province of Quebec. In the province of Quebec it has been decided by this
Court in Dulac v. Nadeau in2:

Mais il y a plus. En effet, et quant au bâtiment de Nadeau,—et on pourrait ajouter, celui de Morin,—il s'agit clairement d'immeubles par nature
suivant les dispositions de l'article 376 C.C. Sans doute, on peut bien, ainsi qu'on le fait remarquer dans Colin
et Capitant, Cours Elémentaire de Droit Civil Français, XIè édition, tome 1, N° 922, ou dans les termes de Planiol et Ripert, Traité Pratique de Droit Civil
Français (1926) tome 3, 75, rappeler que «les constructions volantes
établies à la surface du sol pour quelques jours et réédifiées ailleurs, de
place en place, telles que les baraques de foire, ne sont pas des immeubles
parce que ces édifices légers n'ont pas de place fixe.» Mais les deux auteurs
reconnaissent, aux mêmes pages, le principe que «pour qu'une construction soit
immeuble, il n'est pas nécessaire qu'elle soit élevée à perpétuité, que les bâtiments
construits pour une exposition sont immeubles quoiqu'ils soient destinés à être
démolis.»

It will be easily realized by the reading of the opinions of
these authors that the French law is quite similar to the English law, and that
an immovable is something that is not to be forced from its place. It has the
characteristics of things real or land, although constructions built on the
surface of the soil for some length of time, and later rebuilt somewhere else,
from place to place, are not immovables because these buildings have no fixed
or permanent foundations.

I therefore agree with the reasons of my colleague Mr.
Justice Hall, and I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction.

The judgment of Fauteux, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was
delivered by

Hall J.:—The
facts in connection with this appeal are set out fully in the judgment of
Culliton C.J.S. and shortly are as follows: the accused was charged that he,
the said

[Page 270]

Philip Springman, did on or about
the 16th day of September, 1961, in the Davin District, Saskatchewan, without
legal justification or excuse, and without colour of right, unlawfully and
wilfully set fire to the Nipawin Construction Company Limited camp and did
thereby commit arson contrary to s. 374(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . The
accused was first tried by a judge and jury at which trial the jury were unable
to agree upon a verdict. He then elected to be tried by a judge without a jury
and was tried by His Honour Judge Forbes who found him guilty and sentenced him
to a term of two years in a penitentiary.

The Nipawin Construction Company was a limited company, all
of the shares of which had been held by the appellant Springman and his wife.
The company owned a large amount of equipment, and, immediately prior to the
fire on September 16, 1961, had been engaged in the production of crushed rock
under a contract with Concrete Rock Products Limited of Regina.
The operation was being carried out near Davin, Saskatchewan, and as
production was too slow at that point, the appellant had given instructions to
his foreman, Charles Wingert, to line up the camp for a move. The camp was
lined up for movement so that everything could be moved quickly, and, while
stationary, could be served by the central propane unit which supplied heat to
the bunkhouses and electricity from the portable light plant. The machinery and
equipment consisted of a propane truck, welding truck, a number of other trucks
and power units, a house trailer with a half-ton truck, a rock crusher, a front
end loader, a light plant, a cook car, two bunkhouses and a combined bunkhouse
and office. It was admitted that the bunkhouses, cook car and house trailer
were all mounted on wheels for the purpose of ready movement from place to
place wherever rock crushing operations were to be carried on.

The fire which destroyed this machinery and equipment was
set by Charles Wingert, the foreman, and Peter Mihailuk, an employee. The case
for the Crown was that the appellant counselled Mihailuk to set the fire.
Mihailuk gave evidence that he had been induced by the appellant to set the
fire and he was to receive a new truck or car and $4,000 or $5,000 for so
doing.

[Page 271]

Following his conviction by His Honour Judge Forbes, the
appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal3
for Saskatchewan from both conviction and sentence. The grounds of appeal were
as follows:

(1) That on the facts, including the facts as to source and
credibility of the evidence of the commission of the crime and the connection
of the accused therewith, the verdict is unreasonable, or cannot be supported,
and therefore ought to be quashed;

(2) That as a matter of law there is no evidence of any
offence against Section 374(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , since the
""camp"" referred to in the charge (being mobile or portable equipment
consisting of a gravel crusher, trucks, trailers, bunkhouses, etc. … is not
within the meaning of the words ""a building or structure"" appearing
in the said Section 374(1) (a).

The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan unanimously
rejected the appeal under ground 1, holding that the learned trial judge's
findings on the evidence should not be disturbed.

The Court, however, (Maguire J.A. dissenting) while
accepting the argument that the trucks and power units, the rock crusher, the
front end loader and the light plant were not buildings or structures within
the meaning of s. 374(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , held that the
two bunk-houses and the combined bunkhouse and office were buildings or
structures within the meaning of the said section.

Maguire J.A. in his dissenting judgment held that, in
addition to the items which the majority found were not ""buildings or
structures whether completed or not"", the two bunkhouses and the combined
bunkhouse and office were also not ""buildings or structures whether
completed or not"" within the meaning of the said section on the grounds
that:

… being designed and constructed upon a wheeled chassis, for
the purpose of ready movement from place to place, and the temporary use in
each said place, do not fall within ""a building or structure"".

The appeal to this Court is limited to the question as to
whether the two bunkhouses and the combined bunkhouse and office were
""buildings or structures"" within the meaning of s. 374(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code .

With respect, I think that Maguire J.A. was right in holding
that the two bunkhouses and the combined bunkhouse and office were not
buildings or structures within the meaning of the section in question.

[Page 272]

I accept that the term ""structure"" is not to be
construed ejusdem generis with the term ""building"": London
County Council v. Tann4.
However, both ""buildings"" and ""structures"" do possess
certain essential characteristics, some of which are common to both.

The case of London County Council v. Pearce5 appears to be in point.
There the question whether a builders' office constructed of wood and roofed
with zinc, and placed upon iron wheels for the purpose of enabling it to be
wheeled about to any place where building operations were being carried on,
was, when not required at any such place, kept in the builder's own yard and
used as a pay-office for his men was a ""wooden structure or erection of a
moveable or temporary character"" within the meaning of s. 13 of the Metropolis
Management and Building Acts Amendment Act, 1882. Pollock B. said at p.
111:

No special meaning can be given to the word
""structure"" or the word ""erection"" as something distinct
from a building; and it cannot be supposed that the legislature intended that
everything which could in any sense be called a wooden building of a temporary
character should be within the section. It is the duty of the magistrate to say
whether a particular thing (I purposely use an indefinite expression) is within
the definition. It is obvious that there are many things which, in a sense,
would be wooden structures or erections, but could not possibly be held to come
within the section, such as a dog-kennel or a van for removing furniture, which
would be a much larger and heavier thing than such a pay-office as that in
question. There are, therefore, many considerations which ought legitimately to
influence the magistrate in coming to his decision. I think that in the present
case the learned magistrate was perfectly right in holding that this pay-office
was a part of a builder's plant; it is a thing which is moved from one set of
buildings to another as occasion requires, and when not in use in the ordinary
way it is at rest upon the builder's premises, and is used for the convenience
of paying his men, which seems a very reasonable proceeding.

and Vaughan Williams J. said at pp. 112-3:

The magistrate was of opinion that primâ facie a carriage on
wheels was not a wooden structure or erection within the meaning of the
section. I do not mean to say that a man is to be allowed to evade the Act of
Parliament by building on wheels what he intends to be a wooden structure, and
then saying that it is not within the Act because it is on wheels. In all cases
we must be guided by what I may call the intentions of the structure, and must
inquire with what intention it was made. This seems clear from the case of Hall
v. Smallpiece, 59 L.J. (M.C) 97, where it was held that a steam roundabout
was not a wooden structure or erection within the meaning of the Act. Why was
that held? Not because a thing on wheels cannot be within the section, but
because when one looks into the intention with which the thing was made, it
becomes plain that it

[Page 273]

was made for the purpose of locomotion and for erection in
any place where it might be required.

In Cardiff Rating Authority v. Guest Keen, Limited6, Denning L.J. (as he then
was), in discussing what is a ""building or structure or in the nature of a
structure"" said at p. 31:

A structure is something which is constructed, but not
everything which is constructed is a structure. A ship, for instance, is
constructed, but it is not a structure. A structure is something of
substantial size which is built up from component parts and intended to remain
permanently on a permanent foundation, but it is still a structure even though
some of its parts may be moveable, as, for instance, about a pivot. Thus, a
windmill or a turntable is a structure. A thing which is not permanently in one
place is not a structure, but it may be ""in the nature of a
structure"" if it has a permanent site and has all the qualities of a
structure, save that it is on occasion moved on or from its site.

We are not concerned here with anything ""that is in the
nature of a structure"". We have to deal with items that are either
""buildings"" or ""structures"".

My view that the items in question in this appeal are
neither ""buildings"" nor ""structures"" is strengthened by the
judgment of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Rex v. Arpin7, in which it was held that
a railway freight car was not a ""building"" within the meaning of s.
461  of the Criminal Code  of Canada, and by the judgment of the Supreme
Court of Nova Scotia en banc in The King v. Levy and Gray8, in which it was held that
the buffet of a parlour car on a railway was not a ""building"" within
s. 461 of the Code. In this latter case Chisholm J. (as he then was) said at p.
232:

I have come to the conclusion that the buffet of a parlour
car is not a building within the meaning of section 461  of the Criminal Code . A
building is defined by Bouvier (p. 400) as ""an edifice"",
erected by art and fixed upon or over the soil, composed of brick, marble, wood
or other proper substance, connected together, and designed for use in the
position in which it is so fixed.

The appeal should, therefore, be allowed and the conviction
quashed.

Appeal allowed and conviction quashed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.

Criminal law—Obscenity—Forfeiture of two magazines as
obscene publications—Test applied—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s.
150(8) (as enacted by 1959, c. 41, s. 11 ), and s. 150A(4)  (as enacted by 1959,
c. 41, s. 12 ).

On an information based on s. 150A  of the Criminal Code , issues
of two magazines, which the accused had offered for sale in the ordinary course
of its business, were seized as obscene publications under s. 150(8)  of
the Criminal Code . The trial judge found the magazines to be obscene and
ordered their forfeiture to the Crown. This judgment was affirmed by a majority
in the Court of Appeal, Freedman J.A. dissenting. The accused appealed to this
Court.

Held: The appeals should be allowed for the reasons
given by Freedman J.A.

APPEALS from two judgments of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba1,
affirming forfeiture orders made by Macdonell Co. Ct. J. Appeals
allowed.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

The Chief Justice:—These
two appeals, one relating to the December 1962 issue of a magazine called
""Escapade"" and the other to the September 1962 issue of a magazine
called ""Dude"", were argued together.

We are all of opinion that the appeals should be allowed. We
agree with the reasons given by Freedman J.A. in the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba2.
We wish to adopt those reasons in their entirety and do not find it necessary
to add anything to them.

[Page 252]

The appeals are accordingly allowed, the judgments in the
Courts below are set aside, the orders directing that, the matter seized be
forfeited to Her Majesty in the Right of the Province of Manitoba are quashed,
and it is directed that the matter seized be returned to the appellant.

There will be no order as to costs in any Court.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Conviction for fraud—Acquittal
on charge of conspiracy—Whether inconsistency—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 592, 597.

The appellant and three others were charged
on an indictment containing, inter alia, a count of fraud and a count of
conspiracy to commit the fraud. He was convicted with the others on the count
of fraud and, while he was acquitted on the count of conspiracy, the three
others

[Page 213]

were convicted on that count. The appellant’s
defence was that he withdrew from the association at a certain time and took no
part in the actual fraud except as a friendly bystander without criminal
intent. The case put against him by the Crown was that he was an aider and
abettor. The Court of Appeal maintained the convictions. The appellant alone
appealed to this Court by leave on the ground that his conviction for fraud
should be set aside as inconsistent with his acquittal for conspiracy.

Held (Cartwright,
Ritchie and Hall JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Taschereau
C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Spence JJ.: The judge’s charge
was correct in both fact and law and he was under no compulsion to direct that
if the jury acquitted the appellant on the conspiracy count he could not be
convicted with the others on a count of committing that very offence.

The two offences dealt with in these two
counts were distinct and separate offences. There was no inconsistency
requiring the quashing of the conviction for fraud because of the acquittal for
conspiracy. The appellant was convicted for fraud on ample evidence and
pursuant to a correct instruction that it was necessary for the Crown to show a
common intent or design among all four accused in doing whatever the jury found
they did. Aiding and abetting pursuant to a common intent and design is not
necessarily the same thing as the conspiracy charge in this case and it was
not.

On the evidence the error, if any, was in the
acquittal on the charge of conspiracy and not in the conviction on the
substantive offence. The appellant was properly convicted and his acquittal on
the charge of conspiracy did not vitiate this conviction or give rise to any
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. This Court was not compelled to
defer to this acquittal for the purpose of quashing the conviction for fraud,
and was entitled to look at the facts behind the record of the acquittal. There
was no error in the conduct of this trial, the appellant was properly convicted
on the count of fraud and there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice.

It was doubtful as to whether there was in
this case any question of law which would give this Court jurisdiction under s.
597  of the Criminal Code . But it was not necessary to decide this.

Per Cartwright,
Ritchie and Hall JJ., dissenting: The trial judge ought to have told the
jury that if they acquitted the accused on either of these two counts they
should acquit him on both. It was impossible to see how the jury could
consistently acquit the appellant on the count of conspiracy and convict him on
the count of fraud. In the circumstances of this case if, as was the theory of
the Crown, the appellant aided the others in carrying out their dishonest
purposes he would have been guilty of conspiring with them and this was
negatived by the verdict of not guilty on the count of conspiracy which stands
unimpeached. The appellant could only be convicted on the count of fraud if the
jury were satisfied that he was acting in concert with the others. The
appellant was said to be guilty of acting together with three others, which was
of course conspiracy, while at the same time he was said to be not guilty of
conspiring with the three others. His conviction on the count of fraud was
inconsistent with his acquittal on the count of conspiracy and could not stand.

Per Ritchie
J., dissenting: The verdict of the jury on the conspiracy count
constituted a finding that three of the accused agreed to a plan to

[Page 214]

defraud but that the appellant, who was
familiar with the details of the plan, joined the others and played a vital
role in putting the plan into effect without having agreed to do so. The
verdict on the fraud count was inconsistent with the finding on the conspiracy
count. Before a conspiracy can be complete, there must be evidence both of
common design and of an agreement to carry that design into effect. If the
appellant had been a party to the conspiracy to defraud, then his acts of
participation in the perpetration of the fraud would have been an essential
part of the conduct which caused the common unlawful design to pass from the
stage of intention into that of action. As he was found not guilty of that
conspiracy, his acts could not have that quality and could not justify a
finding of guilty on the fraud count. The evidence against the appellant, if
believed, was only consistent with mutual consent between himself and the
others in the execution of their common unlawful design and the finding that
there was no such mutual consent carried with it the corollary that the
appellant could not have participated jointly with the others in the manner
alleged in the fraud count. It was strongly suggested that the jury treated the
acts of the appellant as being the acts of an aider and abettor rather than
being the innocent acts of courtesy which the appellant swore they were. This
suggestion could not be accepted. The two verdicts were irreconcilable on their
face and this Court could not inquire as to the underlying causes which may
have contributed to this inconsistency.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario affirmining the
appellant’s conviction for fraud. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright, Ritchie and
Hall JJ. dissenting.

G.A. Martin, Q.C., and E.P. Hartt, Q.C.,
for the appellant.

J.A. Hoolihan, for the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland, Judson and Spence JJ. was delivered by

SPENCE J.:—This is an appeal from the judgment
of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing the appeal by Henry Koury from
his conviction after a trial before Gale J. and jury upon a charge that Roy
Robertson, Henry Koury (the present appellant), Andre Begin and D. Charles
Stuart, in the month of March 1960, did obtain certain moneys therein set out
by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means. At the trial, these four
accused were charged in an indictment containing, inter alia, the
following counts:

1. The jurors for Her Majesty the Queen
present that Roy Robertson, Henry Koury, Andre Begin, and D. Charles Stuart in
or about

[Page 215]

the month of March, in the year 1960, at
the City of Toronto, in the County of York, did unlawfully by deceit, falsehood
or other fraudulent means, defraud Stadacona Mines (1944) Limited of valuable
securities, equipment and machinery, a cheque in the amount of $300,000 drawn
by Stadacona Mines (1944) Limited payable to Norado Mines Limited, $50,000 in
trust money, and choses in action, to the total value of approximately Three
Hundred Thousand ($300,000) Dollars, contrary to the Criminal Code .

* * *

5. The said jurors further present that the
said Roy Robertson, Henry Koury, Andre Begin and D. Charles Stuart, in or about
the months of January, February and March, in the year 1960, at the City of
Toronto, in the County of York, and elsewhere, did unlawfully conspire and
agree together and with one another to commit the indictable offence of fraud,
to wit: by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, to defraud Stadacona
Mines (1944) Limited of valuable securities, equipment and machinery, a cheque
in the amount of $300,000 drawn by Stadacona Mines (1944) Limited payable to
Norado Mines Limited, $50,000 in trust money, and choses in action, to the
total value of approximately Three Hundred Thousand ($300,000) Dollars contrary
to the Criminal Code .

All four of the accused were convicted on count
number 1. The three accused Robertson, Begin and Stuart were convicted on count
number 5 but Koury was acquitted on that count. On appeal to the Court of
Appeal for Ontario by all four
accused, the appeals were dismissed. Koury now appeals to this Court. Leave for
such appeal was granted under the provisions of s. 597(1)  (b) of the Criminal
Code  upon the following grounds:

1. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in holding that the
conviction of Koury on Count One was not inconsistent with his acquittal on
Count Five?

2. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in failing to hold that the
conviction of Koury on Count One was bad in law?

3. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in failing to hold that
there was no evidence by virtue of which the conviction of Koury on Count One
could be sustained consistently with the acquittal of Koury on Count Five?

Ground 2 does not state a question of law for
the consideration of this Court and the sole issue in this appeal is whether
the conviction of Koury with his three co-accused on count 1 should be set
aside as inconsistent with his acquittal on count 5.

The appellant submits that since he was acquitted
on the charge of conspiracy to commit the indictable offence, he could not be
convicted with others on a count of com-

[Page 216]

mitting that very offence. He also repeats in
this Court his submission made for the first time in the Court of Appeal that
the judge’s charge should have contained a direction to that effect. In my
opinion, the judge’s charge was correct in both fact and law and he was under
no compulsion to give this direction, which was not even asked for.

In spite of the complexity of detail and the
lengthy trial, the issue, as far as this person is concerned, can be stated in
a few words. The appellant says that at a certain time he withdrew from his
association with his co-accused, whatever that association may have amounted to
at that time, and that he took no further part in the scheme. But the evidence
shows that notwithstanding this protestation, he went on, together with the
other three co‑accused, to take part in the stripping of the valuable
assets of this company in return for worthless assets or promises. On this
evidence the jury properly convicted the appellant of fraud and had that count
stood alone, it could not have been set aside on appeal. We have, therefore,
this assumed position of error. This man participated in the commission of the
fraud but he did not conspire to commit the fraud.

The trial judge correctly instructed the jury on
counts 1 and 5 and he put to the jury the accused’s defence that he withdrew
from the association at a certain point of time and that he took no part in the
actual fraud except as a friendly bystander without criminal intent. In
acquitting the accused of conspiracy, the jury must have found that he withdrew
from the association before the conspiracy had been entered into, for the judge
made it very clear in his charge that the offence of conspiracy was complete
once the agreement was made.

On count 1 (the substantive offence) the judge
made it equally clear that the Crown had to show a conscious participation in a
common design and conscious and deliberate assistance between the aider and
abettor and the other persons. The case put against Koury on count 1 was that
he was an aider and abettor.

The two offences dealt within these two counts
are distinct and separate offences (The Queen v. Kravenia[1]). There is no inconsistency that
requires the quashing of the conviction of Koury on count 1 because of his
acquittal

[Page 217]

on count 5. As to the conviction on count 1,
there was ample evidence to support it. The recent case in the Court of
Criminal Appeal in England, Regina
v. Scaramanga[2], has
no application here. This accused was convicted on count 1 pursuant to a
correct instruction that it was necessary for the Crown to show a common intent
or design among all four accused in doing whatever the jury found they did.
Aiding and abetting pursuant to a common intent and design is not necessarily
the same thing as the conspiracy charged in count 5 and it is not the same
thing in this case. On this ground alone I would dismiss the appeal.

There are, however, broader implications in the
argument submitted in this case. The argument is that once it is shown on the
face of the record that there is an inconsistency then the quashing of the
conviction must follow automatically citing Regina v. Sweetland[3]. That theory of inconsistent
verdicts grew up at common law. I can well understand its application before
the constitution of a Court of Criminal Appeal when the only mode of review,
apart from the Court of Crown Cases Reserved, was the Writ of Error, which brought
before the reviewing tribunal only the indictment, the plea and the verdict.
With a vitiating inconsistency appearing on the face of this limited record,
all that the Court of Queen’s Bench could do was to quash the conviction.

But a case does not now come before a provincial
Court of Appeal on this limited record. We have, in addition, the Judge’s
charge to the jury and the whole of the evidence on which it is based. We can
also see in a limited way from the objections made to the charge, how defence
counsel wishes to have his defence put to the jury. A Court of Appeal has had
no difficulty in dealing with inconsistent convictions for theft, receiving and
obtaining by fraud relating to the same property; Kelly v. The King[4]. In the same way in Cox and Paton
v. The Queen[5], when
the accused were charged with conspiracy to steal and stealing, and conspiracy
to defraud and fraud in connection with the same property and were convicted by
the jury on all four counts, this Court decided, in affirming the Manitoba
Court of Appeal, that the offence disclosed was fraud and

[Page 218]

conspiracy to defraud and not theft. To the
extent indicated in these cases, the Court of Appeal then can sort out the
inconsistency.

The appellant, however, argues that this case is
different and that even if the Court may look at the complete proceedings the
verdicts are inconsistent. Four accused are jointly charged with doing the act
and the same four are jointly charged with conspiracy to do that very act. The
appellant says that in this situation it must be all or nothing and that he
cannot be found guilty of doing the act with others because the jury has found
that he did not conspire to do this act with them.

In my view, this argument adopts a wrong
interpretation of the judgment in Regina v. Sweetland, where Goddard
L.C.J. said at p. 66:

This Court is not laying down in this case,
and has no intention of allowing this case to be quoted as an authority for
saying, that, whenever a verdict of Not Guilty is returned on a count for conspiracy
to commit offences and Guilty on other counts in the same indictment charging
those specific offences, or contrariwise when a verdict of Guilty is returned
on the count of conspiracy and Not Guilty on the counts charging specific
offences, the verdict is necessarily inconsistent. Each case must depend on its
particular circumstances, and it is very dangerous in circumstances of this
sort to lay down general rules which could be quoted when the facts might be
entirely different.

To give effect to this submission would be to
ignore the common sense of the trial. Courts of Appeal do not now operate under
19th century procedural limitations. On the evidence that we can now examine,
the error, if any, is in the acquittal on the charge of conspiracy and not in
the conviction on the substantive offence. We can say with assurance that on
this record, which includes the whole of the evidence, the judge’s charge and
the objections of defence counsel to the charge, that this man was properly
convicted and that his acquittal on conspiracy does not vitiate this conviction
or give rise to any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. We are not
compelled to defer to this acquittal for the purpose of quashing the conviction
on fraud. We are not engaged in a process of logic chopping and we are entitled
to look at the facts behind the record of the acquittal.

It has been stated that there was error on the
part of the trial judge in not instructing the jury that they could not acquit
on conspiracy and at the same time bring in a

[Page 219]

verdict of guilty on the substantive offence.
This seems to me to ignore the theory put forward by the defence at the trial
and which the trial judge submitted to the jury. This was that the appellant
withdrew from association with his co-accused at a certain time before there
was any conspiracy and that he should be acquitted on this count. Further, the
defence submitted that the jury should find that he did not participate in the
commission of the fraud because he was merely there as a friendly bystander
without any criminal intent. The two defences had to be put together. There
would have been error if the judge had not instructed the jury along these
lines. The jury rejected one of these defences but gave effect to the other, which
merely means that they were saying that at a certain time this man did withdraw
from his association. I think that they were wrong in so finding in view of the
subsequent conduct of the accused but this makes no difference. I do not think
that the trial judge could have put it to the jury that it was all or nothing.

It was never put to the trial judge that he
should consider the possibility of inconsistent verdicts and instruct the jury
accordingly. Indeed, when the jury came back with these verdicts which are now
said to be inconsistent, he was not asked to instruct the jury to deal with the
supposed inconsistency. There was no error in the conduct of this trial and I
am prepared to decide (a) that the appellant was properly convicted on
count 1; (b) that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice.

The principle stated in Regina v. Sweetland, supra, that there is no general rule that whenever there is an acquittal on
a count of conspiracy to commit certain offences and a conviction on other
counts in the same indictment charging those specific offences, the verdict is
necessarily inconsistent, was never challenged in argument by the appellant. In
view of that principle, I have some doubt as to whether there is any question
of law which would give this Court jurisdiction under s. 597  of the Criminal
Code .

The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to have
allowed the appellant’s appeal, had it thought fit so to do, is defined in s.
592  of the Criminal Code . It could have done so if it were of the
opinion that:

(i) The verdict of the jury on count one
was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence.

[Page 220]

(ii) The judgment of the trial court should
be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law.

(iii) There was a miscarriage of justice.

There has been no submission that there was a
wrong decision on a question of law by the trial Court, other than the
suggestion, not made at the trial, that the jury ought to have been instructed
in the charge regarding the possibility of inconsistency of verdicts, which
submission I do not accept. The case before the Court of Appeal must have been
based upon the proposition that the verdict of the jury on count one was
unreasonable and could not be supported by the evidence in the light of the
appellant’s acquittal on count five.

Does the refusal of the Court of Appeal to allow
the appellant’s appeal on those grounds raise an issue of law?

This is not a case within those authorities
cited by the appellant in which one person has been found guilty of conspiracy
and all the other alleged conspirators have been acquitted, or in which one
person has been found guilty of being accessory to a murder when all of the
alleged murderers have been acquitted. In this case the law is that the verdict
of guilty of the specific offence is not necessarily inconsistent with an
acquittal on a charge of conspiracy to commit that offence. Whether or not the
verdict of guilty was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence
would appear to involve a decision, in the light of all the circumstances of
the case, on a question of mixed law and fact.

I do not, however, wish to express any final
opinion on this isue, particularly as it was not raised by the respondent and
consequently was not argued before us.

I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Cartwright, Ritchie and Hall JJ.
was delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—This
appeal is brought, pursuant to leave granted by this Court, from a unanimous
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal from the
conviction of the appellant before Gale J. and a jury at the Toronto assizes.

The trial commenced on March 19, 1962, and ended
on May 16, 1962.

[Page 221]

The appellant was indicted jointly with three
other persons, Robertson, Begin and Stuart. The indictment contained eight
counts in each of which the four accused were jointly charged.

Counts 1 and 5 with which we are chiefly
concerned read as follows:

1. The jurors for Her Majesty the Queen
present that Roy Robertson, Henry Koury, Andre Begin and D. Charles Stuart in
or about the month of March, in the year 1960, at the City of Toronto, in the
County of York, did unlawfully by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means,
defraud Stadacona Mines (1944) Limited of valuable securities, equipment and
machinery, a cheque in the amount of $300,000 drawn by Stadacona Mines (1944)
Limited payable to Norado Mines Limited, $50,000 in trust money, and choses in
action, to the total value of approximately Three Hundred Thousand ($300,000)
Dollars, contrary to the Criminal Code .

5. The said jurors further present that the
said Roy Robertson, Henry Koury, Andre Begin, and D. Charles Stuart in or about
the months of January, February, and March, in the year 1960, at the City of Toronto,
in the County of York, and elsewhere, did unlawfully conspire and agree
together and with one another to commit the indictable offence of fraud, to
wit: by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, to defraud Stadacona Mines
(1944) Limited of valuable securities, equipment and machinery, a cheque in the
amount of $300,000 drawn by Stadacona Mines (1944) Limited payable to Norado
Mines Limited, $50,000 in trust money, and choses in action, to the total value
of approximately Three Hundred Thousand ($300,000) Dollars contrary to the
Criminal Code .

It will be observed that the indictable offence
which it is alleged in count 5 that the four accused conspired to commit is the
substantive offence which it is charged in count 1 that they did commit.

Count 2 charged the four accused with having
defrauded Guaranty Trust Company of Canada of $50,000 in trust money. This is the same $50,000 as that
referred to in count 1. Count 2 was framed to cover the possibility of this
money at the time it was taken being regarded as the property of the Trust
Company rather than of Stadacona Mines (1944) Limited.

Counts 3 and 4 were alternative to counts 1 and
2, they charged theft (rather than fraud) in regard to the same property as was
described in counts 1 and 2.

Counts 6, 7 and 8 charged the four accused with
conspiring to commit the substantive offences charged in counts 2, 3 and 4.

The jury found all four of the accused guilty on
count 1, adding a recommendation for leniency as to Koury and

[Page 222]

Begin; they found Robertson, Begin and Stuart
guilty on count 5, adding a recommendation for leniency as to Begin; they found
the appellant not guilty on count 5; they found Stuart alone guilty on count 2;
on all the remaining counts ‘they found all the accused not guilty.

All of the accused appealed against their
convictions to the Court of Appeal. All of the appeals were dismissed. Koury
alone has appealed to this Court.

The questions of law upon which leave to appeal
to this Court was given are as follows:

1. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in holding that the
conviction of Koury on count one was not inconsistent with his acquittal on
count five?

2. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in failing to hold that the
conviction of Koury on count one was bad in law?

3. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in failing to hold that
there was no evidence by virtue of which the conviction of Koury on count one
could be sustained consistently with the acquittal of Koury on count five?

It is not necessary to state the facts at any
great length. Stadacona Mines (1944) Limited, hereinafter referred to as
“Stadacona”, was a mining company. Early in 1960 it no longer had a producing
property and was losing money. Prior to March 10, 1960, Robertson owned, or controlled
through other companies, 625,000 shares of Stadacona; this was said to be a
sufficient number of shares to give him working control of that company. He was
its president.

On the morning of March 10, 1960, Stadacona owned assets of
$368,196 consisting of the following:

Mining equipment valued at $35,000;

Negotiable securities valued at $40,000;

Accounts receivable in the form of call
loans owed to it almost entirely by the accused Robertson and his companies;
$175,000;

Cash deposited in a new bank account at the
Guaranty Trust Company, Toronto on March 10, 1960, $118,196.

By the end of that day Stadacona had parted with
all of the above-mentioned assets except $68,196. The main step by which this
was brought about was the making of a call loan by Stadacona to a company
called Norado Mines Limited, hereinafter referred to as “Norado”, which was
said to be without assets.

[Page 223]

On March 7, 1960, Koury, who had previously
controlled Norado, had turned over the control of that company to Stuart.

As a result of the transactions carried out on
March 10 (Robertson received in money, equipment, securities and by the
extinguishment of his indebtedness to Stadacona $250,000. For this he
transferred his 625,000 shares to Norado; these were said to be worth less than
$75,000; Norado which had no other assets paid for these shares with the money
loaned to it, without security, by Stadacona. The transaction was put through
by new directors of both companies, who had little business experience, and
were selected by Stuart. Shortly afterwards Stuart caused Norado to pay out to
him the $50,000 remaining in its bank account in the Guaranty Trust Company in
exchange for some mining claims stated to be of little value. As Stuart alone
was convicted on count 2 and all the accused were acquitted on count 6 the jury
must have taken the view that this last-mentioned transaction was that of
Stuart and that the other three accused were not involved in it.

In the negotiations between Robertson and Stuart
leading up to the main transaction above referred to Begin acted as Robertson’s
lawyer and Koury acted as Stuart’s lawyer. Koury from time to time consulted
Mr. Stirrett a solicitor in Toronto. It was the theory of Koury’s defence that as soon as Stirrett
advised him that the proposed transaction, and particularly the making of the
call loan of $300,000, was an improper one he dissociated himself from it and
that anything he did thereafter was done as a mere matter of courtesy. The
theory of the Crown, on the other hand, was that Koury took an active part in
the completion of the transaction and particularly that he co-operated in
arranging the necessary meetings, indicated the manner in which the call loan
to Norado should be authorized and assisted in carrying out the delivery of the
share certificates from Robertson to Stuart.

The charge of the learned trial judge was, of
necessity, a lengthy one. He made it clear to the jury that in his view it was
open to them to convict or to acquit Koury on count 1 and also on count 5. He
did not tell them that if they acquitted him on either of these counts they
should acquit him on both. With respect, in my opinion, he ought

[Page 224]

to have done so. After reading the opening
address to the jury of counsel for the Crown, the charge of the learned trial
judge and the relevant evidence which counsel for the appellant and for the
respondent called to our attention, I find it impossible to see how the jury
could consistently acquit the appellant on count 5 and convict him on count 1.

There is no evidence that Koury sought for
himself or obtained any part of the assets of which Stadacona was defrauded.
The theory of the Crown was that knowing the dishonest purposes of Robertson
and Stuart he aided them in carrying them out. If he did this, in the
circumstances of this case, he would have been guilty of conspiring with them
and that he did so conspire has been negatived by the verdict of not guilty on
count 5 which stands unimpeached.

It is well settled, and indeed I did not
understand it to be questioned in argument, that where an accused is convicted
on one charge and acquitted on another and the verdicts are inconsistent the
conviction cannot stand. Whether or not two verdicts are inconsistent depends
upon the particular circumstances of the case in which the question arises.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal was
delivered orally by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario at the conclusion of
the argument which had taken up four days. The question with which we are
concerned was dealt with as follows:

As to the accused Koury, it was argued on
his behalf,...secondly, that the conviction on count 1 was inconsistent with
the acquittal on count 5... As to the second contention, Mr. Martin
referred to and relied particularly and mainly upon the case of Regina v. Sweetland, 42 C.A.R. p. 62. It was made abundantly plain in that case that the
decision was reached on the particular facts and that the Court was not laying
down any principle of law. We are of the opinion that the facts in the case at
bar are different from those in the Sweetland case, 42 Cr. App. R. 62.
In our opinion the proper principles were stated in Rex v. Lenton (1947)
O.R. 155 at p. 161 and R. v. Kupferberg 13 Cr. App. R. 166 at
p. 168.

In R. v. Kupferberg[6], the conviction of the appellant was
at a trial subsequent to the one at which he had been acquitted of conspiracy.
The argument of the defence was based on a plea of autrefois acquit. There
appears to have been no direct reference to the rule that inconsistent verdicts
cannot stand or to an argument based on res judicata such,

[Page 225]

for example, as was dealt with in Sambasivam
v. Public Prosecutor, Federation of Malaya[7].
The passage in the judgment in Kupferberg’s case on which counsel
for the respondent relies is at p. 168 and reads as follows:

Counsel further contended that the
appellant was entitled successfully to plead autrefois acquit at the
second trial, because at the first trial he had been acquitted of certain
charges of conspiracy which were framed under the same Regulation as that which
formed the basis of the charges made against him at the second trial. That also
appears to the Court to be an erroneous contention. A charge of conspiracy is
not the same as one of aiding and abetting. It is true that in many cases aiding
and abetting is done by the mutual consent of the criminals, but it is not
essential that it should be. For a plea of autrefois acquit to be
maintainable, the offence of which the accused has been acquitted and that with
which he is charged must be the same in the sense that each must have the same
essential ingredients. The facts which constitute the one must be sufficient to
justify a conviction for the other. To prove conspiracy against the appellant,
it is necessary that an agreement, express or implied, should be proved to the
satisfaction of the jury, but it is quite unnecessary to prove such agreement
where the charge is one of aiding and abetting. In the latter case, it is only
necessary to show that the appellant appreciated what was going on and did
something to further it.

It seems clear that if the Court in Kupferberg’s
case had considered that the aiding and abetting by the accused was done
with the mutual consent of those who had been indicted with him on the
conspiracy count his appeal would have been allowed.

In the case at bar there is no room for the
suggestion that Koury gave any unsolicited aid or did anything to further the
perpetration of the fraud otherwise than with the consent of and in
co-operation with the other accused. Whenever he indicated a desire to withdraw
either Stuart or Begin or both of them pressed him to continue his assistance.

In Lenton’s case[8], the accused and one Hicks were charged
with conspiring to commit the indictable offence of forcibly seizing or
confining one Neilson and also with the substantive offence of unlawfully
seizing and confining him. Both the accused and Hicks were acquitted on the
conspiracy count and convicted of the substantive offence. The part played by
the accused was confined to the sending of telegrams. He first learned of the
matter after Neilson had been

[Page 226]

seized and confined. Following the receipt of a
telegram from one Schmaltz reading:

 Arrived Jackfish met nine scabs aboard
train they return with J. Osipindo union men steamer Kenora has 26 scabs aboard
they hollered ‘from boat they were locked aboard two days we hold company man
F. Neilson Steamer Kenora gone out to anchor advice immediately what to do
urgent two steamers in bay boys are under pressure to sail contact police.

the accused sent a telegram to Hicks reading:

Hold official stop have two pickets inform
citizens of our case stop request them wire Minister of Justice to take action
stop hold the fort we are taking case to R.C.M.P. and will swear out warrant
stop excellent work.

The only passage in the reasons touching the
question with which we are concerned reads as follows:

As to the first point, it was quite open to
the jury to find that although appellant and his alleged co-conspirators
arrived at no common agreement to commit the indictable offences as charged,
yet appellant, within the meaning of s. 69 of the Code, and independently of
any conspiracy counselled or procured the confining of Neilson. Upon the
evidence there is no inconsistency in these findings. Even accepting
appellant’s own evidence as to the contents of the telegram of 6.55 a.m., it
was quite open to the jury to believe that appellant was counselling or
procuring Hicks to detain Neilson in the complete absence of any conspiracy
between them to bring about such detention.

The Court amended the conviction to read guilty
of unlawfully confining Neilson instead of guilty of unlawfully and forcibly
seizing and confining Neilson.

It seems obvious that the accused could not have
been a party to a conspiracy to bring about Neilson’s detention since that had
been brought about before the accused was brought into the matter at all. I
cannot find that this judgment enunciates any principle helpful in the decision
of the case at bar.

In R. v. Sweetland[9], Lord Goddard, giving the judgment
of the Court of Criminal Appeal, said at p. 66:

This Court is not laying down in this case,
and has no intention of allowing this case to be quoted as an authority for
saying, that, whenever a verdict of Not Guilty is returned on a count for
conspiracy to commit offences and Guilty on other counts in the same indictment
charging those specific offences, or contrariwise when a verdict of Guilty is
returned on the count of conspiracy and Not Guilty on the counts charging
specific offences, the verdict is necessarily inconsistent. Each case must
depend on its particular circumstances, and it is very dangerous in
circumstances of

[Page 227]

this sort to lay down general rules which
could be quoted when the facts might be entirely different.

At p. 68 the Lord Chief Justice said:

It may be that this matter would have been
cleared up if the Recorder had told the jury to consider their verdict further.
As he did not do so, we think that Mr. Clarke is justified in saying that
in this particular case there does appear to be on the face of it an
inconsistency in the verdict. Persons are said to be guilty of acting together,
which is of course, conspiracy, in obtaining cheques by false pretences while
at the same time they are said to be not guilty of conspiring to obtain them by
false pretences.

In the case at bar Koury could only be convicted
on count 1 if the jury were satisfied that he was acting in concert with the
other accused. There is no suggestion in the evidence that he committed some
independent act of fraud on Stadacona and had there been such evidence he could
not have been convicted of that independent act on a count charging him jointly
with the other three accused who were convicted. The authorities on this point
are collected in the recent judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, delivered
by Lord Parker of Waddington, in R. v. Scaramanga[10]. The effect of the judgment is
summarized in the following paragraph at p. 220:

In our judgment, except where provided by
statute, when two persons are jointly charged with one offence, judgment cannot
stand against both of them on a finding that an offence has been committed by
each independently.

The circumstances of the case at bar appear to
me to fall directly within the last sentence quoted above from the judgment of
Lord Goddard at p. 68 of Sweetland’s case. Adapting his words to the
facts of the case before us, Koury is said to be guilty of acting together with
Robertson, Begin and Stuart, which is of course conspiracy, in defrauding
Stadacona while at the same time he is said to be not guilty of conspiring with
Robertson, Begin and Stuart to defraud Stadacona. In my opinion the conviction
of Koury on count 1 is inconsistent with his acquittal on count 5 and cannot
stand.

When these two inconsistent verdicts were
rendered it would have been proper for the learned trial judge to have given
the jury a further direction, pointing out the inconsistency, and to have sent
them back to reconsider their

[Page 228]

verdicts as to Koury on counts 1 and 5. Had this
course been followed no one can say what the result would have been.

I would allow the appeal, direct that the
verdict finding the appellant guilty on count 1 of the indictment be quashed
and that a verdict of acquittal be entered.

RITCHIE J. (dissenting):—The facts giving
rise to this appeal have been fully set forth in the reasons of other members
of the Court and I will endeavour not to repeat more of what they have said
than is absolutely necessary for the purpose of making my views clear.

Having regard to the charge of the learned trial
judge and to those parts of the evidence to which our attention was directed by
both counsel, I am of opinion that the verdict of the jury on count 5 of this
indictment constitutes a finding that three of the accused agreed to a plan for
defrauding the Stadacona Mines (1944) Limited but that the fourth (the
appellant) who was familiar with the details of the plan, joined the others and
played a vital role in putting the plan into effect without having agreed to do
so. The verdict on count 1, which means that the appellant’s acts of
co-operation in the perpetration of the fraud were acts done in furtherance of
a common unlawful intent to defraud, is, in my opinion, inconsistent with the
finding on the conspiracy count.

There can be no doubt that a clear distinction
exists between the crime of conspiracy to commit an indictable offence and the
crime of committing that offence, and it is also clear to me that a man who has
been tried and acquitted of conspiracy to commit an offence could later, when
tried alone, be properly convicted of having aided and abetted in the
commission of the same offence, providing that the acts of those participating
in its commission were not so inter-dependent as to be consistent only with
their having been the product of pre‑arrangement between the
participants. (See Rex v. Kupferberg[11];
Preston v. The
King[12]).

It is to be observed also that where two people
are tried together on two counts—one of conspiracy and the other of committing
the substantive offence—there is not necessarily any inconsistency in a verdict
which acquitted them

[Page 229]

both of conspiracy and found one only to be
guilty of the substantive offence. In such a case the verdict is consistent
with the crime having been committed by one alone and with there having been no
conspiracy. (See the recent case of Anandagoda v. The Queen[13]).

The most frequently quoted definition of
conspiracy is that to be found in the reasons for judgment of Willes J. in Mulcahy
v. The Queen[14], where
he said:

A conspiracy consists, not merely in the
intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or more to do an unlawful
act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. So long as such a design rests in
intention only it is not indictable. When two agree to carry it into effect,
the very plot is an act in itself and the act of each of the parties, promise
against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being enforced if
lawful, punishable if for a criminal object, or for the use of criminal means.

This definition has frequently been cited in
support of the proposition that before the conspiracy can be complete there
must be evidence both of common design and of an agreement to carry that design
into effect. It is, however, well to remember what was said by Lord Alverston
in Rex v. Tibbets[15], where
he commented on the Mulcahy definition in the following terms:

It is plain that the very learned Judge was
there speaking of a case in which the criminal intention has not been carried
into effect, and he says that in such a case the very promise to do—such a
promise as would be binding for a lawful purpose—is an act which negatives the
suggestion that the matter rests in intention only. He never said that when the
unlawful purpose had been carried out no indictment for conspiracy can be
maintained unless a concerted action has been preceded by such a contract
between the conspirators as if the purpose had been lawful, would have given
ground for a lawsuit. His definition is not of conspiracy, but of a kind of
conduct which is sufficient to make the concerted action pass from the stage of
intention into that of action.

If the appellant had been a party to the
conspiracy to defraud for which his co-accused were convicted, then his acts of
participation in the perpetration of the fraud itself would, as I see it, have
been a part, and an essential part, of the conduct which caused the common
unlawful design of the conspirators to pass from the stage of intention into
that of action. As he has been found not guilty of that conspiracy, his acts
cannot have that quality and if they were not acts done in furtherance of the
common unlawful intent

[Page 230]

and design to which his fellow defrauders had
been found to have agreed, then they cannot, in my view, justify a finding of
guilty on the first count of the indictment.

If the appellant had withdrawn from the
conspiracy and rejoined it in time to assist in knowingly carrying out its
illegal object, then his participation would, in my opinion, have made him a
co-conspirator and the finding that he had no part in the conspiracy could
therefore in my view, only be justified on the basis of his active
participation having been innocent and devoid of fraudulent intent.

The evidence against the appellant, if believed,
was, in my opinion, only consistent with mutual consent between himself and his
fellow accused in the execution of their common unlawful design and, as I have
indicated, the finding that there was no such mutual consent carries with it
the corollary that the appellant cannot have participated jointly with his co‑accused
in the manner alleged in count 1.

It was strongly suggested by counsel for the
respondent that the verdict should be construed as an acceptance by the jury of
the accused’s story that he had withdrawn from the conspiracy before the fraud
was actually perpetrated, but that they treated the acts which he thereafter
performed in furtherance of the common unlawful design as being the acts of an
aider and abettor rather than being the innocent acts of courtesy which the
appellant swore that they were. It appears to me, as I have indicated, that the
verdicts on counts 1 and 5 are irreconcilable on the face of it and I do not
feel competent to inquire as to the underlying causes which may have contributed
to this inconsistency.

In the case of Rex v. Cooper and Compton[16], the jury had returned a verdict
finding the appellants guilty on a count charging conspiracy but not guilty on
several other counts charging the commission of the substantive offences involved
in the conspiracy. Having regard to the circumstances disclosed in the
evidence, the Court of Criminal Appeal found the verdicts to be unreasonable
and in the course of his reasons for judgment Humphreys J. said:

The learned Judge then said to counsel for
the defence: “As I understand the verdict... what they have found is that there
was a conspiracy existing between these two men to steal in the course of their
duties, but that they are agreed, so far as the particular instances before the
court are

[Page 231]

concerned, that conspiracy was not in fact
carried out”, and counsel for the defence said that that was the way he
understood the verdict.

That is the way in which the verdict has
been construed in this court, and it may be that it is correct, but this court
takes the view, and always has taken the view, that we are not prepared to
speculate on what a jury meant by a verdict which they have returned. We can
only deal with the actual language used by the jury in returning the verdict.
In the course of the argument a number of theories have been put forward on
what the jury may have thought. We do not join in that speculation. All we can
say is that the jury have said in terms: “We are not satisfied with the case
for the prosecution on counts 2 to 9. We are satisfied with the case for the
prosecution on count 1”, and they returned verdicts accordingly.

These observations, in my opinion, apply to the
consideration of the jury’s verdict in the present case.

For these reasons as well as those stated in the
reasons for judgment of my brother Cartwright, I would allow this appeal and
direct that the matter be disposed of in the manner proposed by him.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Capital murder—Deliberate
and planned—Instructions to jury—Whether deliberation negatived by provocation
and drunkenness—Whether necessary to charge jury in accordance with Hodge's
case on issue of planning and deliberation—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c.
51, ss. 201, 202A(2)(a), 203.

The appellant was convicted of capital murder of his brother.
There was evidence that on the day in question the brothers had been drinking
and had quarrelled over a girl. The appellant obtained a gun from a friend,
waited sometime for his brother to come out of the house and shot and killed
him. The Court of Appeal having directed a new trial, the Crown was granted
leave to appeal to this Court on the questions (1) as to whether the trial
judge erred in failing to point out to the jury that deliberation might have
been negatived by provocation and drunkenness; and (2) as to whether the jury
should have been instructed respecting the rule in Hodge's case.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Martland, Ritchie,
Hall and Spence JJ.: The charge of the trial judge was defective in the failure
to bring the questions of provocation and drunkenness to the attention of the
jury upon the issue of planning and deliberation. In determining whether the
accused committed the crime of capital murder, the jury

[Page 472]

should have available and should be directed to consider all
the circumstances including not only the evidence of the accused actions but of
his condition, his state of mind as affected by either real or even imagined
insults and provoking actions of the victim and by the accused consumption of
alcohol. This is a finding of fact. The jury should have been instructed upon
provocation and drunkenness when the trial judge was dealing with murder,
whether capital or non-capital, under s. 201 of the Code. Then, with clear
indication that he was passing on to the other and important matter of the
additional ingredient needed to establish capital murder, the trial judge
should have brought the jury's attention to all relevant evidence to determine
whether the murder was planned and deliberate. Such a procedure is necessary to
illustrate to the jury the absolute necessity of considering the evidence
firstly upon the issue of intent and the ameliorating provision as to
provocation and then again, only if they find against the accused on the first
issue, upon the issue of planning and deliberation. It could not be said, despite
other evidence pointing strongly to the conclusion that the murder was planned
and deliberate, that the jury might not at least have found a reasonable doubt
that the accused might have acted in a frenzy and in such a highly emotional
state influenced by intoxication so that it would not be planned and deliberate
on his part.

Even though the evidence in respect of the issue of planning
and deliberation was circumstantial, the trial judge was not required to
instruct the jury in accordance with the rule in Hodge's case. In that
case the direction was concerned only with the identification of the accused as
being the person who had committed the crime. The rule is concerned with
evidence as to the commission of an act. These instructions did not apply and
were never intended to apply to the issue here. The task of a jury which is
required to consider whether a murder is capital or not, is entirely different.
Before it is called upon to determine the issue of planning and deliberation,
it must already have reached the conclusion, beyond a reasonable doubt, that
the accused has committed murder. It is then called upon to decide whether the
murder was planned and deliberate and not whether the accused committed the
act. It must consider the whole of the evidence in relation to the issue of
planning and deliberation. The charge to be given by the judge to the jury with
respect to this issue is that it must consider all the evidence before it,
aided by his instruction as to what evidence is indicative of planning and
deliberation and what indicates the contrary, including circumstances and
conditions affecting the capacity and ability to plan and deliberate. Having
weighed the evidence, the jury can only reach a verdict of capital murder if
satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the murder was planned and
deliberate.

Per Cartwright J.: The jury should have been instructed
on the issue of planning and deliberation in accordance with the rule in Hodge's
case. Having reached the conclusion that the accused was guilty of murder, the
jury was then called upon to inquire whether the murder was planned and
deliberate. There was ample evidence to support findings by the jury that the
murder was planned and deliberate; but all of this evidence was circumstantial.
Whether a murder is planned and whether it is deliberate are both questions of
fact which involve an inquiry into the state of mind of the accused at the
relevant time. The key word in the rule in Hodge's case is
""rational"". The jury could not find a verdict of capital murder
unless convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the only rational conclusion
from the facts established by

[Page 473]

the whole of the evidence was that the killing was planned and
deliberate.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], directing a new trial on a charge of capital
murder. Appeal dismissed.

W. G. Burke-Robertson,
Q.C., for the appellant.

John E. Spencer, for the
respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau C.J.
and Fauteux, Martland, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was delivered by

SPENCE J.:—This is an appeal by
the Crown from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[2] pronounced on November 7, 1963, allowing an appeal from the conviction by the Honourable Mr. Justice
MacLean on September 6, 1963, upon the findings of a jury. The accused was
convicted of capital murder contra the Criminal Code , s. 202A(2) 
(a). The Court of Appeal of British
 Columbia directed a new trial. 

The appeal was by leave granted
by this Court on December 9, 1963, upon the following questions:

(a) Did the Court of
Appeal for British Columbia err in holding that the Learned Trial Judge should
have told the jury that even if they rejected provocation as a defence to
murder generally it was open to them to consider provocation as negativing
deliberation and as a defence reducing capital murder to non-capital murder?

(b) Did the Court of Appeal for British Columbia err in
holding that the Learned Trial Judge should have told the jury that they might
consider evidence of the Respondent's drinking as showing that his passions had
been inflamed by alcohol and therefore had a bearing on the important element
of deliberation and as a defence reducing capital murder to non-capital murder
and in failing to point out to the jury that deliberation might be negatived by
drunkenness falling short of incapacity to form the intent to kill?

(c) Did the Court of Appeal for British Columbia err in
holding that the Learned Trial Judge should have charged the jury on the rules
relating to circumstantial evidence as set out in Hodge's case (1883) 168 E.R.
1186?

Whittaker J.A., with whom Davey
and Sheppard JJ.A. agreed, gave reasons for allowing the appeal from the
conviction upon the basis that the trial judge in his charge failed to direct
the jury properly upon the issue of whether the murder had been ""planned
and deliberate"" as those

[Page 474]

words are used in s. 202A(2)  (a).
Tysoe J.A. also delivered reasons for judgment in which he came to the same
conclusion as Whittaker J.A. upon that issue but added that the charge of the
learned trial judge was defective in that it did not contain the appropriate
instruction upon circumstantial evidence as outlined in Hodge's case[3].
Sheppard J.A. disagreed with the latter conclusion and Whittaker J.A. did not
deem it necessary to express any view thereon.

It must be realized that the
learned trial judge did not have the advantage of the reasons for judgment of
this Court in More v. The Queen[4],
only delivered on July 23, 1963, and first reported in October 1963, when he charged
the jury at this trial on September 6,1963. In the More case, this Court
dealt with the circumstance that the evidence of two doctors as to the mental
condition of the accused, which stopped far short of diagnosing him as insane within
the meaning of s. 16(2)  of the Criminal Code , was to all intent and
purpose removed from the consideration of the jury by the trial judge in his
charge. Cartwright J. said at p. 534:

The evidence of the two
doctors is not relied on by the defence as raising the question whether the
accused was legally sane. Its importance is that it would assist the jury in
deciding the question whether the accused's action in pulling the trigger,
which so far as this branch of the matter is concerned was admittedly the
intentional act of a sane man, was also his deliberate act. The question is one
of fact and its solution involves an inquiry as to the thinking of the accused
at the moment of acting. If the jury accepted the evidence of the doctors it,
in conjunction with the accused's own evidence, might well cause them to regard
it as more probable that the accused's final act was prompted by sudden impulse
rather than by consideration. On this question the accused was entitled to have
the verdict of a properly instructed jury.

In a judgment of Ritchie J. in Regina
v. McMartin[5]
(delivered at the same time as are the reasons of the Court in this appeal), he
said at p. 13:

In my opinion, without the
evidence of the appellant's mental history and condition, it cannot be said
that all the circumstances bearing on the question of whether the murder was
planned and deliberate have been passed upon by a jury, and I would accordingly
allow this appeal, quash the conviction and direct that there be a new trial.

I am of the opinion that the
judgments in these two cases have as their ratio decidendi the principle that
in determining whether the accused committed the crime of capital

[Page 475]

murder in that it was
""planned and deliberate on the part of such person"" the jury should
have available and should be directed to consider all the circumstances
including not only the evidence of the accused's actions but of his condition,
his state of mind as affected by either real or even imagined insults and
provoking actions of the victim and by the accused's consumption of alcohol.
There is no doubt this is a finding of fact. The questions which the jury must
decide and decide beyond reasonable doubt before they may convict the accused
of capital murder under the relevant subsection, section 202A(2)  (a),
are: Was the murder which he committed planned and was it deliberate? I
separate the jury's problem in that form because I am in complete agreement
with Whittaker J.A. when he said: ""It is possible to imagine a murder to
some degree planned and yet not deliberate."" Therefore, to determine
whether the charge to the jury delivered by the learned trial judge was
adequate in submitting to them the issue of planning and deliberation the
charge must be examined with some care.

It should be stated at once that
the charge so far as it dealt with provocation under s. 203 and with
drunkenness as it affects murder under the doctrine in Director of Public
Prosecutions v. Beard[6]
was, with respect, excellent. That, however, I believe, is not sufficient. The
jury should have been instructed upon those topics when the trial judge was
dealing with murder, whether capital or non-capital, under s. 201. Then, with
clear indication that he was passing on to the other and important matter of
the additional ingredient needed to establish capital murder under s. 202A(2) 
(a), the learned trial judge should have brought the jury's
attention to all relevant evidence to determine whether the murder was planned
and deliberate on the part of the accused, and therefore, capital murder. I am
the first to agree that such a charge is difficult, onerous and may be, unless
great care is exercised, somewhat repetitive, and no attempt should be made to
force charges to the jury into an inflexible mould, yet I believe some such procedure
is necessary to illustrate to the jury the absolute necessity of considering
the evidence firstly upon the issue of intent and the ameliorating provision as
to provocation and then again, only if they find against the accused on the
first issue, upon

[Page 476]

the issue of planning and
deliberation. I adopt upon this latter issue the statement of Tysoe J.A. in his
reasons:

Our concern is with quite a
different matter, namely, the effect of the drinking of the appellant and of
the deceased's provocative conduct on the mind and mental processes of the
appellant in his then condition in relation to the issue of planning and
deliberation on his part.

It might be preferable, in
discussing insults and the accused's state of mind as they affected deliberation,
to avoid the use of the word ""provocation"" as that word would, in the
mind of the jury, be associated with the exact technical sense in which the
word is utilized in s. 203. Such circumstances have a broader and less exact
scope in the determination of whether the murder was deliberate.

It is true that the learned trial
judge in the charge, after defining ""planned"" and
""deliberate"", said:

Now these two words must be
read together, the meaning of one colours the meaning of the other, planned and
deliberate. The circumstances must be such that there was time for the
conception of a plan to deliberately kill, and it is for you to say whether in
the circumstances of the case there was such time.

Planned and deliberate
conceives a killing not done under the stress of sudden passion or sudden
emotion. Therefore before the accused can be found guilty of capital murder the
Crown must not only prove that the accused is guilty of murder, as I have
defined and explained it to you already, but must further prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the murder was planned and deliberate on his part.

And shortly thereafter in
reciting the various actions of the accused which the jury could consider in
determining whether the murder were planned and deliberate, he said:

Now there was an argument
between Harvey and the accused in the kitchen with regard to
Corinne.

I am of the opinion that this
reference to the conduct of the victim upon the issue of whether the murder was
deliberate on the part of the accused is too slight under the circumstances and
I subscribe to the opinion of Whittaker J.A. when he said:

The jury were not told that
even if they rejected provocation as a defence to murder generally, it was open
to them to consider provocation as negativing deliberation and as a defence
reducing capital murder to non-capital. I think this should have been put to
them divorced from the somewhat complicated provisions of the Code which deal
with provocation reducing murder to manslaughter.

The learned trial judge, as I
have said, adequately instructed the jury on the issue of drunkenness as it
affected

[Page 477]

the question of intent under s.
201 but again I am in agreement with Whittaker J.A. when he said:

The learned Judge was, of
course, dealing with drunkenness as a defence to murder generally, but it was
not anywhere suggested in the charge that the jury might consider the evidence
of drink as showing that appellant's passions had been inflamed by alcohol and,
therefore, having a bearing on the important element of deliberation and as a
defence reducing capital murder to non-capital. Nor was it pointed out that
deliberation might be negatived by drunkenness falling short of incapacity to
form the intent to kill, if the jury thought such a finding supported by the
evidence.

I have, therefore, concluded that
the charge of the learned trial judge was defective in the failure to bring
these elements to the attention of the jury upon the issue of planning and
deliberation and I cannot say, despite other evidence pointing strongly to the
conclusion that the murder was planned and deliberate, that the jury might not
at least have found a reasonable doubt that the accused might have acted in a
frenzy and in such a highly emotional state influenced by intoxication so that
it would not be planned and deliberate on his part. I therefore would answer
both questions (a) and (b) in the order granting leave to appeal in the
negative.

In the Court below, three of the
five judges considered the question as to whether, in respect of the issue of planning
and deliberation, the jury should have been charged in accordance with the rule
in Hodge's case[7]. Tysoe
J.A., with whom Bird J.A. concurred, was of the opinion that, since the
evidence on this issue was circumstantial, the jury should have been so
charged. Sheppard J.A. took the view that the evidence in respect of the issue
was direct, and it was, therefore, unnecessary so to charge the jury. No
opinion was expressed by the other two members of the Court.

The issue is an important one.
Planning and deliberation involve the exercise of mental processes. Because of
that, in almost every case where a jury is required to reach a conclusion as to
whether or not a murder was planned and deliberate on the part of the accused,
it must reach a conclusion on the basis of evidence which is circumstantial.
Does the fact that evidence is circumstantial necessarily require that an
instruction be given to the jury in accordance with that which was given in Hodge's
case?

[Page 478]

To answer this question it is desirable
to recall just what were the circumstances of Hodge's case. The report
states that the prisoner was charged with murder, the case was one of
circumstantial evidence altogether, and contained no one fact which, taken
alone, amounted to a presumption of guilt.

Baron Alderson told the jury that
the case was made up of circumstances entirely; and that, before they could
find the prisoner guilty, they must be satisfied, ""not only that those
circumstances were consistent with his having committed the act, but they must
also be satisfied that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person"".

It is quite clear that this
direction was concerned only with the identification of the accused as being
the person who had committed the crime. A murder had been committed. There was
some circumstantial evidence which implicated the accused. One of the tasks of
the jury was to decide whether the accused was the man who had perpetrated the
crime. The direction given by Baron Alderson was to instruct the jury as to how
far the evidence must go in order to warrant a decision that the accused was
the person who had ""committed the act"".

The rule in Hodge's case
was stated in the same way, in this Court, by Chief Justice Duff in Comba v.
The King[8],
and it has been referred to in several other decisions of this Court. By its
own terms, however, the rule is concerned with evidence as to the commission of
an act. In my opinion, that limitation is a proper one. A criminal charge is
laid as a result of the commission of a certain act or certain acts. If the
evidence against the accused is circumstantial in character, then a jury should
only find him guilty in respect of those acts if consistent with his having committed
them and inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that he did.

The task of a jury which is
required to consider whether a murder is capital or not, is entirely different.
Before it is ever called upon to determine the issue of planning and
deliberation it must already have reached the conclusion, beyond a reasonable
doubt, that the accused has committed murder. What it is now called upon to
decide is not whether the accused committed the act, but whether the murder, of

[Page 479]

which he is guilty, was planned
and deliberate on his part. The pattern of evidence which it must now consider
is not a series of facts, which, in order to establish guilt, must lead to a
single conclusion. The jury is now concerned with the mental processes of a
person who has committed a crime. In relation to that crime it has to consider
his actions, his conduct, his statements, and his capacity and ability to plan
and deliberate. It must consider the whole of the evidence in relation to the
issue of planning and deliberation. In nearly every case some of this evidence
may indicate planning and deliberation and some may indicate the contrary. The
jury must weigh all of this evidence and arrive at a conclusion.

With respect to this issue, in my
opinion, the charge to be given by the judge to the jury is that it must
consider all of the evidence before it, aided by his instruction as to that
evidence which is indicative of planning and deliberation and that, including
circumstances and conditions affecting the capacity and ability to plan and
deliberate, which indicates the contrary, and that, having weighed the
evidence, it can only reach a verdict of capital murder if satisfied, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that the murder committed by the accused was planned and also
was deliberate on his part.

This does not, in the slightest
degree, reduce the onus of proof which rests upon the Crown in criminal cases
and does not substitute any other rule. The direction in Hodge's case
did not add to or subtract from the requirement that proof of guilt in a
criminal case must be beyond a reasonable doubt. It provided a formula to
assist in applying the accepted standard of proof in relation to the first only
of the two essential elements in a crime; i.e., the commission of the act as
distinct from the intent which accompanied that act. The first element,
assuming every circumstance could be established by evidence, would be capable
of proof to a demonstration. The latter element, save perhaps out of the mouth
of the accused himself, could never be so proved. The circumstances which
establish the former not only can be, but must be consistent with each other,
as otherwise a reasonable doubt on the issue arises. The circumstances which
establish the latter, being evidence personal to one individual, will seldom,
if ever, be wholly consistent with only one conclusion as to his mental state
and yet the weight of evidence on the issue may be such as to satisfy the jury,

[Page 480]

beyond a reasonable doubt, as to
the guilty intent of the accused. The instruction of Baron Alderson in Hodge's
case does not apply and was never intended to apply to an issue of this kind.

For the reasons which I have
outlined, I am of the opinion that Tysoe J.A., with whom Bird J.A. agreed, was
in error in the view which he expressed in his reasons and I would answer
question (c) in the affirmative. However, being of the opinion that questions
(a) and (b) should be answered in the negative, I would dismiss the appeal.

CARTWRIGHT J.:—The questions on
which leave to appeal was granted are set out in the reasons of my brother
Spence, which I have had the advantage of reading.

I agree with the view which he
expresses as to the manner in which it will generally be advisable for a trial
judge to instruct the jury in regard to the proper way in which to deal with
the question whether a murder, which they find was committed by the accused,
was ""planned and deliberate"".

The appeal can succeed only if we
give an affirmative answer to all three of the questions on which leave to
appeal has been granted.

I do not find it necessary to
express a final opinion on questions (a) and (b). The defects in the charge
which are said to require a negative answer to these questions are the alleged
failure of the learned trial judge to call to the attention of the jury the
possible effect of the evidence as to drunkenness and provocation on the
questions, (i) whether the accused was capable of planning and of deliberate
action, (ii) whether he did in fact plan, and (iii) whether his action in
firing the fatal shot was in fact a deliberate one.

It is true that the judge did not
direct the jury specifically in relation to the possible effect of the evidence
as to drunkenness and provocation on the answers they should make to these
questions although he had dealt adequately with that evidence in discussing the
differences between murder and manslaughter. On the other hand he directed the
jury clearly on the meaning of the words ""planned and deliberate"" and
emphasized the onus lying on the Crown to prove both planning and deliberate
action beyond a reasonable doubt.

[Page 481]

The reasons of the members of
this Court in More v. The Queen[9],
referred to in the reasons of my brother Spence, must be read in the light of
the peculiar facts of that particular case, in which the accused had given
evidence to the effect that over the course of some days he had contemplated
taking the lives of his wife and himself and had made preparations to do this,
but that, at the last moment, while still in a state of indecision and
distress, he had fired the fatal shot without conscious volition and without
realizing that he was doing so.

I incline to the view that the
absence of any evidence similar to that given in More v. The Queen
differentiates that case from the case at bar; but, as already indicated, I do
not find it necessary to reach a final conclusion on questions (a) and (b). The
reason for this is that, in my opinion, question (c) should be answered in the
negative.

In considering question (c), it
is to be assumed that the jury have reached the conclusion that the accused
caused the death of his victim, that he intended to cause his death, that the
circumstances were not such as to reduce the offence to manslaughter and that,
consequently, the accused is guilty of murder. It is only when the jury have
reached this conclusion that it becomes necessary for them to proceed to the
further inquiry whether the murder was planned and deliberate on the part of
the accused.

As there is to be a new trial in
the case at bar it is desirable to say no more about the evidence than is
necessary to make clear the reasons for decision. It is, I think, sufficient to
say in this case that there was ample evidence to support findings by the jury
that the murder was planned on the part of the accused and that his act in
firing the fatal shot was deliberate, that is to say was considered rather than
impulsive; but it is clear that all of this evidence was circumstantial.

It is equally clear that the
questions whether the murder was planned and whether it was the deliberate act
of the accused are both questions of fact, the solution of which involves an
inquiry into the state of mind of the accused at the relevant time.

[Page 482]

In Edgington v. Fitzmaurice[10],
Bowen L.J. said:

There must be a misstatement
of an existing fact: but the state of a man's mind is as much a fact as the
state of his digestion. It is true that it is very difficult to prove what the
state of a man's mind at a particular time is, but if it can be ascertained it
is as much a fact as anything else.

In Clayton v. Ramsden[11],
Lord Wright said:

States of mind are capable
of proof like other matters of fact.

In Lizotte v. The Queen[12],
there is the following passage in the unanimous judgment of the Court:

Hodge's case was a case where all the evidence against the
accused was circumstantial. It is argued that the direction there prescribed is
not necessary in a case where there is direct evidence against the accused as
well as circumstantial evidence. However that may be, it is my opinion that
where the proof of any essential ingredient of the offence charged depends upon
circumstantial evidence it is necessary that the direction be given.

There is no doubt that an
affirmative finding of fact that the murder was planned and deliberate on the
part of the accused is essential to a conviction of capital murder where, as in
this case, the charge is based on s. 202A(2)  (a) of the Criminal
Code .

It is argued, however, that
although all the evidence put forward to support that essential finding of fact
is circumstantial it is unnecessary and indeed, if I have understood the
argument correctly, undesirable for the trial judge to instruct the jury on
this issue in accordance with the rule in Hodge's case[13].

The substance of that rule is that,
in a criminal case, where proof of any issue of fact essential to the case of
the Crown consists of circumstantial evidence it is the duty of the judge to
instruct the jury that before they can find the accused guilty they must be
satisfied not only that the circumstances are consistent with an affirmative
finding on the issue so sought to be proved but that the circumstances are
inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. In my opinion this rule is one
not merely of prudent practice but of positive law.

I do not pause to examine the
long line of cases in which the rule is formulated because, apart altogether
from those authorities, the rule appears to me to follow inevitably as

[Page 483]

a corollary of the rule that the
jury must not convict unless they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of
the guilt of the accused.

In the case at bar, for example,
no one would question the assertion that the jury must not convict the accused
of capital murder unless satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that his act in
firing the fatal shot was deliberate in the sense of being considered rather
than impulsive. Suppose that the jury had returned a special verdict in the
following words:—""We are all satisfied that the prisoner is guilty of
murder; as to whether he is guilty of capital murder we are all satisfied that
the circumstances which we find proved are consistent with the view that the
prisoner's act in firing was deliberate and that it is highly probable that it
was deliberate but we are all also of opinion that those circumstances are not
rationally inconsistent with the view that his act was impulsive and not
deliberate"". I think it clear that on such a verdict the Court could
record a conviction of murder only and not a conviction of capital murder.

The key word in the rule in Hodge's
case is ""rational"". How, it may be asked, can the proof of
circumstances which are rationally consistent with the innocence of the accused
establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt? How can the proof of circumstances
rationally consistent with the act of the accused having been impulsive rather
than considered establish beyond reasonable doubt that his act was deliberate?

In the case of a charge of
capital murder based on s. 202A(2)  (a) of the Criminal Code 
the Crown is called upon, as a condition precedent to the finding of a verdict
of guilty, to prove a matter of fact which from its nature will frequently be
susceptible of proof only by circumstantial evidence and which will often, to
use the words of Bowen L.J., be ""very difficult to prove"". But the
consideration that proof of a matter of fact which Parliament has seen fit to
require will often be difficult does not permit the Court to modify the long
established rules as to the standard of proof in criminal cases and to substitute
the rule applicable in civil cases that issues may be decided upon the balance
of probabilities.

In regard to question (c),
I am in substantial agreement with the reasons of Tysoe J.A.

[Page 484]

For the above reasons I would
answer question (c) on which leave to appeal was granted in the negative
and would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

DAVID JAMES McMARTIN APPELLANT;

AND

HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN RESPONDENT.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH
COLUMBIA

PRESENT: Taschereau
C.J. and Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and
Spence JJ.

Criminal law-Capital murder-Application by
defence to adjourn trial to obtain further medical evidence-Application
refused-Whether Court of Appeal right in refusing leave to adduce fresh
evidence of mental disorder on issue of planned and deliberate. Criminal Code ,
1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 202A(2) (a), 589(1)(b).

The appellant was convicted on a
charge of capital murder of his common-law wife. He did not testify. The
evidence for the Crown was that he had quarrelled with his wife after she
returned to their house at 1:30 a.m. on the morning of October 11, 1962. When
the children left for school at 8:15 a.m., the wife was alive. Sometime after 9
a.m. the appellant was seen at the back of his house with an axe; about a
minute and a half later he was at his front gate and on his way to telephone
the police. When the police arrived, the wife was dead with severe lacerations
on the right side of the face and head. There was no evidence of any persons being
in the house between 8:15 am. and 9:30 a.m. other than the appellant and his
wife. The Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction and refused an application by
the appellant to introduce fresh evidence before it as to his mental condition
at the time of the crime. On appeal to this Court the Crown was called upon to
answer only the grounds (1) as to whether the trial judge should have granted a
defence motion for an adjournment in order for it to obtain and introduce
further medical evidence; and (2) as to whether the defence motion before the
Court of Appeal to adduce fresh evidence should have been granted.

Held: The appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial
ordered.

Per Taschereau
C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ.: The
application for an adjournment of the trial appeared to have been directed to
the issue of insanity which was not pleaded at the trial. The question of
whether or not an adjournment

is to be granted rests in the
discretion of the judge who is trying the case, and the affidavit filed at the
hearing of this appeal did not contain sufficient information as to the
circumstances under which this application was made to justify the conclusion
that there was any error in principle in refusing the adjournment.

[Page 485]

The proposed evidence, which the
defence sought to introduce in the Court of Appeal, was not directed towards
proving that the appellant was legally insane at the time of the crime, but
rather towards showing that a psychiatric examination after the trial had
disclosed that he had long been suffering from a disorder of the mind which
manifested itself in impulsive, unpredictable and dangerous behaviour, and that
his long history of mental
disorder was a relevant circumstance proper to be considered, together with all
the other circumstances disclosed in the evidence, in determining whether or
not the murder was planned and deliberate on his part. It is recognized that
special grounds must be shown in order to justify the Court of Appeal in
exercising the power conferred upon it by s. 589(1)  of the Criminal Code . The
evidence tendered on such an application was not to be judged and rejected on
the ground that it did not disprove the verdict as found by the jury, or that
it failed to discharge the burden of proving that the appellant was incapable
of planning and deliberation or that it did not rebut inferences which appeared
to have been drawn by the jury. It was enough if the proposed evidence was of
sufficient strength that it might reasonably affect the verdict of a jury, R.
v. Buckle, 94 C.C.C. 84, referred to. Under the present circumstances it could not be
said that the conduct of the appellant's counsel indicated lack of reasonable
diligence to obtain such evidence before the trial. The evidence in question,
like that in Regina v. More, [19631 S.C.R. 522, might have caused the jury to regard it as more probable that the accused's
final act was prompted by a sudden impulse rather than by consideration. It
should have been admitted by the Court of Appeal. Without the evi­dence of the
appellant's mental history and condition, it could not be said that all the
circumstances bearing on the question of whether the murder was planned and
deliberate have been passed upon by a jury.

CARTWRIGHT J.
agrees subject to a reservation regarding the applicability of the rule in
Hodge's case.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia', affirming the conviction of the appellant for capital
murder and refusing leave to introduce further evidence. Appeal allowed and new
trial ordered.

H. A. D. Oliver, for
the appellant.

W. G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau C.J. and
Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall and Spence JJ. was deliv­ered
by

RITCHIE J.:-This is an appeal from a judgment of th( Court of Appeal
of British Columbia[1] by
which that Court

[Page 486]

with Davey J.A.
dissenting, affirmed the conviction of the appellant for the capital murder of
Celestine Bob and unanimously refused an application made on his behalf to
introduce further evidence before it as to his mental condi­tion at the time of
the crime.

The appellant did not
testify and no evidence was intro­duced on his behalf at the trial so that the
jury's verdict was of necessity based on the account given by the various Crown
witnesses of the circumstances surrounding the killing.

This account disclosed
that at about 1:30 a.m. on the morning of October 11, 1962, Celestine Bob
returned to the house near the settlement of Lillooet, B.C., where she and the
appellant had been living with their two children as man and wife for a number
of years; she was accompanied by a man named Stavast who appears to have given
her a lift in his car and who came into the house for half an hour and had a
glass of beer and a discussion or argument with the appellant about
""work"". Marilyn Bob, a 14-year old child, testified that after Stavast
had left she heard the appellant and her mother ""arguing about how come
that man took her home"", but there is no evidence of any further incident
until after the two children left for school at 8:15, at which time they both
say that their mother was alive and the little boy, Percy Bob, says that he saw
her waving to them when they were waiting for the school bus. Sometime after 9
a.m., a man named Whitney, who was walking along the road behind and to one
side of the McMartin house, noticed the appellant at the back of his house pick
up an axe and knock a piece of wood from its blade, and about a minute and a
half later he encountered the appellant at his front gate; he was then
breathing heavily and asked Whitney to come with him to the shoemaker's who
appears to have had the only telephone in the immediate vicinity. On arriving
at the shoemaker's, the appellant telephoned to the police at Lillooet saying,
in part, ""Come down as quick as possible and you'll find out for
yourself"". As a result, Corporal Chiunyk of the R.C.M. Police drove at
once to the shoe-maker's and accompanied the appellant to his house where he
was shown the dead body of Celestine Bob with severe lacerations on the right
side of her face and head, and he then noticed an axe in a box in the corner of
the same room. The appellant declined to say anything until he saw his

[Page 487]

lawyer and when the
Corporal told him that he would have to take him into custody he replied,
""I am prepared"". At the trial Dr. Clark testified that it was very
likely that the deceased had died as a result of blows from the axe found in the
room and that she had probably been hit when asleep.

For the purpose of this
case the relevant definition of capital murder is that contained in s. 202A(2) 
(a) of the Criminal Code  which reads as follows:

(2) Murder is capital
murder, in respect of any person, where (a) it is planned and deliberate on the
part of such person, .. .

In More v. The Queen[2], Cartwright J.
commented on these provisions as follows:

The evidence that the
murder was planned was very strong, but, as was properly pointed out to the
jury by the learned trial judge, they could not find the accused guilty of
capital murder unless they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt not only
that the murder was planned but also that it was deliberate. The learned trial
Judge also rightly instructed the jury that the word ""deliberate"", as
used in s. 202A(2) (a), means ""con­sidered, not impulsive"".

Other meanings of the
adjective given in the Oxford Dictionary are ""not hasty in decision"",
""slow in deciding"" and ""intentional"". The word as used in
the subsection cannot have simply the meaning ""intentional"" because
it is only if the accused's act was intentional that he can be guilty of murder
and the subsection is creating an additional ingredient to be proved as a
condition of an accused being convicted of capital murder.

In dissenting from the
opinion of the majority of the Court of Appeal in the present case, Davey J.A.,
would have ordered a new trial on the ground that, in light of the addresses of
counsel, the charge of the learned trial judge might have caused the jurors to
interpret the word ""delib­erate"" as meaning ""intentional""
and that they might thus have failed to apply the proper test in determining
whether the murder was ""planned and deliberate"" within the mean­ing
of those words as they are used in the above Section. Mr. Justice Davey was
also of opinion that the trial judge had erred in his directions to the jury as
to the evidence of deliberation.

Counsel for the
appellant adopted this reasoning of Davey J.A. and contended also that the
trial judge erred in relating the evidence of the witness Whitney to the day of
the crime as that witness had been unable to state the day of the week or month
on which the events he described took place.

[Page 488]

In this Court, however,
it was only considered necessary to call upon the respondent's counsel in
respect of the 6th and 12th grounds of appeal, and as I am unable to find any
errors of substance in the charge of the learned trial judge, I propose to
limit myself to a consideration of the issues raised by these grounds which are
set out in the notice of appeal as follows:

The Court of Appeal
failed to hold that the learned trial judge erred in failing to grant defence
counsel's motion for an adjournment to enable the defence to obtain and
introduce further medical evidence.

12. The Court of Appeal
erred in refusing to grant the appellant's motion to adduce fresh evidence
before it.

The record of
proceedings as contained in the Case on appeal in this Court makes no reference
whatever to defence counsel's motion for an adjournment, and the only source of
information as to what material the learned trial judge had before him on that
motion is contained in an affidavit of David Moffett which was filed at the
hearing of this appeal and which appears to have been used in support of the
application to adduce fresh evidence which was made to the Court of Appeal of
British Columbia.

This affidavit stated
that before the preliminary hearing Mr. Moffett, who represented the appellant
in the lower courts, suspected that the accused might be suffering from mental
illness and might have been legally insane at the time of committing the
offence, and that he asked the presiding magistrate for directions as to the
obtaining of a psychiatric report and wrote to the Attorney-General of British
Colum­bia requesting an examination of the accused to find out if he were
medically fit to stand trial or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
the offence. The last two paragraphs of this affidavit read as follows :

That in due course I
was advised and verily believed that the accused had been examined by Dr. J. W.
Thomas and I was not then aware that Dr. Thomas' terms of reference did not
include any examination of the accused with a view to ascertaining his sanity
or insanity at the time of the commission of the offence.

That shortly before the
date of Trial I became aware of the contents of Dr. Thomas' medical report and
thereupon applied to the learned presiding Judge at the Quennel assizes, the
Honourable Mr. Justice Ruttan, for an adjournment to enable a further
psychiatric examination to be carried out, which application was refused by the
said learned presiding Judge.

[Page 489]

The question of whether
or not an adjournment is to be granted rests in the discretion of the judge who
is trying the case, and the Moffett affidavit does not, in my opinion, contain
sufficient information as to the circumstances under which this application was
made to justify the conclusion that there was any error in principle in
refusing the adjournment.

This application, like
that which had earlier been made to the Attorney-General, appears to have been
directed to the issue of insanity which was not pleaded at the trial,
not-withstanding the fact that according to the report made to the Court of
Appeal by Ruttan J. the psychiatrist, Dr. J. W. Thomas, was in the court
throughout the proceedings and was not called by either the Crown or the
defence. It is diffi­cult to understand what material defence counsel was able
to put before the trial judge on this issue, particularly in light of the fact
that medical evidence ultimately obtained for the defence did not bear on the
question of insanity at all.

The appellant's motion
for an order granting leave to call fresh evidence at the hearing of the appeal
stands, however, on a very different footing. The proposed evidence was not
directed towards proving that the appellant was legally insane at the time of
the crime, but rather towards showing that a psychiatric examination after the
trial had disclosed that he had long been suffering from a disorder of the mind
which manifested itself in impulsive, unpredictable and dangerous behaviour,
and that his long history of mental disorder was a relevant circumstance proper
to be con­sidered, together with all the other circumstances disclosed in the
evidence, in determining whether or not the murder was planned and deliberate
on his part.

In addition to the
affidavit of Mr. Moffett, to which refer­ence has been made, this application
was supported by the evidence of Dr. Gould and Dr. Tyhurst and by an affidavit
of the appellant which disclosed that Dr. Tyhurst first examined him after his
conviction and concluded by saying:

I am advised by my
legal advisers and verily believe that had the evidence of Dr. Tyhurst and Dr.
Gould been introduced at my trial it might reasonably have induced the jury to
change its view regarding my guilt.

[Page 490]

The jurisdiction of the
Court of Appeal to admit fresh evidence is to be found in s. 589(1)  (b) of the Criminal
Code  which reads, in part, as follows:

589. (1) For the
purposes of an appeal under this Part the court of appeal may, where it
considers it in the interest of justice,

(b) order any witness
who would have been a compellable witness at the trial, whether or not he was
called at the trial, (1) to attend and be examined before the court of appeal
.. .

It is clearly not in
the interests of justice that this privilege should be extended to an appellant
as a matter of course, and although the rules applicable to introducing fresh
evidence before the Court of Appeal in a civil case do not apply with the same
force to criminal matters, it is nevertheless recognized that special grounds
must be shown in order to justify the Court in exercising the power con­ferred
upon it by s. 589(1) .

One of the grounds
advanced by Sheppard J.A. for reject­ing the proposed evidence in the present
case was that it had not been shown that the diligence required by R. v. Martin[3],
had been exercised in
obtaining it at or before the trial. In R. v. Martin, supra, Bird J.A.
who delivered the decision of the majority of the Court of Appeal of British
Columbia said, in regard to the evidence sought to be intro­duced in that case:

No effort was then made
to procure McLeod's attendance at the trial, nor was application made for an
adjournment on account of his absence.

In these circumstances
it is reasonable to infer that the defence elected to proceed to trial without
that evidence. Indeed, I understood counsel for appellant to concede before us
that such was the case.

The Court of Criminal
Appeal in England refused such an application in what appears to me to be a
parallel case, viz., Rex v. Weisz, (1920) 15 Cr. App. R. 85, wherein the
Earl of Reading, C.J. said: ""The appellant's legal advisers knew the case
they would have to meet, and no application was made to adjourn the trial ...
The policy was deliberate of resting the defence upon the evidence of the
accused ... and no precedent could be cited for calling a fresh witness in
those circumstances"".

More recently, Bird
J.A. speaking on behalf of the same Court in R. v. Lalcatos[4] appears to have adopted
the follow­ing interpretation of the requirements stated in Rex v. Martin,
supra:

.. that before fresh evidence will be admitted
by this Court, it must be shown: (a) At the time of the trial the accused
(appellant) either was not aware of the evidence proposed to be adduced or if
he then had knowledge

[Page 491]

of it that all
reasonable diligence had been exercised at or before the trial to adduce that
evidence; (b) That the evidence if adduced might reasonably have induced the
trial tribunal to change its view of the guilt of the accused.

It appears that in the
present case, Dr. Tyhurst knew nothing of the matter until after the trial and
although it may be said that further efforts could have been made before the
trial to find out whether the evidence he would be able to give after
examination might be relevant to the issue of planning and deliberation, it
must at the same time be remembered that the provisions of s. 202A(2)  (a) only
became law in July, 1961, that the case of Regina v. More, supra, had
not been decided at the time of the preliminary hearing and the trial in
October and November of 1962, and that counsel then acting for the appellant
apparently did not appreciate the full significance of psychiatric evidence on
the issue of planning and deliberation. I am not prepared to say that this
indicated lack of reasonable diligence on his part.

Furthermore, unlike the
case of Rex v. Martin, supra and Rex v. Weisz[5], in the present case
efforts were made to obtain a psychiatric report from the Attorney-General and
a motion for an adjournment was made to the trial judge for the same purpose.
It is true that Ruttan J. exercised his discre­tion by refusing the appellant's
application, but this does not detract from the fact that an effort was made.

In all the
circumstances, if the evidence is considered to be of sufficient strength that
it might reasonably affect the verdict of the jury, I do not think it should be
excluded on the ground that reasonable diligence was not exercised to obtain it
at or before the trial.

Having heard the
evidence which was sought to be intro­duced in the present case, the Court of
Appeal dismissed the appellant's application, the majority of the Court (Bird, Davey
and Tysoe JJ.A.) resting their judgment on the ground expressed by Davey J.A.
in the concluding paragraph of his reasons for judgment in the following terms:

I would dismiss the
motion for leave to introduce evidence of appel­lant's alleged mental disorder,
because appellant relates it to no incident proximate in time to the killing
that could be said to rebut any inference of deliberation by showing that the
killing was the result of sudden passion or emotion aroused in a disordered mind
by the incident.

[Page 492]

As has been indicated,
the evidence thus rejected by the Court of Appeal included that of Dr. Tyhurst,
the Head of the Department of Psychiatry at the Vancouver General Hospital and
the Shaughnessy Veterans Hospital, who testi­fied that the appellant had been a
patient in the psychiatric division of two hospitals as well as having been
admitted to one mental hospital in Alberta, and that his family history was
very disordered, his mother having committed suicide and family members having
been in mental hospitals. This witness went on to express the following
conclusion which he had reached after spending a good deal of time with the
appellant:

It is my conclusion
that he is a very unstable paranoid individual, who has a lifelong history of
personal instability, who responds impulsively and against his best interests
on slight provocation, and sometimes on none at all, actually, because of his
suspiciousness; that he is unpredictable and, I would say, dangerous, actually.

In rejecting this
evidence because it could not be related to any incident proximate in time to
the killing which might have aroused sudden passion or emotion in a disordered
mind, the Court of Appeal appears to me to have left out of account the fact
that the very evidence which was so rejected was to the effect that the
disorder in the mind of the appellant was such that he sometimes acted
impulsively, unpredictably and dangerously with no provocation at all.

The majority of the
Court of Appeal also appear to have considered it to be a necessary condition
for the admissibility of this evidence that it should be such as to ""rebut
any inference of deliberation"" by showing affirmatively that the killing
was the result of sudden passion or emotion. This thinking is also reflected in
the reasons for judgment of Sheppard J.A. who said:

There is no evidence
that the accused was in fact provoked, and in any event, there was ample time
between 2:00 a.m, and 9:00 a.m. for any pas­sion to have cooled 

As the result, there is
no evidence for the accused that the recurring paranoic condition referred to
by Dr. Tyhurst was operating to any extent at the time of the murder, and in
any event, assuming the condition had recurred, such condition does not
preclude the accused taking life by a murder planned and deliberate. Hence the
evidence does not disprove the verdict as found by the jury.

[Page 493]

Wilson J.A. expressed
himself even more forcibly in the same vein saying:

The attempt here is,
with the flimsiest evidence of provocation, to prove that this man was
incapable of planning and deliberation ...

and later in his
reasons:

Further, I do not think
the evidence of Dr. Tyhurst establishes that this man was incapable of planning
and deliberation, however unreasonable the result of such planning and
deliberation might appear to the reasonable man. I have no hesitation in
rejecting this evidence.

With the greatest
respect, it appears to me that the evi­dence tendered by the appellant on such
an application as this is not to be judged and rejected on the ground that it
""does not disprove the verdict as found by the jury"" or that it fails
to discharge the burden of proving that the appellant was incapable of planning
and deliberation, or that it does not rebut inferences which appear to have
been drawn by the jury. It is enough, in my view, if the proposed evidence is
of sufficient strength that it might reasonably affect the verdict of a jury.

I would respectfully
adopt the following views expressed on behalf of the majority of the Court of
Appeal of British Columbia by Sloan C.J.B.C. in R.
v. Buckle[6],
where he said :

In my opinion the rule
to be applied in criminal cases in relation to the introduction of fresh
evidence and consequential relief which may be granted by the Court, is wider
in its discretionary scope than that applied by the Court in civil appeals. If
the newly-discovered evidence is in its nature conclusive, then the Court of
Appeal, in both civil and criminal cases, may itself finally deal with the
matter ... If, on the other hand, in a criminal case, the new evidence does not
exert such a compelling influence, but is however of sufficient strength that
it might reasonably affect the verdict of a jury, then, in my opinion, the
Court may admit that evidence and direct a new trial, so that such evidence
might be added to the scale and weighed by the trial tribunal in the light of
all the facts.

It is to be noted that
the reasons of Sloan C.J.B.C. in R. v. Buckle, supra, were expressly adopted on behalf of the Court of Appeal
of British Columbia by Bird J.A. in the recent case of R. v. Lakatos, at
page 391.

The bearing of
psychiatric evidence on the question of whether or not a murder was planned and
deliberate on the part of the accused was considered by this Court in More v. R.,
supra,

[Page 495]

 where Cartwright J., speaking of the
medical evidence there tendered, said at p. 534:

The evidence of the two
doctors is not relied on by the defence as raising the question whether the
accused was legally sane. Its importance is that it would assist the jury in
deciding the question whether the accused's action in pulling the trigger,
which so far as this branch of the matter is concerned was admittedly the
intentional act of a sane man, was also his deliberate act. The question is one
of fact and its solution involves an inquiry as to the thinking of the accused
at the moment of acting. If the jury accepted the evidence of the doctors it,
in conjunction with the accused's own evidence, might well cause them to regard
it as more probable that the accused's final act was prompted by sudden impulse
rather than by consideration. On this question the accused was entitled to have
the verdict of a properly instructed jury.

In deciding whether or
not the evidence sought to be introduced in the present case falls within the
same cate­gory, it appears to me to be helpful to consider that evidence in
light of the charge of the learned trial judge.

As has been indicated,
the evidence identifying the appel­lant with the killing was entirely circumstantial
and in this regard Ruttan J. properly instructed the jury as to the rule in Hodges
case[7]. In
dealing with the additional question of whether or not the murder was planned
and deliberate on the part of the appellant, he made the following comment:

As a final conclusion
from circumstantial evidence the Crown asks you to find that not only did the
accused commit this murder, but that the accused did it by planned and
deliberate actions. I shall explain to you in a moment the significance of that
last submission; briefly I will say that the ingredient of planning
and deliberate action makes a difference between a capital murder and a
non-capital murder.

And later in the same
paragraph he said:

I should point out to
you, I think it was Crown counsel suggested it was a deliberate action because
there were no less than six wounds found by the doctor. There were four
lacerations on one side in the same wound area and one below and one on the
other side of the face. Well, here is an illustration of two conclusions you
may draw from the same circumstances, because that might indicate to you that
the deed was committed in a frenzy and in a highly emotional state, delivering
six blows where one would do, which might suggest to you that it wasn't
planned, or deliberate. I just suggest this to you to illustrate the
circumstantial evidence that is so significant and important in this case, and
that you must consider in draw­ing your conclusions.

As I understand this
part of the charge, the learned trial judge was indicating to the jury that the
circumstances were not only consistent with

[Page 496] 

the act having been
planned

and deliberate on the
part of the appellant, but were also consistent with the deed having been
committed ""in a frenzy and in a highly emotional state ... which might
suggest .. . that it was not planned or deliberate"". He was thus not
telling the jury that because the circumstances were con­sistent with lack of
planning and deliberation they must of necessity acquit the appellant, but
rather that the circum­stances were consistent with two alternative
interpretations which must be weighed in the balance before a verdict could be
reached. There was, in my view, no error in this direction.

Under all the
circumstances, it appears to me that the evidence of Dr. Tyhurst, like that of
the doctors in More v. R., supra might have caused the jury ""to regard
it as more probable that the accused's final act was prompted by sudden impulse
rather than by consideration"".

For these reasons I am
of opinion that the evidence of Dr. Tyhurst should have been admitted by the
Court of Appeal in accordance with the practice outlined by Sloan C.J.B.C. in R. v. Buckle. I do
not, however, consider that there was any error in rejecting the evidence of
Dr. Gould which does not appear to me to bear upon the question here at issue.

It is not suggested
that the evidence in this case did not amply support the verdict of the jury.
There are many cir­cumstances in addition to the way the blows were delivered
which are consistent with the murder having been planned and deliberate, but
the question raised by this appeal is whether, if the evidence of Dr. Tyhurst
had been before them, the jury would inevitably have reached the conclusion
which they did.

In my opinion, without
the evidence of the appellant's mental history and condition, it cannot be said
that all the circumstances bearing on the question of whether the murder was
planned and deliberate have been passed upon by a jury, and I would accordingly
allow this appeal, quash the conviction and direct that there be a new trial.

CARTWRIGHT J.:-I concur in the disposition of this appeal
proposed by my brother Ritchie and I agree with his reasons subject to one
reservation.

After quoting certain
passages from the charge of the learned trial judge to the jury my brother
Ritchie says:

As I understand this
part of the charge, the learned trial judge was indicating to the jury that the
circumstances were not only consistent with

the act having been
planned and deliberate on the part of the appellant, but were also consistent
with the deed having been committed ""in a frenzy and in a highly emotional
state ... which might suggest ... that it was not planned or deliberate"".
He was thus not telling the jury that because the circumstances were consistent
with lack of planning and deliberation they 'must of necessity acquit the
appellant, but rather that the circumstances were consistent with two
alternative interpretations which must be weighed in the balance before a
verdict could be reached. There was, in my view, no erorr in this direction.

For the reasons given
by me in the case of The Queen v. David Mitchell[8], judgment in which is
being given at the same time as in this case, I am of opinion that where the
evidence relevant to the issue whether or not a murder was planned and
deliberate on the part of the accused is entirely circumstantial it is
necessary for the trial judge to charge the jury on that issue in accordance
with the rule in Hodge's case[9]. In so
far as the passage quoted from the reasons of my brother Ritchie indicates a
different view I am unable to agree with it.

I would dispose of the
appeal as proposed by my brother Ritchie.

Appeal allowed, conviction quashed and
new trial ordered.

EN APPEL DE LA COUR DU BANC DE LA REINE, PROVINCE
DE QUÉBEC.

Droit criminel—Meurtre qualifié—Vol de banque—Meurtrier déguisé en Père Noël—Témoignage d'un complice—Corroboration—Défense d'alibi rejetée par le jury—Justification du verdict—Code
criminel , 1963-64 (Can.), arts. 202, 202A.

L'appelant fut trouvé coupable de meurtre
qualifié pour avoir intentionnellement causé la mort d'un constable à l'occasion et aux fins de la perpétration
d'un vol qualifié. Deux de ceux qui ont pris part à ce vol étaient masqués, et
le troisième était déguisé en Père Noël. Un nommé Fournel, qui admit avoir été
un des deux hommes masqués, fut un des témoins de la Couronne et identifia
l'accusé comme étant celui qui portait l'habit de Père Noël. L'accusé a soumis
une preuve d'alibi. Le verdict a été unanimement confirmé par la Cour du banc
de la reine. D'où le pourvoi de l'accusé devant cette Cour.

Arrêt: L'appel doit être
rejeté.

La lecture de la charge du juge et de l'adresse
de l'avocat de la Couronne ne supporte pas les reproches qu'on a faits à l'une
et à l'autre. Également dépourvu de substance est le grief relatif à
l'introduction dans la preuve de certains faits, y compris ce qu'on a appelé «l'incident
Constantin».

Outre les aveux extra-judiciaires faits par
l'accusé quelques heures après l'assassinat, la preuve consistait
principalement dans le témoignage du complice Fournel, témoignage corroboré par
des témoins indépendants. Les jurés, comme ils en avaient le droit, ont accepté
le témoignage du complice et rejeté la défense d'alibi. Au regard de toute la
preuve placée devant eux ils étaient justifiés de rapporter contre l'accusé un
verdict de culpabilité.

Criminal law—Capital murder—Bank robbery—Killer
disguised as Santa Claus—Testimony of
accomplice—Corroborating evidence—Defence of alibi rejected by jury—Whether
conviction justified—Criminal Code , 1963-64 (Can.), c. 51,
ss. 202, 202A.

The appellant was convicted on a charge of capital murder for
having caused the death of a policeman while committing a robbery. Of the three
men involved in the robbery, two wore masks and one was disguised in a Santa Claus suit. One of the masked men was, by his own admission, one
Fournel, who testified on behalf of the Crown and who identified the appellant
as the man dressed as Santa Claus. The accused submitted a
defence of alibi. The conviction was unanimously affirmed by the Court of
Appeal. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

The objections to the trial judge's charge and to the address
of the Crown prosecutor had no substance, as was the objection relating to the

[Page 560]

evidence of certain facts, including what was called the ""Constantin
incident"".

In addition to the extra-judicial admissions made by the
accused a few hours after the killing, the evidence consisted mainly of the
testimony of the accomplice Fournel which was corroborated by independant witnesses.
The jury, as they were entitled, accepted the testimony of the accomplice and
rejected the defence of alibi. Taking all the evidence into account, the jury
were justified in finding the accused guilty.

APPEL d'un jugement de la Cour du banc de
la reine, Province de Québec1,
confirmant un verdict de culpabilité pour meurtre qualifié. Appel rejeté.

Dollard Dansereau, C.R. et Yves Mayrand,
pour l'appelant,

Jacques Ducros et Jean-Guy Boilard, pour l'intimé.

Le jugement de la Cour fut rendu par

Le Juge Fauteux:—L'appelant a été accusé et trouvé coupable
d'avoir, le 14 décembre 1962, en la cité de St-Laurent, district de
Montréal, intentionnellement causé la mort du constable
Claude Marineau, et ce à l'occasion et aux fins de la perpétration
d'un vol qualifié, commettant ainsi un meurtre qualifié.

Ce verdict fut par la suite confirmé par une décision
unanime de la Cour du banc de la reine2,
alors composée de M. le Juge en chef Tremblay et de MM. les Juges Casey, Montgomery, Badeaux et Montpetit (ad
hoc). Le présent appel est de ce jugement.

Les griefs soulevés en cette Cour de la part
de l'appelant portent sur la charge du Juge principalement, et, en partie, sur
l'adresse de l'avocat de la Couronne aux jurés, et sur l'introduction en preuve
de certains faits. La plupart, sinon tous ces griefs ont été soumis à la Cour
du banc de la reine et aucun n'y fut retenu pour modifier le verdict. La
lecture de la charge du Juge et de l'adresse de l'avocat de la Couronne ne
supporte pas les reproches qu'on a faits à l'un et à l'autre. Egalement dépourvu
de substance est le grief relatif à l'introduction dans la preuve de certains
faits, y compris ce qu'on a appelé «l'incident Constantin».

La preuve apportée au soutien de l'accusation
est substantielle. Outre les aveux extra-judiciaires faits par l'accusé

[Page 561]

le 14 décembre 1962, quelques
heures après l'assassinat, qu'il avait fait feu sur deux policiers lors d'un
vol à main armée, cette preuve consiste principalement dans le témoignage de
Jean-Paul Fournel, l'un des complices. Ce témoignage est corroboré par un
ensemble de faits divers rapportés par des témoins indépendants. Témoignant en
défense, l'accusé a cherché à écarter cette preuve incriminante et a, de plus,
soumis une défense d'alibi. La faiblesse de la preuve relative à la défense
d'alibi a été reconnue par l'avocat de l'accusé au cours de son adresse aux jurés.

Les jurés, comme ils en avaient le droit, ont,
d'une part, accepté le témoignage de Fournel et rejeté, d'autre part, la défense
d'alibi. Au regard de toute la preuve placée devant eux, ils étaient justifiés
de rapporter contre l'accusé un verdict de culpabilité.

Ajoutons qu'à la fin de l'audition de cet
appel, nous étions unanimement d'avis qu'il ne pouvait être accueilli et ces
vues n'ont pas été modifiées à la suite d'une considération ultérieure.

L'appel doit être rejeté.

Appel rejeté.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Theft by conversion—Municipal
treasurer giving municipal moneys to mayor on latter’s
instructions—Deficiencies concealed in accounts by treasurer—Defence of honest
belief that accused was justified in following mayor’s order—Court of Appeal
ordering new trial—Whether trial unsatisfactory in regard to instructions to
jury on defence’s theory—Whether appeal to Supreme Court raises question of
law—Whether conversion of moneys to accused’s own use as charged—Criminal Code ,
1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 269(1), 598(1)(b).

The respondent was convicted of unlawfully
converting to her own use a sum of money, the property of a municipal
corporation of which she was the treasurer and tax collector, and thereby
stealing the same. The respondent admitted taking cash from the parking meter
collections and depositing cheques due to the municipality from third persons
in the parking meter bank account in order to balance that account and finally
destroying the records of the transactions with these third persons. Her
defence was that she gave the money to the mayor of the municipality in the
honest belief that he had authority to receive the same and that she took no money
for herself. The mayor gave evidence for the defence and testified that he had
been authorized by council to receive up to $2,600 per year in addition to his
salary for charitable purposes. Nine cheques were used in this way. The accused
admitted that all of these cheques, with the exception of the Beaudry cheque
and the Noël cheque, were bona fide cheques payable to the municipality
and should have been credited to other accounts and that these other accounts
were falsified. As to the Beaudry cheque, the respondent denied having any
knowledge of this transaction. Beaudry himself said that this cheque was for
the purchase of a lot and that he had received a conveyance. As to the Noël
cheque which was certified, the mayor said that Noël cashed this cheque with
the municipality to meet a payroll; the accused said that she understood from
the mayor that Noël was cashing the cheque to raise money in a hurry for a
holiday in Florida; and Noël said that it was paid to the municipality as a
deposit for services to be rendered to his company by the municipality. The
Court of Appeal found non-direction as to these last mentioned cheques and
ordered a new trial. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the
question as to whether the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the
trial judge misdirected the jury as to the theory of the defence.

Held
(Cartwright, Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
allowed and the conviction restored.

Per Taschereau
C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: As to the Beaudry
cheque, the jury had the accused’s explanation that she knew nothing about this
particular item. They did not believe her. This aspect of the charge was
adequate.

[Page 668]

As to the Noël cheque, the jury were entitled
to consider all the circumstances—the concealment, the falsification of books,
the whole operation of the parking meter account for improper purposes and the
fact that this was a certified cheque. There could be no possibility of
confusion or lack of understanding on the part of the jury. The brevity of the
judge’s reference to this cheque had not and could not have had the slightest
effect in bringing about any lack of appreciation of the issues or the evidence
in the minds of the jury. They could come to no conclusion other than the one
that they did, namely, that there could be no honesty or honest opinion of
right in these transactions.

This appeal raised a question of law.

The accused did convert the money to her own
use and the judge’s instruction on this point was correct.

Per Cartwright
and Hall JJ., dissenting: The Court had jurisdiction to entertain the
appeal. The question on which leave to appeal was granted was one of law and
all of the grounds on which the Court of Appeal held that the conviction should
be quashed were grounds the validity of which depended upon the answers given
by that Court to questions of law.

The charge of the trial judge in regard to
the evidence relating to the Beaudry cheque and that relating to the Noël
cheque was insufficient. Since the trial judge instructed the jury that they
should convict if satisfied that she had stolen the money represented by any
one of the nine cheques, an Appellate Court could not know that the verdict was
not based solely on the view that the guilt had been established as to the
moneys represented by one or part of these two cheques.

There was also misdirection when the trial
judge directed the jury that they could convict if they found that the accused
converted the money in question to the use of the mayor since such a conversion
would not be within the scope of the charge as laid. Parliament has seen fit to
treat conversion to an accused’s own use and conversion by an accused to the
use of another person as two alternative modes of committing the offence of
theft by conversion. Subject to the making of an amendment, the prosecution was
bound by the description of the offence contained in the indictment. On the
charge of the trial judge read in the light of the evidence, it was open to the
jury to find that she handed to the mayor some or all of the moneys covered by
the nine cheques, that she made use of none of these moneys for herself, but
that she had no belief that the mayor had any colour of right to the moneys so
taken. On these findings, it would not have been open to them to convict her of
converting the moneys to her own use.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: The Court of Appeal found that the trial judge failed to
give to the jury the evidence as to the defence in a sufficient character to
permit them to consider that defence. It has been held in this Court as a
matter of law that the trial judge must review the substantial parts of the
evidence and give to the jury the theory of the defence. There was therefore an
appeal to this Court under the provisions of s. 598(1)(b) of the Code.

The ground relied upon by the Court of
Appeal, namely, that the trial judge erred in directing the jury that they
could only acquit the accused if they found that she believed she was under a
legal compulsion to obey the mayor’s orders, whereas it was sufficient if she
honestly believed she was justified in following his orders even though she was
not bound to do so, was not well taken. The trial judge pre-

[Page 669]

sented to the jury the defence as it was made
and then added that even if on the facts what was shown was a position weaker
than belief in obligation and merely was belief in justification, it would, if
established, have been a sound defence. But the ground relied upon by the Court
of Appeal that the trial judge while he put the theory of the defence to the
jury did not discuss the evidence relating to that theory in a sufficiently
comprehensive way, particularly in relation to the Beaudry and Noël
transactions, was well taken. In the light of the circumstances, it would seem
that the trial judge was required to outline the evidence adduced by the
defence upon these two transactions in some particularity. Failure to do so
would, in essence, be failure to put to the jury the defence of the accused. Yet
the reference to these two transactions was regrettably brief. This constituted
non-direction amounting to misdirection and a new trial should be had.

The instruction by the trial judge on the
form of the indictment that the accused could have been convicted had it been
proved that she converted to her own use any sum was a proper instruction. When
the accused took the funds she converted them to her use despite the fact that
her use of them was to deliver them to the mayor.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], setting aside the
conviction of the respondent and directing a new trial on the ground of
non-direction. Appeal allowed, Cartwright, Hall and Spence JJ. dissenting.

R.P. Milligan, Q.C., for the appellant.

G.A. Martin, Q.C., and B. Carter, for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Fauteux,
Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

JUDSON J.:—The Crown appeals with leave of the
Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 which set
aside the conviction of the accused and directed a new trial on the ground of
non-direction. The Crown contends on this appeal that the verdict of the jury
should be restored and that the judge’s charge was adequate.

The accused was convicted on the following indictment:

That Adrienne Laroche did, between the 17th
day of September, 1956 and the 17th day of May, 1960, at the Town of Eastview,
in the County of Carleton, unlawfully convert to her own use money to the
amount of $10,790.52, the property of the Municipal Corporation of the Town of
Eastview and did thereby steal the same, contrary to the Criminal Code  of
Canada.

In spite of the fact that the trial lasted two
weeks, the issues in the case were simple. The accused was charged

[Page 670]

with taking money from the parking meter
collections of the Town of Eastview. Periodically, the meters were emptied, the small coins counted and
taken to the bank. Instead of being deposited in the proper account, the coins
were converted into paper currency and brought back to the Treasurer’s
Department of the Town of Eastview and kept there. From time to time the Treasurer took money from
this account and the total alleged to be missing is the amount mentioned in the
indictment, $10,790.52.

This shortage had to be concealed in some way if
the auditors were not to become aware of what was going on. The method adopted
was to take a bona fide cheque payable to the Town of Eastview and put it in the parking meter collection account and deposit it
in the bank. The parking meter account, therefore, showed no shortage. The
account in the books of the town to which the bona fide cheque should have been
credited was falsified or destroyed. Nine cheques were used in this way. They
are as follows:

The accused admitted that all of these cheques,
with the exception of item No. (3), the Beaudry cheque, and item No. (6), the
Noël cheque, were bona fide cheques payable to the Town of Eastview and should have been credited to
other accounts and that these other accounts were falsified. There was some
question about the Beaudry and Noël cheques and I will deal with the evidence
on this later.

The accused commenced her employment with the
Town of Eastview in the year
1947 as a clerk in the Treasurer’s Department. In 1951, she was appointed
Treasurer and Tax Collector and held this office until December 29, 1960. The
accused admitted that she took cash from the parking meter collections and
deposited cheques due to the municipality from third persons in the municipal
bank account in order to balance the accounts, and she admitted that she
destroyed the records of the transactions with the third persons. Her

[Page 671]

excuse was that she gave the money to the Mayor
of the municipality in the honest belief that he had authority to receive the
money and that she took no money for herself.

Lavergne, the Mayor of the municipality, gave
evidence for the defence. He was also a member of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario.
He said that in 1955 and 1956 the municipal council wished to raise his salary
to $5,000 from $2,400 but that he declined the increase because of the extra
income tax that he would have to pay. He said that he made an informal
arrangement with the council that he could draw in cash up to $2,600 a year to
give to the poor and needy. He said that he did not exceed in any one year the
total of $2,600 so authorized to be paid to him and that he used the money for
the purposes stated. He did not keep any records of the amounts he received and
Mrs. Laroche did not keep any records of the amounts that she gave to him.

This outrageous defence, coming as it did from
two public officials of long experience, was put to the jury by counsel for the
accused and by the judge. It was put to the jury by the judge with gravity and
respect, without criticism and without commendation. This is the way counsel
for the accused put it to the jury:

If Mrs. Laroche had an honest belief that
what Lavergne told her to do was all right, that she could do it, and that he
had power and authority to order it, and she believed that he had such power
and authority to order it, then what she did in allowing him to take money and
what she did in not entering up these records as they should have been entered
up, in a proper accounting system, in my respectful submission, is not a
crime…whether Lavergne takes the money out of the box, or whether he tells her
to take it out and give it to him, is immaterial in my respectful submission.
If she honestly believed that Lavergne had the right, Council had said it is
all right, charge it to whatever Department has the money.

This is the way the judge put it to the jury by
way of summary after full discussion:

Now here the theory of the defence as I
understand it is that the accused honestly thought she was obliged to take this
money as Lavergne had asked or ordered her to, because he was the Mayor, and
had told her the Council had authorized him to have the money. Now if you
believe her, or if you have a reasonable doubt in the matter, then you must
acquit her, because she had not the fraudulent intent to steal.

I now turn to the two items on which the Court
of Appeal found non-direction. The first is item No. (3) on the above list—the
Beaudry cheque. Beaudry said that he gave his cheque payable to the town for
the purchase of a lot and

[Page 672]

that he received a conveyance. The respondent
denied having any knowledge of this transaction but the fact is that the
Beaudry cheque, a bona fide cheque payable to the town, got into the parking
meter collection account under her charge and was used at some date after April
25, 1958, to cover up the taking of the sum of $1,000. This was plain to the
jury. They had her explanation that she knew nothing about this particular
item. They did not believe her. This is what the judge said about the Beaudry
cheque:

The same with the Beaudry cheque for
$1,000. The accused said she does not know how that got into the Treasurer’s
drawer and gave no explanation for it at all, and as Crown counsel has
suggested, it is a peculiar situation where a cheque for $1,000 would be
kicking around with the Treasurer not being curious enough to make some enquiry
to find out where it came from, or why it was there and what it was for, but
this again appears to have been used for covering up the taking of monies.

I think that aspect of the charge was adequate.

The second of the two disputed items is No. (6)
on the above list, the cheque of L.W. Noël Limited. This company was in the
construction business. The cheque was a certified cheque for $2,000 payable to
the Town of Eastview and Noël
said that it was paid to the town as a deposit for services to be rendered to
his company by the town for the installation of sewer pipes and water mains.
Lavergne said that Noël cashed this cheque with the town to meet a payroll.
Mrs. Laroche said that she understood from Lavergne that Noël was cashing the
cheque to raise money for a holiday in Florida and that he wanted the money in a hurry. These are the three
explanations of the use of the Noël cheque referred to in the judge’s charge,
and they could not fail to be clear in the minds of the jury.

This is what the judge said:

The next one is in April and July of 1958
when we are told about the Noël cheque for $2,000, and we are given three
explanations of how that cheque came to be in the Municipal coffers, and you
will have to decide which, if any, of these stories you accept. I do not know
that you have to accept any of them. The fact is it was put in there and
apparently improperly used and not credited.

Noël was called as the last witness in reply by
the Crown. He had by this time, of course, heard the explanations that he was
cashing a cheque for a pay-roll or for a trip to Florida. He denied that he had ever cashed a cheque with the municipality
and was again cross‑examined at length, much of it repetition of what he
had gone through before.

[Page 673]

The next day the case went to the jury. The
$2,000 cheque was fully dealt with by counsel for the accused and he put it to
them that the cheque was cashed. Counsel for the Crown put it to them that it
was for a building permit and that whatever the purpose was, it was payable to
the Town of Eastview and had nothing to do with the parking meter account and
that the only purpose of getting it into that account was to cover up a
defalcation of $2,000. The jury heard all this evidence, argument and
instruction from the judge. They were entitled to consider all the
circumstances—the concealment, the falsification of books, the whole operation
of the parking meter account for improper purposes, and finally, the fact that
this was a certified cheque that all the discussion was about. Why have a cheque
certified in the afternoon if you are going to need cash? Why not get the cash
instead of having the cheque certified?

I cannot see any possibility of confusion or
lack of understanding on the part of the jury. I have already said that in my
opinion, the issues were plain. The jury knew what these issues were and were
in a position to form an opinion on the credibility of the two witnesses I have
mentioned. The brevity of the judge’s reference to the $2,000 cheque had not
and could not have had the slightest effect in bringing about any lack of
appreciation of the issues or the evidence in the minds of the jury. In my
opinion they could come to no conclusion other than the one that they did,
namely, that there could be no honesty or honest opinion of right in these
transactions.

I would allow the appeal and restore the verdict
of the jury and the sentence of the Court.

I agree with the reasons of Spence J.

(a) that this appeal raises a question of law,

(b) that the accused did convert the monies to
her own use and that the judge’s instruction on this point was correct.

The judgment of Cartwright and Hall JJ. was
delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—The course of
the trial and the questions raised on this appeal are stated in the reasons of
other members of the Court.

[Page 674]

I agree with what I understand to be the opinion
of all the other members of the Court that the question on which leave to
appeal was granted is one of law, that all of the grounds on which the Court of
Appeal[2] held
that the conviction should be quashed were grounds the validity of which
depended upon the answers given by that Court to questions of law and that,
consequently, this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.

For the reasons given by my brother Spence and
those given by McLennan J.A. I agree with their conclusion that the charge of
the learned trial judge in regard to the evidence relating to the Beaudry
cheque and that relating to the Noël cheque was insufficient. This defect
assumes added importance by reason of the fact that the learned trial judge
had, in effect, instructed the jury that they should convict the respondent if
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that she had stolen the money represented
by any one of the nine cheques listed in the reasons of my brother Spence. An
appellate Court cannot know that the verdict of the jury was not based solely
on the view that the guilt of the accused had been established as to the moneys
represented by one or both of these two cheques.

My agreement on this point renders it
unnecessary for me to examine the other grounds of law which were raised in the
Court of Appeal and on which counsel for the respondent relies. I wish,
however, to deal with the one which was stated as follows in the notice of
appeal to the Court of Appeal:

That the learned trial judge erred in law
in directing the jury that they could convict the appellant if they found that
she improperly converted the money in question to the use of Lavergne since
such a conversion would not be within the scope of the charge as laid.

The charge on which the accused was indicted and
tried was as follows:

Adrienne Laroche did, between the 17th day
of September, 1956, and the 17th day of May, 1960, at the Town of Eastview, in
the County of Carleton, unlawfully convert to her own use money to the amount
of $10,790.52, the property of the Municipal Corporation of the Town of
Eastview and did thereby steal the same, contrary to the Criminal Code  of
Canada.

[Page 675]

The relevant words of s. 269(1)  of the Criminal
Code  defining the offence with which the respondent was charged are as
follows:

Everyone commits theft who fraudulently and
without colour of right takes, or fraudulently and without colour of right
converts to his use or to the use of another person, anything…with intent…

The corresponding words of the Criminal Code  prior
to the coming into force of the present code were the following, in s. 347 :

Theft or stealing is the act of
fraudulently and without colour of right taking, or fraudulently and without
colour of right converting to the use of any person anything…with intent…

In the present code Parliament has seen fit to
treat (i) conversion to an accused’s own use, and (ii) conversion by an accused
to the use of another person, as two alternative modes of committing the
offence of theft by conversion. The prosecution could, if so minded, have
charged the respondent in the words of s. 269; in which case the defence might
well have moved for particulars. However, when the prosecution sees fit to
particularize in the indictment itself it is, subject to the making of an
amendment in a proper case, bound by the description of the offence contained
in the indictment.

On the charge of the learned trial judge read in
the light of the evidence it was open to the jury to find, (i) that the
respondent handed to Lavergne some or all of the moneys covered by the nine
cheques, (ii) that she made use of none of these moneys for herself, but (iii)
that she had no belief that Lavergne had any colour of right to the moneys so taken.
If, as may be the case, these were the conclusions arrived at by the jury, it
would have been their duty to convict the respondent, had she been so charged,
with converting the moneys to the use of Lavergne; but it would not, in my
opinion, have been open to them to convict her of converting the moneys to her
own use. It may be observed that at no stage of the proceedings did the Crown
apply for any amendment.

In the course of his charge to the jury the
learned trial judge said:

Now the accused further says she took or
retained none of the money for herself, but she turned over every cent she
received to the Mayor, and I must tell you it is immaterial to this charge
whether she kept some, all or none of the money. In fact in the first instance
when she took it, it was

[Page 676]

for use to do as she wished with, and the
use she made of it was to give it…or some of it surreptitiously I suggest to
Lavergne. If she took it for his use entirely it still falls in the definition
of theft as I gave it to you, which definition is imported into the charge by
the definitions I read.

For the reasons I have given above on this
branch of the matter, I am of opinion that this was misdirection fatal to the
validity of the conviction; and on this ground also I would have upheld the
order made by the Court of Appeal.

I would dismiss the appeal.

SPENCE J. (dissenting):—This is an appeal
by the Crown from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario[3] directing a new
trial of the accused. The appeal is taken by leave of this Court granted on May
6, 1963, and the appeal was permitted upon the following question:

Whether the Court of Appeal erred in law in
holding that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury as to the theory of
the defence?

Counsel for the accused took the preliminary
objection that the Court of Appeal had allowed the appeal and directed a new
trial upon two separate and independent grounds: (1) that the trial was
unsatisfactory because the trial judge, while he put the theory of the defence
to the jury, did not discuss the evidence relating to that theory in a
sufficiently comprehensive way, and (2) that the trial judge erred in directing
the jury that they ought to acquit the accused if the accused, honestly thought
that she was obliged to give the money to the mayor and thereby conveyed to the
jury the impression that they should acquit only if the accused believed she
was under a legal compulsion to obey the mayor’s orders, whereas it was
sufficient, if she honestly believed that she was justified in following the
mayor’s orders even though she was not bound to do so. Counsel for the accused
submitted that the first of those grounds was a ground of fact and that no
appeal lay to this Court upon such ground. Where the provincial court of appeal
has allowed an appeal on two grounds and no appeal lies to the Supreme Court of
Canada on one of those grounds, no appeal will be considered with respect to
the other of such grounds because the appeal would be devoid of practical
results: Ouvrard v. Quebec Paper Box Co. Ltd.[4] and The Queen v. Warner[5]. It is true that in R. v. Cohen

[Page 677]

and Bateman[6], the Court of
Criminal Appeals held that a mistake of the judge as to the fact or omission to
refer to some point in favour of the prisoner is not a wrong decision on any
point of law but merely comes within the words “on any grounds” as those words
appear in s. 592(1) (a) (iii) of the Criminal Code , so that
the appeal should not be carried beyond the Court of Appeal of Ontario, those
words not appearing in s. 598(1)(b) of our Code.

I am of the opinion that it has been held in
this Court as a matter of law that the trial judge must review the substantial
parts of the evidence and give to the jury the theory of the defence.

The present Chief Justice of this Court, in Azoulay
v. The Queen[7], said
at p. 497:

The rule which has been laid down, and
consistently followed is that in a jury trial the presiding judge must, except
in rare cases where it would be needless to do so, review the substantial parts
of the evidence, and give the jury the theory of the defence, so that they may
appreciate the value and effect of that evidence, and how the law is to be
applied to the facts as they find them.

In the result, the appeal was allowed, the
judgment of the Court of King’s Bench (Appeal Side) reversed, and a new trial
directed.

In Rex. v. Krawchuk[8], this Court considered an appeal by the
Crown from the Court of Appeal of British Columbia quashing a conviction for murder and directing a new trial. In
giving judgment dismissing the appeal, Kerwin J., as he then was, said at p.
223:

A trial Judge need not refer to every piece
of evidence but to omit to mention the only evidence upon one branch of the
defence is an omission to place that defence before the tribunal of fact.

There is no word in the judgment as to any lack
of jurisdiction to consider such a ground in the Supreme Court of Canada.

In Brooks v. The King[9], this Court allowed an appeal from the
judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario which had
dismissed an appeal by the

[Page 678]

accused from his conviction at trial. At p. 636
of the judgment, it is said:

Misdirection in a material matter having
been shown, the onus was upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that the jury,
charged as it should have been charged, could not, as reasonable men, have done
otherwise than find the appellant guilty. That burden the Crown, in the view of
the majority of the Court, has not discharged. There was non‑direction by
the learned trial judge in a vital matter, tantamount in the circumstances of
this case to misdirection, and constituting a miscarriage of justice within
subs. (1)(c) of s. 1014  of the Criminal Code .

That section is now s. 592(1) (a) and yet
the Court considered it.

In Kelsey v. The Queen[10], leave to appeal was granted the accused
upon two questions. Question (a) being, did the learned trial judge err in
failing to instruct the jury adequately as to the theory of the defence?
Fauteux J. at p. 225 said:

It is suggested that the trial Judge should
have commented on:—

(h) The lack of any evidence of
blood or signs of a struggle in the victim’s taxi which serves strongly to
contradict the appellant’s statement to the police.

And at p. 226, commenting on this suggestion (h),
said:

In law, the general rule as again stated
recently in Azoulay v. The Queen, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495, is that the trial
Judge in the course of his charge should review the substantial part of
the evidence and give the jury the theory of the defence so that they may
appreciate the value and effect of that evidence and how the law is to be
applied to the facts as they find them.

Again, there was no reference to any lack of
jurisdiction in this Court.

Despite the sentence in the judgment of McLennan
J.A. in the Court of Appeal, “I have come to the conclusion that while the
trial judge told the jury what the theory of the defence was, he did not
discuss the evidence relating to that theory in a sufficiently comprehensive
way and that the trial was unsatisfactory.”, I have come to the conclusion that
what the learned justice in appeal found was the failure of the trial judge to
give to the jury the evidence as to the defence in a sufficient character to
permit them to consider that defence and that that complaint was a matter of
law and that, therefore, there is an appeal to this Court under the provisions
of s. 598(1)(b). The Court of Appeal of Ontario considered that such a failure to submit the defence

[Page 679]

of the accused to the jury had been established.
I shall deal with that question hereafter.

At the present time I turn to the second ground
of appeal relied upon in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, namely, that the
trial judge erred in directing the jury that they could only acquit the accused
if they found that she believed she was under a legal compulsion to obey the
mayor’s orders, whereas it was sufficient if she honestly believed she was
justified in following the mayor’s orders even though she was not bound to do
so. If the evidence given by the accused and her counsel’s address to the jury
are carefully perused, it will be demonstrated that her defence was, in fact,
that she was told by Lavergne that he was authorized to take these moneys, that
she believed he was so authorized (she regarded him as the mayor, or as her “boss”)
and therefore that she was obliged to obey not merely that she was justified in
obeying.

Since that was the defence which the accused
submitted in her evidence and which her counsel emphasized in his address to
the jury, it was that defence which the trial judge should have submitted to
the jury. The trial judge did so even prefacing this statement with the words,
“Now here the theory of the defence is as I understand it…” It may well be that
the accused could have advanced a sound defence by merely establishing that she
honestly believed she was justified in following the mayor’s orders even though
not bound to do so, and even when that belief was without foundation: Regina
v. Bernhard[11]. The
distinction, in my view, is academic as there could be no belief in
justification which the accused could imagine except her obligation as a
municipal servant to obey the mayor’s orders. The trial judge, however, went
farther having informed the jury of the defence of her belief in her obligation
to obey the mayor’s order, he charged them toward the close of his summing up
in these words:

If you take the other view that she was
honestly under the domination of Lavergne, and I pointed out to you the
position in which he was there, as Mayor, with the power and prestige that he
held, and that she thought she was acting honestly, and what she was doing was
alright, or if you have any reasonable doubt about that, then you must acquit
the accused.

Therein, the trial judge stressed that the
accused’s honest belief that her actions were honest “and what she was doing
was alright” was a complete defence. What counsel for the

[Page 680]

accused sought to do in the Court of Appear and
here was to submit that the trial judge should have presented the accused’s
defence not as it was made but as it could have been made. The trial judge
presented to the jury the defence as it was made and then added that even if on
the facts what was shown was a position weaker than belief in obligation and
merely was belief in justification, it would, if established, have been a sound
defence. I am therefore of the opinion that this ground of appeal was not well
taken and should not have been accepted by the Court of Appeal.

The Court of Appeal also allowed the appeal of
the accused on the ground that the trial judge while he put the theory of the
defence to the jury did not discuss the evidence relating to that theory in a
sufficiently comprehensive way, particularly in relation to the Noël and
Beaudry transactions. These transactions were two of the nine as to which
evidence was adduced by the Crown to prove the total conversion of $10,790.52.
It would seem an accurate summary of the learned trial judge’s charge to say
that he regarded these two transactions as merely two of the nine and, in fact,
he charged the jury very explicitly that even if the accused had not been
proved to have converted the $3,000 represented in those two transactions but
had been proved to have converted the sums involved in the other transactions,
she should be found guilty. This shall be referred to hereafter but at this
point we are only concerned with the importance of these two transactions. It
must be remembered that the accused swore that she had not used the Beaudry
cheque for $1,000 to replace any sum taken from the municipal coffers in order
to give it to the mayor, Lavergne, and that she also swore that she merely
cashed the $2,000 Noël cheque as a matter of courtesy when requested by the
mayor to do so and gave the proceeds to the mayor to deliver them to Noël. Now
there was the strongest evidence to throw doubt on the bona fides of the
defence story as to either of these transactions and that evidence was referred
to forcefully and properly by the trial judge in his charge, but the fact
remains that if the defence evidence were true, then neither the amount of
$1,000 in the case of Beaudry nor of $2,000 in the case of Noël was filched by
the accused from the municipal treasury although both appeared in the deposits
to make up the balance in the various accounts. Lavergne, when called as a
defence witness, made no estimate at all of the amount received from

[Page 681]

the accused, and which he swore he used for
various philanthropic gifts to citizens of the town, and persisted in this
answer despite a very careful cross-examination. About the closest he came to
such an estimate was to say that it was over $5,000 and not more than $2,600
per annum, i.e., $10,400.

The accused finally, in cross-examination, gave
an estimated total of $6,300 as the amount which she had removed from the
treasury upon the mayor’s instructions and delivered to the mayor, but this was
a most tentative estimate subject to qualification as to her ability to
remember. The $6,300 in this estimate seems to be made up as follows: two
Millcraft cheques for $906.81 and $923.81; a $1,200 Ottawa Gas cheque which was
actually $1,231.05; another cheque which she described as a $900 cheque, i.e.,
the C.L. Laroche cheque for $977; and another cheque which she described as a
$2,400 cheque, i.e., the Laroche cheque for $2,404.65. Those amounts total
$6,443.32.

McLennan J.A., giving judgment for the Court of
Appeal, set out the nine different cheques which were involved in the charge.
Those cheques are as follows:

It will be seen, therefore, that the accused
acknowledges the delivery to Lavergne of funds represented by cheques Nos. 1,
2, 5, 7 and 9 in that list. The Beaudry and Noël cheques are Nos. 3 and 6, so
this leaves unaccounted for only cheques Nos. 4 and 8, 4 being an Ottawa Gas
Company cheque for $347.99, and 8 being a C.L. Laroche cheque for $1,000. It is
possible that the accused, in her most inaccurate memory of those cheques which
she had used to cover deliveries of cash to Lavergne, forgot those two items.
If the accused’s story had been believed that neither the Beaudry nor the Noël
cheques represented any deduction from the assets of the town, it might have
gone far towards supporting, in the minds of the jury, her defence that in all
other cases she had acted on the orders of Lavergne and honestly

[Page 682]

believed she was justified in so doing, or at
least it might have raised in the minds of the jury a reasonable doubt.

If, on the other hand, she was not believed on
these two, the jury might well have felt that she had taken the $3,000
represented in those two cheques for herself personally and not to pass on to
Lavergne, and so would have disbelieved her defence that she honestly believed
she was under obligation to obey the orders of Lavergne. In the light of this
situation, it would seem that the trial judge was required to outline the
evidence adduced by the defence upon these two transactions in some particularity.
Failure to do so would, in essence, be failure to put to the jury the defence
of the accused. Yet the reference of the trial judge to these two transactions
is regrettably brief. As to the Beaudry cheque, there is failure to point out
the important fact that many persons had access to the drawer in which the
cheque was kept and to the receptacles where the money in the various accounts
reposed before such money was deposited in the bank, so that others beside the
accused could have removed from these receptacles the amount equal to that
represented by the cheque and cause the cheque to be placed amongst those to be
deposited in the place of the cash. As to the Noël cheque, the brief reference
thereto fails to mention the evidence of the accused that it was cashed from
funds on hand merely as a courtesty, i.e., that it had been simply the delivery
of money to the face value of a certified cheque after bank hours.

It is true, as has been pointed out above, that
the evidence of the accused is contrary to much of the evidence proved on
behalf of the Crown, and the jury might well have disbelieved the accused but
since it was the gist of the defence the jury should have had called to their
attention the evidence of the accused upon that theory of the defence, and, of
course, quite properly, the evidence contra, so that they could have come to
their decision whether the Crown had proved the charge beyond reasonable doubt.
I, therefore, am in agreement with the judgment of the Court of Appeal that the
trial judge’s failure to do so constituted non‑direction amounting to
mis-direction and that a new trial must be had. That, of course, is sufficient
to dispose of the appeal. However, some other grounds argued by counsel for the
accused before the Court of Appeal and either not accepted by that Court or not
dealt with in the Court of Appeal should be referred to, although briefly.

[Page 683]

McLennan J.A., in giving judgment of the Court
of Appeal, said:

Counsel for the appellant argued that each
of the nine transactions should have been made the subject of a separate count
and since they were not the conviction is void for uncertainty because a
general verdict on the indictment as it stands now does not reveal what amount
the jury found that the appellant had stolen. This charge is, however, that the
appellant between certain dates stole varying sums, in amounts and at times
unknown, to a total sum of $10,790.52. In such a case it is proper to charge a
general deficiency: Minchin v. The King, (1914) 23 C.C.C. 414. The proof
of the nine transactions was necessary to show the general deficiency and apart
from the first Millcraft cheque and the Noël cheque, if that was a substitution
for cash previously taken, there was no relation in time between the takings
and the substitutions of the cheques. If the charge had been that of falsifying
records under section 340 it would of course have been necessary to set out in
a separate count each of the transactions referred to, but that is not this
case. The appellant did not apply for particulars before or during the trial
under section 497 or to amend or divide the count under section 500. I would
not be disposed to quash the conviction on these grounds because in substance
the charge is of one continuous act of theft. In any event it is not a rule of
law but one of practice that in cases like this the charge should be divided
into as many counts as possible: Regina v. Tomlin, (1954) 38 C.A.C. 82.
However, if there is a new trial it will be desirable and of assistance in
directing the attention of the jury to the issues to be determined by them if
either particulars are given under section 497 of the means by which the
offence was committed by referring to each transaction or if that count be
divided into separate counts so as to separate, at least, the first Millcraft
transaction and the Noël and Beaudry transactions from the others.

I am in agreement with the view of McLennan J.A.
and have nothing to add thereto.

If McLennan J.A.’s suggestion is complied with
at the new trial, there will be no need to consider any question of the accused
being found guilty as charged, when in fact some amount smaller than the total
of $10,790.52 was proved beyond reasonable doubt. I must, however, express
dissent from the submission made by counsel during the argument of this appeal
that on the indictment if the evidence disclosed that only a lesser amount of
money had been stolen the jury could have returned a verdict of guilty of that
lesser amount but not guilty as charged. In my view, the instruction on the
form of the indictment presented at the former trial that the accused could
have been convicted had it been proved that she converted to her own use any
sum was a proper instruction.

The submission that the accused could not have
been convicted on the indictment as laid, in that it alleged that she had
converted the funds to her own use while the evidence

[Page 684]

at trial showed that at any rate as to some
indeterminate amount, perhaps $6,300, the accused had converted the funds of
the town so that they could be used by the mayor, Lavergne, raises a rather
difficult and important issue. To accede to the submission of the respondent’s
counsel herein, would enable an accused person to establish a sound defence by
merely proving that the funds converted were handed over to the third party, be
he a creditor or an ailing parent or an informal philanthropist such as
Lavergne alleged he was. The trial judge charged the jury on the basis of the
definition of theft in s. 269(1) of the Code that it mattered not whether the
accused had converted the funds to her own use or that of another. Counsel for
the accused, however, takes the position that the Crown had not charged theft
generally, which would have permitted such an instruction to the jury, but had
specifically charged the accused with conversion to her own use. It must be
remembered that until the accused gave evidence in her own defence the
allegation of conversion to the use of Lavergne had never been advanced. The
answer to this contention, in my opinion, is that given by the learned trial
judge when he said in his charge:

In fact the first instance when she took it
it was for use to do as she wished with. And the use she made of it was to give
it or some of it, surreptitiously, I suggest, to Lavergne.

In short, when the accused took the funds she
converted the funds to her use despite the fact that her use of them was to
deliver them to Lavergne. I distinguish cases such as R. v. Haurany[12] and R. v. Lurie[13], on the ground that there the charge was
obtaining by false pretences while the evidence showed that what the accused
did was to obtain the delivery of property to another by a false pretence and
never had possession himself. In the latter case, Goddard L.C.J., at p. 118,
said:

In this case, the cheques have been made
out to the company, there is no doubt that the company was the owner of those
cheques; it was always intended to be the owner. The only banking account into
which those cheques could have gone was the banking account of the company.

In the result, I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Non-capital murder—Expert
evidence—Defence of automation following brain injury—Psychiatrist expressing
opinion based on evidence of other witnesses—Whether evidence of psychiatrist
admissible.

The appellant was acquitted on a charge of
non-capital murder. In the course of a fight with the victim, the appellant was
knocked down or fell down and his head struck the pavement. The victim had
started to walk away when the appellant, having regained his feet, followed

[Page 562]

him and stabbed him fatally with a knife.
Some of the witnesses observed that when the appellant got up he staggered and
appeared to be dazed. The appellant advanced the defence of automation. This
defence was supported by a psychiatrist who had not examined the appellant
until more than three months after the incident but who had attended his trial
and listened to all the evidence as to the appellant’s head injury and his
behaviour immediately after receiving it. The expert was not asked hypothetical
questions but on the contrary was invited to express his opinion based on the
evidence which he had heard. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on the
ground that this evidence was inadmissible and should not have been accepted by
the trial judge even though no objections were taken by the Crown at the trial.
The accused appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and the verdict of acquittal restored.

Provided that the questions are so phrased as
to make clear what the evidence is on which an expert is being asked to found
his conclusion, the failure to put such questions in hypothetical form does not
of itself make the answers inadmissible. It is within the competence of the
trial judge in any case to insist upon the foundation for the expert’s opinion
being laid by way of hypothetical question if he feels this to be the best way
in which he can be assured of the matter being fully understood by the jury,
but this does not mean that the judge is necessarily precluded from permitting
the expert’s answer to go before the jury if the nature and foundation of his
opinion have been clearly indicated by other means. In the present case there
was no difficulty in concluding that the psychiatrist was proceeding on the
hypothesis that the appellant’s blow on the head and his conduct after
receiving it were as described by the uncontradicted evidence of the Crown
witnesses, and that his condition as to amnesia, headaches and other symptoms
was the condition which the appellant himself described. Where the evidence is
open to the construction that the premises upon which the expert’s opinion is
based were clearly presented to the jury, a Court of Appeal should be hesitant
to interfere with the ruling made by the trial judge as to the admissibility of
that opinion. All those concerned with the conduct of this trial were satisfied
that a proper basis had been laid for the admission of the doctor’s opinion.
Under these circumstances a Court of Appeal should, before excluding an
expert’s opinion, be able to make a clear finding that there was no material
before the jury to enable it to determine whether his conclusions were properly
founded or not. Such a finding was not justified in the present case. The trial
judge was justified in proceeding on the assumption that the hypothesis on
which the psychiatrist based his opinion had been made clear to the jury and he
was accordingly justified in admitting the evidence of that opinion and
commenting on it as he did.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], setting aside a
verdict of acquittal on a charge of non-capital murder and ordering a new
trial. Appeal allowed.

A. Maloney, Q.C., for the appellant,

W.C. Bowman, Q.C, for the respondent.

[Page 563]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—This is an appeal brought pursuant
to s. 597 (2)  of the Criminal Code  from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Ontario1 setting aside the verdict of a jury which had
acquitted the present appellant of the non-capital murder of one Hairedin Gafi
and directing that there be a new trial on the ground that certain evidence
given by a psychiatrist who was called by the defence was inadmissible and that
the trial judge was in error in accepting it and dealing with it as he did.

At the trial a number of Crown witnesses
testified that they were present on Dundas Street in the City of Toronto on the
afternoon of June 6, 1963, and there watched the course of a fight between Gafi
and the appellant which culminated in the appellant stabbing Gafi fatally in
the neck. Although the stories of the eye witnesses differ as to the details of
the affray, it is clear that blows were exchanged between the two men, that the
appellant was knocked down or fell down striking his head forcibly on the
pavement and that Gafi had started to walk away when the appellant, having
regained his feet, followed him and pulled out a knife with which he delivered
the fatal blow. Two of the onlookers observed that when the appellant got up he
staggered and appeared to be dazed, and one police officer also commented on
his apparently dazed condition, but the other witnesses to the fight made no
observation in this regard.

The defence advanced at the trial on behalf of
the appellant was that the blows to his head sustained when it struck the
sidewalk had the effect of depriving him of all voluntary control over his
actions so that he acted as an automaton for a period which included the time
when he stabbed Gafi, and that he was therefore not legally responsible for his
actions at that time. This defence was supported by the evidence of Dr. Ronald
Stokes, a psychiatrist and an Assistant to the Director of the Forensic Clinic
at the Toronto Psychiatric Hospital, who had not examined the appellant until
more than three months after the incident but who had attended his trial and
listened to all the evidence as to the appellant’s head injury and his
behaviour immediately after receiving it.

The reasons for the Court of Appeal rejecting
this evidence as inadmissible are well summarized in the decision 

[Page 564]

rendered on behalf of that Court by Porter
C.J.O. in which he said:

Counsel for the accused did not follow the
established practice of putting to the expert witness a hypothetical question
upon which he could properly base an expert opinion, but asked the expert
questions concerning his view of evidence given by witnesses. Dr. Stokes,
in fact was improperly permitted to express an opinion based on his own
assessment of the evidence. No objections were taken by counsel for the Crown
to this evidence, and the trial judge raised no objections, and admitted the
evidence without question or argument. In his charge the trial judge discussed
this evidence and treated it as if it had been properly admitted, and suggested
that the jury should give it a good deal of consideration. Indeed, the evidence
of Dr. Stokes was the only evidence that in any way touched upon the subject of
automation.

and he continued:

…I am of the opinion that the evidence as
presented by Dr. Stokes was inadmissible and the learned trial judge was in
error in accepting it and dealing with it in his charge in the way that he did.

The question of whether or not an accused person
was in a state of automatism so as not to be legally responsible at the time
when he committed the acts with which he is charged, is a question of fact, and
indeed may be the most vital question of fact in a criminal case, and it is
because the opinion of an expert witness on such a question can serve only to confuse
the issue unless the proven facts upon which it is based have been clearly
indicated to the jury that the practice has grown up of requiring counsel, when
seeking such an opinion, to state those facts in the form of a hypothetical
question. In cases where the expert has been present throughout the trial and
there is conflict between the witnesses, it is obviously unsatisfactory to ask
him to express an opinion based upon the evidence which he has heard because
the answer to such a question involves the expert in having to resolve the
conflict in accordance with his own view of the credibility of the witnesses
and the jury has no way of knowing upon what evidence he based his opinion.
Where, however, there is no conflict in the evidence, the same difficulty does
not necessarily arise and different considerations may therefore apply.

In M’Naghten’s Case[2], certain questions were put by the House of
Lords to the judges of England
and amongst these was the following:

Can a medical man conversant with the disease
of insanity, who never saw the prisoner previously to the trial, but who was
present during the

[Page 565]

whole trial and the examination of all the
witnesses, be asked his opinion as to the state of the prisoner’s mind at the
time of the commission of the alleged crime, or his opinion whether the
prisoner was conscious at the time of doing the act that he was acting contrary
to the law, or whether he was labouring under any and what delusion at the
time?

This question, which appears to me to be singularly
apt to the present circumstances, was answered by Tindal C.J., as follows:

In answer thereto, we state to your
Lordships, that we think the medical man, under the circumstances supposed,
cannot in strictness be asked his opinion in the terms above stated, because
each of those questions involves the determination of the truth of the facts
deposed to, which it is for the jury to decide, and the questions are not mere
questions upon a matter of science, in which case such evidence is admissible.
But where the facts are admitted or not disputed, and the question becomes
substantially one of science only, it may be convenient to allow the question
to be put in that general form, though the same cannot be insisted on as a
matter of right.

In answer to the same question, Mr. Justice
Maule, who expressed a separate opinion, indicated what in my view is the true
reason for excluding such a question when he said:

Supposing there is nothing else in the
state of the trial to make the questions suggested proper to be asked and
answered, except that the witness had been present and heard the evidence; it
is to be considered whether that is enough to sustain the question. In
principle it is open to this objection, that as the opinion of the witness is
founded on those conclusions of fact which he forms from the evidence, and as
it does not appear what those conclusions are, it may be that the evidence he
gives is on such an assumption of facts as makes it irrelevant to the inquiry.

In Regina v. Francis[3], the very question which had been asked of
the judges in the M’Naghten Case was considered by Baron Alderson and
Cresswell J. Baron Alderson was of opinion that the question should not be put
at all and that the decision in M’Naghton’s Case was wrong; but
Cresswell J., although apparently concurring in the result, is reported to have
observed that the answer in M’Naghten’s Case went no further than
deciding “that the question could not be put as a matter of right”. This latter
view appears to be shared by leading text writers. (See Phipson on Evidence,
10th ed., para. 1298, and Glanville Williams, Criminal Law, 2nd ed., para. 149,
Note 3 at page 452.

The case of R. v. Holmes,[4] is illustrative of the fact that the
opinion of experts on the very question at issue can be elicited without the
aid of a hypothetical question if the

[Page 566]

basis for the opinion is made apparent to the
jury. In that case the expert who had examined the accused before the trial was
questioned as to his opinion based on his behaviour after the alleged murder
had been committed. The manner in which the evidence was introduced and the
opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeal in England are well described in the
reasons for judgment of Lord Goddard C.J., at page 324 where he said:

In the present case the appellant, after a
savage attack on the murdered person, went to a police station, gave himself
up, said he was giving himself up for murder, and gave a detailed account of
what he had done and how he had done it. A medical witness who was called for the
defence, was asked in cross-examination:

You remember that I asked you the question
whether the accused’s conduct immediately after this incident would indicate to
you that he knew the nature of the act that he was committing and your reply
was ‘Yes’. That is so, is it not? A.—Yes. Q.—Would his conduct immediately
after indicate equally that he knew his conduct was contrary to the law of the
land. A.—Yes.

Counsel for the appellant has submitted
that those questions were inadmissible. Whatever fine distinctions may have
been drawn in days before or soon after M’Naghten’s Case, we can only
say that no member of the court has ever heard an objection being taken to such
questions as those. Moreover, if the objection prevailed, it would, as it seems
to us, put an insuperable difficulty in the way of the defence whenever they
were trying to establish insanity. For instance, if a medical witness could not
be asked whether the defendant’s conduct immediately after the act in respect
of which he was charged indicated that he knew his conduct was contrary to the
law of the land, the doctor being prepared to answer “No”, it would be a great
hardship on the defendant who was setting up a plea of insanity if the doctor
was not to be allowed to answer that question. It seems to the court that that
is essentially a question that may be asked and answered.

In commenting on what he described as “the
orthodox and accepted theory of the hypothetical question in our law”, the
learned editor of Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd ed., summarized the matter in para.
672 at page 793 in the following language:

The key to the situation, in short, is that
there may be two distinct subjects of testimony,—premises, and inferences or
conclusions; that the latter involves necessarily a consideration of the
former; and that the tribunal must be furnished with the means of rejecting the
latter if upon consultation they determine to reject the former, i.e. of
distinguishing conclusions properly founded from conclusions improperly
founded.

Provided that the questions are so phrased as to
make clear what the evidence is on which an expert is being asked to found his
conclusion, the failure of counsel to put such

[Page 567]

questions in hypothetical form does not of
itself make the answers inadmissible. It is within the competence of the trial
judge in any case to insist upon the foundation for the expert opinion being
laid by way of hypothetical question if he feels this to be the best way in
which he can be assured of the matter being fully understood by the jury, but
this does not, in my opinion, mean that the judge is necessarily precluded in
the exercise of his discretion in the conduct of the trial from permitting the
expert’s answer to go before the jury if the nature and foundation of his
opinion has been clearly indicated by other means.

In the present case there does not appear to me
to be any difficulty in concluding that in giving his opinion Dr. Stokes was
proceeding on the hypothesis that the appellant’s blow on the head and his
conduct after receiving it were as described by the uncontradicted evidence of
Crown witnesses, and that his condition as to amnesia, headaches and other
symptoms was the condition which he himself described.

As he was required to do, the learned trial
judge made it clear to the jury that they were not bound to accept the evidence
upon which the doctor based his opinion or the opinion itself when he said:
“You may accept or reject the evidence of any witness in whole or in part and
that applies to the experts—in this case the doctor—as it does to all other
evidence”.

If the jury disbelieved Bleta’s story of amnesia
and headaches, it would undoubtedly affect the weight which they attached to
Dr. Stokes’ evidence, but the possibility of this happening does not, in my
view, in any way affect the admissibility of that evidence.

In the same way the evidence of Dr. Golab, who
saw the appellant some five and a half hours after the fight and pronounced him
to be then quite normal and well-oriented, might well have been viewed as substantially
weakening the force of Dr. Stokes’ opinion, based as it was in such a large
degree upon hypotheses rather than personal examination, but this would reflect
on the reliability rather than the admissibility of the Stokes evidence.

As has been indicated, the decision as to
whether a sufficient basis has been laid for the admission of an expert opinion
rests in each case in the discretion of the trial judge, the exercise of which
is dependant upon many factors, all

[Page 568]

of which may not be fully appreciated by a court
of appeal which is confined to the printed record of the proceedings in its
reconstruction of the atmosphere existing at the trial. For this reason, in
cases where the evidence is open to the construction that the premises upon which
the expert opinion is based were clearly presented to the jury, a court of
appeal should, in my opinion, be hesitant to interfere with the ruling made by
the trial judge as to the admissibility of that opinion. It is particularly
noteworthy that in the present case Crown counsel not only took no objection to
the admissibility of the evidence, but without framing a hypothetical question
of any kind himself, elicited a much more detailed opinion from the doctor than
had theretofore been given as to the nature of the appellant’s injury. This
appears to me to be clear confirmation of the fact that all those concerned
with the conduct of the trial who saw and heard the witnesses were satisfied
that a proper basis had been laid for the admission of the doctor’s opinion.
Under these circumstances it seems to me that, before excluding an expert’s
opinion, a court of appeal should be able to make a clear finding that there
was no material before the jury to enable it to determine whether his
conclusions were properly founded or not. I do not, with respect, consider that
such a finding is justified in the present case.

In instructing the jury the learned trial judge,
as I have pointed out, told them that they were free to reject the evidence of
the doctor in whole or in part, he indicated to them that the doctor’s opinion
was based on the evidence of the appellant’s amnesia and the blow to his head,
he reviewed the evidence as to his staggering and dazed condition and concluded
by saying:

On the issue of automatism I come now to
the important evidence of Dr. Ronald Stokes. He is an experienced psychologist,
he examined the accused and heard all of the important evidence at this trial.
His evidence is not contradicted and while you may still refuse to accept it
you should most certainly give it a good deal of consideration. The considered
opinion of Dr. Stokes in this case is that the accused was so affected by the
blow on the head that he suffered a brain injury temporary in nature but which
caused amnesia, which is a loss of memory, and which in turn makes it
impossible for him to give anyone an accurate account of what happened although
he may attempt to do so, as he did.

Later in his charge, the learned trial judge
continued:

…the doctor says that the actions of the accused
when he stabbed the deceased were purely automatic and without any volition on
the part

[Page 569]

of the accused. He was, in fact, in the
condition of a sleep walker or an epileptic. During this seizure, and since he
had been in a fight, he automatically continued it. If you accept that
evidence, then as I have told you, the law is that the accused is not guilty of
anything.

Dr. Stokes considered all of the
circumstances and the actions of the accused both before and after his arrest
and gives as his opinion, and without doubt on his part, that this is a true
case of automatism. It is for you to decide whether the evidence of
Dr. Stokes should be accepted or rejected.

With the greatest respect for the views
expressed by The Court of Appeal for Ontario, I am of the opinion that the
learned trial judge was justified in proceeding on the assumption that the
hypothesis on which Dr. Stokes based his opinion had been made clear to the
jury and that he was accordingly also justified in admitting the evidence of
that opinion and commenting on it as he did.

In view of this conclusion, it is unnecessary
for me to consider the other points raised in support of this appeal.

I would allow the appeal and restore the verdict
of the jury acquitting the accused and the order of the learned trial judge
made pursuant thereto.

Appeal allowed and verdict of
acquittal restored.

ON
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR THE
NORTHWEST TERRITORIES.

Criminal law—Constitutional law—Indians—Game
laws—Shooting duck out of season in Northwest Territories—Migratory Birds
Convention Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 179, s.
12(1).

The appellant, a treaty
Indian, was found guilty by a magistrate at Yellowknife in the Northwest
Territories of killing a migratory bird during the closed season in violation of Reg. 5(1) (a) of the Migratory
Bird Regulations, contrary to s. 12(1) of the Migratory Birds
Convention Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 179. The appellant admitted that
he shot the bird for food. His defence was that under Treaty No. 11 made
in 1921 he was entitled to hunt and shoot
ducks for food regardless of any regulations
or legislation, whether in season or not. The bird was identified as a female
mallard duck. The conviction was set aside by the Territorial
 Court, which also expressed a doubt
as to whether the duck was wild or
domestic. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, the conviction was restored on the grounds that the Act was valid
legislation and abrogated any rights
given to Indians by treaty. Leave was granted to appeal to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

The doubt expressed by the
trial judge as to whether the duck in question was a wild duck was a question of law alone, since the validity of this conclusion was dependant upon the true
meaning to be attached to the words ""wild duck"" as used in the
statute and regulations. There was no
room for doubt that a mallard is a species of wild duck within the meaning of the Act, and under the circumstances
the doubts expressed by the trial
judge were only consistent with his erroneous opinion that a wild duck
which once has been tamed or confined and is later found at large is not then a
wild duck within the meaning of

the statute. Hamps v.

Appeal and this Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. On the merits of the appeal, the reasons and conclusions of the Court of Appeal should be upheld.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for the Northwest Territories[1],
restoring the conviction of the appellant. Appeal dismissed.

W. G. Morrow, Q.C., and Mrs. E. R. Hagel, for the appellant.

D. H. Christie, Q.C., and J. M. Bentley, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

HALL J.:—This is an appeal, pursuant
to leave, by Michael Sikyea from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for the
Northwest Territories allowing an appeal by the respondent from the judgment of
Mr. Justice Sissons of the Territorial Court of the Northwest Territories who
had allowed an appeal by the appellant by way of trial de novo from his
conviction at Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, on May 7, 1962, by W. V.
England, a Justice of the Peace in and for the Northwest Territories for an
offence contrary to subs. (1) of s. 12 of the Migratory Birds Convention Act,
R.S.C. 1952, c. 179. The charge on which the appellant was convicted was that
he—

on the 7th day of May AD 1962 at or near
the Municipal District of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories did
unlawfully kill a migratory bird in an area described in Schedule A of the
Migratory Bird Regulations at a time not during an open season for that bird in
the area in the aforementioned schedule, in violation of Section 5(1) (a) of
the Migratory Bird Regulations, thereby committing an offence contrary to
Section 12(1) of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, Chapter 179, R.S.C.
1952.

The regulation mentioned provides that:

Unless otherwise permitted under these
Regulations to do so, no person shall

(a) in any area described in
Schedule A, kill, hunt, capture, injure, take or molest a migratory bird at any
time except during an open season specified for that bird and that area in
Schedule A,

Section 12(1) of the Act provides that every
person who violates any regulation is, for each offence, liable upon summary
conviction to a fine of not more than three hundred








 [Page 644]

dollars and not less than ten dollars, or to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both fine and
imprisonment.

Part XI of Schedule A to the Regulations defines
the open season for ducks in the Northwest Territories as being from September 1 to October 15 inclusive.

Under s. 3(b) (i) ""migratory game
birds"" include ""wild ducks"".

The appellant testified at the trial de novo
before Sissons J. and in his evidence admitted having shot the duck which was
in evidence as part of the Crown's case as testified to by Constable Robin. The
appellant also said that he had shot the duck for his own use as food when he
saw it swimming on a pond. This pond, according to Constable Robin, was in the
open country in the Northwest Territories six miles out of Yellowknife.

The appellant's defence was in effect that he
was a Treaty Indian, a member of the Yellowknife Band and that under Treaty No.
11 made in 1921 he was entitled to hunt and shoot ducks for food regardless of
any regulations or legislation, whether in season or not.

Sissons J. made the following findings:

THAT the appellant was a Treaty Indian and
one of the Band included under Treaty No. 11;

THAT on May 7, 1962 the appellant shot the
duck for which he was being prosecuted;

THAT the duck was a female mallard.

Sissons J. then dealt at length with the contention
that the appellant as a Treaty Indian was lawfully entitled to shoot ducks for
food at any time of the year. He concluded his judgment by saying:

I find that the Migratory Birds Convention
Act has no application to Indians hunting for food, and does not curtail their
hunting rights.

He had, however, preceded that finding with this
statement:

It is clear that the evidence does not
establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the female Mallard which was shot was
a wild duck. In spite of the argument of the Crown, I cannot draw from the
circumstantial evidence the inference that it was a wild duck. The Rule in
Hodge's case is in the way. The accused therefore cannot be found Guilty of the
offence with which he is charged.

but having said that, he immediately added:

The real defence and the important issue in
this case is that the Migratory Birds Convention Act has no application to
Indians engaged in the

[Page 645]

pursuit of their ancient right to hunt,
trap and fish game and fish for food at all seasons of the year, on all
unoccupied Crown lands.

The substantial question argued on the hearing
of this appeal was whether the provisions of the Migratory Birds Convention
Act, supra, and the Regulations made there-under apply to Treaty Indians in
the Northwest Territories hunting and killing ducks for food at any time of the
year.

But the point is validly made that an appeal to
this Court in a case of this kind can be on a question of law alone and that if
the statement of Sissons J. above quoted is a finding of mixed fact and law, no
appeal lay to the Court of Appeal or lies to this Court. What the learned judge
was deciding in the passage above quoted was that there was some doubt on the
evidence as to whether the duck in question was a ""wild duck"" within
the meaning of the Migratory Birds Convention Act. The validity of his
conclusion is dependent upon the true meaning to be attached to the words
""wild duck"" as used in the statute and regulations, and this is, in
my view, ""a question of law alone"". See Vail v. The Queen[2]. A mallard duck is
defined in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary as a ""wild duck"". It is also
referred to in Canadian Water Birds, Game Birds: Birds of Prey, by P. A.
Taverner as ""perhaps the choice duck of the wild-fowler"" and in the
Catalogue of Canadian Birds by J. Macoun and J. M. Macoun, published by the
Geological Survey of Canada as ""the most abundant duck in the Northwest
Territories and British Columbia, breeding near ponds and lakes from lat. 49°
to the borders of the Barren Lands."" Mallards are also referred to as wild
birds in the publication Canadian Bird Names, published by the Canadian Wild
Life Service, 1962.

The facts are not in dispute; the duck in
question was a mallard which was shot on a pond some six miles from Yellowknife in the Northwest
 Territories in the month of May at which time such a
bird found in this region would be in the nesting grounds area and would
probably be starting to nest.

There is evidence that if such a bird were tamed
it would be very difficult to distinguish it from one which was wild, and in
fact an expert called on behalf of the Crown was unable to say whether the dead
duck, which was an exhibit

[Page 646]

in this case, had been tamed during its
lifetime, and it is this evidence which seems to have caused Sissons J. the
doubts he expressed.

There appears to me to be no room for doubt that
a mallard is a species of wild duck within the meaning of the Migratory
Birds Convention Act and under the circumstances the doubts expressed by
Sissons J. are only consistent with his having erroneously formed the opinion
that a wild duck which has once been tamed or confined and is later found at
large in the nesting area at a time when it would be likely to nest is not then
a ""wild duck"" within the meaning of the statute. The contrary is the
case. A wild duck which has once been tamed or confined reverts, on escaping,
to being a wild duck in the eyes of the law. See Hamps v. Darby[3]. Accordingly, the Court
of Appeal had jurisdiction and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the
appeal.

On the substantive question involved, I agree
with the reasons for judgment and with the conclusions of Johnson J.A. in the
Court of Appeal[4]. He has
dealt with the important issues fully and correctly in their historical and
legal settings, and there is nothing which I can usefully add to what he has
written.

The appeal must, therefore, be dismissed. There
will be no order as to costs, counsel having stated that costs were not being
asked for by either party, regardless of the result.

Appeal dismissed; no order as to
costs.

ON APPEAL FEOM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN.

Criminal law—Summary convictions—Appeals—Whether
affidavit of service identified the respondent sufficiently—Criminal Code , 1963–64
(Can.), c. 51, ss. 722, 733.

The information upon which the appellant Chouinard was
convicted on summary conviction of impaired driving described the informant as
""Roger Eugene Moore, a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
Saskatoon, Sask."" The affidavit of service of the notice of appeal to the
District Court stated that Corporal Roger E. Moore of the Royal Canada Mounted
Police was served with the notice, but the affidavit did not state that Moore
was the informant. Pursuant

[Page 280]

to an objection by the Crown, the District Court Judge refused
to hear the appeal on the ground that he had no jurisdiction since he could not
satisfy himself that the respondent had been served with the notice of appeal
as required by s. 722  of the Criminal Code . The Court of Appeal dismissed the
appeal from that judgment. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this
Court. 

A similar situation presented itself in the case of the
appellant McDonnell charged and found guilty of unlawfully selling liquor,
where the informant was described as ""Lee J. Corey, of Saskatoon, Sask.,
Peace Officer"".

A. W. Prociuk, for the appellants.

B. L. Strayer, for the respondent.

At the conclusion of the argument, the following judgment
was delivered

Taschereau J.
(orally, for the Court):—It will not be necessary to hear you in reply, Mr.
Prociuk. We are all of opinion that this appeal should be allowed. We think
that the affidavit of service which was filed was sufficient, as the
presumption would be that Roger E. Moore was the respondent, unless that fact
was questioned, which it was not. Had it been doubtful whether Moore was the
respondent, we are of opinion that the learned District Court Judge could and
should have looked at the information which would have shown at once that Moore
was in fact the respondent.

We would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the
judgment of the Court of Appeal1
and of the District Court Judge and remit the case to the District Court Judge
to be heard and disposed of.

The decisions of this Court, referred to in the reasons of
the Court of Appeal, are not decisive of the point raised on this appeal. The appellant
is entitled to his costs throughout.

The decision in the Chouinard case will apply also to the
McDonnell case. That appeal also will be allowed with costs throughout.

Appeals allowed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE
DIVISION.

Criminal law—Capital murder—Body of alleged victim never
found—Circumstantial evidence—Theory that one of two accused merely an
accessory after fact to murder committed by other—Whether sufficient reality to
theory to require trial judge to place it before jury.

The two appellants, W and H, were convicted as principals, on
a charge of capital murder. The victim's body was never found. The Crown's case
relied exclusively on circumstantial evidence, and was based largely on the
testimony of one O who testified as to events on the night of the alleged
murder as well as to events before and after. A strong motive for murder was
proved against W who devised the plan for the killing, but there was no
evidence of motive against H who heard the plan on the day the deed was done.
The common defence of both accused was that the death had not been
satisfactorily proved, and that the Crown's case failed to meet the
requirements for a conviction. In the Court of Appeal it was contended, for the
first time, that the jury could have found that H was concerned not as a
principal but as an accessory after the fact and that the trial judge erred in
not putting this defence to the jury. The conviction was affirmed by the Court
of Appeal. The accused appealed to this Court where the same submission on
behalf of H was repeated.

Held: The appeal of W should be dismissed.

Held further (Ritchie and Hall JJ. dissenting): The
appeal of H should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ.: The jury
was correctly instructed that the case put against the accused was that they
were both involved as principals, also as to the defence of both accused and as
to the credibility of O's testimony. There was ample evidence upon which a jury
could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim was dead, even though his
body had not been found, and that the two accused were guilty as-principals in
his killing.

With respect to the submission of H, there was no possible
ground for any instructions that, on any view of the evidence, H could be an
accessory after the fact and not a principal. There could not be found in the

[Page 267]

record any evidence which would convey a sense of reality in
the submission. Failure of counsel to raise the matter does not relieve the
trial judge of his duty to place a possible defence before the jury but there
must be something beyond fantasy to suggest the existence of the duty.

Per Ritchie and Hall JJ., dissenting as to H's appeal:
A trial judge, when addressing a jury in a criminal case, is not under a duty
to explore all the remotest and most fantastic possibilities. Even though the
alternative defence of H that he was an accessory after the fact rather than a
principal relied on improbable suppositions, and even though it was extremely
unlikely in the present case that the jury would have found in favour of such a
defence, under all the circumstances such a direction should have been given.
It could not be said to be impossible that the jury would have found H to be an
accessory. The failure of the trial judge to place that defence before the jury
entitled H to a new trial even though it was not raised at his original trial.

As to the case of W, the evidence against him was
overwhelming.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division1,
affirming the convictions of the accused for capital murder. Appeal dismissed,
Ritchie and Hall JJ. dissenting as to H's appeal.

T. J. Nugent, for the appellant Huculak.

F. S. Lieber, for the
appellant Workman.

J. W. K. Shortreed, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Judson JJ. was
delivered by

Judson J.:—The
two appellants were convicted on a charge of the capital murder of one Frank
Willey. Their appeal was dismissed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court of Alberta2.
They appeal to this Court under s. 597 (a) of the Criminal Code . The
two accused were separately represented on both appeals. Neither gave evidence
at the trial nor did they call any witnesses.

The learned trial judge instructed the jury that the case
put against the accused was that they were both involved as principals in the
offence charged and, in my respectful opinion, it was not open to objection on
that basis, and, in fact, no objection was made by either counsel for the
accused. The defence of both accused, also correctly and adequately put to the
jury by the judge, was that the death of Frank Willey had not been
satisfactorily proved, his body

[Page 268]

not having been found, and that the Crown's case, being
based largely on circumstantial evidence, failed to meet the requirements for a
conviction.

For the first time in the Court of Appeal counsel for
Huculak submitted that on one view of the evidence, the jury could have found
that his client was concerned not as a principal but as an accessory after the
fact and that the learned trial judge erred in not putting this defence to the
jury. The same submission was repeated in this Court and this makes it
necessary for me to review the evidence.

Frank Willey was a golf professional in the City of
Edmonton. At the time of his disappearance he was living in the same house as
his wife and two children although there was strong evidence of an adulterous
association between Workman and Mrs. Willey. Fourteen months before the
disappearance of Willey, Workman had enquired of an Alberta solicitor whether
it was possible for a guilty party in an adulterous association to get a
substantial part of the property of the opposite party. When he was told that
this was a very improbable result, he said to the solicitor ""we'll just
have to kill him."" This was in February 1961. In July 1961, Mrs. Willey
sued her husband for a judicial separation and claimed maintenance in the sum
of $800 per month. Willey defended the action and also counterclaimed against
Workman for damages for enticement and harbouring. This action was settled in
January 1962.

Huculak did not come to Edmonton until February 1962. There
is no evidence that he had ever known or even met Mrs. Willey or her husband or
that he knew his co-accused Workman before he came to Edmonton or that he had
any motive for joining in the killing of Willey.

One Paul Osborne, a neighbour of Huculak and one who had
known him in Eastern Canada, gave evidence that on April 18, he met Workman and
Huculak and had a conversation with them in a car, and that Workman suggested
that he would like somebody ""worked over."" The three met again the
following morning and, according to Osborne, Workman was still talking about
""working this guy over."" He eventually said that he wanted him killed
and wanted it to look like an accident. ""Knock this guy out, take him out
in the country and hit him with another car."" No name was mentioned and
Osborne said that he immediately refused to have anything to do with the plan.
Part of the plan was

[Page 269]

to lure the victim to a partially built house somewhere.
Workman telephoned Osborne at one o'clock in the afternoon of the same day,
April 19, to find out whether his decision was final.

On the same day, Willey received a telephone call for the
delivery of a set of ladies golf clubs, not to exceed $225 in value, as a
present for the caller's wife. He accepted the order, procured the golf clubs
and agreed to deliver them at 9 o'clock that night. There is evidence that on
the afternoon of April 19, Workman was at the house where the killing is
alleged to have been done and spoke to the painters. The purpose of his enquiry
seems to have been to find out how late they would be working. Huculak was not
with him. The house was under construction by a builder who employed Workman as
a book-keeper.

On this date, April 19, Willey arrived home for dinner with
the golf clubs and an extra bag in his car. He had dinner with his wife and
family and with his sister and mother, who were visiting from Vancouver. After
dinner he left with the car to deliver the golf clubs. A neighbour gave
evidence of the presence of two cars and two men at a certain house. The two
cars were identified as being white in colour. Willey owned an Oldsmobile which
had a white body and brown top, and Workman had hired a white Pontiac
a few days before April 19. It was in this house, which was the one
which Workman had visited during the afternoon, that the police found a lot of
blood, even after cleaning-up operations.

Between 9 and 10 on the same evening, April 19, Workman
brought a tire to a service station. This tire came from Willey's car. At about
3 a.m. the following morning, he came back to this service station and picked
up the wrong tire and rim. Instead of picking up the one from the Olds-mobile
that he had left, he picked up one from a Cadillac belonging to another
customer. This tire and rim were later found on Willey's car. There is a clear
inference from this evidence that Workman at least was in possession of
Willey's car when this tire and rim were removed and replaced by another not
belonging to the car.

[Page 270]

To resume with Osborne's evidence, he said that about 10
p.m. on the evening of April 19, he received a telephone call from Workman who
was enquiring about the whereabouts of Huculak:

Q. What did he say?

A. He asked me if I had seen Mr. Huculak.

Q. What did you say?

A. I said no.

Q. Anything else?

A. Oh, he said something about—I asked him what was the
matter and he said everything went haywire. I said, you don't mean to tell me
you went through with that thing and he said yes.

Q. Did you—did he ask or say anything more?

A. He asked me if I would phone around and see if I could
get hold of Mr. Huculak.

Q. And what did you say?

A. I said I would, yes.

Q. Did you?

A. No sir I didn't.

Then, at 11.30 p.m., in response to a telephone call from
Mrs. Huculak, Osborne and his wife went to the apartment where the Huculaks
lived and which was close to where the Osbomes lived. He and his wife sat up
with Mrs. Huculak until about 3 a.m. when Workman and Huculak came to the, apartment
together. Osborne noticed nothing unusual about Workman's appearance but he did
notice that Huculak was very disturbed.

Well, Mr. Huculak was in pretty rough shape. I took him in
the washroom and calmed him down. He kept mentioning about this guy's eyes
sticking out of his head and something hanging out of the back of his head and
he was just all shook up.

Workman also joined them in the bathroom. When they
returned to the living-room Workman told Huculak to get rid of his shoes, which
were very muddy. Mrs. Huculak cleaned them. Osborne said that the two stayed
for about an hour and then went out again. On being asked whether either of
them said anything before leaving, Osborne replied:

Yes, Mr. Huculak said there was a body in a shed somewhere
and they had to go out and bury it.

Osborne had a further conversation with Huculak over the
Easter week-end. He was not sure whether it was Satur-

[Page 271]

day or Sunday. April 20 was Good Friday. This is the
conversation that he reported with Huculak:

A. He mentioned something to me about something coming off a
wrench or something, some bandages or tape or something that flew off.

Q. Did he say when it flew off or what caused it to fly off?

A. He said when the person was hit some tape or something on
the end of this wrench flew off.

Q. Did he say anything else at this time?

A. Something about they would have to—if I remember
correctly, they would have to go back to this house and get it, something to
that effect.

Q. Back to the house?

A. To get this tape or whatever it was, I wasn't too clear
on it, I wasn't listening to him too good.

Q. Did he say anything about the burying which they had
talked about before?

A. Oh yes, he said they couldn't get this bury deep enough
into the ground or something, the ground was frozen and they couldn't bury him
deep enough.

On being brought back to the night of April 19 or the early
morning of April 20, Osborne reported one further item of conversation—that
they had to go back and clean up this house. Osborne also said that several
days later Workman brought a Pontiac car into his driveway
for the purpose of borrowing a hose to wash out the trunk of the car, and that
a few days later he went for a drive in the country with Workman in the Pontiac. They turned off the main highway after driving south
for about 12 miles and drove another 15 or 16 miles into the country. Workman
stopped the car and told Osborne to drive down the road and come back in about
20 minutes to pick him up. Osborne said he did this but Workman said nothing
about the purpose of the trip. He also said that at some time Huculak expressed
a fear about some woman talking to the police about the night in question and
that Workman said that he was not worried about that.

Rose Francis, the woman with whom Osborne was living and who
passed as Mrs. Osborne, also gave evidence of the return of Huculak and Workman
to the Huculak apartment about 3 a.m. in the early morning of April 20. She
said that Huculak looked scared and that his wife cleaned his shoes, that
Osborne, Workman and Huculak were all in the bathroom together and that Workman
and Huculak remained in the apartment until about 4.30 a.m. She did not hear
the

[Page 272]

conversation in the bathroom. She did hear Workman say-that
he was glad that it was a holiday week-end so that he could go back and clean
the walls.

It is apparent that if the jury believed Osborne, there was
a very strong circumstantial case against both the accused on a charge of
capital murder. The learned trial judge gave clear directions on the question
of credibility and pointed out that Osborne's criminal record went to the
question of credibility. He also raised the question why it was that when
Workman called about 10 p.m., he was enquiring about the whereabouts of Huculak
if Workman and Huculak had been working in concert.

The defence submitted by counsel for Workman and put to the
jury by the learned trial judge as applicable to both defendants was based upon
what was alleged to be an infirm circumstantial case. With evidence of the kind
that I have outlined and with the jury adequately charged on Osborne's
evidence, including its weaknesses, I can see no possible ground for any
instruction that, on any view of the evidence, Huculak could be an accessory
after the fact and not a principal. Before this could be done, there must be
found in the record some evidence which would convey a sense of reality in the
submission: Kelsey v. The Queen3.
Failure of counsel to raise the matter does not relieve the trial judge of
his duty to place a possible defence before the jury but there must be
something beyond fantasy to suggest the existence of the duty. The Court of
Appeal, in the exercise of its function under s. 583A(3)  (b) of the Criminal
Code , in dismissing the appeals found no error on this ground and I
respectfully agree.

There was a full review of the evidence in the charge of the
learned trial judge. It was again reviewed in the reasons of the Court of
Appeal and, finally, before this Court. My conclusion is firm that there was
ample evidence upon which a jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that
Willey was dead, even though his body had not been found, and that the two
accused were guilty as principals in his killing.

While there might be a question of the admissibility against
Huculak of evidence of the solicitor's conversation with Workman in February
1961, it was admissible against Workman for the reasons given by the Court of
Appeal.

[Page 273]

Huculak was not identified with any motive or animosity that
Workman may have entertained and this was plain to be seen. But on the evidence
of Osborne, which the jury must have accepted, Huculak was actively involved in
the plan and in its execution. It is for this reason that I would hold that
there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in the judge's failure
to instruct the jury that the solicitor's evidence was admissible only against
Workman.

The appeals of both appellants must be dismissed.

The judgment of Ritchie and Hall JJ. was delivered by Ritchie J. (dissenting as to
Huculak's appeal):—This appeal is brought pursuant to the provisions
of s. 597A  of the Criminal Code  from a judgment of the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta4
affirming the conviction of both the appellants on a charge of the capital
murder of Frank Willey.

The evidence has been reviewed in the reasons for judgment of
my brother Judson, which I have had the advantage of reading, and it would be
superfluous for me to repeat it.

The main argument advanced by Mr. Nugent on behalf of the
appellant Huculak was that the evidence against his client was not necessarily
inconsistent with his having been an accessory after the fact rather than a
party to the murder, and although this defence was not raised by counsel at the
trial the failure of the trial judge to direct the jury with respect to it
nevertheless constituted a miscarriage of justice entitling Huculak to a new
trial.

It appears to me to be established that the failure of a
defence counsel to advance an alternative argument does not relieve the judge
from the duty of directing the jury with respect to it if there is any evidence
to justify such a direction. This is supported by the decision of Viscount
Simon in Mancini v. Director of Public Prosecutions5, and the decision of Lord
Reading in Rex v. Hopper6,
is to the same effect.

In this Court, in the case of McAskill v. The King7, Duff J., as he then was,
had occasion to say:

The able and experienced judge who presided at the trial
properly directed the attention of the jury to the defence as it was put before
them by counsel for the prisoner; and having done this, he did not ask

[Page 274]

them to apply their minds to the further issue which we have
just defined. It was the prisoner's right, however, notwithstanding the course
of his counsel at the trial to have the jury instructed upon this feature of
the case. We think, therefore, that there must be a new trial.

The position of a Court of Appeal in such circumstances appears
to me to be well described in the decision of Lord Tucker speaking for the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Bullard v. The Queen8:

In the present case the fact that the jury rejected the
defence of self-defence does not necessarily mean that the evidence for the
defence was not of such kind that, even if not accepted in its entirety, it
might not have left them in reasonable doubt whether the prosecution had
discharged the onus which lay on them of proving that the killing was
unprovoked. Their Lordships do not shrink from saying that such a result
would have been improbable, but they cannot say it would have been impossible. ...Every
man on trial for murder has the right to have the issue of manslaughter left to
the jury if there is any evidence upon which such a verdict can be given. To
deprive him of this right must of necessity constitute a grave miscarriage of
justice and it is idle to speculate what verdict the jury would have reached.
Their Lordships are accordingly of opinion that the verdict of guilty of murder
cannot stand in this case.

The same considerations, in my opinion, apply wherever it
can be said that any alternative defence could properly arise on the facts in a
murder case but it must be borne in mind that when non-direction by a trial
judge is made a ground of appeal it is to be considered subject to the
conditions outlined by Fauteux J. in Kelsey v. The Queen9, where he said:

The allotment of any substance to an argument or of any
value to a grievance resting on the omission of the trial judge from mentioning
such argument must be conditioned on the existence in the record of some
evidence or matter apt to convey a sense of reality in the argument and in the
grievance.

I am satisfied that there is ample evidence in the record
before us to justify the jury in finding that Willey was killed, that Workman
had a motive for killing him and that he did in fact cause him to be lured to a
partially-built house where he was killed. The circumstances are also
undoubtedly consistent with Huculak having taken part in the murder, but the
narrow question to be considered is whether it can be said with certainty that
a rational jury, after being instructed in the manner now suggested, would
necessarily have concluded, in fight of all the evidence,

[Page 275]

that these circumstances were entirely inconsistent with
Huculak's participation being limited to assisting in the disposal of the body
and the cleaning up of the mess occasioned by the murder.

While it is appreciated that motive is not a necessary
ingredient in the crime of murder, it nevertheless appears to me that the
strong motive proved against Workman who devised and propounded the plan for
killing Willey, and the complete absence of any evidence of motive for murder
on the part of Huculak who heard the plan for the first time on the morning of
the day the deed was done, place the two appellants in somewhat different
categories and that this is something which can properly be taken into
consideration in determining whether a separate defence should have been
suggested to the jury by someone on Huculak's behalf. Save as hereinafter set
forth, no attempt was made to sever the defences in any way.

The learned trial judge, during the course of his
instructions to the jury as to the law, made the following statements:

1. The onus is on the Crown to establish to you, to your
satisfaction, first, that Frank Willey is dead; secondly, that Frank Willey came
to his death as a result of the actions of these two accused or one of them, or
either of them, and that when the act causing death was carried into effect it
was carried into effect as part of a planned and premeditated scheme to kill
Frank Willey.

2. You must consider the evidence to determine the question
of whether or not he came to his death through the criminal act or acts of the
two accused in concert or either one of them by themselves.

3. If, however, you are satisfied that the death came about,
that it was done by the accused or one or either of them, yet you are not
satisfied of the planning and deliberation but you were satisfied that the two
accused or either of them intended to kill but without the planning and
deliberation then the verdict would be of murder, not capital murder … What is
more, and I should make it clear to you, that if in your consideration of the
evidence there were doubts in your minds as to whether one or the other of the
two accused has the essential elements proved against him but that you are
satisfied that it has been proved against the other, you can only convict the
one.

In my view, these very proper instructions to the jury
cannot be considered as a substitute for an express direction as to the defence
that Huculak was an accessory after the fact if it can be said, to use the
language of Fauteux J. in the Kelsey case, supra, that there
exists ""in the record some evidence or matter apt to convey a sense of
reality"" to such a defence.

[Page 276]

I think it must be accepted that the jury believed the
evidence to the effect that on the morning of the 19th of April Workman
proposed that Huculak and Osborne should join him in carrying out his plan to
kill a man which Osborne refused to do, that Willey was lured to an empty house
which two men were seen to be leaving at 9:45 p.m. in cars not dissimilar to
Willey's Oldsmobile and Workman's rented Chevrolet, and that about 15 minutes
after the murder had been committed Workman was telephoning to Osborne telling
him that everything had gone ""haywire"" and asking him if he could
""get hold of Huculak"".

In my view, the question of whether or not a jury could
properly have accepted the theory that the circumstances were not inconsistent
with Huculak's involvement being limited to the role of an accessory after the
fact must depend in large measure upon the weight to be attached to this
telephone conversation, which was reported by Osborne as follows:

Q. From whom did you get the call?

A. From Mr. Workman.

Q. The accused?

A. Yes sir.

Q. What did he say?

A. He asked me if I had seen Huculak.

Q. What did you say?

A. I said no.

Q. Anything else?

A. Oh, he said something about—I asked him what was the
matter and he said everything went haywire. I said you don't mean to tell me
you went through with that thing and he said yes.

Q. Did you—did he ask or say anything more?

A. He asked me if I would phone around and see if I could
get hold of Mr. Huculak.

Q. And what did you say?

A. I said I would, yes.

Q. Did you?

A. No sir, I didn't.

'The only comment on this conversation made to the jury by anyone
was the following observation by the learned trial judge:

Now one of the things that struck my mind as being a matter
to consider in weighing the entire evidence of Osborne, and this is no
reflection of his credibility, but on the basis of it being true one wonders
why he gave evidence to the effect that at something like 11 o'clock at night
on the evening of the 20th of April 1962 he had a phone call from Workman

[Page 277]

in which Workman said something in effect that things had
gone haywire. He wanted to know where Huculak was and Workman asked him, he
didn't go through with that thing and he said yes. The query comes to mind that
if Workman and Huculak had been working in concert in carrying out this plan
just why it would be that Workman wouldn't know where Huculak was at that time
of night when it is remembered that they both ultimately came into Huculak's
suite at something after 3 o'clock in the morning. It just leaves a query in
one's mind.

It is obvious that in this passage where the learned judge
said ""and Workman asked him, he didn't go through with that thing …""
he meant ""and Osborne asked him …"" and it is equally clear from the
evidence that the call was at 10 o'clock on the 19th and not at 11 o'clock on
the 20th.

It is now suggested that the trial judge should not have
stopped at telling the jury that this evidence left ""a query"" in his
mind but that he should have gone on to point out that it was open to them to
reach the conclusion that Huculak was an ""accessory after the fact""
rather than a principal in the murder, if they took the view that the other
evidence, viewed in the light of this telephone conversation, was not
inconsistent with Huculak, having backed out of the plan, failing to turn up at
the time of the murder and subsequently having been persuaded by Workman to
help in the disposal of the body.

The question, of course, is whether some such instruction
should have been given by the learned trial judge and whether if it had been
given a rational jury could have concluded that the whole evidence viewed in
this manner was not entirely inconsistent with Huculak being an accessory after
the fact rather than a party to the murder.

Osborne's story of the return of Huculak and Workman to the
Huculak apartment at 3 o'clock, and of Huculak's wild statements about ""a
guy's eyes sticking out of his head and something hanging out of the back of his
head"" are fully reported in the reasons of my brother Judson. It will be
noted that Huculak spoke of a body being in a shed somewhere and that they had
to go out and bury it, and also that there was talk of going ""back""
to the scene of the crime, and a statement by Huculak which was not made until
a day or two after the murder that they would have to go there to get
""some bandages or tape or something that flew off"" the end of the
wrench when the person was hit.

[Page 278]

In order to find that there is any substance to the defence
now suggested, it must be accepted that the muddy condition of Huculak's shoes
at 3 o'clock in the morning and his description of the dead body which
""they had to go out and bury"" were not inconsistent with his role being
limited to assisting the murderer to escape detection by getting rid of the
body and the evidence of violence, and that his knowledge of the bandages or
tape ""that flew off"" the wrench which he did not communicate to
Osborne until much later was something which Workman had told him about when
they were cleaning up at the scene of the crime. It is also necessary to accept
Mr. Nugent's submission that the heel mark in the blood on the floor of the
partially-built house which the police expert stated could have been made by
Huculak's shoe might have been left when Huculak went there to clean up the
mess.

While I am bound to say that these suppositions are
improbable this does not answer the question of whether the jury should have
been instructed on this feature of the case. The question is by no means an
easy one, but I have come to the conclusion that under all the circumstances
such a direction should have been given in this case.

I do not wish to be construed as saying that a trial judge,
when addressing a jury in a criminal case, is under a duty to explore all the
remotest and most fantastic possibilities but I do think that in a capital case
where the two accused are jointly charged and no independent defence has been
advanced to the jury on behalf of the one of them who has not been shown to
have any motive for the crime then it does become necessary for the trial judge
to scrutinize the circumstances with additional care in a conscious effort to
insure that the jury has been informed of all defences for which any support
can be found in the evidence. If under such circumstances some such defence
should escape the notice of the trial judge then, in my view, the accused is
entitled to a new trial.

Although I am of opinion that it is extremely unlikely in
the present case that the jury would have found Huculak to be an accessory
rather than a principal, it cannot be said

[Page 279]

to be impossible. In this regard, I would adopt the language
employed by Humphreys J. in Rex v. Roberts1, where he said:

The Court … cannot delve into the minds of the jury and say
what they would have done if the issue had been left open to them.

In view of the above, I would allow the appeal of William
Huculak, set aside his conviction and direct a new trial.

As to the case of Workman, I agree with the Court of Appeal
that the evidence against him is overwhelming and I would dismiss his appeal.

Both appeals dismissed, Ritchie
and Hall JJ. dissenting as to H's appeal.

1963: June 3; 1963: June 24.

Present: Taschereau C.J. and Cartwright, Fauteux, Abbott and

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE,
PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Criminal negligence causing death—Motor
vehicle—Jury trial—Lack of evidence—Insufficiency of evidence—Question of law.

The respondent was found guilty of criminal negligence causing
death. The evidence relating to the accident itself was given by one witness
who testified that a car going about 70 m.p.h. overtook her own car and cut
suddenly in front of her. The right side of the car appeared to rise from the
ground and then the car veered to the left side of the road and continued on.
The place where this observation occurred was the place where the body of a
nine-year old boy was found in the ditch the following morning. The respondent
denied any knowledge of the accident and sought to show that neither he nor his
automobile had anything to do with it. Debris found at the scene connected his
car with the accident. Subsequent to the accident, the respondent kept his car
in his garage for two or three days, which was unusual for him to do. Then four
days later, he drove to Oshawa during the night and had his car repaired. The
Court of Appeal

[Page 492]

quashed the conviction. The Crown was granted leave to appeal
to this Court.

Held (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be
allowed and the conviction restored.

Per Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux, Abbott and Judson JJ.:
It was a common basis to both sets of reasons for judgment in the Court below
that there was no evidence to go to the jury. This was a question of law and it
was erroneously decided by that Court. In addition to the witness's description
of the driving, there was the subsequent conduct of the respondent which was of
real significance when linked with the driving. All this was properly before
the jury, so that there was evidence of criminal negligence to go to the jury. Balcerczyk
v. The Queen, [1957] S.C.R. 20, referred to.

Per Cartwright J., dissenting: A reading of the
reasons for judgment of Casey J., with which Badeaux J. concurred, where he
used the very words of clause (i) of s. 592(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , after
which he went on to hold that guilt could not be ""reasonably deduced""
from the evidence, forces the conclusion that the Judge based his judgment on
the insufficiency of the evidence rather than the lack of it. It is well
settled that if one of the grounds on which a Court of Appeal quashes a
conviction is that it cannot be supported by the evidence this Court is without
jurisdiction even though the judgment is also based on other grounds raising
questions of law in the strict sense. The Queen v. Warner, [1961] S.C.R.
144, referred to.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the Court of
Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, quashing the
respondent's conviction. Appeal allowed, Cartwright J. dissenting.

Y.van Mignault, for the appellant.

Lawrence Corriveau, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau C.J. and of Fauteux, Abbott and
Judson JJ. was delivered by

Judson J.:—The
conviction of the respondent Russell Taylor on a charge of criminal negligence
causing death was set aside by a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal
Side2,
from which judgment the Crown now appeals by leave of this Court.

The evidence relating to the accident itself was brief and
given by only one witness. She was Madame Léonard Lemieux, who was driving
north on Boulevard Henri Bourassa on April 5, 1960, between 7 and 7:15 in the
evening. She says that a car overtook her and cut suddenly

[Page 493]

in front of her. She thought it was going to strike a power
pole on the side of the road. The right-hand side of the car appeared to rise
from the ground and then the car veered suddenly to the left-hand side of the
road and from there went on its way to the north. It did not stop. She
estimates its speed at 70 miles an hour. She says she herself was going at 40
miles an hour. The place where this observation occurred was the place where
the body of Marcel Berthiaume, a boy of 9 years of age, was found in the ditch
the following morning. The boy had left his house in the early evening of April
5 to go on an errand for his mother.

Taylor's defence was that he had nothing to do with the
accident; that he was not at the scene of the accident at the hour in question
but was at home with his car in the garage; and that at no relevant time had he
given his car into the possession of any other person. This defence could not
succeed against the evidence adduced by the prosecution. Debris from a car
which was found at the scene of the accident connects Taylor's car with the accident
beyond any doubt. Taylor's conduct after April 5, 1960, is also significant. He
kept his car in the garage for two or three days with the doors closed. This
was an unusual thing to do and was noted by his neighbours at Lac Beauport. On
April 9, four days after the accident, he left Lac Beauport at 9 p.m. and drove
to Oshawa during the night. He had the car repaired in Oshawa and the
explanation he gave for this trip could not possibly be accepted by the jury.

When the case came to appeal the Court concentrated its
attention upon the evidence of Madame Lemieux. I take the finding of Casey J.
to be that there was no evidence to go to the jury and that, in consequence, he
held that the verdict was unreasonable and could not be supported by the
evidence. Rinfret J. held that the learned trial judge ought to have directed a
verdict of acquittal. Badeaux J. agreed with both his colleagues and, in my
opinion, without any inconsistency for it is a common basis to both reasons for
judgment that there was no evidence to go to the jury. This is a question of
law and I am of the opinion that the ruling upon it was erroneous.

Even if the attention of a Court is limited entirely to
Madame Lemieux's description of the driving, I cannot agree that there was no
evidence of criminal negligence to

[Page 494]

go to the jury. There was, in addition, Taylor's subsequent
conduct which is of real significance when linked with the driving. All this
was properly before the jury. Balcerczyk v. The Queen3.

I would set aside the judgment of the Court of Queen's
Bench, Appeal Side, and restore the jury's verdict of guilty. I note from the
record that the accused has already been sentenced.

Cartwright J. (dissenting):—This
is an appeal brought by the Crown, pursuant to leave granted by this Court,
from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side4,
quashing the conviction of the respondent on a charge of criminal negligence.

On April 5, 1960, Marcel Berthiaume died as a result of
having been struck by an automobile. It was the theory of the Crown that the
respondent was the owner and driver of the car which struck the deceased. The
defence was a denial that this was so. The respondent sought to show that
neither he nor his automobile had anything to do with the accident.

The Court of Queen's Bench was composed of Casey, Rinfret
and Badeaux JJ. Casey J. and Rinfret J. each delivered written reasons and
Badeaux J. agreed with both of them.

The appeal is met in limine by the submission of
counsel for the respondent that we are without jurisdiction as the judgment
sought to be appealed was based on the ground that the conviction was
unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence and that the appeal
raises no question of law in the strict sense.

In my opinion this submission is entitled to prevail.

The question whether there is any evidence (as distinguished
from sufficient evidence) to support a verdict is a question of law. The answer
to the question whether Casey J. decided that as a matter of law there was no
evidence or that the evidence was insufficient depends on the construction of
the words used by that learned Judge.

After a review of portions of the evidence, Casey J. says:

It was the burden of the Crown, to prove that the victim had
been struck by appellant's car, that appellant had been driving the automobile

[Page 495]

and that (CC 191) in his driving he had shown 'wanton or
reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons'.

Before a jury can be called upon to pass judgment, before it
can be asked to decide whether there was 'wanton or reckless disregard' there
must be some evidence from which the existence of this element can be
reasonably deduced. If no such evidence exists then the verdict that finds the
accused guilty is one that in the words of CC 592 is 'unreasonable or cannot be
supported by the evidence'. In this case the only person who testifies as to
the conduct of the appellant was Mrs. Lemieux. Assuming that the appellant was
driving the automobile that struck the victim the evidence of Mrs. Lemieux does
not establish facts from which the existence of 'wanton or reckless disregard'
can be reasonably deduced.

For the foregoing reasons I would maintain this appeal and
quash the conviction.

It will be observed that the learned Judge used the very
words of clause (i) of s. 592(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  which
must be contrasted with clause (ii). The section reads in part:

592(1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction, the
court of appeal

(a) may allow the appeal
where it is of opinion that

(i) the verdict should be set
aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the
evidence,

(ii) the judgment of the trial
court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of
law, or

(iii) on any ground there was a
miscarriage of justice;

Casey J. goes on to hold that guilt cannot be
""reasonably deduced"" from the evidence.

I have reached the conclusion that Casey J. based his
judgment on clause (i) quoted above and not on clause (ii). It has already been
pointed out that Badeaux J. agreed with Casey J.

It is settled by the judgment of this Court in The Queen
v. Warner5, that if one of the grounds on
which a Court of Appeal quashes a conviction is that it cannot be supported by
the evidence we are without jurisdiction even although the judgment is also
based on other grounds raising questions of law in the strict sense.

For these reasons I have reached the conclusion that we are
without jurisdiction to interfere with the judgment of

[Page 496]

the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, in this case, and I
would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal allowed, Cartwright J. dissenting.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—False representations—Whether
any evidence—Question of law—Question of fact.

The appellant was charged and convicted on a
charge that by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means he defrauded certain
members of the public by inducing them to advance money to obtain the
immigration to Canada of
relatives or friends residing in Hungary. His appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. He was granted
leave to appeal to this Court on the question of law as to whether there was
any evidence upon which the accused might properly be found guilty of the
offences charged.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

There was evidence, most of which was
circumstantial, on which it was open to the trial judge to find that the
representations, which on the evidence were made by the appellant, were false
and from which the inference of guilt could legally be drawn. The question as
to whether guilt ought to have been inferred was one of fact with which this
Court was not concerned.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, affirming the
appellant’s conviction. Appeal dismissed.

A. Maloney, Q.C., and T.J. Donnelly, for
the appellant.

W.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J.:—This is an appeal from a judgment
of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, pronounced on February 14, 1962, dismissing, without recorded
reasons, the appellant’s appeal from his conviction before His Honour Judge
Donley, on April 10, 1961, on
the following charge:

That in the years 1957, 1958, 1959 and
1960, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York by
deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means defrauded the public to wit;
certain members of the public who were induced to advance money to obtain the
immigration to Canada of relatives or friends who were residing in Hungary of a
sum of money in excess of three thousand dollars contrary to the Criminal Code .

[Page 452]

Leave to appeal was granted by this Court on the
following question of law:

Whether there was any evidence upon which
the accused might properly be found guilty of any of the offences charged in
the indictment.

There was evidence on which it could be found
that representations were made by the appellant to a number of persons and that
they were induced by the representations to pay money to the appellant. The
serious question, which was fully argued, was whether there was any evidence
that the representations made were false. I have reached the conclusion that
there was evidence, most of which was circumstantial, on which it was open to
the learned trial judge to find that the representations were false and from
which the inference of guilt of the appellant could legally be drawn. The
question whether guilt ought to have been inferred was one of fact with which
we are not concerned.

For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.

Criminal law—Capital murder—Whether murder was
""planned and deliberate""—Meaning of word
""deliberate""—Medical evidence showing impairment of ability to
think—Whether misdirection as to weight of that evidence—Substantial
wrong—Miscarriage of justice—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 16,
201(a)(i), 202A(a)(iii), 592.

The appellant shot his wife through the head while she was
asleep, early one morning. He then wrote a number of letters explaining why he
had done it, that he was in financial difficulty and did not want his wife to
suffer from it. During the afternoon, he attempted suicide by shooting himself.
The attempt having failed, he telephoned the police in the evening to tell them
what he had done. Three days before, he had secured a permit for the purchase
of a revolver, but did not buy any. However, two days before the shooting he
did buy a rifle and a box of shells with the intention, he said, of taking his
own life.

At the trial for capital murder, the defence of insanity was
specifically disclaimed by his counsel. However, two medical doctors testified
that at the time of the shooting the appellant was suffering from a depressive
psychosis resulting in ""impairment of ability to decide even
inconsequential things, inability to make up a decision in a normal kind of
way"". The trial judge, instead of leaving this medical evidence to the

[Page 523]

jury for their consideration, quoted from authorities to the
effect that the testimony of experts is of slight weight.

The appellant was convicted of capital murder. In the Court of
Appeal, all the judges were of opinion that there had been misdirection as to
the weight to be given to the medical evidence on the appellant's state of mind
at the time of the offence. The majority dismissed the appeal on the ground
that there had been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. The
dissenting judge would have substituted a verdict of non-capital murder. The
appellant appealed to this Court.

Held (Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux J. dissenting): The
appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial directed.

Per Cartwright, Abbott, Judson, Ritchie and Hall JJ.:
There was very strong evidence that the murder was planned, but the jury could
not bring in a verdict of capital murder unless they were satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that it was also deliberate. The word ""deliberate"",
as used in s. 202A(2)(a), means ""considered not impulsive"". It
cannot simply mean ""intentional"" for that is the prerequisite for
murder, and the subsection is creating an additional ingredient as a condition
of capital murder. On the facts and the evidence as to what happened at the
moment of the shooting, it was open to the jury to take the view that the act of
the appellant was impulsive rather than considered and therefore was not
deliberate. The medical evidence would have had a direct bearing on that
question; its weight was a matter for the jury. The enactment of s. 202A(2)(a)
has in no way affected the interpretation or application of s. 16 of the Code.
The medical evidence was not relied on as raising the question whether the
appellant was legally sane, but its importance was that it would assist the
jury in deciding whether the shooting was deliberate. On this question of fact,
the appellant was entitled to have the verdict of a properly instructed jury.

The probable result of the unwarranted disparagement of the
medical evidence, which was relevant and admissible, was its withdrawal from
the jury's serious consideration. On a charge of capital murder, based on an
allegation that the killing was planned and deliberate, it was virtually a
withdrawal of the whole defence. In these circumstances, it could not be held
that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. Since the case
has never really been considered by the jury on evidence which should have been
before it, the appellant was entitled to a new trial.

Per Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux J., dissenting: It
was uncontrovertible on the evidence that the murder was planned, i.e.,
""arranged beforehand"", as found by the jury and the majority of the
Court of Appeal. All that was done prior to and after the shooting was done in
implementation of a plan. There was nothing in the evidence foreign to this
plan, suggesting a sudden impulse to kill.

On the dictionary definition of the word
""deliberate"", it appears from both the English and French versions of
s. 202A(2)(a) that the word qualifies the murder and that a time element
is the material feature common to both the definition of ""planned""
and the definition of ""deliberate"". What Parliament intended was to
exclude from the offence of capital murder a murder committed on the spur of
the moment. There is nothing in the definition of either word which relates to
the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the arrangement made beforehand or of
the predetermination to kill. Irrationality of either may suggest a

[Page 524]

degree of mental irresponsibility legally apt to relieve from
legal responsibility. But that is a matter for s. 16 of the Code. The factual
and opinion evidence does not show that the ability of the appellant to think,
reason and decide was abolished but impaired. To accept the submission that
such an impairment, short of insanity within the meaning of s. 16 of the Code,
is a defence, would be tantamount to introducing in the Canadian law a new and
secondary text of legal irresponsibility, which Parliament has deliberately
refused to adopt. The language of the enactment is inapt to justify such a
departure from the system of our criminal law as is contended for by the
appellant. It follows that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice resulting from the direction given by the trial judge as to the weight
of the expert medical evidence.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba1, affirming the appellant's conviction
on a charge of capital murder. Appeal allowed, Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux J.
dissenting.

John A. Scollin, for the appellant.

G. E. Pilkey, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau C.J. and of Fauteux J. was
delivered by

Fauteux J. (dissenting):—The
appellant was indicted and tried for the capital murder of his wife on the 27th
day of September 1962 at the City of Transcona in the Eastern Judicial District
in the Province of Manitoba.

The case as presented to the jury by the Crown and the
defence respectively may briefly be stated:

The theory of the Crown was that the accused loved his wife
but having accumulated heavy debts, of which he had not fully informed her, he
became worried and depressed and that, when threatened with legal action which
would have disclosed his true financial position to her, he shot her and
attempted to commit suicide; on the evidence, the killing of his wife was motivated,
intended, planned and deliberate, thus amounting in law to a capital murder
under ss. 201 (a)(i) and 202A (2) (a) of the Criminal Code . In
defence the accused, who admittedly killed his wife on the 27th day of
September last, pleaded that at the time he was an automaton, devoid of will,
not knowing what he was doing, and that the Crown had failed to prove that the
homicide was planned and deliberate; according to expert

[Page 525]

medical evidence of two psychiatrists called by the defence,
the accused was suffering from a diminution of his ability to think, reason,
and decide at the time of the offence.

There is no evidence to support a defence of insanity under
s. 16  of the Criminal Code  and indeed after all the evidence had been
adduced, such a defence was specifically disclaimed by counsel for the accused.

The jury, presided by Nitikman J., found the accused guilty
as charged. Required under s. 642A—of which the provisions are applicable in
any case of an offence punishable by death—to consider whether a recommendation
that he should be granted clemency should be made, the jury so recommended.

On the appeal under s. 583 of the Code the verdict of the
jury was upheld. The Court2 found that the trial judge misdirected
the jury on the weight to be given to the psychiatric expert medical evidence
called for by the defence. Miller C.J.M., Schultz, Monnin and Guy JJ.A. found
that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred, and upheld
the verdict of the jury. Freedman J.A. dissenting considered that the expert
evidence was of major importance on the issue whether the murder was planned
and deliberate and would have substituted to the verdict of capital murder a
verdict of non-capital murder.

Pursuant to s. 597A(a) of the Code, appellant then appealed
to this Court on one ground which, as formulated in his notice of appeal to
this Court, reads:

The learned trial judge so misdirected the jury as to the
weight to be attached to the medical evidence called by the defence that the
(accused) appellant was not properly convicted of capital murder.

Involved in this ground of appeal are three matters to be
considered. (i) Whether, upon the evidence it was open to the jury, not only to
conclude as they and all the members of the Court of Appeal did, that the
shooting of Mrs. More was intended—thus constituting murder under s.
201 (a)(i)—but was also planned and deliberate, as they and the majority of the
Court of Appeal found—thus constituting capital murder under ss. 201(a)(i) and
202A (2)(a) of the Code; and in the affirmative, (ii) whether impairment
of the ability to think, reason and decide, short

[Page 526]

of insanity within the meaning of s. 16 of the Code, is a
defence to the offence charged; and, (iii) whether in the result there was any
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

The complete and unchallenged review of the evidence
appearing in the reasons for judgment of Schultz J.A. may be summarized as
follows: On September 4, 1962, the accused, who had become a free lance
photographer, secured part-time employment as a school bus driver, hoping that
by undertaking to turn over his wages to Transcona Credit Union, his most
urgently pressing creditor, he would avoid legal action being taken against him
and his wife, co-signer for the debt. The Credit Union refused his proposal and
through its solicitor advised him his wife's wages at Eaton's would be
garnisheed on September 28 if the debt were not paid in full before that date.
On September 24, which was four days before the deadline set by Credit Union
and three days before that of the murder, the accused obtained a permit from
the police to convey a revolver from a Sporting Supplies store to his
residence. On September 25, shortly after 9:00 a.m. he asked for two days off
from his school bus driving employment on the admittedly false pretext that he
and his wife had to go east to bring back his father-in-law whom he falsely
represented as having had a heart attack. Later the same morning, he went to
the Sporting Supplies store to buy a revolver, representing again admittedly
falsely, that he required it for use in connection with Sea Cadet activities.
He left the store without making a purchase and went to the T. Eaton Company
where he purchased a single shot 22 calibre rifle and a box of 50 cartridges.
The rifle was taken home and kept there in the cellar without the knowledge of
his wife. On September 27, at 6:00 a.m., according to his testimony, his wife
while asleep was shot by him through the forehead, the rifle being held not
more than 6 inches at the most from the head. Between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.
he testified he wrote numerous documents hereafter referred to, which he left
on the kitchen table. At 8:00 a.m., according to independent testimony, he
telephoned his wife's employer that she would not be in to work that day as she
was ill. At 10:00 a.m. he testified that his sister, Mrs. St. Jean, telephoned
and asked him to drive her downtown, which he did, mentioning

[Page 527]

nothing to her on the occasion about the killing of his
wife. He testified that around 4:00 p.m. he laid down beside his dead wife,
shot himself through the head, and that expecting to die from his serious,
though not fatal, wound he stayed lying in the bed. At 8:00 p.m. he telephoned
a constable at the Transcona Police Station, identified himself and said:

I shot my wife this morning and myself this afternoon, but I
did not do a good job on myself, so I had better go to the hospital. Come to
the side door.

Upon the arrival of the police he volunteered:

I shot her this morning, shot myself at about 4:00 o'clock,
did not make a good job, financial problems; it is all there,

and he pointed to the numerous documents lying on the
kitchen table. On the way to the hospital in the police car, having been duly
cautioned, he said:

the only thing I have to say is I have financial problems,
and I was going to do away with both of us, that is all.

'The following day in the hospital and again after being
cautioned he declared to the police officers:

I had some financial problems. It was worrying my wife so
much. She was a very nervous type of person. Anything like this would upset
her. Actually I had a choice of doing one of two things, either going to
personal bankruptcy which would probably upset her so much that it would upset
her happiness or doing what I did by trying to take both our lives. That's all
there is to it.

He testified that when he made the last two statements he
was under the impression that he was going to die and trying to be truthful and
not hide anything.

The substance of the documents written and left by appellant
on the kitchen table or mailed by him when he left his home to drive his sister
downtown tallies with these voluntary declarations made to the police
immediately after the event. The documents also indicate his debts in great
detail, the location of his insurance policies and those of his wife, and
contained the disposition to be made of his estate. A letter written and mailed
to a close friend reads in part:

Please read the following very carefully before you do
anything.

I shot Marge early this morning & am now going to do
away with myself.

[Page 528]

Please get Joe Teres Transcona Chief of Police & tell
him to come to the house 330 Harvard Ave. W. & here is the key to the side
door. Do not come in with him because it is a horrible sight to see, I know
because I know what Marge is like & I just hope I have the courage to
finish what I have started. We are both in the back bedroom …

I hope this will do some good some where, & I really
don't feel too badly, because Marge & I have had a good life together even
if it has been shortened by this act. I'll close now as I must join Marge &
I hope to 'Go with God'.

In a three-page note to Mrs. St. Jean, her husband and
family, he wrote:

I am sorry to do this, but as far as I can see it is my only
way out.

Marge is so upset and worried lately that it is hurting me
deeply. Marge and I love each other very deeply & have had a real good
& happy life together & in one way I think I am doing the right &
best thing.

Please try & not feel too bad about us, because at least
we are still together & if there is another world beyond this one I
hope Marge & I have as much happiness there as what we have had here on
earth.

* * *

Well I guess that's it for now. Once again please don't feel
badly about us, as we have always been happy together & we will
still have our happiness as we are still together.

In a further note to Mrs. St. Jean, admittedly written
after he had driven her to work, he wrote in part:

… When you get the insurance money be sure to straighten out
your affairs & do as I asked this morning if you don't have cash for it
don't buy it. I just wish I had taken my own advice & this would not be
necessary.

Please try and find happiness instead of sadness over this,
as I'm sure Marge & I will be happy together in the future as we have been
in the past …

I know it's easy to say, but please don't feel badly about
us and enjoy your lives as much as Marge & I have.

While on his evidence all the documents were written on the
morning of the 27th, after the shooting of his wife, many bear a prior date. At
trial he said he back-dated these particular documents, this to overcome any
possible suggestion that he might not have been sound of mind when they were
written which would cause them to be ineffectual. Two such documents are
significant. The first is dated the day before the murder; it is headed
""Last Will and Testament of John P. T. More"", of which the opening
words are ""Being of sound mind at the time of writing this, I hereby declare
this to be my last will and testament"". The second is dated the 24th, to
wit the day he obtained the permit from the police to carry a revolver to his
residence; it lists 14 items

[Page 529]

of expensive photographic equipment and provides for their return
partly to a creditor and the balance, not to his wife but to Mrs. St. Jean.
Shown this last exhibit at trial, he could give no explanation why it was dated
September 24.

Subject to the consideration of matters raised for the
appellant, on this evidence it was manifestly open to the jury to conclude that
the killing of Mrs. More was intended, planned and deliberate.

That it was intended was found by the jury and all the
members of the Court of Appeal. It was also, by necessary implication if not
expressly, admitted by appellant who did ask this Court to reduce the verdict
of capital murder to one of murder simpliciter. The defence of automatism was
rejected by the jury which disbelieved the evidence of the appellant at trial
as to what occurred at the moment of the discharge of the rifle. This defence
was abandoned in this Court.

That the murder was planned, i.e., ""arranged
beforehand""—cf. the Shorter Oxford Dictionary—as found by the jury and the
majority of the Court of Appeal is, in my respectful view, uncontrovertible on
the above evidence accepted by the jury. There was a plan and one plan only;
and all that was done by the appellant, prior to and after the shooting of his
wife, was done in implementation of this plan. With deference to my brother Cartwright,
I find no evidence, of anything foreign to this plan, suggesting that the
accused was suddenly impelled to kill his wife at the moment of the discharge
of the rifle. Obviously the jury, having rejected the evidence as to what
occurred at the time of the discharge of the rifle, could not rely on or infer
from the same evidence impulsivity intervening at that particular moment.

From appellant's factum and the oral argument, the grievance
as to the direction of the trial judge with respect to the weight to be
attached to expert medical evidence is rather fundamentally related by him to
the question whether the murder was deliberate within the meaning he gives to
this word under the provisions of s. 202A (2) (a). To dispose of the
merits of this appeal, this Court, in my respectful view, must unavoidably
determine the meaning of the word ""deliberate"" under these provisions
of the Criminal Code  and their legal effect in the case.

[Page 530]

In the Shorter Oxford Dictionary, the word is thus defined:

Deliberate: well weighed or considered, carefully
thought out, done of set purpose, studied, not hasty or rash. Of persons:
characterized by deliberation, considered carefully, leisurely, slow, not
hurried.

The first part of the definition is related to an action;
the second part is related to a person. Under the provisions of the section the
word ""deliberate"" qualifies not the person charged but his action,
i.e. the murder. In the French version of these provisions, the expression
""de propos délibéré"" stands for the word ""deliberate"", and,
according to the Larousse XXe siècle, means ""à dessein—de parti pris—de
dessein formé, arrêté à l'avance"". In Harrap's Standard French and English
Dictionary, the expression ""of set purpose"" is translated ""de
propos délibéré, de parti pris"". In the same dictionary, the word
""predetermination"" is translated ""détermination prise d'avance;
dessein arrêté"".

Thus it appears from both the English and French versions,
which in the consideration of a federal statute must be read together, Composers,
Authors and Publishers of Canada Ltd. v. Western Fair Association3,
that a time element is the material feature common to both the definition
of the word ""planned"" and the definition of the word
""deliberate"". This feature was not a constitutive element of murder
under the state of the law as it was prior to the enactment of s. 202A (2) (a).
All of which reasonably indicates that what Parliament intended, by adding it
as such, was to exclude from the offence, henceforth categorized as capital murder,
a murder committed on the spur of the moment. There is nothing in the
definition of either of the words ""planned and deliberate"" which
relates to the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the arrangement made
beforehand or of the predetermination to kill. If, in the context of the
relevant part of ss. 201 (a)(i) and 202A (2) (a), from which stems
the definition of capital murder, the words ""planned"" and
""deliberate"" were held to imply reasonableness, what type of planned
and deliberate murder could be held by a jury to be reasonable and when would
these provisions have any application, I am unable to say. Irrationality of
either, if appearing in a given case, may

[Page 531]

suggest a degree of mental irresponsibility legally apt to
relieve from legal responsibility. The policy of the law in this respect is not
stated in s. 202A (2) (a) but in s. 16 of the Code, which appearing in
Part 1 of the Code is all-embracing with respect to the question of insanity in
criminal matters. Of course it is for the prosecution to show and for the jury
to say whether it is shown by the evidence that the offence charged is
intended, planned and deliberate. The mental capacity to commit this as well as
any other offence is another matter altogether. For it is a matter of defence
to displace the presumption created in the imperative terms of s.
16(4)—""Everyone shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to be and
to have been sane"". This presumption cannot be displaced by factual or
opinion evidence unless such evidence meets the test of legal irresponsibility
set forth in s. 16(2), (3). The factual and opinion evidence in this case does
not show that the ability of the appellant to think, reason and decide was
abolished but impaired. The evidence does not meet the legal test; on the
contrary Dr. Adamson affirms that the accused was capable of appreciating his
unlawful acts and added that he could not convince himself that the accused did
not know the difference between right and wrong at the time of the offence.

Acceptance of appellant's submission that mental defect or
disease not sufficient to render an accused legally irresponsible under s. 16
of the Code may nevertheless operate to reduce the degree of the crime charged
is tantamount to introducing in the Canadian law a new and secondary test of
legal irresponsibility as was done in England prior to the enactment of the
provisions of s. 202A (2) (a) by the Homicide Act 1957, 5 & 6
Eliz. 2, c. 11, of which s. 2(1) and (2) read:

2. (1) Where a person kills or is a party to the killing of
another, he shall not be convicted of murder if he was suffering from such
abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded
development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as
substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in
doing or being a party to the killing.

(2) On a charge of murder, it shall be for the defence to
prove that the person charged is by virtue of this section not liable to be
convicted of murder.

[Page 532]

Undoubtedly aware of these provisions, the Canadian
Parliament deliberately refused to adopt them. If the appellant's submission is
accepted, it follows that the Canadian Parliament has adopted rather obliquely
a policy more generous than that of the English law. Contrary to what is the
case in England, the prosecution in Canada would further have the burden of
proving, as a constitutive element of the offence of capital murder, not only
that the accused is mentally sane within the meaning of s. 16 , but also that
his mental responsibility is not affected to a lesser degree for which no legal
standard is given. Again on appellant's submission there are two different
tests of legal irresponsibility with respect to the offence of capital murder.
The first being with respect to intent is defined in s. 16 ; the other being
with respect to planning and deliberation is left to the arbitrament of the
jury to define in each case. I am unable to read the section as implying such
substantial innovations and changes in our Criminal Law.

In the United States, the tests of irresponsibility of the
various jurisdictions, in cases involving insanity as a defence to crime, are
reviewed in Weihofen, Mental Disorder As A Criminal Defence, at pages 129 et
seq. In most of the jurisdictions, it appears that where the law of the State
includes specific intent, deliberation or premeditation as constitutive
elements of a murder of first degree, it is held that insanity, not sufficient
to require an acquittal, may not be shown to negative intent, deliberation or
premeditation, and so reduce the crime to murder in second degree.

There is a presumption against implicit alteration of the
law and one of these is that the Legislature does not intend to make any
substantial alteration in the law beyond what it explicitly declares. It is in
the last degree improbable that the Legislature would overthrow fundamental
principles or depart from the general system of law, without expressing its
intention with irresistible clearness. (Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes,
9th ed., pp. 85 et seq.). In my view, the language of the enactment—which on
the above meaning of the words ""planned and deliberate"" is truly
related to a time element—is inapt to justify such a departure from the system
of our Criminal Law as is contended for by appellant.

[Page 533]

On that view of the law, impairment of mental capacity short
of insanity was not a defence to the crime charged. It follows that there was
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice resulting from the direction
given by the trial judge as to the weight of the expert medical evidence. For
while relevant to a defence of insanity—to negative intent or that the murder
was planned and deliberate—, in this particular case the evidence adduced was
admittedly short of showing insanity to the degree required by law to relieve
from legal responsibility. And, again, insanity as a defence was specifically
disclaimed. To the extent that it could be relevant to the consideration of a
recommendation that the accused should be granted clemency, there was no
prejudice, for such a recommendation was made.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Cartwright, Abbott, Judson, Ritchie and Hall
JJ. was delivered by

Cartwright J.:—I
agree with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Judson and wish to add only
a few words on one aspect of the matter.

It does not appear to have been argued by counsel for the
Crown at any stage of the proceedings that the evidence of Dr. Adamson and of
Dr. Thomson was not relevant to the question whether the appellant was guilty
of capital murder; and all of the learned judges in the courts below have
proceeded on the view that it was relevant. In my opinion they were clearly
right in so doing.

In the circumstances of this case, the defence of insanity
having been expressly disclaimed, there were really only two questions for the
jury. The first was whether the appellant meant to cause the death of his wife;
if this was answered in the affirmative he was guilty of murder. The second,
which arises under s. 202A (2) (a) of the Criminal Code , was
whether this murder was planned and deliberate on his part; if this was
answered in the affirmative he was guilty of capital murder.

The evidence that the murder was planned was very strong,
but, as was properly pointed out to the jury by the learned trial judge, they
could not find the accused guilty of capital murder unless they were satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt not only that the murder was planned but also

[Page 534]

that it was deliberate. The learned trial judge also
rightly-instructed the jury that the word ""deliberate"", as used in s.
202A (2) (a), means ""considered not impulsive"".

Other meanings of the adjective given in the Oxford
Dictionary are ""not hasty in decision"", ""slow in deciding""
and ""intentional"". The word as used in the subsection cannot have
simply the meaning ""intentional"" because it is only if the accused's
act was intentional that he can be guilty of murder and the subsection is
creating an additional ingredient to be proved as a condition of an accused
being convicted of capital murder.

The recital of the facts and the evidence of the appellant
as to what occurred at the moment of the discharge of the rifle, set out in the
reasons of my brother Judson, show that it was open to the jury to take the
view that the act of the appellant in pulling the trigger was impulsive rather
than considered and therefore was not deliberate. The evidence of the two
doctors and particularly that of Dr. Adamson, also quoted by my brother Judson,
that, in his opinion, at the critical moment the appellant was suffering from a
depressive psychosis resulting in ""impairment of ability to decide even
inconsequential things, inability to make a decision in a normal kind of a
way"" would have a direct bearing on the question whether the appellant's
act was deliberate in the sense defined above; its weight was a matter for the
jury.

I wish to emphasize that all that I have said above is
related to the peculiar facts of this particular case.

Since writing the above, I have had an opportunity of
reading the reasons of my brother Fauteux and I wish to make it clear that in
my opinion the enactment of s. 202A (2) (a) of the Criminal Code  has
in no way affected the interpretation or application of s. 16 . The evidence of
the two doctors is not relied on by the defence as raising the question whether
the accused was legally sane. Its importance is that it would assist the jury
in deciding the question whether the accused's action in pulling the trigger, which
so far as this branch of the matter is concerned was admittedly the intentional
act of a sane man, was also his deliberate act. This question is one of fact
and its solution involves an inquiry as to the thinking of the accused at the
moment of acting. If the jury accepted the evidence of the doctors it,

[Page 535]

in conjunction with the accused's own evidence, might well
cause them to regard it as more probable that the accused's final act was
prompted by sudden impulse rather than by consideration. On this question the
accused was entitled to have the verdict of a properly instructed jury.

I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by my brother
Judson.

The judgment of Cartwright, Abbott, Judson, Ritchie and Hall
JJ. was delivered by

Judson J.:—The
Manitoba Court of Appeal4, with Freedman J.A. dissenting, has
affirmed the conviction of the appellant on a charge of capital murder. His
appeal asks this Court to set aside the verdict of guilty of capital murder and
substitute a verdict of guilty of non-capital murder, or, in the alternative,
to quash the conviction and order a new trial.

The issue in the appeal is sharply defined in the reasons
for judgment delivered in the Court of Appeal. All the judges were of the
opinion that the learned trial judge had misdirected the jury on the weight to
be given to the medical evidence called by the defence on the appellant's state
of mind at the time of the offence. The majority considered that the provisions
of s. 592(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  applied and that there
had been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice despite the wrong
decision of the learned trial judge on a question of law. Freedman J.A.,
dissenting, held that the appellant was not properly convicted of capital
murder but should have been convicted of non-capital murder and would have
substituted the latter verdict under s. 592(3)  of the Criminal Code . The
issue therefore is whether the majority of the Court of Appeal was correct in
holding that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

The accused shot his wife through the head while she was
asleep about 5 o'clock on the morning of September 27, 1962. He then wrote a
number of letters explaining why he had done it. He concealed his crime during
the day and during the afternoon he attempted suicide by shooting himself
through the head. Although seriously wounded, he did

[Page 536]

not die and at 8 o'clock in the evening of September 27, he
telephoned the police to tell them what he had done.

There is no history of matrimonial discord in this family,
either remote or immediate. The accused married his wife in 1942 and the
evidence indicates that they lived together happily. From 1942 to 1945 the
accused served in the Navy. On his return to civilian life he completed his
apprenticeship as an upholsterer and worked at this trade for 12 years in the
employment of the Canadian National Railways. He left this employment to start
his own business as a photographer. In this he was unsuccessful. He accumulated
many debts; he was being hard-pressed by his creditors at the time of the
crime; and there is no doubt that he was suffering from some mental disturbance
that caused him to do what he did.

On September 24 he had secured a permit for the purchase of
a revolver. He made some enquiries at a shop about the purchase but did not go
through with it. At that time he gave a false reason for his interest in a
revolver. On September 25 he bought a rifle and a box of shells with the
intention, he said, of taking his own life because of worry about his financial
problems and the effect upon his wife of their impending discovery.

He was up twice during the night of September 27 thinking
about his troubles while his wife was sleeping. He said that the second time he
got up was about 5 a.m. and that he sat around smoking and thinking. He gave
his description of the shooting in the following words:

From there the only next thing I can remember is standing by
the bed with the rifle in my hand and hearing it go off.

He also said that immediately before the rifle was
discharged he was thinking

what my wife and I had here on earth and what it would be
like in a better world ahead, Heaven … I thought what a better place it would
be, that we would not need to think of money problems or anything like that.

The letters that he wrote after the shooting of his wife
indicated the same kind of mental disturbance. Dr. Gilbert L. Adamson, who had
been practising in the field of neurology and psychiatry in Winnipeg since
1931, and who had recently retired as Associate Professor of Medicine in

[Page 537]

the University of Manitoba, gave the following opinion about
the mental condition of the accused at the time of the killing:

I formed the opinion that on the 27th day of September 1962
he was suffering from an abnormal state of mind, which is referred to as a
depressive psychosis, in which the symptoms are severe depression,
hopelessness, inability to sleep, loss of appetite, loss of weight, and
impairment of volition—that is to say, impairment of ability to decide even inconsequential
things, inability to make up a decision in a normal kind of a way. In this
state, a person is so hopeless, their feelings are so hopeless, that their
judgment becomes distorted, and their thinking confused.

Dr. Ian Blake Thomson, Assistant Medical Superintendent of
the Psychiatric Institute in Winnipeg and a lecturer in psychiatry at the
University of Manitoba, expressed the following opinion:

… I formed the opinion that he had during the course of last
year … suffered from symptoms of depression, and that towards the end of the
period in question—that is, in September of last year, during the month of
September—his condition deteriorated very markedly, so that the depression
deepened and became a severe depression with great feelings of despair and
despondency and hopelessness; and he suffered from brooding preoccupation which
interfered with his ability to work, to reason, to think, and that at the time
of the alleged offence, this condition very probably was one which in medical
terms is called a ""psychosis"", which is a major mental illness.

This is very important and highly relevant evidence given by
men of eminence in their profession. The learned trial judge instead of leaving
it to the jury for the consideration to which it was entitled, quoted from
Phipson on Evidence, Taylor on Evidence and Lord Campbell, to the effect that
the testimony of experts is of slight weight.

From Phipson on Evidence, 9th ed., p. 403, he quoted:

The testimony of experts is often considered to be of slight
value, since they are proverbially, though perhaps unwittingly, biased in
favour of the side which calls them, as well as over-ready to regard harmless
facts as confirmation of preconceived theories …

From Taylor on Evidence, 12th ed., p. 59, he quoted:

Perhaps the testimony which least deserves credit with a
jury is that of skilled witnesses … it is often quite surprising to see
with what facility, and to what an extent, their views can be made to
correspond with the wishes or the interests of the parties who call them.

[Page 538]

From Lord Campbell's judgment in the Tracy Peerage case5,
he quoted:

Skilled witnesses come with such a bias on their minds to
support the cause in which they are embarked that hardly any weight should be
given to their evidence.

I agree with Freedman J.A. that as generalizations, these
statements are bad. They could, moreover, have no possible application to the
evidence given in this case. All the judges in the Court of Appeal were of the
opinion that the medical evidence was relevant and admissible and that there
was error in the judge's instruction. In the context in which this instruction
was given, the only possible reference is to the evidence of Dr. Adamson and
Dr. Thomson and the probable result of this unwarranted disparagement of their
evidence was its withdrawal from the jury's serious consideration. On a charge
of capital murder, based on an allegation that the killing was planned and
deliberate, it was virtually a withdrawal of the whole defence.

I agree with Freedman J.A. that in these circumstances the
Court cannot hold that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice. I would, however, not substitute a verdict of non-capital murder. This
case has never really been considered by the jury on evidence which should have
been before it.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction of capital
murder and direct a new trial.

Since writing these reasons, I have had the opportunity of
reading the reasons of my brother Cartwright and I agree with them.

Appeal allowed and new trial directed, Taschereau C.J. and Fauteux J.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE,
PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Lotteries—Mail order product distribution
plan—Whether scheme contrary to s. 179(1) (e) of the Criminal Code , 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51.

The respondents conducted a mail order product distribution
plan whereby a participant received three cards which he sold to three friends
for $4 each. The participant returned the three cards to the respondents, each
card bearing the name and address of one of the friends, together with $12. The
original participant would then receive three cartons of cigarettes of his
choice. The three friends in turn would receive three cards each and, after
repeating the same procedure of selling their cards, would each receive three
cartons of cigarettes.

The respondents were charged under s. 179(1) (e) of the Criminal
Code  with conducting a scheme by which any person, upon payment of any sum
of money, could become entitled under the scheme to receive a larger sum of
money or amount of valuable security than the sum paid by reason of the fact
that other persons had paid any sum of money under the scheme. The respondents
were convicted, but their convictions were quashed by the Court of Queen's
Bench. The Crown appealed to this Court.

Held: The appeal of the Crown should be dismissed.

A participant in the scheme did not receive anything which
falls within the term ""valuable security"" within the meaning of s.
179(1)(e) of the Code.

Even if it could be held, contrary to what was decided by the
Court of Queen's Bench, that what the participant obtained under the scheme
could be regarded as constituting valuable security, the scheme would not be in
contravention of s. 179(1)(e) of the Code. The essence of the scheme was
that the respondents were prepared to compensate, in the form of goods, at
their own expenses, for the performance of services, such as advertising and
distribution of their products, which they obviously considered to be of value
to them. The scheme did not, therefore, fall under s. 179(1)(e) of the
Code.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the Court of
Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, quashing the
respondents' convictions on a charge of conducting a lottery. Appeal dismissed.

[Page 626]

R. Larivée, Q.C., for the appellant.

F. Kaufman, for the respondents.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Martland J.:—This
is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (Appeal Side) for
the Province of Quebec2, which unanimously maintained the
present respondents' appeals against their convictions on charges laid against
them under s. 179(1) (e) of the Criminal Code  which provides as
follows:

179. (1) Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for two years who

* * *

(e) conducts, manages or is a party to any scheme,
contrivance or operation of any kind by which any person, upon payment of any
sum of money, or the giving of any valuable security, or by obligating himself
to pay any sum of money or give any valuable security, shall become entitled
under the scheme, contrivance or operation, to receive from the person
conducting or managing the scheme, contrivance or operation, or any other
person, a larger sum of money or amount of valuable security than the sum or
amount paid or given, or to be paid or given, by reason of the fact that other
persons have paid or given, or obligated themselves to pay or give any sum of
money or valuable security under the scheme, contrivance or operation;

The scheme conducted by the respondents in respect of which
the charges were laid is described in agreed admissions of fact as follows:

At material times the above company (i.e. Buckley's
Wholesale Tobacco Ltd.) has conducted a mail order product distribution plan
that operates as follows:

a) A number of people each receive a written
explanation of the company's operation and an offer to participate in that
operation, together with three (3) identical beige coloured cards.

b) Each of the above persons may then explain the
company's operation to friends, and sell each of the three cards to a friend
for a price of $4.00.

c) Upon returning the three cards (now completed,
with each one bearing the name and address of a new customer) along with the
$12.00 collected ($4.00 for each of the 3 cards) to the company, the company
sends to the original customer three (3) cartons of cigarettes (of the brand
chosen by him), and it sends to each of his friends who has paid $4.00, i.e.
each new customer, a set of 3 cards.

d) Each of the above mentioned participants can then
sell his three cards at a price of $4.00 each, and upon sending the completed
cards

[Page 627]

back to the company, receives in turn three cartons of
cigarettes (of the brand he chooses).

e) Thus the orginal participants receive three
cartons of cigarettes in return for having sold the 3 cards sent to them, and
each subsequent participant receives 3 cartons of cigarettes in return for
having purchased a set of cards for $4.00 and having sold those cards to three
of his friends.

f) Participants who succeed in selling 2 cards, but
have difficulty with the third, can return their 2 completed cards (together
with the $8.00 collected) to the company, and receive in return 2 instead of 3
cartons of cigarettes. If they then succeed in selling the third card, they
receive a third carton of cigarettes.

g) Participants who have bought a set of cards
(for $4.00) but who seem to be unsuccessful in selling them are given the
opportunity of returning their uncompleted cards to the company, and of
choosing a premium from a number of items offered to them by the company,
thereby eliminating any chance of loss to them.

h) Participants may substitute various other products
for cigarettes.

i) Participants who sell their cards promptly may
receive special bonuses.

The instruction sheet sent by the respondents to their
customers read as follows:

Dear Customer:—

Enclosed you will find 3 cards for which you have paid
$4.00.

Please follow these instructions:

(1) Sell these 3 cards to your customer friends at $4.00
each.

(2) Mail us the 3 cards with the $12.00.

We will then mail you the 3 cartons of cigarettes (of your
choice), plus 9 cards for distribution to your 3 customer friends. They, in
turn, will sell these 3 cards to their friends at $4.00 each and will then
receive their 3 cartons of cigarettes.

Yours very truly,

BUCKLEY'S WHOLESALE

TOBACCO LIMITED.

P.S. Do not send cash through the mail. Send money order
only, this being your receipt.

In the reasons for the judgment from which this appeal is
brought, it was held that a participant in this scheme does not receive
anything which falls within the term ""valuable security"" within the
meaning of s. 179(1) (e) and, in consequence, as a participant does not
receive a sum of money or valuable security, the scheme did not contravene that
paragraph. I am in agreement with this conclusion.

Furthermore, I do not think that the scheme would contravene
that paragraph even if that which a participant obtains under it could be
regarded as constituting valuable security. His entitlement to receive property
under the scheme does not arise merely by his payment of money and

[Page 628]

the property to which he becomes entitled is not received by
him ""by reason of the fact that other persons have paid or given, or
obligated themselves to pay or give any sum of money or valuable security under
the scheme, contrivance or operation"".

This is not a scheme such as that which was considered by
this Court in Dream Home Contests (Edmonton) Limited v. R.3,
under which a number of people purchased tickets and the winner received a
prize substantially more valuable than the amount which he had paid for the
ticket, as a result of the moneys paid for the tickets paid for by the other
contestants. In the present case the typical participant does not become
entitled to obtain his cartons of cigarettes or other products upon payment of
the $4.00 fee. It is also necessary for him to persuade three other persons to
enter into the arrangement which he himself has made. He thereby renders a
service to the respondent company which, in turn, derives a benefit by reason
of the wider advertising and distribution of the products which it has for sale
and for which service it is prepared to compensate the participant in the form
of goods of a value exceeding the $4.00 fee. While the scheme in question here
is different from that which was considered by this Court in R. v. The
Procter and Gamble Company of Canada, Ltd.4, and while the
charge in that case was laid under different paragraphs of s. 179(1) , the
reasoning in that case is, I think, also applicable to the present one. The
essence of the matter is that the respondent company is prepared to compensate,
in the form of goods, at its own expense, for the performance of services which
it obviously considers to be of value to itself. It is not conducting a scheme
whereby a prize can be won by a contestant which is provided out of the funds
obtained from other contestants under the scheme.

For these reasons, in my opinion, the appeal should be
dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL OF THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES.

Criminal law—Charge of murder—Conviction of
manslaughter—Appeal.

Courts—Conviction affirmed by Court of
Appeal—Dissenting judgment— Whether conflict between majority and minority on
questions of law— Jurisdiction of Supreme Court to entertain appeal—Criminal
Code , 1953-64 (Can.), c. 61, ss. 69S(1)(a), (b), (c), 697(1)(a).

The appellant was charged with the murder of a woman with whom
he was sharing a one-room cabin. He
testified he had noticed that a rifle in the porch was cocked and that on re-entering the cabin he had asked the woman if it was loaded and she answered it was
not. He, nevertheless, proceeded to
uncock the rifle and it discharged, the bullet killing the woman instantaneously. The accused's story
indicated that when he attempted to
uncock the rifle, the rifle barrel was directly in line with the head of the deceased then lying in bed.
Thereafter, and on three successive occasions, the appellant admitted
responsibility for the shooting, but at the
trial his evidence, in substance, was that he had no intention of harming the deceased and the shooting was purely accidental.

The jury were particularly
instructed as to murder; manslaughter; provocation, drunkenness and criminal negligence, as incidents reducing murder to manslaughter, and directed that if the
shooting was accidental and
unaccompanied by criminal negligence, there was no crime. At the close of the trial they brought in a verdict
that ""we find death by accidental means with elements of criminal
negligence, and bring in a verdict of
manslaughter"". The appellant's conviction was affirmed by a majority of the Court of Appeal. He then
appealed to this Court on the grounds,
(i) that the trial judge misdirected the jury, and (ii) that the verdict of the jury was ambiguous and
the trial judge should not have
directed a verdict of guilty of manslaughter to be entered.

Held (Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. dissenting): The appeal
should be allowed, the conviction
quashed and a new trial directed on the charge of manslaughter.

Per Locke, Cartwright and Martland JJ.: Assuming that Rozon
v. The King, [1951] S.C.R. 248, is authority for the proposition
that a person who is convicted of an
indictable offence whose conviction is affirmed by the Court of Appeal and Who asserts a right of appeal to this Court under the provisions of s. 597(1)  (a) of the
Criminal Code  must show not
only (i) that a judge of the Court of Appeal dissented and (ii)' that his dissenting judgment was founded on
a question of law, but also (iii) that the question of law upon which
the dissenting judge founded his judgment was
considered by the majority in the Court of

[Page 372]

Appeal and that they
disagreed with the view of the dissenting judge upon it, this Court had
jurisdiction to entertain the present appeal on both of the grounds put forward.

With respect to the first
ground, the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal found that a passage in the charge to the jury was material and fatally misleading, while Johnson and Kane JJ.A.
held that the same passage was
irrelevant. This was a disagreement on a point of law.

As to the second ground,
there was direct disagreement between the majority and the minority in the Court of Appeal and the question was one of
law. In deciding what verdict should be entered by the Court following the
rendering of a special verdict by the jury the judge was deciding a question of law.

As to the merits of the appeal, there was, as found by the
Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal,
misdirection in the charge to the jury. Also as found by the Chief Justice, there was ambiguity or uncertainty in the jury's verdict.

The argument of counsel for the respondent, based on s.
592(1)(b) (iii) of the Code, was rejected.

Per Taschereau J., dissenting: There was no dissent
within the meaning of s. 597(1)(a) of the Code;
there was no conflict between the majority judgment and the one delivered by the minority on questions of law. In order to give jurisdiction to this Court there
must necessarily exist a difference
between the views of the majority and those of the minority. None could be found in the present case. The
King v. Décary, [1942] S.C.R. 80; Rozon v. The King, supra; The
Queen v. Fitton, [1956] S.C.R. 958, referred to.

Per Fauteux J., dissenting: All the members of
the Court of Appeal agreed that there
was evidence to support a verdict of manslaughter founded on criminal
negligence; there was no dissent expressed by the majority on the views taken
by the minority on the question of the validity of the instructions in the
charge to the jury; the only point of difference was confined to the verdict held to be ambiguous by the minority and unambiguous by the majority. The determination
of the question whether the answer or
opinion given by the jury on the facts was clear or ambiguous did not involve the determination of any question of
law, nor was there any determined by either the members of the majority or those of the minority. The difference
in the view they formed in the matter was not a difference on a question
of law within the meaning of s. 597(1) (a).

However, contrary to these
views, assuming the appellant did bring his appeal within the section and that it was open to this Court to consider the grounds of appeal, the appeal should,
nevertheless, be dismissed. Once the
appellant's account of the occurrence was accepted, as it was by the
jury, a verdict of manslaughter based on criminal negligence was, in the circumstances of the case, the only verdict which
a reasonable jury acting judicially could return. With respect to the alleged misdirections, the jury having accepted
appellant's testimony, it became
irrelevant to the appeal to consider the validity of these instructions, and, in any event, no miscarriage of
justice or substantial wrong resulted
therefrom. As to the verdict, when considered with the evidence and the judge's charge, it meant no more than that

[Page 373]

the
jury were indicating to the judge that one of the three types of manslaughter
which it was open for them to find—that is, due to criminal negligence,
provocation or because of drunkenness—they were finding him guilty of
manslaughter because of criminal negligence.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of the Northwest Territories[1],
affirming by a majority the appellant's conviction of manslaughter. Appeal
allowed, Taschereau and Fauteux JJ. dissenting.

A. W. Miller, Q.C., for the appellant.

T. D. MacDonald, Q.C., for the respondent.

TASCHEREAU J. (dissenting):—I
had the advantage of reading the reasons delivered by my brothers Cartwright
and Fauteux, and I agree with my brother Fauteux that this appeal should be
quashed. I only wish to add a few personal observations.

The jurisdiction of this Court is determined by
s. 597(1)  of the Criminal Code  which
is as follows:

597. (1) A person who is convicted of an
indictable offence other than an offence punishable by death and whose
conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme Court
of Canada. 1960-1961, c. 42, s. 27(1).

(a) on any question of law on which a judge
of the court of appeal dissents, or

(b) …………………………………………………………………………………………     

I think that in the present case, there has been
no dissent within the meaning of this
section. I can find no conflict between
the majority judgment and the one delivered by the minority, on
questions of law.

In The King v. Décary[2], it was held that the Court had no
jurisdiction to entertain the appeal because neither of the judgments of the
two dissenting judges of the appellate court disclosed a dissent on a question
of law within the meaning of (former) s. 1023  of the Criminal Code .

In his reasons, speaking for the full Court, Sir
Lyman Duff said:

It is quite plain that the judgment does
not rest upon any view of the majority upon a question which is a question of
law alone.

And further, at p. 84, he says:

Mr. Justice Walsh, in the reasons delivered
by him for his conclusion that there should be a new trial, does not say,
either expressly or by implication, that this conclusion is based upon an
opinion that the majority proceeds upon any error in point of law alone.








[Page 374]

In Rozon v. The King[3], it was held that,      

the appeal should be dismissed as the
dissent in the Court of Appeal was not on any ground of law dealt with by the
majority, and upon which there was a disagreement in the Court of Appeal.

Speaking for the majority of the Court, Mr.
Justice Fauteux said:

Being of opinion that the judgment of the
majority in this case does not rest upon a question of law alone and that the
judgment of the minority rests upon a question of law upon which there was no
expressed or implied dissent from the majority, I must conclude that it is not
within the jurisdiction of this Court to review the answer given by the Court
of Appeal, etc. ...

The same jurisprudence has been followed in The
Queen v. Fitton[4].
In that case, at p. 978, Mr. Justice Cartwright says:

In my opinion the motion should be granted.
After reading all the evidence and everything that was said by counsel and by
the learned trial judge during the hearing
and disposition of the issue raised as to the admissibility in evidence of the oral and written
statements above referred to and everything said on the point in the
reasons for judgment delivered in the Court of Appeal I am unable to discern
any dissent on, or indeed any difference
of opinion as to any point of law.

These judgments clearly hold that in order to
give jurisdiction to this Court, there must necessarily exist a difference
between the views of the majority and those of the minority. I can find none in
the present case. The case of Brooks v. The King[5] is not an authority to support the
contention that this difference of view is not a necessary element to confer
jurisdiction to this Court. In that case the matter has not even been
considered.

I would quash the appeal.

The judgment of Locke and Martland JJ. was
delivered by

LOCKE J.:—I have had the advantage of
reading the judgments to be delivered in this matter by my brothers Cartwright
and Fauteux.

I agree with my brother Cartwright that there
is, in this case, a dissent—as that expression in s. 597(1) (a) of the Code is
interpreted in Rozon v. The King[6]—upon the two questions
of law to which he has referred. Accordingly, there is jurisdiction in this
Court to entertain this appeal.








[Page 375]

For the reasons assigned by the learned Chief
Justice of Alberta and by my brother Cartwright, I would quash the conviction
and direct that there be a new trial on a charge of manslaughter.

CARTWRIGHT J.:—This is an appeal from
a judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Northwest
 Territories[7] affirming, by a majority, the appellant's conviction of
manslaughter before Sissons J. and a jury. S. Bruce Smith C.J. and Hugh John
Macdonald J.A. dissenting, would have allowed the appeal, quashed the
conviction and directed a new trial on the charge of manslaughter.

The appellant was tried on an indictment
charging ""that he at Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories on the 17th day of December, A.D., 1960, did murder Madelaine
Marlowe contrary to section 206  of the Criminal Code "".

The facts are summarized in the reasons of my
brother Fauteux, which I have had the advantage of reading. I shall refrain
from repeating them but will make reference here-after to one or two matters
appearing in the transcript which appear to me to require special mention.

Before turning to the merits of the appeal it is
necessary to consider the question of our jurisdiction.

While the notice of appeal contains a number of
paragraphs, counsel for the appellant put forward only two grounds of appeal,
(i) that the learned trial judge misdirected the jury, and (ii) that the
verdict of the jury was ambiguous and the learned trial judge should not have
directed a verdict of guilty of manslaughter to be entered.

Counsel for the Crown submits that as to the
second of the above grounds there is no dissent on a question of law by a Judge
of the Court of Appeal which would give a right of appeal to this Court under
s. 597(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code . In his factum he puts this
submission as follows:

There was no difference of opinion in the
Court of Appeal upon the question of what constitutes criminal negligence or
manslaughter; the only difference of opinion was as to what the jury intended
to say.

Counsel for the Crown does not in his factum
make a similar submission as to the first ground of appeal, based on
misdirection, and I did not understand him to do so in his oral argument; but,
of course, neither failure to object nor indeed express consent can confer
jurisdiction on the








[Page 376]

Court if the right of appeal is not given by the
statute. My brother Fauteux has reached the conclusion that we are without
jurisdiction to entertain either ground of appeal and both must be examined.

For the purpose of this branch of the matter I
will assume that the case of Rozon v. The King[8] is authority for the proposition that a
person who is convicted of an indictable offence whose conviction is affirmed
by the Court of Appeal and who asserts a right of appeal to this Court under
the provision of clause (a) of subs. 1 of s. 597  of the Criminal Code 
must show not only (i) that a Judge of the Court of Appeal dissented and (ii)
that his dissenting judgment was founded on a question of law, but also (iii)
that the question of law upon which the dissenting judge founded his judgment
was considered by the majority in the Court of Appeal and that they disagreed
with the view of the dissenting judge upon it. I use this form of expression
because, with the greatest respect, if the judgment of the majority in the Rozon
case does enunciate the proposition stated, it is my opinion that, giving full
effect to the rule of stare decisis, it is still open to this Court to
reconsider it on the ground that it is at variance with other judgments of this
Court equally binding upon us and which were not referred to in the reasons in Rozon;
an example being Brooks v. The King[9].
The fact that Rozon was followed in Pearson v. The Queen[10], does not preclude
this reconsideration; for the reasons in Pearson simply follow Rozon
and make no mention of the other judgments of this Court referred to above
which were not dealt with in Rozon. It would not, I think, be proper to
endeavour to enter upon such a reconsideration in the case at bar, because
proceeding on the assumption that Rozon is authority for the proposition
stated above I have reached the conclusion that we have jurisdiction to
entertain this appeal on both of the grounds argued before us by counsel for
the appellant.








[Page 377]

As to the first
ground, that of misdirection of the jury in a material
matter, the learned Chief Justice found that the misdirection occurred when the learned trial judge gave the jury additional directions, from which he quoted
the following passage:

I think the
most serious objection taken by counsel for the defence was when I stated to you if you did not believe the evidence of the
accused as to this being an accident that it,
did not automatically follow that the verdict would be murder, and that
the accused would still be presumed to be innocent until proved guilty, and
that it was necessary for you to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he had the
intent to murder Madelaine Marlowe. I think
perhaps I should have gone a little further than I did, and made my remarks clearer than I probably did.
All you have got, the situation you have then if you disbelieve that story, you
have the evidence that the accused shot Madelaine Marlowe, but there is
no evidence as to intent, or what intent he had in his mind when he shot her,
and it doesn't rule out even an1
accidental death.

It is conceivable he might have shot at
her, he might have shot at her with the intent of scaring her, or he may not
even have pointed the rifle at her at all,
but if he did point the rifle at her, it might have been a case of
trying to scare her—it might have been in itself an unlawful act, the unlawful
act of point (sic) a rifle—but in any of those things, any of those things would make it manslaughter, instead of
murder.

Now I don't know whether I can make myself
any clearer, and in fact, I doubt very much if I have met the wishes of counsel
for the defence, and I am afraid all I have done is to make this situation more
confusing, but that is the best I can do.

Dealing with this passage later in his reasons
the learned Chief Justice said:

Before
concluding I wish to add, with every respect to the learned trial judge, that in my opinion he misdirected the jury, (a) in
instructing them after they were brought back that any of the
""things"" set out in the second last
paragraph of his additional directions and quoted by me at page 6, ""would make it manslaughter"",
(b) in directing the jury that if the
accused shot the deceased when he ""may not even have pointed the rifle at her at all"", ""that would make it
manslaughter"".

It seems clear
to me that in respect to the matters referred to in (a) the jury should have been left to find whether their verdict was
manslaughter or not guilty as was suggested at the trial by counsel for the
Crown. The jury were in my view directed to
find manslaughter in any of the circumstances set out in the paragraph
referred to.

I am satisfied that the jury should not
have been told that it ""would make it
manslaughter"" if the accused had not pointed the rifle at the deceased
at all, at all events unless there was coupled with this direction the qualification that in order to so convict they
must find the accused was negligent in
the degree required in manslaughter cases, or a reference to this
requirement as explained earlier in the charge.

[Page 378]

Turning to the reasons of the majority it will be
found that Parker J.A. did not disagree with the learned Chief Justice on this first ground; indeed he pointed
out further errors in the charge. After quoting the second paragraph
from the additional directions which had been quoted by the learned Chief
Justice, Parker J.A. said:

This portion of the charge is not, with
respect, completely sound.

The learned Justice of Appeal went on to hold
that the appeal should be dismissed for the reason which he stated as follows:

Although there are, with respect, certain
deficiencies in the charge of the jury, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has occurred and, accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal against
conviction having regard to the provisions of Section 592(1)  (b) (iii) of the Criminal
Code .

Johnson J.A., with whom (except on the question
of sentence) Kane J.A. agreed, says early in his reasons:

The two grounds of appeal which require
consideration are, (1) that there was no evidence upon which to found a verdict
of manslaughter, and (2) that the jury's verdict was in fact a verdict of
acquittal, or alternatively, that the verdict indicated a doubt as to there
being criminal negligence within1 the meaning of the Criminal Code .

It will be observed that this sentence makes no
mention of the question of misdirection;
however, later in his reasons the
learned Justice of Appeal in the course of his discussion of the
question whether the words used by the jury when they returned to render a
verdict were unambiguous refers to several
portions of the charge and says:

At the end of the charge, defence counsel
objected that this latter part of the charge was bad because it stated that the
story of the accused must be accepted before the jury could find that death was
caused by accident. The jury was recalled and
further instructed. The instructions on this point were preceded by the words ""if you disbelieve
that (appellant's) story"", and what followed is not very clearly
expressed. Much was made at the hearing of
this appeal of these additional instructions but I think it is quite
clear from their verdict that the jury accepted the appellant's account of what happened, for it is only on this evidence
that a verdict of criminal negligence would be founded. That being so,
these additional instructions to the jury became
irrelevant as far as this appeal is concerned.

With the greatest respect to those who entertain
a different view, it appears to me that when one judge holds that a passage in
the charge to the jury is material and fatally misleading and another judge
holds that the same passage is irrelevant they are in disagreement on a point
of law. 

[Page 379]

Turning now to the question whether we have
jurisdiction to consider the second ground of appeal it is at once apparent
that as to this ground there was direct disagreement between the majority and
the minority in the Court of Appeal and all that has to be considered is
whether the question is one of law. It is desirable to state precisely what
occurred when the jury returned to the courtroom for the purpose of giving
their verdict. The transcript reads as follows:

The Clerk: Gentlemen of the jury, have you
arrived at your verdict? if so, say so by
your foreman.

Foreman of the Jury: (Mr. H. McCaskill): We
have.

The Clerk: What is your verdict?

Foreman of the Jury: We find death by
accidental means, with elements of criminal negligence, and bring in a verdict
of manslaughter.

The Clerk:
Gentlemen of the Jury, do you all agree? (Each name was called, and each juror
answered ""Yes"").

The Clerk: Harken to your verdict as
rendered by your foreman, you find death by accidental means, with elements of
criminal negligence.

Mr. Miller: In the light of the finding of
the Jury, I am asking that Your Lordship direct that the accused be acquitted.
The finding is that death was accidental,
with elements; of criminal negligence, which indicates a doubt that it
was caused by criminal negligence, and therefore the accused is entitled to an
acquittal.

Mr. De Weerdt:
I have nothing to say, except that I would disagree.

The Court: No, I am accepting the verdict of the
jury as the verdict of
manslaughter.

It will be observed that when the clerk directed
the jury to harken to their verdict and proceeded to state it he omitted the
final words which had been used by the foreman: ""and bring in a verdict of
manslaughter"".

It will also be observed that the clerk did not
use the form of question which is usual: ""Harken to your verdict as
recorded ... so say you all?"" The reason for this would seem to be that
the clerk rightly regarded the findings of the jury as reported by the foreman
to be a special verdict upon which it would be for the judge to direct whether
a verdict of guilty or not guilty should be recorded. While the argument that
followed as to what verdict should be entered by the Court is extremely brief
and the decision of the learned trial judge even more so, it would appear that
the learned judge and counsel also regarded the verdict as a special one.

[Page 380]

Special verdicts in criminal cases are unusual;
the Criminal Code  makes express provision for them in only two cases,
defamatory libel (s. 267 ), and cases in which evidence is given that the
accused was insane at the time the offence was committed (s. 523 ); but the Criminal
Code  does not forbid the giving of a special verdict in any case and it is
open to the jury to do so if they see fit.

The matter is put briefly and accurately in
Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 10, under the title ""Criminal
Law and Procedure"" as follows:

at page 428:

The verdict may be either a general verdict
of guilty or not guilty on the whole charge, or a verdict of guilty on one part
of the charge and not guilty on another part, or a special verdict which finds
the facts of the case and reserves the legal inference to be drawn from them for
the judgment of the Court. 

at page 430:

Where a special verdict is returned, it is
for the Court to act upon it and to direct a verdict of guilty or not guilty to
be entered. 

and at page 431:

If the finding of the jury is ambiguous or
inconsistent, and a verdict of guilty has been entered on it, the conviction
will be quashed.

It is sufficient to refer to one of the cases
cited. In Regina v. Gray[11],
the prisoner was indicted for obtaining food and money by false pretences.
After the summing up the jury retired to consider their verdict and upon their
return handed to the trial judge a paper which they said contained their
verdict. It read as follows: ""Guilty of obtaining food and money under
false pretences, but whether there was any intent to defraud the jury consider
there is not sufficient evidence, and therefore strongly recommend the prisoner
to mercy"". The trial judge accepted this verdict and discharged the jury.
After hearing argument the trial judge directed a verdict of guilty to be
entered but at the request of counsel for the prisoner stated a case for the
Court of Crown Cases Reserved. The members of that Court, Lord Coleridge C.J.
and Denman, Mathew, Charles and Williams JJ., were unanimous in deciding that
the conviction should be quashed. Denman J. said at page 302:

If the verdict had been guilty merely, no
question could have arisen. But when the jury go beyond the mere verdict of
guilty or not guilty and add words, they at once give rise to the question
whether their verdict is sufficient.








[Page 381]

It is scarcely necessary to point out that the
jurisdiction of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved was limited to deciding
questions of law which: arose in criminal trials. The strictness with which
that rule was observed is illustrated by the case of The Queen v. Clark[12].

That Parliament contemplated the giving of
special verdicts in criminal cases appears from the wording of clause (c) of
subs. (1) of s. 592  of the Criminal Code  which
reads as follows:

592. (1) On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction, the Court of Appeal

*      *      *

(c) may refuse to allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that the
trial court arrived at a wrong conclusion as to the effect of a special
verdict, and may order the conclusion to be recorded that appears to the court
to be required by the verdict, and may pass a sentence that is warranted in law
in substitution for the sentence passed by the trial court;

The opening words of this clause ""may
refuse to allow the appeal"" would indicate that but for the power
conferred by this subsection the Court of Appeal should allow the appeal if of
opinion that the trial court arrived at a wrong conclusion as to the result of
a special verdict.

The Court of Appeal derives its power to allow
an appeal against a conviction from subs. (1) of s. 592  and, in my opinion, it
is only in clause (a) (ii) of that subsection that power is found to allow an
appeal because the trial court has arrived at a wrong conclusion as to the
effect of a special verdict; in arriving at that wrong conclusion the trial
court has made ""a wrong decision on a question of law"". It will be
remembered that s. 592(1)  (a) reads as follows:

592. (1) On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction, the court of appeal

(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the
opinion that

(i) the verdict should be set aside on the
ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence, 

(ii) the judgment of the trial court should
be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or 

(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage
of justice.

In my opinion in deciding what verdict should be
entered by the Court following the rendering of a special verdict by the jury
the judge is deciding a question of law; the task of








[Page 382]

the jury has been completed and it becomes the
function of the judge to interpret their finding and to order the appropriate
verdict of guilty or not guilty to be entered; ad quaestionem facti non
respondent judices; ad quaestionem juris non respondent juratores.

On the merits of the appeal I find myself as
regards both of the grounds argued before us, in substantial agreement with the
reasons of the learned Chief Justice who dissented and in whose reasons
Macdonald J.A. concurred.

I agree with the view of the learned Chief
Justice that the learned trial judge should have asked the jury to reconsider
their verdict, but as this was not done we must, of course, deal with the
matter on the record as it stands.

I have already quoted the passage from the
reasons of the Chief Justice in which he found that there had been misdirection
and I agree with it. His reasons on the second ground conclude as follows:

I find myself unable to conclude what the
jury meant by the phrase ""with elements of criminal negligence"" and
where there is ambiguity or uncertainty in a jury's verdict and their intention
is not clear, this court cannot speculate or guess what the jury meant. The
confusion is added to by the clerk having recorded the verdict as 'you find
death by accidental means with elements of criminal negligence' without
reference to their words 'and bring in a verdict of manslaughter'. The jury
made no comment when the clerk asked them to 'harken to your verdict as
rendered by your foreman'. The jury may have accepted the accused's statement
as to what occurred and found that he failed to act as a reasonable person,
that is that he was negligent and that his negligence caused the deceased's
death, but reached the conclusion that his negligence was not of the high
degree required to prove manslaughter. There is so much doubt whether the jury
intended to convict of manslaughter that in my opinion it would be quite unsafe
to accept the jury's verdict as one of guilty of this offence and on this
ground I would quash the conviction and direct a new trial. I do not consider
that the verdict which the jury rendered is a verdict which can be recorded as
a verdict at all.

With this passage also I agree.

It remains to consider the argument of counsel
for the respondent based on s. 592(1)  (b)
(iii) of the Criminal Code :

592 (1) On the hearing of an appeal against
a conviction, the court of appeal

(b) may dismiss the appeal where

*      *      *

(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of
opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) the
appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred;

[Page 383]

It may be observed, in passing, that it is only
in cases of which the court is of opinion that the appeal might be decided in
favour of the appellant because the judgment of the trial court should be set
aside on the ground of error in law that it can require to consider subpara.
(iii) of s. 592(1)  (b) at all.

On this point also I am in agreement with the
reasons of the learned Chief Justice and propose to add only a few words.

The finding of the jury has negatived any
intention on the part of the appellant to injure the deceased. There was
evidence on which it was open to the jury to find that immediately before the
happening of the fatal accident the appellant was engaged in endeavouring to
unload the rifle in case it should be loaded. The rifle was cocked and the
appellant did not know whether it was loaded or not. He had not loaded it but
apparently he was not satisfied of the reliability of the statement of the
deceased that she had not done so. The rifle was made an exhibit; we had an
opportunity of examining it and it was described by the witness Corporal Kirby
of the R.C.M.P., an expert in the matter of fire arms. It is a .22 calibre rim
fire, bolt-action, single-shot rifle. After a cartridge has been inserted and
the breech closed the rifle is cocked by ""grasping the bolt by the tail
and bringing it to the rear"". The rifle is then ready to be fired. It is
so constructed that when there is a live round in the breech and the rifle is
cocked the breech cannot be opened to permit of the extraction of the live
round until the rifle is either discharged or un cocked. Corporal Kirby was
asked how the rifle could be un cocked without firing it and explained that
this operation ""requires both hands, one to grasp the tail of the bolt,
and the second to release the trigger and then it is allowed to travel forward
slowly"". It is obvious that if while this procedure was being carried out
the bolt should slip from the fingers of the operator the rifle would be
discharged. The concluding question and answer in Corporal Kirby's
cross-examination read as follows:

Q. And if one is not careless, but is
careful, one might still accidentally lose contact with the tail of the bolt? 

A. Yes sir, and allow it to fire.

It appears to me that it would have been open to
the jury to take the view that the appellant, engrossed in the operation of
uncocking the rifle, was momentarily inattentive to

[Page 384]

the direction in which it was pointing; and on
that view it would be a question of degree for the jury whether his conduct
amounted to the ""very high degree of negligence required to be proved
before the felony is established""—to use the words of Lord Atkin in Andrews
v. Director of Public Prosecutions[13],
quoted in the reasons of Johnson J.A.

The question was eminently one on which the
appellant was entitled to have the verdict of a properly instructed jury; I
find it impossible to say that had the jury been properly instructed they would
necessarily have convicted him.

While I do not found my judgment upon what was
said by Crown counsel at the trial after the misdirection referred to above had
occurred, it is worthy of note that, with exemplary fairness, Mr. Price
submitted to the learned trial judge that it was open to the jury to find a
verdict of not guilty and that he should so instruct them.

For the above reasons and those given by the
learned Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal, I would allow the appeal, quash
the conviction and direct a new trial on the charge of manslaughter.

FAUTEUX J. (dissenting):—Tried,
last May at Yellow-knife in the Northwest Territories, on a charge that he, at
Yellowknife on the 17th day of December 1960, did murder one Madelaine Marlowe,
contrary to s. 206  C.C., appellant was found guilty of manslaughter. His appeal
from this conviction to the Court of Appeal of the Northwest Territories was
dismissed by a majority decision[14];
Johnson, Parker and Kane JJ.A., of the majority, affirmed the conviction while
Smith C.J.A., and Macdonald J.A., would have ordered a new trial. Appellant now
appeals to this Court.

For the purpose of this appeal, the facts
adduced in evidence by the prosecution and by the accused, sole witness heard
for the defence, need only be shortly stated.

Appellant and the deceased were sharing a small
one-room cabin on Joliffe Island in Yellowknife. The
accused testified that, on the night of December 16, both left the cabin at 6
p.m. and, from that time to 11 p.m., consumed four bottles of wine with two
other persons. Upon their return home at 11 p.m., appellant went to bed while
Marlowe, already inebriated, left the cabin to obtain more








[Page 385]

liquor. Appellant said he became concerned with
her condition and went looking for her at a neighbour's place where admittance
was refused to him. Early in the morning of the 17th, he went out again and
found her at a neighbour's place ""just about as drunk as I have ever seen
her"". He brought her home and both went to bed. He got up in the forenoon
when some visitors came. As he followed the last visitor leaving the cabin, he
said that he glanced at the .22 calibre bolt-action, single-shot rifle which
was behind the door in the porch, noticed that it was cocked and realized that
it was dangerous because a little boy used to run around the premises. Having
re-entered the cabin, he asked Marlowe, who was still lying in bed, whether the
rifle was loaded and she answered it was not. He testified that he, none the
less, proceeded to un cock the rifle and said: ""I don't know what
happened, whether the bolt slipped or I touched the trigger or what but it went
off."" The bullet struck Marlowe's head in the left temporal region
penetrating the brain in a straight horizontal direction. This fact, if
appellant's story is to be believed, indicates that when he attempted to un
cock the rifle, the rifle barrel was directly in line with the head of the
deceased then lying in bed. Marlowe died instantaneously. Thereafter, and on
three successive occasions, appellant admitted responsibility for the shooting.
To McKechnie, the last visitor to leave the cabin prior to the event, he handed
the rifle, saying: ""Here, Trapper, I did it. I shot her. You go to Scratchet's
and phone the police."" To Larsen, a neighbour, he said: ""I shot
Madelaine Marlowe."" And to the police, he declared: ""I shot her""
or ""I shot a woman"" and when asked why, he answered: ""She lied
to me."" After the usual warning, he said: ""I shot her. I don't care.
I told Trapper I shot her and I asked him to phone the police."" He then
inquired whether she was dead and being informed that she was, said:
""Thank God for that. I won't write anything, and I won't say
any-thing."" At trial, he explained that when he said ""She lied to
me"", he was referring to her statement that the gun was unloaded and that
by saying ""Thank God for that"", he was expressing thankfulness for
the fact that being dead she was not going to suffer. In substance, his evidence
was that he had no intention of harming the deceased and the shooting was
purely accidental.

 [Page 386]

The jury were particularly instructed as to
murder; manslaughter; provocation, drunkenness and criminal negligence, as
incidents reducing murder to manslaughter, and directed that if the shooting
was accidental and unaccompanied by criminal negligence, there was no crime. At
the close of the trial, they brought in the following verdict:

We find death by accidental means with
elements of criminal negligence, and bring in a verdict of manslaughter.

Requested to say whether they all agreed to this
verdict, each juryman answered affirmatively.

Appellant then appealed his conviction to the
Court of Appeal with the result already indicated.

His appeal to this Court purports to be lodged
pursuant to s. 597  (l) (a) C.C., reading:

597. (1) A person who is convicted of an
indictable offence other than an offence punishable by death and whose
conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme Court
of Canada. 1960-1961, c. 42, s. 27(1).

(a) on any question of law on which a judge
of the court of appeal dissents, or

(b) ………………………………………………………………………………………..                   

It behooves the appellant to show that the
record discloses material enabling him to bring his appeal within the
conditions prescribed by this section. While, in certain respects having here
no relevancy, the text of this section differs from that of its predecessors,
the section still, as did the latter, conditions the right of appeal given
thereby to the presence, in the reasons for judgment delivered in the Court of
Appeal, of points of difference between the views of the majority and those of
the minority, on pure questions of law. Rozon v. The King[15] and the decisions therein referred to and
applied; The Queen v. Fitton[16]; Pearson
v. The Queen[17]. It is
therefore expedient to compare the two sets of reasons, as was done by this
Court in The King v. Décary[18], to
ascertain whether this statutory condition is here present.

[Page 387]

For the minority, Smith C.J.A., with the
concurrence of Macdonald J.A., found (i) that there was doubt as to what the
jury meant by their verdict; (ii) that there were misdirections in the
following excerpt from the charge:

It is conceivable he
might have shot at her, he might have shot at her with the intent of scaring
her, or he may not even have pointed the rifle at her at all, but if he did
point the rifle at her, it might have been a case of trying to scare her—it
might have been in itself an unlawful act, the unlawful act of point (sic) a
rifle—but in any of those things, any of those things would make it
manslaughter, instead of murder.

Being unable to say that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice had occurred as a result of these instructions, he
concluded that the conviction should be quashed and a new trial ordered.

For the majority, Johnson J.A., with the
concurrence of Kane J.A., said that there were two grounds of appeal requiring
consideration, namely (i) that there was no evidence upon which to found a
verdict of manslaughter and (ii) that the jury's verdict was in fact a verdict
of acquittal or, alternatively, that the verdict indicated a doubt as to there
being criminal negligence within the meaning of the Criminal Code . He
rejected the first ground as being un-founded, adopting, in this respect, a
view similar to that of the Judges of the minority who would have ordered a new
trial. As to the second ground, i.e., the meaning of the verdict, he
also rejected it. While considering this ground, the learned Judge did refer to
the criticism made in relation to the instructions above quoted and found to be
misdirections by the minority. However, he expressed no view in the matter. He
considered these instructions irrelevant as far as the appeal was concerned, in
view of the fact that it was quite clear from the verdict that the jury had
accepted the appellant's account of what had happened.

Parker J.A., said that there were only two
grounds of appeal to which need was to refer, namely, (i) that the trial Judge
misdirected the jury and (ii) that the jury in stating the basis upon which
they found the accused guilty of man-slaughter used language raising a doubt
whether they had proceeded upon the right principle. Considering at first the
latter ground, he rejected it. As to the instructions to the jury, he said that
while there were certain deficiencies in the charge, no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice had occurred.

[Page 388]

In short, all the members of the Court agreed
that there was evidence to support a verdict of manslaughter founded on criminal negligence; there was no dissent
expressed by the majority on the views taken by the minority on the question of the validity of the instructions
quoted above; the only point of difference is confined to the verdict
held to be ambiguous by the minority and unambiguous by the majority. Hence the
question is whether this disagreement is on
a pure question of law.

It is certain that
if the verdict is ambiguous, it cannot be accepted in
that form. On that proposition, there is not the slightest disagreement in the Court below.

By definition, a verdict is ""The answer of
a jury on a question of fact in a civil or criminal proceeding"" Osborn, A
Concise Law Dictionary, or ""The opinion of a jury on a question of fact in
a civil or criminal proceeding"" Earl Jowitt, Dictionary of English Law. In
this particular case, the determination of the question whether the answer or
opinion given by the jury on the facts is clear or ambiguous does not involve
the determination of any question of law, nor was there any determined by
either the members of the majority or those of the minority. The difference in
the view they formed in the matter is not a difference on a question of law
within the meaning of s. 597(1)  (a).

Under these circumstances, I would say that the
record does not disclose material enabling appellant to bring his appeal within
the section and that the appeal should be quashed.

I will assume,
however, that contrary to these views, appellant did bring his appeal within
the section and that it is
open to this Court to consider grounds of appeal raised on behalf of appellant, namely, lack of
evidence to support a
verdict of manslaughter founded on criminal negligence, misdirections, and ambiguity of the verdict.

None of the members
of the Court below found any merits in the first ground. A former soldier, appellant was familiar with the danger of loaded firearms. It was indeed that very danger
which, on his own story, prompted him to un cock the trigger of the rifle. He did not rely on Marlowe's answer that it was not loaded. In performing this
operation, he had a duty to take these ordinary precautions in the
absence of

[Page 389]

which human life would necessarily be
endangered. The elementary if not the only one called for was to make sure that
during the operation the rifle would point in a direction opposite to that of
the woman. The special hazards allegedly attending the un cocking of this
particular rifle, whether known or unknown to appellant, did not minimize but
rendered more imperative the duty to do so. Proceeding as he did while the
rifle was directly in line with the deceased's head, appellant did show wanton
or reckless disregard for the life and safety of the victim. In my view, once
appellant's account of the occurrence is accepted, as it was by the jury, a
verdict of manslaughter based on criminal negligence was, in the circumstances
of this case, the only verdict which a reasonable jury acting judicially could
return.

With respect to the alleged misdirections, I agree
with Johnson and Kane JJ.A., that the jury having accepted appellant's
testimony, it became irrelevant to the appeal to consider the validity of these
instructions, and, in any event, as found by Parker J.A., no miscarriage of
justice or substantial wrong resulted therefrom.

As to the verdict, Johnson J.A., with the
concurrence of Kane J.A., had this to say:

I have said that the verdict must be
considered in the light of the judge's charge. It must also be considered with
the facts of this case. I have said it was apparent that the jury accepted the
appellant's account of the events preceding the shooting. It was the acts of
the appellant as related by himself, which, taken together with and in the
circumstances, related by him, that were criminally negligent. That evidence
was not capable of being broken down into separate ""elements"" which
could be believed or not without destroying the whole fabric of the
explanation. The only exception to this was the conversation between the
accused and the deceased about whether the rifle was loaded. That could be
believed or not without affecting the narrative of events.

The language of a jury of laymen should not
be subjected to minute scrutiny or to fine shading of dictionary meanings. When
the verdict is considered with the evidence and the judge's charge, it means no
more than this: they, the jury, were indicating to the judge that of the three
types of manslaughter which it was open for them to find—that is, due to
criminal negligence, provocation or because of drunkenness—they were finding
him guilty of manslaughter because of criminal negligence.

With these views, I am in substantial agreement.

I would, therefore, quash the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE,
PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Jury trial—Motor vehicles—Jury's verdict—Written
questions and answers—Sufficiency—Clarity—Code of Civil Procedure, art. 483.

The plaintiff was driving his motorcycle when it collided with
a vehicle owned by the defendant Dufour and driven by his employee Drolet. The
jury came to the conclusion that the action should be dismissed and the trial
judge so ordered. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on the ground that
the jury's answers to the questions put to it were not sufficiently clear so as
to satisfy the requirements of art. 483 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The
defendants appealed to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be allowed, and the jury's
verdict as well as the judgment of the trial judge should be restored.

The jury's verdict must be sufficiently clear so that the
trial judge can determine whether or not there was civil liability. Some of the
jury's answers in this case could have been clearer, but the verdict taken as a
whole allowed the Court to supply the minor deficiencies. Article 483 is not to
be construed too narrowly, and the Court should consider the answers as a
whole. Meticulous criticisms of a jury's findings were not admissible and they
must always be read with and construed in the light of the issues presented by
the pleadings, the evidence and the charge of the trial judge. In the present
case the verdict clearly showed that the plaintiff had failed to make out a
case, and that the plaintiff's motocycle struck the rear of the defendant's
vehicle. This finding was sufficient to allow the trial judge to render
judgment in accordance with the verdict of the jury. B.C. Electric Ry. v.
Dunphy, 59 S.C.R. 263, and Sloan v. Fraid, [1943] Que. K.B. 91,
referred to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench,
Appeal Side, Province of Quebec1, reversing a judgment of Lacroix J. and
ordering a new trial. Appeal allowed.

W. Desjardins, Q.C., and A. Desjardins, for
the defendants, appellants.

J. de Billy, Q.C., and A. Marceau, for
the plaintiff, respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Taschereau J.:—Il s'agit dans la présente cause d'un jugement de la Cour du banc
de la reine de la Province de Québec2, qui a maintenu l'appel du demandeur en
Cour supérieure et a ordonné un nouveau procès.

Le demandeur-intimé conduisait sa motocyclette
dans les limites du Village de Beaupré, et vint en collision avec une
camionnette, propriété de Henri-Paul Dufour et conduite par son préposé René
Drolet. A l'issue du procès, le jury vint à la conclusion que l'action devait
être rejetée, et l'honorable Juge Gérard Lacroix a confirmé le verdict rendu.
La Cour du banc de la reine, M. le Juge Miquelon dissident, a cru que les réponses
du jury aux questions posées n'étaient pas suffisamment précises, et que les
exigences de l'art. 483 C.P. qui veut que le verdict soit explicite et
articulé, n'ont pas été satisfaites.

Les questions posées au jury et pertinentes à
la détermination de la présente cause sont les suivantes:

1.—Le demandeur a-t-il été victime d'un
accident le ou vers le 10 juin 1959, alors qu'il conduisait sa motocyclette,
sur la route Royale à Beaupré?

2.—Cet accident a-t-il été le résultat d'une
collision entre la moto-cyclette du demandeur et une camionnette de livraison
appartenant à Henri-Paul Dufour et conduite par René Drolet?

3.—Le conducteur de cette camionnette était-il
l'employé et le préposé du défendeur Henri-Paul Dufour, et dans l'exercice de
ses fonctions?

4.—L'accident dont fut victime le demandeur
est-il dû à la seule faute ou la seule négligence ou imprudence de René Drolet,
l'employé du défendeur? Si qui, en quoi consiste cette faute ou cette
négligence?

5.—L'accident est-il. dû à la seule faute ou
la seule négligence du demandeur Jean Ferland lui-même? Si oui, en quoi
consiste cette faute ou cette négligence?

[Page 547]

6.—Cet accident est-il dû, pour une partie, à
la faute ou à la négligence de René Drolet, l'employé du défendeur Dufour, et
en même temps, pour une partie, à la faute ou à la négligence du demandeur Jean
Ferland? Si oui, dites:

a) quelle a
été la faute ou la négligence de René Drolet?

b) quelle a été la
faute ou la négligence du demandeur Jean Ferland?

Les réponses ont été ainsi rédigées:

1re question:     Oui, 12.

2e question:     Oui, 12.

3e question:     Oui, 12.

4e question:     Non, 12.

5e question:     Oui 11 sur 12, on
a supposé qu'il avait eu une distraction.

6e question:     Sans réponse.

a) sans réponse.

b) sans réponse.

Personne ne conteste, et personne ne peut
contester, que les réponses du jury, comme dans le cas présent, lorsqu'il y a
eu définition des faits, le verdict doit être suffisamment précis pour
permettre au juge au procès de déterminer si, en droit, il y a eu ou non
responsabilité civile.

Il s'agissait dans cette cause de déterminer
si c'est le camion de Dufour qui a frappé la motocyclette de Ferland, ou si
c'est Ferland, comme l'expliquait le juge aux jurés, qui, par inhabilité ou
distraction, a frappé le camion sur le côté droit arrière. C'est sur ce point
que le débat a été engagé.

En formulant les réponses qu'il a données, le
jury évidemment est arrivé à la conclusion que c'est la motocyclette qui a
frappé le camion. Certaines réponses pourraient être sûrement plus précises,
mais l'ensemble du verdict permet de suppléer à ces insuffisances mineures. Les
réponses n'attribuent aucune faute au conducteur du camion, et, à la cinquième
question, le jury exprimait l'opinion que l'accident était dû à la seule faute
de Ferland qui aurait été distrait. C'est la conclusion qu'il faut
nécessairement tirer de l'ensemble des réponses, à la lumière des instructions
données par M. le juge Lacroix qui a clairement défini les questions qui
étaient en litige.

La loi ne veut pas et n'a pas cette rigidité
qui exige une précision rigoureuse à chaque réponse, mais c'est l'ensemble

[Page 548]

de ces réponses qu'il faut considérer. Ainsi,
dans son Manuel de la Cour d'Appel, commentant cet art. 483 du Code de P.C., M.
le juge Rivard dit avec infiniment de raison:

qu'il y a lieu d'intervenir seulement si la
réponse omise importe pour la décision du procès, et que le reste du verdict ne
permet pas d'y suppléer.

Dans une cause de British Columbia Electric
Railway Company v. Dunphy3, la Cour Suprême du Canada a eu
l'occasion de dire sous quel aspect il fallait expliquer cet art. 483 et
l'honorable juge Anglin dit, dans des notes, à la page 271, ce qui suit:

Meticulous criticisms of a jury's findings are not
admissible and they must always be read with and construed in the light of the
issues presented by the pleadings, the evidence and the charge of the trial
judge. While it might have been more satisfactory had the second finding been
more specific, if dealt with in the manner I have indicated it seems to be
sufficiently certain what the jury meant by it.

Et l'honorable juge Mignault, à la page
273:

I think it sufficiently assigns the lack of sufficient
precautions which in the jury's opinion caused the accident.

Dans Sloan v. Fraid4, la
Cour d'Appel a refusé d'intervenir et s'est exprimée de la façon suivante:

If a jury answering the usual questions as to fault finds
that the accident was not due exclusively to the fault of the defendant, that
there was no common fault and that it was due exclusively to the fault of the
plaintiff, without stating in what such fault consisted, such answers (not
unreasonable in the light of the evidence) are sufficient to entitle the
defendant to a judgment according to the verdict.

A mon sens, l'ensemble du verdict révèle
clairement que le demandeur n'a pas prouvé son action, mais qu'il a, au
contraire, été décidé par le jury que c'est la motocyclette qui a frappé
l'arrière de la camionnette. Ceci était suffisant pour permettre au juge au
procès de rendre un jugement suivant le verdict rendu.

L'appel doit donc être maintenu, le verdict de
même que le jugement du juge au procès rétablis, et l'action rejetée avec
dépens de toutes les Cours.

Appeal allowed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE,
PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Carrier—Taxi—Transporting passengers for
hire within limits of airport—Order-in-Council—Validity of regulations—Whether
delegated powers to Minister—Department of Transport Act, R.S.C. 1962, c. 79 s.
25—Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 2—Airport Vehicle Control Regulation 4A.

The appellant was summarily convicted of illegally operating a
taxi service within the limits of an airport. His conviction was quashed in a
trial de novo before a judge of the Superior Court. The Court of Appeal
restored the conviction. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

Regulation 4A of the Airport Vehicle Control Regulations,
which provides that no person shall, without the authority in writing of the
Minister of Transport, operate a commercial passenger vehicle on an airport,
and which was adopted by the Governor-in-Council pursuant to s. 25  of the
Department of Transport Act  for, inter alia, the management, proper use
and protection of airports under the management or control of the Minister of
Transport, is within the scope of the legislative authority conferred upon the
Governor-in-Council by Parliament. The granting of such authority to the
Minister by Order-in-Council was not a delegation of legislative authority. It
merely indicated how the Minister should exercise his responsibility of
managing and controlling a public work entrusted to him by statute.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench,

appellant for illegally operating a taxi service within an airport. Appeal
dismissed.

R. Bédard, Q.C., and G. Côté, for the
respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau, Abbott, Martland, and Ritchie
JJ. was delivered by

Abbott J.:—Appellant,
a taxicab operator in Sept-Iles, on October 14, 1958, was convicted by a district
Magistrate of having

[Page 516]

illégalement, le ou vers le 3 mai 1958
exploité à Sept-Îles, district de Saguenay, sans autorisation écrite du
Ministre des Transports à cet effet un véhicule commercial à voyageurs sur
l'aéroport de Sept-Îles, propriété de la Couronne du Chef du Canada en
transportant contre rémunération des voyageurs au moyen d'un auto-taxi, le tout
contrairement à l'article 4-A du règlement concernant le contrôle des véhicules
sur les aéroports édicté par le décret C.P. 1953-942 et de ses amendements à
date, C.P. 1955-1443 et C.P. 1956-1666, se rendant ainsi passible des peines
prévues à l'article 22 dudit règlement.

He was condemned to pay a fine of $5 and costs.

The Superior Court for the District of Saguenay, sitting in
appeal, and in a trial de novo pursuant to s. 719 et seq. of the Criminal
Code , quashed the conviction. Upon appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench2,
the appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. Leave to appeal from that
judgment was granted by this Court.

The facts are not in dispute. The sole question in issue is
one of law, namely, whether certain provisions contained in an Order-in-Council
concerning the operation of commercial passenger vehicles within airports under
the administration and control of the Minister of Transport, are within the
scope of the legislative authority conferred upon the Governor-in-Council by
Parliament.

The provisions in question are contained in the
""Airport Vehicle Control Regulations"", established by
Order-in-Council P.C. 1953-942 as amended by P.C. 1955-1443 and P.C. 1956-1666,
s. 4A, of which reads:

4-A (1) No person shall, without the authority in writing of
the Minister,

(a) carry on any business
on an airport relating to the renting or otherwise providing of commercial
passenger vehicles, or

(b) except as provided in
subsection (2) operate a commercial passenger vehicle on an airport.

(2) A commercial passenger vehicle may be operated within an
airport, without authority in writing by the Minister, for the purpose of
carrying passengers

(a) from a place outside
the airport to a place inside the airport; or

(b) on a trip originating
within the airport, pursuant to arrangements made prior to the arrival of the
vehicle at the airport.

The Sept-Iles airport is a civil airport and is the property
of the Crown in the right of Canada. In addition to landing strips and
surrounding land together with buildings, plant

[Page 517]

and machinery, access roads leading from the landing strips
and buildings to public roads outside the property are provided by the Crown.

The Court below held—and in my respectful view held
correctly—that authority for the provisions contained in s. 4A of the Airport
Vehicle Control Regulations, is to be found in the Department of Transport
Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 79, and in particular in s. 25 of that Act which
reads:

25. The Governor in Council may from time to time make such
regulations as he deems necessary for the management, maintenance, proper use
and protection of all or any of the canals or other works under the management
or control of the Minister, and for the ascertaining and collection of the
tolls, dues and revenue thereon.

The airport at Sept-Iles is clearly a work ""under the
management or control"" of the Minister of Transport. Section 3(c)
of the Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 2, provides that it is the duty
of the Minister

to construct and maintain all Government aerodromes and air
stations, including all plant, machinery and buildings necessary for their
efficient equipment and upkeep;

As Mr. Justice Hyde has pointed out in the Court below, the
vehicular approaches within an airport are properly subject to control in the
interests of proper management and have not the full character of public
highways upon which the public has the right to pass and repass. The management
of an airport, in the interest both of the Crown and of the public, may well
require a limitation and control of many kinds of commercial activities within
its boundaries, including the regulation of taxi services. The operation of a
taxi service is clearly a commercial activity, is so defined in s. 2 of the
Airport Vehicle Control Regulations above referred to and, in my opinion, the
regulation of commercial activity within an airport clearly comes within the
meaning of ""management, proper use and protection"" of such airport.

The Governor-in-Council exercising the powers given in the
statute, established the Airport Vehicle Control Regulations which provide for
the control of all vehicular traffic using an airport and which limit such use
by commercial vehicles. Under these Regulations the Minister of Transport is
given discretion and authority to determine, among other matters, what persons
shall be allowed to ""carry on any business on an airport relating to the
renting or otherwise providing of commercial vehicles"". The granting of

[Page 518]

such authority to the Minister by Order-in-Council is not a
delegation of legislative authority. It merely indicates how the Minister shall
exercise his responsibility of managing and controlling the public work
entrusted to him by the statute.

I would dismiss the appeal with costs.

Fauteux J.:—I
agree with my brother Abbott whose reasons I had the advantage to read. I only
wish to point out some of the reasons why the decision of this Court in City
of Verdun v. Sun Oil Co. Ltd.3, strongly relied on by appellant
in support of the contention that s. 4A of the Airport Vehicle Control
Regulations is ultra vires of the Governor-in-Council, has here no
application.

Purporting to implement its statutory authority to restrict
by a zoning by-law the right of land-owners to use their property as they see
fit, the City of Verdun did, by the provision impugned in that case, transform
that authority into a mere administrative and discretionary power to cancel by
resolution a right which, untrammelled in the absence of any by-law, could only
be regulated in a proper one. For that reason, the provision was declared ultra
vires of the City.

The situation here is entirely different. The right to carry
on a private business on airports which are the property of the Crown in the
right of Canada is vested in no one. The Crown may find it expedient to grant
this right to any one under such terms and conditions as may be found
appropriate. By the statutory provisions referred to in the reasons of my
brother Abbott, Parliament authorizes the Governor-in-Council to make such regulations
as the latter deems necessary for, inter alia, the management, proper
use and protection of airports which are under the management or control of the
Minister of Transport. Pursuant to this authority, the Governor-in-Council
adopted the Airport Vehicle Control Regulations, of which s. 4A provides that
no person shall, without the authority in writing of the Minister, i.e. the
Minister of Transport, carry on, on these airports, a business similar to that
conducted by appellant. This provision cannot be held to be restrictive of the
alleged right claimed but not possessed by appellant. In its prohibitive form,
the provision, if violated, gives rise to penal

[Page 519]

sanctions, thus insuring with greater effectiveness the
management and control of these airports. With the unlimited discretion given
by Parliament to the Governor-in-Council, the latter, had he deemed it
necessary, might well have determined, by regulations, the circumstances in
which the Minister should grant the authority. This, however, Parliament did
not require the Governor-in-Council to do. In the exercise of the power given
to him by s. 4A, the Minister performs an act which, of its nature, is clearly
administrative.

I would dismiss the appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Habitual
criminal—Notice of preventive detention—Whether certificate of previous
convictions adequate—Whether accused's testimony at trial of substantive
offence admissible on hearing for preventive detention—Criminal Code , 1953—54
(Can.), c. 51, ss. 574, 660, 662.

[Page 740]

The accused was charged with an offence under ss. 24  and 292 
of the Criminal Code  of attempting to break and enter a shop with intent
to steal. Prior to the trial, he was served with a notice in writing under s. 662(1)
(a) (ii) of the Code stating that if he were convicted of this offence
an application would be made to the Court to find that he was an habitual
criminal and to impose on him a sentence of preventive detention. In due course
he was convicted on the substantive offence. At the hearing on the application
to impose a sentence of preventive detention, the trial judge heard evidence in
support of the allegations contained in the notice, and also took into
consideration evidence concerning the accused's previous convictions and past
habits which had been given by the accused himself under cross-examination at
the trial of the substantive offence. The accused was sentenced to preventive
detention as an habitual criminal. The Court of Appeal quashed and set aside
the finding that the accused was an habitual criminal. The Crown was granted
leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be allowed and the sentence of
preventive detention restored.

The form of the certificates filed by the prosecutor appeared
to sufficiently identify the judge who presided at the time of both the
convictions and the sentences mentioned therein, and the fact that the
convictions mentioned in the certificates and those mentioned in the notice were
identical as to the name of the person convicted, the offences committed and
the date and nature of the sentences imposed was enough to show that the
convictions referred to therein were the same as those referred to in the
notice. In any event, the form of the certificates satisfied the provisions of
s. 574 of the Code requiring that the conviction be set out with
""reasonable particularity"".

The judge presiding at the hearing on the application for
imposition of a sentence of preventive detention was entitled to take into
consideration the evidence taken at the trial of the substantive offence, and
was justified in accepting the accused's own admission of previous convictions
as serving to identify him as the person who was convicted. An accused person
who elects to go on the witness stand at his own trial has the benefit of all
the safeguards referred to in the case of Parkes v. The Queen, [1956]
S.C.R. 768, and the evidence elicited from such an accused is admissible and
does not violate the provisions of s. 662(2) of the Code.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], quashing and setting aside a finding that the
appellant was an habitual criminal. Appeal allowed.

J. J. Urie, Q.C., for the
appellant.

H. Rankin, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by 

RITCHIE J.:—This is an appeal
brought by leave of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[2] quashing and setting aside the finding of His

[Page 741]

Honour Judge Remnant of the
County Court of the County of Vancouver that the respondent was an habitual
criminal and the consequent imposition of a sentence of preventive detention
pursuant to the provisions of s. 660  of the Criminal Code . It is to be
noted that the provisions of ss. 660  and 662  of the Criminal Code  were
substantially amended by c. 43 of the Statutes of Canada (1960-61) which was
not in force at the time of the finding and sentence in the present case, and
wherever reference is herein made to either of those sections it relates to the
Criminal Code  as it existed immediately before the said amendment came
into force.

The respondent, having been
charged with an offence under ss. 24  and 292  of the Criminal Code  of
attempting to break and enter a shop with intent to steal, was, on December 7, 1960,
served with a notice in writing in compliance with s. 662(1)  (a) (ii) of
the Criminal Code  stating that if he were convicted of this offence an
application would be made to the Court to find that he was an habitual criminal
and also to sentence him to preventive detention in addition to any sentence in
respect of the said offence. In due course, on December 21, 1960, the
respondent was convicted of the said offence before the aforesaid County Court
judge who, on January 23, 1961, conducted a hearing in respect of the application
to impose a sentence of preventive detention and who, having heard evidence in
support of the allegations contained in the said notice and having taken into
consideration evidence concerning his previous convictions and his past habits
given by the respondent himself under cross-examination at the trial of the
substantive offence, proceeded to sentence the respondent to preventive
detention as an habitual criminal.

The notice given by a prosecutor
under the provisions of s. 662(1)  (a) (ii) is required to specify
""the previous convictions and the other circumstances, if any, upon which
it is intended to found the application …."" and the notice given in the
present case recited, inter alia, that the accused was convicted in the
Supreme Court of Alberta at Edmonton before Mr. Justice Clinton J. Ford on the
4th and 8th of October, 1946 of two separate offences, one of ""breaking
and entering"" and the other of ""breaking, entering and theft"" for
which he was sentenced to terms of five and eight years' imprisonment to run
concurrently. The same notice went 

[Page 742]

on to specify that certain other
named persons were convicted of the same offences and to describe the premises
a broken into, and in the theft case the nature and amount of the property
stolen.

A certificate purporting to be
signed by the clerk of the Court ""setting out with reasonable
particularity the conviction in Canada of an accused for an indictable offence"" is,
upon proof of the identity of the accused, prima facie evidence of that
conviction by virtue of the provisions of s. 574  of the Criminal Code .

In the present case the
certificates of conviction produced by the prosecution in proof of the offences
above referred to purport to be signed by the clerk of the Court and are in the
following form:

I, the undersigned, do
hereby certify that at a Sitting of the Supreme Criminal Court held at the
Court House in the City of Edmonton, the following prisoner, having been duly convicted
of the crime set opposite his name, was sentenced as hereunder stated BEFORE
THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE CLINTON J. FORD.

In the course of the reasons
delivered by Bird J.A. on behalf of the Court of Appeal, that learned judge
found that these certificates were insufficient to satisfy the requirements of
s. 574  (a) of the Criminal Code  on the ground that:

…neither document contains
more than a sketchy reference to the conviction alleged and omits the names of
the confederates of the convicted 

[Page 743]

man, the description of the
premises broken and of the property stolen as well as the name of the learned
Judge presiding at the time when the conviction was entered, all of which are
set out in detail in paragraphs (c) and (d) of the notice.

With the greatest respect, I must
say that the form of the certificates filed by the prosecutor appears to me to
sufficiently identify Mr. Justice Clinton J. Ford as the judge who presided at
the time of both the convictions and the sentences therein referred to and the
fact that the convictions mentioned in the certificates and those mentioned in
paras. (c) and (d) of the notice are identical as to the name of
the person convicted, the offences committed and the date and nature of the
sentences imposed is enough to satisfy me that the convictions referred to therein
are the same as those referred to in the notice.

In any event, in my view the
provisions of s. 574  requiring that the conviction be set out with
""reasonable particularity"" are satisfied by the form of the
certificates above referred to, and I am of opinion that the ""reasonable
particularity"" required by the section is in no way controlled by the
manner in which the offences are described in the notice filed under s. 662 
provided that it is apparent that the certificates refer to convictions
described in that notice.

Mr. Justice Bird, however,
considered that there was no sufficient proof to identify the respondent as the
person named in certain of the convictions set out in the certificates and the
notice because the only evidence to this effect was elicited from the
respondent on cross-examination at the trial of the substantive offence when it
was admitted for the sole purpose of testing the respondent's credibility. As
will hereafter appear, I am of opinion that the judge presiding at the hearing
of the application for imposition of a sentence of preventive detention is
entitled to take into consideration the evidence taken at the trial of the
substantive offence, and in so doing he is, in my opinion, justified in
accepting the accused's own admission of previous convictions as serving to
identify him as the person who was convicted.

A strong argument was made on
behalf of the respondent in support of Mr. Justice Bird's further finding that
admissions made by him at the trial of the substantive offence as to his past
conduct and associations should not have been considered in determining the
issue of whether or not he was 

[Page 744]

an habitual criminal. Mr. Justice
Bird rested this finding on the ground that consideration of such evidence
constituted a violation of the provisions of s. 662(2)  of the Criminal Code 
which reads as follows:

662. (2) An application
under this Part shall be heard and determined before sentence is passed for the
offence of which the accused is convicted and shall be heard by the court
without a jury.

It is contended that the
circumstances are governed by the decision of this Court in Parkes v. The
Queen[3],
in which case highly damaging information concerning the previous career of the
convicted person was introduced, directly after his conviction and before the
opening of the hearing of the application for imposition of a sentence of
preventive detention, in the form of an unsworn ""Probation Officer
Presentence Report"". In commenting on the effect of this information on
the mind of the judge at the preventive detention hearing, Mr. Justice Fauteux
said at p. 779:

However, prior to such
hearing, the judge, for the purpose of determining what sentence he should
impose, received from the prosecution and exacted from the defence, in a most
exhaustive manner, information of a character highly damaging to the accused.
In the result, when the subsequent hearing of the issue related to preventive
detention commenced, his mind was no longer free, in the measure it should have
been, had the provisions of s. 662(2)  been complied with, and the effective
exercise of the right which the appellant had, on the hearing of such issue, to
remain silent and hold the prosecution strictly to its obligation to prove its
case according to rules of procedure and rules of evidence, was henceforward
jeopardized.

Mr. Justice Bird adopted this
reasoning as applying ""with equal force in the present
circumstances"", and in so doing it seems to me with all respect that he
failed to appreciate that Mr. Justice Fauteux was addressing himself to the
special circumstances of the Parkes case in which the mind of the judge
at the commencement of the preventive detention hearing ""was no longer
free in the measure it should have been"" had the damaging information
tendered before him been subjected to the ""rules of procedure and rules of
evidence"" which normally attend the trial of any issue.

The accepted practice concerning
the material which a judge may properly consider before sentencing a convicted

[Page 745]

person in respect of the offence
for which he has been convicted is well described in Crankshaw's Criminal Code 
of Canada, 7 ed., p. 912, as follows:

After conviction, accurate
information should be given as to the general character and other material
circumstances of the prisoner even though such information is not available
in the form of evidence proper, and such information when given can rightly
be taken into consideration by the judge in determining the quantum of
punishment, unless it is challenged and contradicted by or on behalf of the
prisoner, in which case the judge should either direct proper proof to be given
or should ignore the information. There should be precision and accuracy in any
such information: …. (The italics are mine.)

In the Parkes case, supra,
it was held that the introduction of such information between the time of
conviction and the opening of the preventive detention hearing constituted a
violation of the provisions of s. 662(2) of which section Mr. Justice Fauteux
observed at p. 779:

Under the imperative
provisions of s. 662(2)  of the Criminal Code , the hearing and
determination of this issue must take place before sentence is passed for the
offence of which the accused is convicted. The reason for this order of
precedence established in the procedure is to assure the effective operation
of all the safeguards which, both by the method of inquiry and by the rules of
evidence, attend the trial of any issue and, more particularly to exclude
definitely any possibility that the judge entrusted with the matter be, until
it is finally determined, adversely influenced in any degree by facts or
representations of which, once an accused is convicted, he may, without the
same safeguards, be apprised for passing a sentence. (The italics are mine.)

An accused person who, like the
respondent, elects to go on the witness stand at his own trial has the benefit
of all the safeguards to which Mr. Justice Fauteux refers in this passage, and
evidence elicited from such an accused on cross-examination is, in my opinion,
in an entirely different category from the kind of information with which this
Court was concerned in Parkes v. The Queen, supra.

It has been pointed out in this
Court in the cases of Kirkland v. The Queen[4] and Harnish v. The Queen[5]
that the proceedings at the trial of the substantive offence are relevant
material for the consideration of a court in determining the issues raised by
an application under ss. 660  and 662 , but it was seriously contended on behalf
of the respondent that His Honour Judge Remnant, when he presided at the
preventive detention hearing, was precluded from considering the sworn evidence
given at the trial on the ground

[Page 746]

that a transcript of that
evidence was not introduced at the hearing under the oath of the Court reporter.
It appears to me to be altogether unrealistic to suggest that in enacting Part
XXI of the Criminal Code  Parliament intended to provide for a hearing to
be interposed between conviction and sentence on the substantive offence at
which the trial judge is required to close his mind to relevant evidence
adduced before him at the trial which led to the conviction unless and until a
transcript of such evidence has been introduced before him at the hearing under
the oath of the Court reporter.

In my view His Honour Judge
Remnant, when he presided at the hearing of the application for imposition of a
sentence of preventive detention, was fully justified in taking into
consideration the evidence as to his identity and his past life and habits
which was given by the accused at his trial, and I am, therefore, with great
respect, unable to agree with the Court of Appeal that there was any violation
of the provisions of s. 662(2)  in the conduct of these proceedings.

I would allow this appeal and
restore the finding of the learned trial judge that the respondent is an
habitual criminal and the consequent imposition of a sentence of preventive
detention.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA,
APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Evidence—Habitual
criminal—Preventive detention—Evidence concerning charge in which appellant
acquitted—Evidence admissible at hearing in respect of sentence of preventive
detention—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 660.

Following his conviction upon a charge of
breaking and entering and theft, the appellant, who had fifteen previous
convictions, was found to be an habitual criminal and sentenced to preventive
detention. At the hearing in respect of the sentence of preventive detention,
the trial judge admitted evidence given, before him, by two witnesses one of
whom gave evidence as to having been awakened

[Page 370]

one early morning by the sound of glass
breaking in the entrance door of his shop and who found N, a man with an
extensive criminal background, at the cash register and then encountered the
appellant. The latter was acquitted in respect of that incident, and it was
submitted that this evidence should be expunged on the ground that it related
to a matter in respect of which the appellant had been acquitted and which was,
therefore, res judicata. The Court of Appeal affirmed the finding that
the appellant was an habitual criminal and the sentence of preventive
detention. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The trial judge properly found that the
appellant had not attempted to rehabilitate himself after his last release from
prison, prior to the commission of the primary offence, and properly found that
he was an habitual criminal. On the facts of this case, the trial judge was
warranted in holding that it was expedient, for the protection of the public,
to impose a sentence of preventive detention. The admission of the evidence of
the two witnesses, which was introduced only to establish the appellant’s
association with N, a fact which was later conceded by counsel at the trial,
was not a sufficient basis for ordering a new trial in the present case.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of
Alberta, Appellate Division, affirming a sentence of preventive detention.
Appeal dismissed.

J. F. Pecover, for the appellant.

B.A. Crane, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—This is an appeal from the unanimous
judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta dismissing
the appellant’s appeal from the decision at trial, which, after finding that
the appellant was an habitual criminal, imposed upon him a sentence of
preventive detention. This sentence was in lieu of a term of. six years’
imprisonment, imposed upon him on June 7, 1967, following his conviction upon a
charge of breaking and entering and theft.

The appellant, who was born on March 12, 1928,
committed a considerable number; of

[Page 371]

offences over a period of time commencing in the
year 1948 up to the commission of the primary offence in 1966. The list of his
convictions is as follows:

1948, October 29th, Winnipeg, Manitoba, theft, 2
months.

1949, January 7th, Winnipeg, Manitoba, shop
breaking and theft, 1 year.

1951, June 12th, Winnipeg, Manitoba, fraud, 2
years suspended sentence.

1952, August 8th, Winnipeg, Manitoba, nine
charges of fraud, six months on each charge concurrent; a second charge of
breach of recognizance, 3 months consecutive.

1953, July 20th, Winnipeg, Manitoba, two charges
of fraud, 26 months concurrent, and a further five charges of fraud, 6 months
concurrent.

1955, July 18th, High Prairie, Alberta, four
charges of obtaining by false pretences, 6 months concurrent.

1956, April 12th, Edmonton, Alberta, attempted
theft, 3 months.

1956, June 21st, Edmonton, Alberta, attempted
breaking and entry, 2 years.

1958, April 10th, Calgary, Alberta, two charges
of obtaining by false pretences and two charges of uttering forged documents, 2
years concurrent.

1958, July 15th, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan,
two charges of uttering forged documents, 1 year, concurrent with the sentence
dated April 10th, 1958.

1959, November 3rd, Edmonton, Alberta, breaking
and entry with intent, 2 years.

1961, November 17th, Edmonton, Alberta,
possession of stolen property, three charges of forgery and three charges of
uttering, three and a half years concurrent.

1964, obtaining by false pretences and theft
Under fifty dollars, 2 years less 1 day, concurrent.

[Page 372]

1966, December 5th, Winnipeg, Manitoba, theft, 3
months.

1967, June 7th, Edmonton, Alberta, breaking and
entering and theft, 6 years.

The Crown clearly established that the
appellant, since attaining the age of 18 years, had, on more than three
separate and independent occasions, been convicted of an indictable offence for
which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or more, as required by
s. 660  of the Criminal Code , and the learned trial judge so found.
He then went on to consider the further requirement as to whether the Crown had
established that the appellant “is leading persistently a criminal life.” After
properly charging himself as to this requirement of s. 660 , he made the
following findings of fact:

1. The primary offence of breaking and entering,
while not premeditated, could not be said to be a sudden yielding to temptation
in the proper sense of that term.

2. The appellant left Fort Saskatchewan Gaol on
February 12, 1966, on completion of his then sentence. The substantive offence
was committed on March 3, 1966. On May 31, 1966, the appellant was not present
in court for his trial. A warrant was issued for his arrest. While at large he
was arrested and on December 5 was convicted on a charge of theft under $50.

3. The appellant was associated with one Nugent
in the commission of the primary offence, and had admitted that, just prior to
that time, he and Nugent had been living with one Tonner. Both Nugent and
Tonner had extensive criminal backgrounds.

The learned trial judge properly found that the
appellant had not attempted to rehabilitate himself after his last release from
prison, prior to the commission of the primary offence, and properly found that
he was an habitual criminal.

The next issue is as to whether, because of that
finding, it was expedient for the protection of the public that the appellant
be sentenced to preventive detention. The learned trial judge was of the

[Page 373]

opinion that the sentence should be imposed.
After referring to s. 660(1) (b), which refers to this matter, he
said:

The object of this section is to
protect the public from people who have shown by their history that they are a
menace, not just a nuisance to society, and when this situation is clear, the
question is not one of punishment since that has proven to be a futile
exercise, but rather it is a matter of putting them away, so to speak, for the
protection of the public. In my opinion it is important that the public be
protected from criminals, not only from crimes involving violence against the
person, but as well from crimes against property, which are in themselves very
serious.

The accused was sentenced to six years
imprisonment on the substantive offence. No doubt the trial judge gave
consideration to the matter of protecting the public in passing sentence.
Nevertheless, I am satisfied from the accused’s history and conduct that he is
a recidivist in crime and cannot be trusted in society. The public is not
sufficiently safeguarded by the sentence and requires the additional protection
resulting from a sentence of preventive detention. The Crown, I find has proven
this ingredient and all other essential ingredients beyond a reasonable doubt
and, therefore, has made out its case to support a sentence of preventive
detention.

It was held in Poole v. The Queen[1], that, on the issue of the expediency of a
sentence of preventive detention, this Court is entitled to substitute its
opinion for that of the trial judge. Both in that case and in the later case of
Mendick v. The Queen[2], the
decision of the lower court to impose a sentence of preventive detention was
reversed. It was stated, in the reasons of the majority in the Poole case,
that the expediency of the sentence of preventive detention was a question of
fact, or perhaps a question of mixed law and fact. Each of these cases was
determined upon its own particular facts, as must any other case involving the
question of the expediency of imposing a sentence of preventive detention.

[Page 374]

There is not much to be gained from a comparison
of the facts of other cases. It may, however, be pointed out that in the Poole
case it was found that there was some evidence of the appellant’s, trying
to live a normal life. In Mendick, some point was made of the fact that
out of 47 convictions, 27 related to unlawful possession and use of gasoline
credit cards and that 23, involving a total sum of $249.95, resulted from “a
single spree” extending over December 1964, and early January 1965. Reference
was also made to the fact that his last employer would be willing to re-employ
him upon his release. There was no similar evidence in the present case, and no
witnesses were called on behalf of the appellant, who did not, himself,
testify.

In my opinion, on the facts of this case, the
learned trial judge was warranted in holding that it was expedient, for the
protection of the public, to impose a sentence of preventive detention.

It was contended, on behalf of the appellant,
that the learned trial judge had erred in admitting evidence given, before him,
by Alfred Ernest Shepherd and Barbara Jean Shepherd, his wife, on the ground
that it was tendered to prove an issue which was res judicata. When the
appellant was tried in respect of the primary offence, of which he was
convicted, he was also tried in respect of three other offences, two of these
being:

(1) Theft with violence from Shepherd of $100.

(2) Breaking and entering the Beverly Hills Gift
and Hobby Centre, of which Shepherd was the proprietor.

The appellant was acquitted in respect of these
two charges, the court holding that, though the Crown had proved that he was
probably guilty, guilt had not been established beyond a reasonable doubt. He
was convicted on the other two charges, but successfully appealed against one
of them. Evidence in respect of the two charges on which he was acquitted at
trial was given by Mr. and Mrs. Shepherd.

[Page 375]

On the hearing in respect of the sentence of
preventive detention, Shepherd gave evidence as to having been awakened in the
early morning of March 3, 1966, by the sound of glass breaking in the entrance
door of his shop. He said that he found a man at the cash register and that,
after a struggle, held him to the floor. This man, he said, was Nugent. He then
rose to encounter the appellant, whom he forced to the floor. Nugent escaped
and returned later with another man, at which time the witness received a blow
on the head. He identified the appellant in court.

Mrs. Shepherd gave an account of coming
downstairs and finding her husband struggling with a man. She tried,
unsuccessfully, to telephone the police. She did not identify the appellant or
Nugent.

Shepherd’s evidence went in, without objection,
but subsequently counsel for the appellant submitted that it should be expunged
on the ground that it related to a matter in respect of which the appellant had
been acquitted and which was, therefore, res judicata. This objection
was not sustained.

The position taken by the Crown was stated, at
trial, as follows:

My Lord, the proceedings in this case are
not a re-trial of the person on the charge, the finding at the end of the
substantive trial is final and there is no attempt being made to alter it.
However, the associations of the accused at the time of the substantive offence
remain relevant and the evidence may be reconsidered by Your Lordship to
ascertain whether or not an association is proved notwithstanding the fact that
in the trial the guilt of the accused in connection with the robbery itself was
not proven.

It was later conceded by counsel for the
appellant, in argument, at the conclusion of the evidence in respect of the
sentence of preventive detention that the appellant was associating with Nugent
on the night when the primary offence was committed. This concession was not
made as a result of the admission of the Shepherds’ evidence, but for other
reasons.

The effect of a verdict of acquittal in criminal
proceedings was considered by the Privy Council

[Page 376]

in Sambasivam v. Public Prosecutor,
Federation of Malaya[3]. Lord
MacDermott, at p. 479, said:

The effect of a verdict of acquittal
pronounced by a competent court on a lawful charge and after a lawful trial is
not completely stated by saying that the person acquitted cannot be tried again
for the same offence. To that it must be added that the verdict is binding and
conclusive in all subsequent proceedings between the parties to the
adjudication The maxim “Res judicata pro veritate accipitur” is no less
applicable to criminal than to civil proceedings. Here, the appellant having
been acquitted at the first trial on the charge of having ammunition in his
possession, the prosecution was bound to accept the correctness of that verdict
and was precluded from taking any step to challenge it at the second trial. And
the appellant was no less entitled to rely on his acquittal in so far as it
might be relevant in his defence.

In that case the accused had been tried on two
charges, under the Emergency Regulations, 1948, of carrying a firearm
and of being in possession of ammunition respectively. He was acquitted of the
second charge, but a new trial was ordered on the first one.

At the second trial a statement of the accused
was introduced which had not been in evidence at the first trial. If accepted
as the truth, it went to prove his guilt on the second charge, of which he had
been acquitted, as clearly as it would establish his guilt on the first charge.
The statement was admitted and no intimation was given to the assessors of the
fact that the accused had been acquitted on the second charge, and was,
therefore, to be taken as innocent of that offence.

In view of these circumstances it was felt that
the acquittal of the appellant on the charge of being in possession of
ammunition was relevant to the consideration by the assessors in the second
trial of the effect of this statement. It might have been a ground for
excluding the statement in its entirety, because it could not have been severed
satisfactorily. The result of the omission to refer to the acquittal on the
second charge was that the Crown was enabled to rely upon the existence of
facts in respect of which there had already been a contrary finding in favour
of the accused.

[Page 377]

The situation in the present case is quite
different. The learned trial judge was well aware of the appellant’s acquittal
on two charges at the time the primary offence was tried. It was made clear to
him that the purpose of introducing the evidence was only to establish the
appellant’s association with Nugent, a fact which was later conceded. The
learned trial judge made no reference whatever to the evidence of the
Shepherds, but did refer to counsel’s admission. In my opinion the admission of
that evidence is not a sufficient basis for ordering a new trial in the present
case.

Counsel for the appellant also raised various
technical objections to the validity of the present proceedings. In my opinion
they lack substance and it is unnecessary, in these reasons, to deal with them
further.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Possession of housebreaking
instruments—Failure of counsel to appear before Court of Appeal—Appeal
dismissed—Court of Appeal rescinded its judgment—Administration of
justice—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 295(1).

The respondent was found guilty by a judge of
the Court of Sessions of the Peace of possession of housebreaking instruments,
and appealed to the Court of Queen’s Bench. On the day of the hearing his
counsel failed to appear. Thereupon, the Crown requested and was granted
dismissal of the appeal. A few weeks later, on a motion explaining counsel’s
default, the Court of Appeal, constituted differently, rescinded its judgment
dismissing the appeal. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The two judgments were given by the Court of
Appeal in the exercise of the discretionary power relating to practice
concerning the proper administration of justice in criminal matters. The Court
accepted the explanations offered by the respondent’s counsel and held that the
latter was not to suffer the loss of his right to appeal on account of the
oversight of his counsel’s secretary. It was virtually held and correctly so
that the remedy sought by the respondent was due him ex debito justitiae.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Queen’s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec, rescinding its own
previous judgment. Appeal dismissed.

Claude Chamberland, for the appellant.

F.D. Shoofey, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

[Page 93]

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The appellant appeals from a
unanimous decision, delivered on April 18, 1969, by the Court of Queen’s
Bench (Appeal Side), Province of Quebec, rescinding, at the request of the
respondent, a unanimous decision delivered by the same Court, on March 24
preceding.

The circumstances giving rise to this appeal may
be stated immediately.

On October 31, 1968, the respondent, Joseph
Jacobs, was found guilty by a judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace of
having, in Montreal on or about July 8, 1968, committed the offence described
in s. 295(1)  of the Criminal Code , namely possession of
housebreaking instruments.

The respondent entered an appeal to the Court of
Queen’s Bench (Appeal Side) against this conviction. This appeal came up for
hearing on March 24, 1969. Counsel for Jacobs, then duly called upon to proceed
with his case, failed to appear. Thereupon, in view of this default, counsel
for the Crown requested and was granted dismissal of the appeal by the Court,
then composed of Hyde, Rivard and Salvas JJ.

Jacob’s counsel, who was informed of this
decision the same day it was handed down, immediately went to one of the judges
of the Court of Appeal, and, in the presence of the Crown counsel, gave reasons
to justify or excuse his absence, all with a view to having the case put back
on the list of appeal cases. The Crown counsel did not agree in any manner to
this request by respondent’s counsel, but a few days later, on April 1, 1969,
the latter served his opponent with a motion returnable to the Court of Queen’s
Bench on April 3, 1969, to obtain rescission of the decision given the previous
March 24. After taking the matter under advisement, the Court of Appeal, then composed
of Tremblay C.J. and Rinfret and Taschereau JJ., gave judgment on April 18
following, granting respondent’s motion.

[Page 94]

The Crown then applied to this Court for leave
to appeal from this judgment. Respondent Jacobs opposed the motion for leave:
he contended that the Supreme Court did not have jurisdiction, in the matter,
to grant leave to appeal. Without prejudice to this objection, the Court
granted the Crown’s motion, and left it to the Court that would be hearing it
to decide whether it was well founded.

Neither the judgment of April 18, 1969,
rescinding that of March 24, nor in fact the latter judgment, deal in any way
with the merits of the appeal lodged by Jacobs against the conviction
pronounced against him. These are judgments given by the Court of Appeal in the
exercise of the discretionary power relating to practice concerning the proper
administration of justice in criminal matters. In this case the Court of
Appeal, which pronounced the judgment a quo, accepted the explanations
offered by Jacobs’ counsel, and held that the latter was not to suffer the loss
of his right to appeal on account of the oversight of his counsel’s secretary,
who failed to inform the latter, as she ought to have done, of the date on
which the case would be called for hearing. It was virtually held—and correctly
so, in my humble opinion—that the remedy sought by Jacobs was due him ex
debito justitiae.

This being the case, there is no need to
consider the objection raised by the respondent as regards the jurisdiction of
this Court. I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

The appellant was convicted on a charge of

offence involving such money. He gave evidence in denial of knowledge of the
presence in his car of a package consisting of three tightly rolled counterfeit
notes. These were found by the police wedged among the wires under the
dashboard next to the steering column. The Crown’s theory was that the accused
was a distributor rather than a pusher of counterfeit bills. In his address to
the jury, Crown counsel put, as facts to be considered for conviction, matters
of which there was no evidence and which came from Crown counsel’s personal
experience or observations. The Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction. Leave
to appeal to this Court was granted on two questions of law: (1) Did the Court
of Appeal err in failing to hold that the trial judge should have declared a
mistrial by reason of the nature of counsel’s address; and (2) Did the Court of
Appeal err in not holding that the address to the jury by counsel deprived the
accused of a fair trial?

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.

There can be no unyielding general rule that
an inflammatory or improper address to the jury by Crown counsel is per se conclusive
of the fact that there has been an unfair trial and that a conviction thereat
cannot stand. However, in the present case, what Crown counsel at the trial
improperly said to the jury bore so directly on the central issue in the

[Page 739]

case, namely knowing possession, and was so
prejudicial in respect of that issue and of the related question of credibility
of the accused, of whose criminal record the jury were aware, as to deprive the
accused of his right to a fair trial. No case was made out for the application
of s. 592(1)  (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code .

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, affirming the
appellant’s conviction on a charge of possession of counterfeit money. Appeal
allowed.

Claude Thomson and John Morin, for the
appellant.

R.M. McLeod, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LASKIN J.—This appeal, from the affirmation by
the Court of Appeal of Ontario of the conviction of the accused on a charge of
possession of counterfeit money, is here by leave on two questions of law that
were formulated as follows:

1. Did the Court of Appeal err in failing
to hold that the learned trial judge should have declared a mistrial on the
motion of counsel for the accused by reason of the nature of Crown counsel’s
address to the jury?

2. Did the Court of Appeal err in not
holding that the address to the jury by Crown counsel was of such a nature as
to deprive the accused of a fair trial and hence resulted in a miscarriage of
justice?

Counsel for the Crown contended that these
questions did not disclose any issue of law, and hence that this Court was
without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. It is sufficient to get to the
merits to found jurisdiction on question 2, and to rely in this respect on the
views of this Court on such a question as expressed in Boucher v. The
Queen[1].

[Page 740]

The reasons for judgment given separately in Boucher
by Kerwin C.J., Rand, Locke and Cartwright JJ. amply point up the
obligation of Crown counsel to be accurate, fair and dispassionate in
conducting the prosecution and in addressing the jury. Overenthusiasm for the
strength of the case for the prosecution, manifested in addressing the jury,
may be forgivable, especially when tempered by a proper caution by the trial
judge in his charge, where it is in relation to matters properly adduced in
evidence. A different situation exists where that enthusiasm is coupled with or
consists of putting before the jury, as facts to be considered for conviction,
matters of which there is no evidence and which come from Crown counsel’s
personal experience or observations. That is the present case.

At the conclusion of Crown counsel’s address in
this case, counsel for the accused moved for a declaration of a mistrial. The
trial judge did not act on the motion but proceeded to charge the jury. There
was nothing in his charge that can be regarded as directed to the serious
breaches of duty exhibited by Crown counsel. The charge was in the general
pattern that is followed when there is no untoward situation that demands
particular consideration and instruction to the jury. I do not consider that
the familiar observation or reminder to the jury that they alone are judges of
the facts and that they may disregard any comments, whether of the trial judge
or of counsel, on the facts in evidence, can meet a situation where Crown
counsel, who addresses the jury last, puts extraneous prejudicial matters to
the jury as if such matters were part of the record of evidence.

Of course, there can be no unyielding general
rule that an inflammatory or other improper address to the jury by Crown
counsel is per se conclusive of the fact that there has been an unfair
trial and that a conviction thereat cannot stand. The issues in a case and the
evidence that is presented are highly relevant in this connection, as is the
supervision exercised by the trial judge in

[Page 741]

relation to the addresses of counsel and in the
course of his charge. In the present case, I am satisfied that what Crown
counsel at the trial improperly said to the jury bore so directly on the
central issue in the case, namely knowing possession, and was so prejudicial in
respect of that issue and of the related question of credibility of the
accused, of whose criminal record the jury were aware, as to deprive the
accused of his right to a fair trial. I have already observed that the trial
judge did nothing to erase the effect of Crown counsel’s remarks, and I should
add that nothing said by defence counsel in his preceding address can be
regarded as justifying what Crown counsel intruded into the trial.

I wish to refer to some of the facts of the case
and to portions of Crown counsel’s address as reproduced in the transcript. The
accused was a man with a record not related to any offence involving
counterfeit money, and he gave evidence in denial of knowledge of the presence
in his car of a package consisting of three tightly rolled up counterfeit
notes. They were found by the police wedged among the wires under the dashboard
next to the steering column. He had $700 in cash on his person in genuine
notes. There was evidence that his wife and two relatives had access to his
car. He denied police evidence that he said, when the counterfeit notes were
found, “I don’t know. It looks like funny money”, but admitted that he said to
the police, “I guess you’ve got me good. I want to see a lawyer”.

The Crown’s theory was that the accused was a
“distributor” rather than a “pusher” of counterfeit bills; that is, that he
was, so to speak, a wholesaler who showed samples to “pushers” who would buy
from the samples and then “sell” to the public. In opening to the jury before
any evidence was led Crown counsel spoke as follows:

So the essence of the charge as you heard
from the indictment is that he had it in his custody or posses-

[Page 742]

sion. It was his car. He had the car for
some time; apparently nobody had access to it—that he had placed this money in
this hiding place, and he had it for some purpose. I will explain the purpose
to you when I address you later.

No evidence was adduced as to any purpose, nor
was there any evidence as to how counterfeit bills are distributed or marketed.
There was no evidence as to any association of the accused with so-called
distributors or pushers.

The transcript of Crown counsel’s address to the
jury includes the following passages:

All right, so what happens. The officers
found it, and he has all his notes. He is going underneath like that. Now, if a
person knew, if somebody in fact had put it there—I suggest he did—you would
know where it is. You would be able to put your hand underneath, probably while
you are still sitting there and pull it out notwithstanding that it was wedged
in; you would know where it is, so you would measure it up and if you needed
it—and I will explain why he needed it—you are not going to carry three ten
dollar counterfeit bills on your person because in fact you may be stopped by
the police. They stop people and they interview people and check people, and he
is not going to carry the bills on him; that is for sure. He is not going to
put it in his car. You heard the evidence about the $700 on his person at that
time, and this comes to the reason why I had Corporal Dore explain what type
and quality this money was, going from fair to good to fairly deceptive. He
said they were at the top range, deceptive, the best at that time.

Now, I suggest to you that what in fact
Pisani had these bills for, was for specimens, for samples, and he would go
out, and he was a distributor. He would not carry any of this money on him. It
was too dangerous. The police might stop him, so he hides it in this very
unusual hiding place in the car; somewhere where he could get it out fast if he
wanted to show somebody, but he wouldn’t carry it on his person. He would try
to find pushers. People with records don’t push counterfeit money. They are
distributors. They sell it to pushers. They sell it to people without records
and they push it. Pisani wouldn’t be caught dead pushing ten dollar bills. It
is not worth it to him. He has got a record, so he

[Page 743]

goes, he finds his pusher, he brings it to
wherever the pusher is and then calls them as he reaches underneath the
dashboard where it is. He tries to persuade the pusher. He says, “Look, it is
good quality ten dollar bills.” Here is the sales pitch. He takes the three ten
dollar bills, he goes in and he says to the man, and he will take one or two
perhaps; he will say: all right, take a look at this. The person looks at it,
and if he has another ten dollar bill he would look at it, and he would say: It
looks pretty good. Then he would say, all right take a look at this, and then
lo and behold they have the same serial number; they have got to be
counterfeit. He looks at it and says: This is pretty good; these are top-notch
counterfeit, I probably could get rid of this. Maybe that person wouldn’t do
it, he pushes it through his girlfriend or an associate. He says: Take another
look at this. This is another sample. This is another of the batch with a
different serial number; have a look at it. That is pretty good top. So that is
the sales pitch. He has one. He shows them to everyone. It has to be
counterfeit, because it has the same serial number. So he has three samples,
and they are top-notch quality and people want it. It is good quality. The type
of people that would push them say: Yes, I could fool a person with them.

How many of you people know what a
counterfeit looks like? My Dad owns a store. He doesn’t know. I work in a
store. I don’t know what counterfeit is unless there is something drastically
wrong with the bill. That is when he questions it.

I suggest to you that Pisani had secreted
these three counterfeit ten dollar bills, and he wouldn’t touch it. He probably
figured the police aren’t going to find it there. You will recall that it took
the officer quite some time. He would put it there knowing that it was
dangerous to have it on his person, on his physical person, and only at the
last minute when he arrives where the pusher is, whether it be in a store or an
apartment, and he would park, look around and make sure there are no police
officers, no detectives that he recognizes, he would take it out and would show
the samples to the person who is doing the pushing. Then when he comes back he
would hide it in the same place.

Later on in the address, Crown counsel after
referring to Pisani’s seven previous convictions

[Page 744]

and to the legal limitation that these
convictions could only be used to assess his credibility, said this:

He had $700 in his possession at that time
made up of hundreds, fifties, twenties and tens. Is it possible that he got
that as down payment from one of his pushers? He wouldn’t bring money to the
pusher. The pusher would have to go to somebody else, another person or
party that has no record to get money. Pisani wouldn’t be caught dead with the
money. He would arrange for the pusher to get the money. He wouldn’t be caught
dead with large quantities of counterfeit money.

Again, in a succeeding portion of the address he
spoke as follows:

You heard the evidence that if you put the
bills through the silver nitrate processing solution you would ruin the paper
itself. It would turn to dark brown as we have heard, and they handle this
money gingerly in Ottawa. You
don’t lift prints off counterfeit; that was known to Pisani. Pisani is, as I
suggest to you he is not a pusher, but a distributor. He knows these technical
things. He knows you can’t lift a print, so I suggest to you that there is a
matter of credibility. The story at the scene contrast. There is no one that he
mentions. No person that he mentioned that would plant this money, and I
suggest to you if that was so there would be a good quantity of money put there
instead of three ten dollar bills.

There was no evidence that Pisani knew that
fingerprints cannot be lifted from counterfeit money, and Crown counsel was
also again repeating as facts matters not in evidence.

Two more passages of the address should be
quoted:

I would ask you then to disbelieve Pisani
entirely when he says he didn’t know who put it there. I suggest to you exactly
that he put it there. He might have been on a selling jaunt at that time. He
might have gotten a deposit to line up the place where the pusher would have
got the money from a third party

[Page 745]

who had no record and he was coming back.
He had a large quantity of money and unfortunately he was stopped and his car
was searched.

There is no direct evidence in this case
that anyone saw Pisani put it there. There is no statement, and you don’t
expect statement from a person like this, do you really? A person, I suggest to
you, that a person without a record may give a statement, not a person like
this. There is no statement: Yes, I put it there. There is nothing like that,
so I ask you—I am going to have to ask you to draw your conclusion that he put
it there on the basis of circumstantial evidence.

The foregoing passages bear out the assessment I
made of the effect of the address.

In my view, no case was made out for the
application of s. 592(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code . In the
result, I would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and direct a new
trial.

Appeal allowed and new trial directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR THE
YUKON TERRITORY

Criminal law—Charge to jury—Circumstantial
evidence—Erroneous example—Misdirection—Duty to relate evidence to issues—Test
in Hodge’s case—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 207.

Criminal law—Evidence—Confession—Statement
admitted without voir dire—Substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice—Criminal
Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 592(1)(b)(iii).

The appellant had been living with a girl. On
August 22, he drove with his nephew to an Indian reservation and broke into a
house in which the girl had stayed overnight. He then sent his nephew on an
errand. When the latter returned, the appellant and the girl were no longer
there. The girl was never seen alive again. Ten days later, the appellant told
his nephew that “the girl was finished”, that “he did not know what he should
do” and that he “did not know if he should turn himself in or not”. Two weeks
after that, while the appellant was being held in custody for questioning
concerning the girl’s whereabouts, he led three police officers to a place in
the bushes where her dead body was found wrapped in a blanket inside a canvas
covering and trussed up with a rope. The appellant was charged with
manslaughter. The trial judge opened his instructions to the jury by stating
that all the evidence was circumstantial; and, he gave them the following
illustration of the difference between circumstantial and direct evidence: If a
witness gives evidence that he saw A stab B with a knife, that is direct evidence
that A stabbed B. If a witness gives evidence that he found a dagger with an
unusually long blade in the possession of A and another witness testified that
such a dagger could have caused B’s wounds, that is circumstantial evidence
tending to prove that A did in fact stab B. The appellant was convicted and his
appeal was dismissed by a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for the
Yukon Territory. The accused appealed to this Court.

[Page 782]

Held (Hall,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Abbott, Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: Although the illustration
was potentially misleading if it had stood alone, the fact that it was almost
immediately followed by a correct statement of the effect to be given to
circumstantial evidence, served to offset any wrong impression of the law which
it might have left in the minds of the jurors. The language used in Hodge’s case
does nothing more than provide a graphic illustration of the principle that
where the evidence is purely circumstantial it must be made plain to the jury
that in order to be satisfied of the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable
doubt, they must first be satisfied that the circumstances are such as to be
inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the accused was the
guilty person. If the jury is left in doubt as to whether or not the
circumstances are equally consistent with some conclusion other than guilt,
then it is their duty “to give the accused the benefit of the doubt and not to
convict him on the circumstantial evidence standing alone”. When read as a
whole the charge contains no errors in regard to circumstantial evidence which
would warrant this Court in quashing the conviction and ordering a new trial.

There is no duty upon a trial judge when
instructing a jury to relate each item of evidence to the issues in the case
and to give the jury specific instructions as to whether it could or could not
properly form the basis of an inference as to those issues. Nor is it necessary
that each item of circumstantial evidence be subjected to the test in Hodge’s
case.

The statement made by the appellant to the
police that he had last seen the girl on August 25 was not objected to by
counsel on his behalf on the ground that it was exculpatory. It was admissible
not because it was exculpatory but because it was volunteered by the appellant.
The question of whether a statement is inculpatory or exculpatory and whether
or not it is voluntary are two different matters, and where it has been shown
that a statement made to a person in authority was not voluntarily made, it is
to be excluded whether it be exculpatory or inculpatory. The question of
whether or not all of the statements made by the appellant to the police could
be said to have been voluntary and therefore admissible without the holding of
a voir dire, did not have to be decided because even if the appellant’s
rambling account of his activities after August 22 should not have been
admitted as it was, this would in no way affect the relevancy and admissibility
of the all important evi-

[Page 783]

dence that he led the police officers to the
place where the body of the girl was concealed. However, even if some error had
been made by the trial judge, the circumstances were consistent with the
appellant having unlawfully killed the girl and the facts were inconsistent
with any other rational conclusion, so that a jury properly instructed would
necessarily have returned a verdict of guilty. There was therefore no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

Per Pigeon J.:
The illustration of circumstantial evidence was erroneous in its entirety. This
could not properly be said to be circumstantial evidence as it does no more
than reveal a possibility, suggest a conjecture or at most raise a suspicion.
The fact that this was presented only for the purpose of explaining the
distinction between the two kinds of evidence does not mean that it was not in
itself misleading. While it is literally true the jury must give an accused the
benefit of the doubt if the evidence is equally consistent with the innocence
of the accused as with his guilt, it is highly misleading because the obvious
implication is that if the circumstantial evidence is more consistent with the
guilt than with the innocence then they may convict. Circumstantial evidence
requires facts from which guilt is the only rational inference and if innocence
is an equally rational inference there is no proof of guilt at all. The rule on
circumstantial evidence is nothing more than a formula to assist in applying
the accepted standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to a criminal case
resting upon such evidence. It is misleading to couple that rule with a
statement that really implies a different and much lower standard. However, by giving
clear instructions on the burden of proof and enumerating the elements of the
offence, the trial judge has clearly dissipated any unfortunate implication as
to the standard of proof. The illustration cannot possibly have misled the jury
and, on the whole, this inaccuracy did not constitute misdirection. In any
event, this is a proper case for applying the provisions of s. 592(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .

Per Hall J., dissenting:
The charge on circumstantial evidence constituted misdirection, and were it
not for the admission in evidence of statements made

[Page 784]

by the appellant without a voir dire, this
would have been a proper case for applying the provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii)
of the Code. However, a voir dire was not held despite the fact that one
was asked for by the appellant’s counsel. That error was of such a consequence
that the Court ought not to say that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice had occurred.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: The misdirection constituted a fatal error in the charge. It
was not cured by other statements in the charge in which the rule as to
circumstantial evidence was stated correctly. The faults would have the effect
of permitting the jury to apply to the assessment of the probative value of the
circumstantial evidence a much less stringent test than that set out in Hodge’s
case. The admission of the accused’s statement without any determination of
its voluntary character in a proper voir dire resulted in there being
placed before the jury inadmissible evidence of a most important and a most
damaging character. The provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Code
could not be applied. One cannot conclude that a jury properly charged on
admissible evidence could not have done otherwise than convict the appellant.

Per Laskin J.,
dissenting: The question whether the charge taken as a whole was
adequate notwithstanding the standing misdirection is quite separate from the
issue of no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. If the misdirection is
fatal to the conviction the least to which the accused is entitled is a new
trial. The trial judge did not explain the meaning of circumstantial evidence
except by reference to an illustration which was clearly unacceptable. This
error could only have been regarded as immaterial if the trial judge had not
been obliged in this case to do more than point out to the jury in general
words the difference between direct and circumstantial evidence. The trial
judge aggravated the deficiency by simply narrating what each witness had said,
without relating the evidence to the issues in the case and without indicating
to the jury the need to distinguish between those facts which were reasonably
probative of the issues and those which could not be regarded as justifying
inferences to that end. The generalities in the charge cannot serve as a cover
for the inadequacies in this case because the medical evidence, taken alone,
could not support a finding that the deceased came to her death as a result of
the wrongful act of another person, because the statements of the appellant
which were admitted without a voir dire involved a variety of admissions

[Page 785]

which, without proper direction, could
mislead the jury into inferences of guilt and because the trial judge’s
omission to mention, let alone relate to it, certain qualiflying evidence of
the witness Kerry. The failure of the Crown to establish the voluntariness of
the accused’s statements warrants the quashing of the conviction and a new
trial. The defect in the charge goes beyond a mere mix-up of the principle of
reasonable doubt with the rule of circumstantial evidence as the trial judge
suggested a lower burden of proof upon the Crown than proof beyond a reasonable
doubt. It would aid clarity in charging a jury if proof of issues by
circumstantial evidence was dealt with in a way that would not suggest that
there were possibly colliding or separate burdens of proof in a case involving
such evidence. It is preferable, where all or part of the case against an
accused is based on circumstantial evidence, to bring only the traditional
burden of proof in relation to such evidence, but at the same time to emphasize
the function of inference through which that evidence has vitality and show its
bearing on the issues to which the evidence is addressed.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for the Yukon Territory[1],
affirming the appellant’s conviction for manslaughter. Appeal dismissed, Hall,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting.

Ralph Hudson and B.A. Crane, for the
appellant.

John Scollin, Q.C., and Stephen Hardinge,
for the respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux C.J. and of Abbott,
Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for the Yukon Territory1 dismissing the appellant’s
appeal from his conviction of manslaughter by the Honourable Mr. Justice
Madison sitting with a jury at Whitehorse in the Yukon Territory, on May 16,
1969.

[Page 786]

The charge against the appellant is

THAT HE, between the 21st day of August, 1967,
and the 7th day of September, 1967, in the Yukon Territory, did unlawfully kill
Graffie George, thereby committing Manslaughter, contrary to Section 207  of the
Criminal Code .

The evidence discloses that prior to August
21st, Graffie George had been living with the appellant for about eighteen
months but on the afternoon of that day she was found to be hiding in the
bushes near her sister’s house at an Indian reservation outside of Whitehorse;
she was then “very dirty” and her sister took her into the house where she
stayed over night. On the following evening (August 22nd) the sister went out
to play bingo at Whitehorse at about 7 p.m., but Graffie George remained in the
house because, as her sister says “she was scared to come with me.” Later that
evening, while the sister was still out, the appellant and his nephew, Lester
John, drove to the reserve and the appellant broke into her house leaving it,
with Graffie George, through the window by which he had broken in. The
appellant then sent Lester John on an errand and when he returned the appellant
and Graffie George were no longer there.

There is no evidence that Graffie George was
ever seen again alive, but on September 14th, after the police had started to
investigate her disappearance and while the appellant was being held in custody
for questioning concerning her whereabouts, he led three police officers to a
place in the bushes off the Alaska Highway where Graffie George’s dead body was
found wrapped in a blanket inside a canvas covering and trussed up with rope so
that it “appeared to be in a foetal position with head down around the knees
and the knees drawn up towards the head area and the rope went around the head
area and down around the ankles.”

The canvas covering in which the body was found was
identified as a tent which, with a mattress and two blankets, had been stolen
from a campsite set up by two boys not far from a camp which had been occupied
by the appellant. The blanket covering the body was identified as similar

[Page 787]

to one of the stolen blankets while the mattress
was found at the appellant’s campsite.

Lester John testified that on September 1, 1967,
ten days after the girl had last been seen, the appellant called at the house
where he was staying and told him that “the girl was finished” that “he did not
know what he should do” and that he “did not know if he should turn himself in
or not.”

In conducting the autopsy on Graffie George’s
body, Dr. D.F. Morrow, an experienced pathologist, found that the cause of
death was a sub-dural haemorrage covering the left side of the brain which had
been pushed downwards by the pressure of the haemorrage. He also found two
bruises located on the chest wall over the ribs and in the abdomen two
haemorrages in the liver approximately 2¼” to 2½” by ¾” which he thought
to be related to the chest bruises. The doctor indicated that the injuries were
caused by “a blunt type of force”, on cross-examination he agreed that the head
injury was such as could be caused by “a person striking their head getting out
of a car” and that the other injuries were possibly compatible with a person
having fallen on a two-pronged object, but that they were also consistent with
having been caused by blows from a fist.

There is no evidence as to how the dead girl’s
body came to be trussed up in the fashion in which it was found, but it is
self-evident that this was the deliberate work of some human agency, and the
facts are that the appellant was the last person that any witness had seen in
the dead girl’s company and that on the 14th of September he knew where the
body was concealed in the woods.

I have not attempted to make an exhaustive
review of the evidence, the greater part of which is discussed at length in the
dissenting reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Branca in the Court of
Appeal, but the facts which I have recited are uncontradicted and in my opinion
afford more than sufficient evidence upon which a properly instructed jury
could have convicted the appellant of manslaughter.

[Page 788]

The question on his appeal, however, is whether
there was such misdirection in the charge of the learned trial judge as to
justify this Court in ordering a new trial.

In the course of his dissenting reasons for
judgment, Mr. Justice Branca found that the learned trial judge had
misdirected the jury in a number of respects, but I think it fair to say that
his main objections were related to the instructions given to the jury as to
the nature of circumstantial evidence and the effect to be given to it. It is
not disputed that the evidence was entirely circumstantial and in this regard
the trial judge opened his direction to the jury by furnishing them with an
example of the difference between direct and circumstantial evidence. This
example was criticized by Mr. Justice Branca and is now said to have
amounted to misdirection. In this regard the learned trial judge said:

All of the evidence that has been given in
this trial is what is known as circumstantial evidence. To refresh your memory
as to the difference between circumstantial evidence and what is known as
direct evidence I will give you an illustration. If a witness gives evidence
that he saw A stab B with a knife, that is direct evidence that A stabbed B. If
a witness gives evidence that he found a dagger with an unusually long blade in
the possession of A and another witness testified that such a dagger could have
caused B’s wound, that is circumstantial evidence tending to prove that A did
in fact stab B.

The two forms of evidence are equally
admissible but the superiority of direct evidence is that it contains only one
source of error, namely the unreliability of human testimony, where
circumstantial evidence in addition to the unreliability of human testimony
suffers from the difficulty of drawing a correct inference from the
circumstantial evidence.

As the trial judge said, the above illustration
was designed exclusively for the purpose of refreshing the memory of the jury
as to the difference between direct and circumstantial evidence and although it
was so unhappily phrased as to have been potentially misleading if it had stood
alone, I think the fact that, as will hereafter appear, it was; almost
immediately followed by a

[Page 789]

correct statement of the effect to be given to
circumstantial evidence, served to offset any wrong impression of the law which
it might have left in the minds of the jurors.

It seems to me that the only valid criticism of
this illustration must relate to the final words “tending to prove that A did
in fact stab B”. There can be no doubt that it was correct to say “If a witness
gives evidence that he saw A stab B with a knife, that is direct evidence that
A stabbed B”, and I think it was also correct to say that “If a witness gives
evidence that he found a dagger with an unusually long blade in the possession
of A and another witness testified that such a dagger could have caused B’s
wound, that is circumstantial evidence”, but standing alone it is not evidence
“that A did in fact stab B” although, taken in conjunction with evidence of
other facts, it might afford a link in a chain of circumstantial evidence so
that when the whole was taken together a jury might be justified in reaching
the conclusion that the circumstances were consistent only with guilt and
inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. Having stated correctly that
it was circumstantial evidence, it will be observed that the trial judge
proceeded to point out that while the value of direct evidence is dependant
upon the reliability of human testimony, the value of circumstantial evidence
suffers also “from the difficulty of drawing a correct inference” from the
testimony as to the existence of the circumstances, and he went on to state
correctly the rule which has been established for the evaluation of such
evidence, saying:

It is therefore my duty to urge you not to
find the accused guilty on circumstantial evidence alone, unless you are
satisfied, not only that the circumstantial evidence is consistent with the
conclusion that the accused committed the offence with which he is charged, but
also that the facts which have been proved are such as to be inconsistent with
any other rational conclusion than that the accused is guilty of the offence
with which he is charged.

There can be no exception taken to this part of
the charge as it is phrased in very much the same

[Page 790]

language as that employed by Baron Alderson in Hodge’s
case[2], which
was approved and adopted in this Court in R. v. Comba[3].

It is contended, however, that the next
paragraph of the charge constituted misdirection and indeed in the opinion of
Mr. Justice Branca, it was “completely erroneous”. This paragraph reads as
follows:

If you come to the conclusion that the
evidence is equally consistent with the innocence of the accused as with the
guilt of the accused, then it is your duty to give the accused the benefit of
the doubt and not convict him on circumstantial evidence standing alone.

Mr. Justice Branca expressed his opinion of
this direction in the following language:

The direction, in my humble judgment, should
have been that if the jury found the evidence consistent with guilt but
likewise consistent with a rational hypothesis of innocence the jury should
acquit the appellant, not on the basis of giving the appellant the benefit of a
reasonable doubt, but because the evidence did not satisfy the test laid down
in the Hodge’s case. It was only if the evidence satisfied the test in Hodge’s
case that the jury would have to consider the doctrine of reasonable doubt
and then only if upon the whole of the evidence they entertained a reasonable
doubt as to the guilt of the accused.

I think that these observations of the learned
judge must be read in light of the following statement made on behalf of this
Court in McLean v. The King[4], where
it is said:

The respect in which the learned judge’s
charge is said to be insufficient as a proper direction to the jury is that he
did not instruct them that, in so far as they relied upon circumstantial
evidence in the case before them, they must be satisfied not only that the circumstances
proved were all consistent with the guilt of the accused, but also that they
were inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. This is the rule laid
down by Baron Alderson as far back as the Hodge case, and it has ever
since been recognized as a proper direction to jurors.

It is of last importance, we do not doubt,
where the evidence adduced by the Crown is solely or mainly of what is commonly
described as circumstantial, that

[Page 791]

the jury should be brought to realize that
they ought not to find a verdict against the accused unless convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt that the guilt of the accused is the only reasonable
explanation of the facts established by the evidence. But there is no single
exclusive formula which it is the duty of the trial judge to employ. As a rule
he would be well advised to adopt the language of Baron Alderson or its
equivalent.

More recently, in The Queen v. Mitchell[5], which was a case of capital murder,
where Mr. Justice Spence was dealing with the effect of the rule in Hodge’s
case in relation to proof of planning and deliberation, he had occasion to
say, at page 479:

The direction in Hodge’s case did
not add to or subtract from the requirement that proof of guilt in a criminal
case must be beyond a reasonable doubt. It provided a formula to assist in
applying the accepted standard of proof in relation to the first only of the
two essential elements in a crime; i.e., the commission of the act as distinct
from the intent which accompanied that act. The first element, assuming every
circumstance could be established by evidence, would be capable of proof to a
demonstration. The latter element, save perhaps out of the mouth of the accused
himself, could never be so proved. The circumstances which establish the former
not only can be, but must be consistent with each other, as otherwise a
reasonable doubt on the issue arises.

With the greatest respect for the views
expressed by Mr. Justice Branca, I think that his criticism of the last of
the above-quoted paragraphs of the charge of the learned trial judge is founded
on too rigid an adherence to the letter of the charge given by Baron Alderson
to the jury in Hodge’s case which resulted in his treating the words of
that charge as if they embodied a principle which was quite distinct from the
question of reasonable doubt. It appears to me on the contrary that, on
analysis, the language used in Hodge’s case does nothing more than
provide a graphic illustration of the principle that where the evidence is
purely circumstantial it must be made plain to the jury that in order to be
satisfied of the guilt of the ac-

[Page 792]

cused beyond a reasonable doubt, they must first
be satisfied that the circumstances are such as to be inconsistent with any
other rational conclusion than that the accused was the guilty person.

If the jury is left in doubt as to whether or
not the circumstances are equally consistent with some conclusion other than
guilt, then it is their duty “to give the accused the benefit of the doubt and
not to convict him on (the) circumstantial evidence standing alone”. I do not
think that the learned judge was saying any more than this and I am satisfied
that there was no misdirection in this passage.

I think it pertinent to observe also that much
later in his charge to the jury, in discussing the theory of the defence in
detail, the learned trial judge said:

The defence also relies heavily on the rule
on circumstantial evidence. The defence says that there are many conclusions
they may come to by making inferences from the evidence that are equally
consistent with the innocence of the accused as with the guilt of the accused
and if you apply these doctrines—these three doctrines, presumption of
innocence, reasonable doubt and the rule of circumstantial evidence—you can
only arrive at a verdict of acquittal.

While I do not consider that the charge to the
jury in this case afforded a model of the way in which juries should be
instructed with respect to circumstantial evidence, I am nevertheless satisfied
that when read as a whole it contains no errors in this regard which would
warrant this Court in quashing the conviction and ordering a new trial.

Further objection is taken to the charge of the
learned trial judge to the jury on the ground that after he had directed them
as to the law and recited the theory of the Crown and that of the defence, he
proceeded to review the evidence of each of the witnesses without relating each
item of evidence to the issues in the case and giving the jury specific
instructions as to whether it could or could not properly form the basis of an
inference as to those issues.

I do not think that any such duty lies upon a
judge when instructing a jury, but I find it unnecessary to trace the details
of the learned trial judge’s charge in this regard because I do not

[Page 793]

question the accuracy of the comment made by
Chief Justice Davey in the last two paragraphs of his reasons for judgment
where he said:

After explaining to the jury in the light
of the evidence the case for the Crown and the weaknesses in it alleged by the
defence, and the defence’s case the learned trial Judge proceeded to give to
the jury a summary of the evidence witness by witness, instead of analysing it
and relating it to the cases of Crown and defence.

For myself, when I was on the trial bench,
I preferred the latter method when it was suitable, but there have been many
eminent Judges who preferred the former. I think it must be left to each trial
Judge to use the method that he considers best suited to the case then before
him, provided his charge meets the requirements laid down by the authorities.
In my respectful opinion the present charge did.

It was suggested in argument that each item of
circumstantial evidence should be subjected to the test in Hodge’s case
and I think in this regard that it is well to bear in mind the language used in
this Court by Taschereau J. in Côté v. The King[6], where he said:

It may be, and such is very often the case,
that the facts proven by the Crown, examined separately have not a very strong
probative value; but all the facts put in evidence have to be considered each
one in relation to the whole, and it is all of them taken together, that may
constitute a proper basis for a conviction.

Counsel on behalf of the appellant contended
also that the conviction should be quashed on the ground that a statement made
by the appellant to the police on the 7th of September was admitted in evidence
without a voir dire having first been conducted. The statement was made at 2
o’clock on the afternoon of the day on which the appellant had been taken into
custody for interrogation, no charge had been laid against him and the police
were simply seeking to determine the whereabouts of Graffie George. The
statement which was finally admitted purported to be an account of the
appellant’s activities during the summer of 1967 and particularly after the
22nd of August,

[Page 794]

and in the course of it he stated that he had
last seen Graffie George on the 25th of August. This statement was made after
careful warning had been given to the accused by the police officers concerned
and it was treated by the trial judge as being exculpatory in character, but it
has been suggested that because no voir dire was held to determine the
voluntary character of the statement, it should not have been admitted on the
ground that the circumstances are governed by the recent decision of this Court
in Piché v. The Queen[7], where
the trial judge, after conducting a lengthy voir dire, ruled that a statement
made by the accused was inadmissible on the ground that it had not been made
voluntarily and it was contended that the statement should have been admitted
on the ground that it was exculpatory.

The most significant part of the statement made
on the 7th of September was that the accused had last seen Graffie George on
the 25th of August, but this information had already been given to Constable
Pelletier on the 5th of September when he was on patrol in the neighborhood of
Haines Junction and encountered the accused with his brother and sister-in-law.
In this regard the Constable gave the following evidence:

Q. Without referring to the text of the
conversation you had with any of these people and particularly any conversation
you might have had with the accused Alec John, will you tell the court of the
encounter with these people—what happened?

A. We stopped and talked with these three
individuals.

Q. What about?

A. We talked in generalities, to begin
with, then I asked Alec John where Graffie George might be.

Q. And did he reply? A. He did, sir.

The answer given by the accused to this question
was that the last time he had seen Graffie George was on the 25th of August and
counsel for the appellant expressly stated that he had no objection to the
admissibility of this statement on the ground that it was exculpatory. In my
view, this statement was admissible not because it was exculpatory, but because
it was volunteered by the

[Page 795]

appellant, and I can see no objection to the
admissibility of the evidence to the effect that the appellant repeated it to
the police on the 7th of September under the circumstances above described.

In the concluding paragraph of the reasons for
judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Hall on behalf of the majority of this
Court in the Piché case (page 40) he summarized the effect of that
decision by saying:

On the basis that there is no distinction
to be drawn between inculpatory and exculpatory statements as such in so far as
their admissibility in evidence when tendered by the Crown is concerned, I
would allow the appeal and restore the verdict of acquittal rendered by the
jury.

The question of whether a statement is
inculpatory or exculpatory and whether or not it is voluntary, are two entirely
different matters and it is made plain in the Piché case that where it
has been shown that a statement made by an accused to a person in authority was
not voluntarily made, it is to be excluded whether it be exculpatory or
inculpatory.

The question of whether or not all the
statements made to the police on and after September 7th can be said to have
been voluntary and therefore admissible without the holding of a voir dire, in
my opinion does not have to be decided in the present case because even if the
appellant’s rambling account of his activities after August 22nd should not
have been admitted as it was, this would in no way affect the relevancy and
admissibility of the all important evidence that he led the police officers to
the place where the body of Graffie George was concealed. This circumstance
places this case in the same category as that of The Queen v. Wray[8], which was also recently decided in
this Court. In that case the location of the murder weapon was pointed out to
the police by the accused and, following the judgment of McRuer C.J. in Rex
v. St. Lawrence[9], it
was held that although a confession made by the respondent was legally
inadmissible because it was not

[Page 796]

voluntary, nevertheless the Crown was entitled
to prove not only the finding of the murder weapon, but also the fact that its
location had been pointed out to the police by the accused and so much of the
confession as was verified by the fact of the finding was held to be
admissible.

In the concluding paragraph of his reasons for
judgment in the Wray case, Mr. Justice Martland, speaking for the
majority of the Court at page 19, said:

…on the issue of the admissibility of the
evidence sought to be introduced by the Crown in this case, notwithstanding the
exclusion of the confession, the law in Canada is correctly stated by McRuer
C.J.H.C. in The King v. St. Lawrence, at page 391:

Where the discovery of the fact confirms
the confession—that is, where the confession must be taken to be true by reason
of the discovery of the fact—then that part of the confession that is confirmed
by the discovery of the fact is admissible, but further than that no part of
the confession is admissible.

Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the
learned trial judge erred in law in excluding evidence as to the facts leading
up to the finding of the rifle, and in excluding such parts of the confession
as were confirmed as true by the discovery of such facts.

In the present case the appellant did not lead
the police officer to the place where the body was concealed until he had been
in custody for seven days during which time he had been subjected to constant
questioning, but, as I have indicated, I have no doubt that the evidence of the
body having been found under those circumstances was both relevant and
admissible, and when this evidence is considered in conjunction with the
statement made by the appellant to his nephew on September 1st that he “did not
know if he should turn himself in or not”, then, as I have indicated, I think
it becomes unnecessary to pursue any further the question of whether or not the
statements made by the appellant to the police on or after September 7th should
not have been admitted without the holding of a voir dire.

It will be seen that I am in general agreement
with the reasons for judgment of Chief Justice Davey in the Court of Appeal,
but I would add

[Page 797]

that even if this were not so and I considered
that some error had been made by the learned trial judge, I am of opinion that
the circumstances were consistent with the appellant having unlawfully killed
Graffie George and that the facts are inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion, so that a reasonable jury properly instructed would necessarily
have returned a verdict of guilty and I would therefore have applied the
provisions of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code .

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

HALL J. (dissenting)—I agree with my
brothers Spence, Pigeon and Laskin that the five paragraphs referred to in
their reasons constitute misdirection, and were it not for the admission in
evidence of statements made by appellant on September 7th and September 14th to
Staff Sergeant Dwernichuk without a voir dire having been held, I would
agree with my brother Pigeon that this was a proper case for applying the
provisions of s. 592(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .

However, I cannot ignore that a voir dire was
not held, and this despite that one was asked for by appellant’s counsel. The
record is clear in this regard.

The statements made by appellant to Dwernichuk
cover two interviews. The first was on September 7th, the day he was arrested,
when notes were made by Dwernichuk of what appellant said. The second was on
September 14th during which the notes made by Dwernichuk on September 7th were
produced, discussed with appellant, handed to him and, according to Dwernichuk,
torn up by appellant as being untrue and following which appellant eventually
led the police officers to the place where the body of the deceased, wrapped in
a blanket, was found hidden underneath a willow windfall. She had been dead
some time as the body was in an advanced state of decomposition.

I do not suggest that the evidence of the
finding of the body in the place pointed out to the police officers by
appellant or of appellant’s movements

[Page 798]

leading up to the finding of the body were not
admissible, but as was held in The Queen v. Wray[10], that does not involve admitting
the whole of the confession but only those parts leading up to the finding of
the body unless the confession as a whole has been ruled to be voluntary. In
the present case, extracts of what appellant said on September 7th and the
whole of the interview of September 14th were admitted and in both cases
without a voir dire to determine whether either or both statements were
made voluntarily. It is true that Staff Sergeant Dwernichuk said that he warned
the accused, but that evidence was given in the presence of the jury.

Piché v. The Queen[11], referred to by my brother Ritchie, decided that “exculpatory
statements made to a person in authority by an accused shall be subject on a voir
dire to the same requirements as inculpatory statements…”. Piché is
not authority for the proposition that the question of whether a statement
being tendered in evidence by the Crown was or was not voluntary can be decided
in the presence of the jury. That situation did not arise in Piché. The
only way a trial judge, trying an accused with a jury, can determine whether or
not any statement given by the accused to a person in authority being tendered
by the Crown is voluntary or involuntary is by holding a voir dire in
the absence of a jury. That was not done here and, in my view, it is an error
of such consequence that this Court ought not to say that no substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice has occurred.

I would, accordingly, set aside the conviction
and direct a new trial.

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—I have had the
opportunity of reading the reasons of my brethren Ritchie, Pigeon and Laskin
JJ., however, I feel I must deliver short additional reasons. I shall not

[Page 799]

repeat the outline of the facts except in so far
as they are relevant to these reasons.

I concur with the view of Pigeon and Laskin JJ.
that the five paragraphs in the charge of the trial judge to the jury recited
in the reasons of Laskin J. do constitute a misdirection. I cannot, however,
agree with Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. that this misdirection did not constitute a
fatal error in the charge or that it was cured by other statements in the
charge of the learned trial judge in which the rule as to circumstantial
evidence was stated correctly. On the other hand, I concur with Laskin J. that
the faults pointed out would have the effect of permitting the jury to apply to
the assessment of the probative value of the circumstantial evidence a much
less stringent test than that set out by Baron Alderson in Hodge’s case[12]. That test has, on numerous occasions,
been approved by this Court and its use, although certainly not in its exact
words, has been required when the evidence is wholly or largely circumstantial.

In my view, another ruling during the course of
the trial resulted in an error which could not be corrected by any statement in
the charge and which must result in a new trial. Laskin J. has outlined these
circumstances in reference to Staff Sergeant Dwernichuk’s evidence. That officer
testified that he interviewed the accused on September 7th, the day on which
the latter was arrested. The learned trial judge ruled without carrying on any
proper voir dire that the Staff Sergeant’s evidence as to such interview was
admissible giving as his reason that the statements made during the interview
by the accused were altogether exculpatory. After the trial judge had so ruled,
the officer was recalled; he testified that he had warned the accused and that
the accused had acknowledged that he knew the meaning of the warning and then
the officer outlined in very considerable detail the accused’s account of his
actions from June of that year until his arrest on the 7th of September. The
Staff Sergeant testified that he had made notes of that long statement by the
accused and that later, on the 14th of September, one of the many occasions
when he had questioned the accused, the latter tore up such notes.

[Page 800]

Although counsel for the accused cross-examined
Staff Sergeant Dwernichuk as to the voluntary nature of that long statement,
such cross-examination took place in the presence of the jury. As I have said,
there was never a proper voir dire in the absence of the jury. Counsel for the
accused was never given an opportunity to adduce evidence as to the voluntary
nature of the statement nor to address argument thereon after the Crown’s
evidence had been adduced. The argument as to admissibility made in the absence
of the jury was prior to the testimony given by the Staff Sergeant and was
addressed to the court on the basis of what that evidence would be. The
argument and the decision to admit the evidence was solely on the basis that
the statement was wholly exculpatory. Counsel for the accused had objected to
the admission of the evidence stating the issues in these words:

MR. HUDSON: Oh, yes. It is something that I
am aware of, but it is lengthy, and there are two issues to be concerned with.
One is, I think, is it exculpatory or inculpatory. And secondly, is it
voluntary.

to which the Court had replied:

The voluntariness only applies in the event
we find it is inculpatory.

The record contains no transcript of the address
of counsel but one may well imagine how damaging would be the Crown’s reference
to a statement made by the accused on the day of his arrest the untruth of
which the Crown had proved as to one item after another. The learned trial
judge, in his charge, as my brethren have pointed out, merely recited short
summaries of the evidence of the various witnesses for the Crown, no evidence having
been adduced for the defence, in the chronological order in which it had been
adduced. His reference to the evidence given on this topic by Staff Sergeant
Dwernichuk was:

Staff Sergeant Dwernichuk gave evidence of
the accused setting out in detail what he had done from August 14th to
September 7th, and further gave evidence of the accused tearing up those notes
when he was having a subsequent conversation with him on September 14th. Staff
Sergeant Dwernichuk also

[Page 801]

told of the journey which they had made,
that is, McLeod, the accused and himself, on September 14th, ending up with
finding the body at the location north of 1011.6.

However, much earlier in his charge, the learned
trial judge had said:

The Crown’s theory is that the actions of
the accused on the night—evening—of August 22nd and during the day at the
Chapman home on August 23rd, the false statements which the accused—the Crown
alleges the accused made, the fact that the Crown alleges that the accused knew
where the body of Graffie George was, all indicate that he knew of her death.

This Court in Piché v. The Queen[13], by its judgment delivered on June
26, 1970, has decided that no statement made by an accused to a person in
authority whether such statement is alleged to be exculpatory or inculpatory
may be admitted in evidence unless and until its voluntary nature had first
been determined on a proper voir dire. That judgment, of course, was delivered
long after the date of the learned trial judge’s charge to the jury in the
present case. It does, however, set out the law of Canada now and when the
present appeal is to be decided and I am of the opinion that it applies
particularly to the present case. The result must be that the admission of the
accused’s statement to Staff Sergeant Dwernichuk made on the 7th of September
without any determination of its voluntary character in a proper voir dire
resulted in there being placed before the jury inadmissible evidence of a most
important and a most damaging character. The accused, on September 7th, was
under arrest. It is true that no charge had been laid and that Staff Sergeant
Dwernichuk in his evidence testified that the charges which were then
contemplated were those of kidnapping and breaking and entering. The Staff
Sergeant admitted, however, that he told the accused he was investigating the
whereabouts of Graffie George, as to whose death the accused was convicted of
manslaughter. Therefore, there can be no doubt that the accused knew he was in
jeopardy when the statement was made.

[Page 802]

In my opinion, the decision of this Court in The
Queen v. Wray[14], delivered
on the same 26th of June 1970, cannot affect this issue. I am not
concerned with the evidence as to the finding of the body of the deceased woman
as a result of statements and actions of the accused long after September 7th
but I am concerned with the admission of the statement made by the accused on
that September 7th without any proper determination of its voluntary character.

I turn finally to the provisions of
s. 592(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code . Both of my brethren
Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. would apply such section to dismiss the appeal. I
must, however, concur with my brother Laskin J. and would refuse to do so. The
proper application of that paragraph of the Code had been determined in this
Court in a series of cases from Allen v. The King[15] to Colpitts v. The Queen[16] and, in the latter decision at
p. 755, the words of the judgment in Brooks v. The King[17] are adopted:

Misdirection in a material matter having
been shown, the onus was upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that the jury,
charged as it should have been, could not, as reasonable men, have done
otherwise than find the appellant guilty.

I am of the opinion that such a test is as
applicable to the adducing of inadmissible evidence as to misdirection in the
charge. One cannot conclude that a jury properly charged on admissible
evidence, that is, without it having heard very damaging and inadmissible
evidence, which this jury did hear, could not have done otherwise than convict
the accused.

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and
direct a new trial.

PIGEON J.—The facts and the issues in this case
are stated in the reasons of my brothers Ritchie and Laskin. Although I am in
general

[Page 803]

agreement with the former, I feel obliged to say
that taken by themseves, the five paragraphs dealing with circumstantial
evidence, at the outset of the charge, would, in my opinion, constitute
misdirection.

In the second of those paragraphs, namely the
illustration of the difference between direct and circumstantial evidence, the
second sentence, the illustration of circumstantial evidence, is, in my view,
erroneous in its entirety, not only in the concluding words. Although the facts
that (a) “a dagger with an unusually long blade was found in the possession of
A”, and (b) “such a dagger could have caused B’s wound”, would be admissible in
evidence on a charge that A stabbed B, this could not properly be said to be
“circumstantial evidence”. It does no more than reveal a possibility, suggest a
conjecture or, at most, raise a suspicion.

The concept of circumstantial evidence as
defined by the authorities, especially McLean v. The King[18], requires facts such that their
existence is a premise from which the existence of the principal fact may be
concluded by necessary laws of reasoning. To support a conviction those facts
must be such that guilt can properly be inferred from them by the jury. If the
guilt cannot rationally be deduced from the set of facts proved, there is no
need to consider the further question whether any other rational conclusion is
possible. The question whether the weight of the evidence is sufficient to
support a conclusion does not arise: there is no evidence. Such is clearly the
situation in the hypothetical case presented to the jury as an illustration of
“circumstantial evidence”. I cannot agree with the Court of Appeal that,
because this was presented only for the purpose of explaining the distinction
between the two kinds of evidence, it is not in itself misleading.

Then, in the last of the five paragraphs above
referred to, the jury are told that it is their duty “to give the accused the
benefit of the doubt” if “the evidence is equally consistent with the innocence
of the accused as with the guilt of the accused”. Although this is literally
true, it is, in

[Page 804]

my view, highly misleading because the obvious
implication is that if the circumstantial evidence is more consistent with the
guilt than the innocence, then they may convict. If, on a criminal charge
resting on circumstantial evidence, the facts are equally consistent with
innocence as with guilt, it is not a question of giving the accused “the
benefit of the doubt”. There is simply no evidence because, as previously
stated, circumstantial evidence requires facts from which guilt is the only rational
inference. If innocence is an equally rational inference, there is no proof of
guilt at all.

I cannot accept that the defect in the last
paragraph is overborne by the correct statement of the rule in the immediately
preceding paragraph. However, I agree that the rule on circumstantial evidence
is nothing more than a formula to assist in applying the accepted standard of
proof “beyond a reasonable doubt” to a criminal case resting upon such
evidence. It is therefore seriously misleading to couple that rule with a
statement that really implies a different and much lower standard.

I have considered it specially necessary to deal
at some length with the above-mentioned five paragraphs of the charge because,
as pointed out by my brother Laskin, they are taken verbatim from model
instructions proposed in a current book. Those are not therefore improvised
directions, but prepared instructions written in advance. It is to be hoped
that proper steps will be taken to ensure that the necessity of correcting the
offending paragraphs is brought to the attention of all users of the work and
of its French version as well.

Although for the above reasons I must hold that
the five above-mentioned paragraphs constituting the trial judge’s instructions
on circumstantial evidence at the beginning of his charge would, if considered
by themselves, constitute misdirection, the charge must be considered in its
entirety in the context of the actual facts of the case in order to determine
whether, on the whole, there is really misdirection. At this point, it must be
noted that, after the above-mentioned prelim-

[Page 805]

inary instructions, the judge went on to explain
the nature of the offence Charged. In conclusion of that part of his address,
after enumerating the elements that must be proved, he said:

Therefore, if after considering all the
evidence, the arguments of counsel, and my charge, you come to the conclusion
that the Crown has proved to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt, each
and every one of such items then in such circumstances it is your duty to find
the accused guilty of the offence of manslaughter.

Alternatively, if after considering all the
evidence, the arguments of counsel, and my charge, you come to the conclusion
that the Crown has failed to prove to your satisfaction, beyond a reasonable
doubt, either or both of such items, then in such circumstances it is your duty
to give the accused the benefit of that doubt and to acquit him.

In my view, those perfectly clear instructions
on the burden of the proof, coming as they did after an enumeration of the
elements of the offence, clearly dissipated any unfortunate implication as to
the standard of proof, that might have arisen out of the concluding paragraph of
the preliminary instructions on circumstantial evidence.

The trial judge then went on “to deal with the
theory of the crown’s case” and he concluded that part of his address as
follows:

The Crown says the way in which Graffie
George met her death was inconsistent with accident—that she met her death
while with the accused, and that she met her death by the actions of some other
person, and the Crown says that this was the accused. The Crown says there is
only one rational conclusion—she died at the hands of the accused, by assault.

Then, going on to the defence theory, he said
among other things, after a paragraph quoted by my brother Ritchie:

The Defence says that one rational
conclusion that is not inconsistent with the evidence is that Graffie George suffered
accidentally a fall on the hills or into the creek which could have rationally
caused the injuries in question, and that there are many other rational
conclusions as to how the deceased met her death.

[Page 806]

Lastly, before going on to review the evidence,
he concluded that part of his address by saying:

…the Crown says if accident was the cause
of death, why was the body wrapped, and the Defence answer to the Crown’s
theory is that on the Doctor’s evidence—Doctor Morrow’s evidence—death would occur
at a time when a person in whose company she was would not know the reason for
the death, and being apprehensive would wrap the body. That is the Defence
answer to that part of the Crown’s theory.

It is therefore apparent that in explaining the
rule on circumstantial evidence in its application to the actual facts of the
case, the trial judge always correctly relied exclusively on the proper
statement, that is that it must exclude any other rational conclusion. Also he
correctly related it to facts which undoubtedly constituted circumstantial
evidence and not merely grounds for conjecture or suspicion.

In the instant case, the facts relied on as
circumstantial evidence could, in no way, be likened to those in the
unfortunate illustration. They undoubtedly came within the proper concept of
such evidence and it could not possibly be contended that there was no
evidence. Therefore, in view of the manner in which, after the preliminaries,
the trial judge put the concrete facts of the case to the jury, I must hold
that the unfortunate illustration of the difference between direct and
circumstantial evidence cannot possibly have misled the jury and that, on the
whole, this regrettable inaccuracy did not constitute misdirection.

I also agree with Ritchie J. that in any event
this is a proper case for applying the provisions of s. 592(1) (b).(iii)
of the Criminal Code  and it is on that basis that I concur in the
dismissal of the appeal notwithstanding what was decided in Piché v. The
Queen[19].

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 807]

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—In this case there
was, admittedly, misdirection by the trial judge which, again admittedly, was
not cured in any other part of his charge to the jury. We confront hence the
recurring question whether, notwithstanding the standing misdirection, the
charge taken as a whole was adequate. This question is quite separate from the
issue of no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. Indeed, there is not
the remotest justification for invoking the provisions of s. 592(1) (b)
(iii) of the Criminal Code  against the accused in this appeal. If
the misdirection is fatal to the conviction, the least to which the accused is
entitled is a new trial.

I have no doubt that it is fatal, and that there
must be a new trial. My reasons will be all the shorter because of the summary
of the case, which I adopt, found in the dissenting reasons of Branca J.A. in
the Yukon Territory Court of Appeal[20].

The fundamental problem in this appeal is with
the legal and factual elements of circumstantial evidence and their relation to
the duty of the trial judge in charging the jury thereon. At the forefront of
the case, as it was developed through the evidence, were three issues: First,
was there an assault of the deceased? Second, did the assault cause the death
of the deceased? Third, was the accused the assailant? There was here no direct
evidence that any offence had been committed, and no direct evidence to
implicate the accused in the offence charged. Although the accused had been
living with the deceased, there was no suggestion of any friction between them
nor of any motive for the commission of any offence against her.

Since the trial turned completely on the
strength of the circumstantial evidence offered by the Crown (the defence
proffered no evidence), the important inquiry is whether the trial judge met or
failed to meet the obligation resting upon him

[Page 808]

in charging the jury in such a situation. What
was he obliged to say about the nature of circumstantial evidence, and did he
instruct the jury adequately on the legal standards applicable to
circumstantial evidence, before the jury would be warranted in making findings
against the accused on the issues in the case?

The following passages, which appear
sequentially in the charge, constitute the whole of the trial judge’s direction
on the legal and factual aspects of circumstantial evidence:

All of the evidence that has been given in
this trial is what is known as circumstantial evidence. To refresh your memory
as to the difference between circumstantial evidence, and what is known as
direct evidence. I will give you an illustration. If a witness gives evidence
that he saw A stab B with a knife, that is direct evidence that A stabbed B. If
a witness gives evidence that he found a dagger with an unusually long blade in
the possession of A and another witness testified that such a dagger could have
caused B’s wound, that is circumstantial evidence tending to prove that A did
in fact stab B.

The two forms of evidence are equally
admissible but the superiority of direct evidence is that it contains only one
source of error, namely the unreliability of human testimony, where
circumstantial evidence in addition to the unreliability of human testimony
suffers from the difficulty of drawing a correct inference from the
circumstantial evidence.

It is therefore my duty to urge you not to
find the accused guilty on circumstantial evidence alone, unless you are
satisfied, not only that the circumstantial evidence is consistent with the
conclusion that the accused committed the offence with which he is charged, but
also that the facts which have been proved are such as to be inconsistent with
any other rational conclusion than that the accused is guilty of the offence
with which he is charged.

If you come to the conclusion that the
evidence is equally consistent with the innocence of the accused as with the
guilt of the accused, then it is your duty to give the accused the benefit of
the doubt and not convict him on circumstantial evidence standing alone.

It is patent that the trial judge did not
explain the meaning of circumstantial evidence except by reference to an
illustration which was clearly

[Page 809]

unacceptable. With great respect to the majority
of the Yukon Territory Court of Appeal, I cannot agree with its conclusion that
this error was immaterial because (1) the trial judge’s purpose was merely to
illustrate the difference between direct proof and inferential proof; and (2)
the improper illustration was followed by a correct statement of the rule in Hodge’s
case[21]. This
is simply to confound the legal standard, by which, according to Hodge’s case,
circumstantial evidence is to be judged, with the reasoning process on which
the cogency of circumstantial evidence depends. In my opinion, if the error
made by the trial judge is to be regarded as immaterial, it would be because he
was not obliged in this case to do more than point out to the jury, in such
general words as he in fact used, the difference between direct and
circumstantial evidence. I do not see this as being sufficient for the purposes
of the case with which he had to deal, and the less so in view of his error in
illustration.

Moreover, the deficiency is aggravated by the
way in which the trial judge presented the case to the jury. Once he had
directed the jury on the law, and had given them the theory of the Crown and
stated the defences open on the evidence, he simply narrated (with one
important exception to which I will refer later) what each witness had said,
without relating the evidence to the issues in the case and without indicating
to the jury, either by direct reference or by general caution, the need to
distinguish between those facts which were reasonably probative of the issues
and those which could not be regarded as justifying inferences to that end.

What is required of a trial judge in charging a
jury in a homicide case depends, of course, on the issues and on the nature of
the evidence brought to bear upon them. The generalities that a charge need not
follow any particular formula and that it must not be “fine-combed” are simply
generalities; and the latter observation is as applicable to analysis of a
charge to support its adequacy as it is to scrutiny for fatal fault. Why the
generalities I have mentioned cannot serve

[Page 810]

as a cover for what I consider to be serious
inadequacies in the present case is pointed up by the following references.

First, whether or not an offence had been
committed by anyone, resulting in the death of the deceased, depended on the
evidence of a pathologist called by the Crown. He found no external abrasions,
bruises, cuts or lacerations on the body. An internal examination revealed two
bruises on the chest wall over the ribs, but the ribs and chest organs showed
no injury. Related to the internal bruises were two haemorrhages of the liver.
There was a large bruise in the tissues of the scalp over the crown of the head
but no breach of the skin; and although the skull showed no sign of fracture,
there was a sub-dural haemorrhage over the left side of the brain, which had
been pushed down by the haemorrhage, and this was the cause of death. The
witness testified that the bruise on the head was the result of the application
of a blunt type of force, and it could come from a self-inflicted bump or from
an accidental fall. Death, according to the witness, would not be instantaneous
but could take some hours, possibly up to ten, and during this period there
would be headaches, sometimes dizziness and staggering.

The medical evidence, taken alone, could not
support a finding that the deceased came to her death as a result of the
wrongful act of another person, if such a finding had to meet the probative
test of being inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The trial judge
made no point of this in his charge, but allowed his narration of the
pathologist’s evidence to speak for itself in that respect. I would not regard
this as in itself fatal to the charge but it does not stand alone.

Second, the trial judge’s narration of the
evidence as given by each witness faltered in respect of the evidence of Staff
Sergeant Dwernichuk. That witness gave evidence of statements by the accused
made during a one and one-half hour interview on September 7, 1967, the date

[Page 811]

on which the accused was arrested. He was not
arrested on any charge but was told only that the police were investigating the
whereabouts of the deceased. Interviews were held also on September 8,
September 9, September 10, September 11 and September 14. Indeed, as the
witness put it “I don’t recall the exact—exact number of times. At least twice
a day, and I believe on a few days three times a day”. Notes were taken by the
police of what was said by the accused on these occasions but there was no
formal reduction to writing of what he had said and nothing was signed by him.
On September 14, the notes of the interview of September 7 were handed to the
accused and he tore them up. Crown counsel told the trial judge that the
accused had asked for the notes, and said, in tearing them up, “that’s not
right’ or something to that effect”. Thereafter, on the same day, the accused
drove with the police to a number of places and eventually to a place where the
body of the deceased was found wrapped in canvas tenting.

What the police sought to put in evidence was
the recollection of Staff Sergeant Dwernichuk of what the accused said on
September 7 and what was done on September 14. The question of a “voir dire”
was raised in respect of the September 7 interview but the trial jury ruled
that the proposed evidence was totally exculpatory and was therefore admissible
without a voir dire. Defence counsel had also objected to the selective
proposal of the Crown to put in only the statements of the one interview and
not all the statements made by the accused.

The statements of the accused so put in through
the mouth of the Staff Sergeant were a detailed account of his activities and
his movements and association with the deceased during the summer of 1967 and
particularly from August 14, 1967 until his arrest on September 7. The trial
judge’s reference to this evidence was in these words:

Staff Sergeant Dwernichuk gave evidence of
the accused setting out in detail what he had done from

[Page 812]

August 14th to September 7th, and further
gave evidence of the accused tearing up those notes when he was having a
subsequent conversation with him on September 14th. Staff Sergeant Dwernichuk
also told of the journey which they had made, that is, McLeod, the accused and
himself, on September 14th, ending up with finding the body at the location
north of 1011.6.

Counsel for the accused did not challenge the
admissibility per se of the evidence of the accused’s statements (once
they had been declared to be totally exculpatory), and hence the issue recently
canvassed by this Court in Piché v. The Queen[22], decided on June 26, 1970, (and
with the disposition of which I agree) did not arise. But he did object to the
unbalanced reference to this evidence made by the trial judge, especially in
the light of an earlier reference in the charge to “the false statements which
the accused—the Crown alleges the accused made”. If the basis of the
admissibility of the statements was that they were all exculpatory—and I can
only so regard them in the blunt sense that there was no confession of
guilt—the trial judge could not let them stand without comment (and without
even telling the jury that the statements were evidence for the accused as well
as against him), when they involved a variety of admissions which, without
proper direction, could mislead the jury into inferences of guilt. The
probability of such inferences would be fed by the erroneous illustration of
circumstantial evidence given by the trial judge.

Third, the failure of the trial judge to relate
the evidence to the issues in the light of the circumstantial nature of the
Crown’s case is additionally highlighted by his reference to the evidence of
Linda Chapman (who later became Mrs. Boily), and his omission to mention,
let alone relate to it, certain qualifying evidence of the witness Kerry.
Branca J.A. dealt with this point and I need not review it in detail here.

[Page 813]

Equally relevant to the point under discussion,
although not reversible error if considered in isolation, was the evidence
relating to the time of the theft of the tent material in which the body of the
deceased was wrapped; and also the evidence respecting the box of cut-up wild
meat transported by the accused by truck on August 27, evidence which could
lead more to conjecture than to inference that the accused was concealing the
deceased’s body in the box.

I can best sum up my conclusion that there was
fatal non-direction amounting to misdirection in this case by quoting remarks
attributed to Baron Alderson, who presided in Hodge’s case, as found in
a contemporaneous manuscript report and reproduced in Wills on
Circumstantial Evidence (1937, 7th ed.), at p. 45:

It was necessary to warn the jury against
the danger of being misled by a train of circumstantial evidence. The mind was
apt to take a pleasure in adapting circumstances to one another, and even
straining them a little, if need be, to force them to form parts of one
connected whole; and the more ingenious the mind of the individual, the more
likely was it, in considering such matters, to overreach and mislead itself, to
supply some little link that is wanting, to take for granted some fact
consistent with its previous theories and necessary to render them complete.

Notwithstanding the fact that the issue
determined by this Court in Piché v. The Queen was an open one at the
time of the trial herein, I do not think that this should militate against the
rights of the accused to enjoy its protection so far as it can be provided in
this appeal. Hence, apart from all other considerations canvassed in these reasons,
the failure of the Crown to establish the voluntariness of the accused’s
statements, albeit they were exculpatory, warrants the quashing of the
conviction and a direction for a new trial.

Counsel for the Crown in this appeal conceded
that the trial judge had incorrectly mixed up the principle of reasonable doubt
with the rule as to circumstantial evidence, but urged that neither this nor
other errors were, on an overall assess-

[Page 814]

ment of the charge, fatal to the conviction. The
reference to the incorrect mix-up was to the last paragraph of the portions of
the charge already quoted and which I repeat here:

If you come to the conclusion that the
evidence is equally consistent with the innocence of the accused as with the
guilt of the accused, then it is your duty to give the accused the benefit of
the doubt and not convict him on circumstantial evidence standing alone.

If the paragraph reflected merely a mix-up of
the kind mentioned, I would not have thought that the jury could have been
misled because in either case they would have understood the heavy burden of
proof upon the Crown. The defect in the paragraph goes, however, beyond the
concession of counsel; it suggests a lower burden of proof upon the Crown than
proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and is a formulation that ought not to be
used. In any event, counsel’s concession requires comment.

Where circumstantial evidence is admitted
against an accused, it has become obligatory in this country to charge a jury
in accordance with the formula taken from the report of Hodge’s case[23], or for a trial judge sitting alone to pay
heed to that formula. I do not regard the formula as fixing a different or
higher burden of proof for the Crown to meet than the traditional burden of
proof beyond a reasonable doubt. This burden of proof is, of course, the
ultimate one, to be met at the conclusion of all the evidence. In a manner of
speaking, it may be said that this traditional burden rests upon the Crown with
respect to each issue in the particular case. Thus, it is not wrong for a trial
judge to instruct the jury, or to direct himself, that where proof of any issue
depends on circumstantial evidence alone, that evidence must provide a basis
for the necessary inferential proof of that issue to a degree that would make
it unreasonable to come to any other conclusion. Indeed, it was pointed out by
Cartwright J., as

[Page 815]

he then was, in Lizotte v. The King[24], that a direction in the Hodge terms
is obligatory where proof of any essential ingredient of an offence is sought
to be made by circumstantial evidence.

I have deliberately used the word “unreasonable”
rather than the formula of “inconsistent with any other rational conclusion”
because I think it may confuse or create a double standard, to the bewilderment
of a jury, if different key words are used to instruct them on their ultimate
duty. In a recent judgment of this Court in Wild v. The Queen[25], given on March 19, 1970, both
Cartwright C.J.C. and Spence J., each speaking in dissent on the question
whether an alleged misapplication of the rule in Hodge’s case raised a
question of law, referred to that rule, respectively, as being “only an example
of the application of the rule that an accused can be convicted of a criminal
offence only if the tribunal is satisfied of his guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt” and as involving “a certain degree of intermixture [with] the doctrine
of ‘reasonable doubt’”.

These observations indicate to me that it would
aid clarity in charging a jury if proof of issues by circumstantial evidence
was dealt with in a way that would not suggest that there were possibly
colliding or separate burdens of proof in a case involving such evidence. In my
opinion, the concurrent use of the Hodge formula and the traditional
formula of the burden of proof, in the comprehensive way relative to the case
as a whole in which they are often employed, may obscure or lead to the neglect
of proper instruction on the meaning of circumstantial evidence and on the
process of inference through which the cogency, if any, of circumstantial
evidence is manifested. The present case is an example of what I mean in this
connection.

I would think it preferable, where all or part
of the case against an accused is based on cir-

[Page 816]

cumstantial evidence, to bring only the
traditional burden of proof into relation to such evidence, but at the same
time to emphasize the function of inference through which that evidence has
vitality and show its bearing on the issues to which the evidence is addressed.
This approach may better serve to distinguish for the jury, if not also for the
trial judge, the difference between appraisal of the credibility and weight of
evidence and the burden on the Crown on the whole of it to establish guilt of
an accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

In concluding these reasons, I would point out
that the illustration of circumstantial evidence used by the trial judge is in
the exact words given in Kennedy, Aids to Jury Charges—Criminal (1965),
at p. 25; and, indeed, the trial judge borrowed heavily throughout his
charge from the model instructions proposed in that book.

In the result, I would allow the appeal, set
aside the judgment of the Yukon Territory Court of Appeal and the conviction
entered against the accused, and direct a new trial on the charge of
manslaughter.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Assault—Alleged unlawful assault by beverage
room waiter causing severe injuries to customer—Contradictory evidence—Onus of
proof—Whether jury misdirected by trial judge—No objection at close of
charge—New trial.

The plaintiff arrived at the defendant hotel
company’s ladies’ beverage room at about 6 p.m. and sat at a table
occupied by a woman with whom he was living as man and wife. She had been there
since about 2 p.m. About 9 p.m.
a noisy altercation developed between them. The defendant B, who was the bar
manager employed by the company, testified that on several occasions he asked
them to keep quiet. He said that when their language “really got rough” he
walked from behind the bar, put his hand on the plaintiff’s shoulder and
ordered him to get out. The plaintiff had no memory as to what occurred
following the argument with his companion, but evidence given on his behalf was
to the effect that B violently and without cause struck the plaintiff with the
result that the plaintiff fell striking his head heavily on the tile floor. The
evidence by B and supported by evidence of other customers was that he merely
touched the plaintiff’s shoulder and arms and drew him to his feet and then
left him standing while he turned to pick up the plaintiff’s jacket and the
plaintiff, due to his intoxicated condition, fell to the floor and struck his
head.

An action for assault against B and his
employer was tried before a jury. The following question was answered by the
jury in the negative: Did the defendant Balaban, without lawful excuse, commit
an assault and battery on the plaintiff Mann? On the

[Page 75]

basis of this answer, the action was
dismissed. On appeal, the Court of Appeal, by unanimous decision, dismissed the
appeal. An appeal to this Court was taken solely on objection to the charge of
the trial judge to the jury, the objection being that the trial judge
misdirected the jury in saying that the onus of proof was on the plaintiff with
respect to the issues of justification, lawful excuse and the use of reasonable
force.

Held: (Martland
and Judson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and a new trial
granted.

Per Hall,
Spence and Pigeon JJ.: In an action for assault, it has been established that
it is for the plaintiff to prove that he was assaulted and that he sustained an
injury thereby. Then it is upon the defendant to establish the defences,
firstly, that the assault was justified and, secondly, that the assault even if
justified was not made with unreasonable force.

The trial judge did not put the case to the
jury in accordance with these principles. In such a case as the present, where
the evidence was wildly contradictory, the jury should be carefully instructed
on which of the two parties bore the burden of proving a particular fact or
establishing the particular issue.

The misdirection might well have affected the
verdict and caused a miscarriage of justice. Therefore, despite the fact that
no objection was made by counsel for the plaintiff at the close of the charge,
the appeal should be allowed and a new trial granted.

Per Martland
and Judson JJ., dissenting: The charge to the jury, in the light of the
pleadings, the evidence adduced, and the agreement of the parties as to the
issue to be put to the jury, was a proper one. In the circumstances, the jury
was not called upon to determine whether a particular degree of force was or
was not excessive. If the jury believed the story told by the plaintiff’s
witnesses, the force used was obviously excessive. If they believed the
defendant’s story, no assault had been committed at all. That was the position
at the conclusion of the trial, and in the light of all the evidence the
question of onus was no longer of any significance.

Furthermore, even if the charge could be said
to be inadequate in relation to the matter of onus of

[Page 76]

proof, there was no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice occasioned to the plaintiff which would permit the
ordering of a new trial within the requirement of s. 28(1) of The Judicature
Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 197.

involves an action for assault against the defendant, Balaban (hereinafter
referred to as “the defendant”), and his employer, Fersu Hotel Limited
(hereinafter referred to as “the Company”). The incidents which gave rise to it
occurred in the Ladies’ Beverage Room in the Company’s hotel, in Galt, Ontario,
during the evening of December 23, 1965, when the defendant sought to have the
plaintiff leave the premises.

The action was tried before a jury, which, in
answer to the following question, gave the following answer:

Question 1:
Did the defendant Balaban, without lawful excuse, commit an assault and battery
on the plaintiff Mann?

Answer: No.

On the basis of this answer, the action was
dismissed, no order being made as to costs. An appeal to the Court of Appeal of
Ontario, by unanimous decision,
was dismissed, with costs. There were no written reasons. The present appeal is
from that judgment.

[Page 77]

There was a sharp conflict in the evidence
presented at the trial, in respect of some of the incidents which had occurred.
The plaintiff arrived at the hotel at about 6 p.m. and was seated at a table, with
Evelyn Killoran, with whom he was living as man and wife. She had been there
since about 2 p.m. About 9 p.m.
a noisy altercation developed between them.

The defendant, who was the bar manager employed
by the Company, on several occasions asked them to keep quiet. The defendant
said that when their language “really got rough” he walked from behind the bar,
put his hand on the plaintiff’s shoulder and ordered him to get out.

The evidence as to what then occurred is
conflicting. The plaintiff had no memory as to what occurred, but
Mrs. Killoran said that, without having said anything, the defendant hit
the plaintiff on the side of the head, picked him up and threw him hard on the
floor. Two other witnesses said that the defendant had thrown the plaintiff to
the floor.

The defendant said that, after being told to
leave, the plaintiff started to get up. He was not steady on his feet, and the
defendant grabbed him to prevent his falling. When the plaintiff got to the
aisle, near the table where he had been sitting, the defendant released his
hold, and the plaintiff fell to the floor. This version of the incident was
supported by several other witnesses.

The plaintiff struck his head on the floor and
sustained serious injuries.

Following the evidence, the learned trial judge
charged the jury. No objection, save as to one minor matter, not relevant to
this appeal, was made by counsel for the plaintiff. The questions put to the
jury were framed with the agreement of counsel for all parties.

Counsel for the appellant, in this appeal,
contends that there was misdirection, or non-direction, in the charge to the
jury, as to the onus of proof, occasioning a miscarriage of justice to the appellant.

[Page 78]

The objection to the charge relates chiefly to
the following passages in it:

Now, in this action the plaintiff,
Mr. Mann, says he was unlawfully assaulted by the defendant,
Mr. Balaban, and that he sustained damages by reason of the injuries he
suffered because of this assault. If the plaintiff is to succeed, he must prove
it and he must prove it on the reasonable balance of probabilities. In other
words, for the plaintiff to succeed you members of the jury must be satisfied
that he was probably assaulted without lawful excuse by the defendant,
Mr. Balaban, and that, as a result of this, he probably sustained damages
and, if this has been done, you will then assess a sum which will reasonably
compensate Mr. Mann for such damages.

Now, in addition to this, if the plaintiff
is to succeed against the defendant hotel company, you must be satisfied not
only that Mr. Balaban probably assaulted the plaintiff without lawful
excuse, but that he did so in the course of his employment with the defendant
hotel company. As I have said, in so far as this trial is concerned, an assault
without lawful excuse may be defined as the intentional application of unlawful
force by the defendant to the person of the plaintiff.

* * *

Now, for the plaintiff, of course, the case
is that Mr. Balaban used excessive force under the circumstances; that the
force he used was unreasonable and was entirely out of proportion to what the
occasion required. That is what the plaintiff submits. It is for you to say
whether that is true or not. You see, for the plaintiff, Mr. Mann, it is
said, “Well, let us say he was arguing in the beverage room. Let us say he was
using foul language. Let us say he was creating some disturbance that
nevertheless, assuming all this to be the case, there should have been some way
for Mr. Balaban to remove him from the premises without fracturing his
skull.” 

* * *

Now, there is the case pretty well, you
see. For the plaintiff the case is that there was an excess of force used that
Mr. Balaban came around and that he picked the plaintiff, Mr. Mann,
from the chair and threw him on the floor. That is one part of the case.

* * *

Well, there is the one story of
Mr. Balaban with force that was unreasonable and unwarranted so it

[Page 79]

is submitted by the plaintiff picking the
plaintiff up out of the chair and by the excess of force causing him to find
himself on the floor of the beverage room with a fractured skull.

And the other picture that is presented by
the defence is that the defendant, Balaban, in keeping order in the beverage
room, as he was entitled to do, assisted, and was assisting, the plaintiff to
get from the chair in which he was sitting out so that he could be removed from
the beverage room and that he wasn’t using any more force than was reasonable
or necessary to accomplish that purpose. And that he had previously asked the
plaintiff to leave, but the plaintiff had not left.

Immediately following the passage just cited,
the learned trial judge went on to say as follows:

Now, it is for you to say what you believe
in connection with this. You have heard all the witnesses as to just what
occurred.

Now, this is what I would like to say to
you, and this is the law, with respect to this matter of expelling a person
from premises. If you wished someone to leave your premises ordinarily no force
at all is justified until he has been requested to leave and has been given a
reasonable opportunity to leave. If it becomes necessary to use force to make
someone leave your premises then it is lawful to use only such force as may be
necessary to accomplish that purpose. It is not lawful to use more force than
is necessary to accomplish that purpose. Where greater force than necessary or
reasonable has been used to expel an intruder that constitutes an unlawful
assault. That is an assault without lawful excuse and the intruder is entitled
to compensation for the excess of force so used.

It is argued that the learned trial judge should
have directed the jury that, if the plaintiff proved an assault, the onus shifted
to the defendants to prove that such assault was justified or made with lawful
excuse and that the force used was reasonable. Reliance was placed upon the
judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in O’Tierney v. Concord
Tavern Ltd.[1], in
which it was held that the trial judge had misdirected the jury when he said,
when instructing them in an action for assault, arising out of the plaintiff’s
ejection from a tavern, that the burden of proof

[Page 80]

was on the plaintiff to show that the defendant
used excessive force.

The report of the case states:

The Court was unanimous in the opinion that
on that ground the appeal must succeed. It had been laid down in Miska v.
Sivec, [1959] O.R. 144, that in an action of this nature where the
defendant set up a plea of justification for the force used, the burden of
proving that the force used was not excessive in the circumstances rested upon
the defendant.

The defendant, in the present case, did not
set up any plea of justification. The plaintiff, in his statement of claim,
pleaded as follows:

4. The Defendant Walter Balaban was
employed with the Royal Hotel as a waiter and unlawfully committed a grievous
bodily assault upon the Plaintiff, causing severe, painful and personal
injuries and causing personal injuries to the Plaintiff.

The defendant, by his statement of defence,
denied this.

Counsel for the plaintiff, in his opening
remarks to the jury, outlined what he proposed to prove, as follows:

Now, I propose to call evidence which will
show that Warren Mann was a patron and a customer at the Royal Hotel and he was
sitting in the ladies’ beverage room and he was sitting with his lady friend
who he lives with in a common law relationship. They had lived so for a year or
so. It was their custom to imbibe at the Royal Hotel in Galt and did on this
date which was December 23rd, 1965.

Now, I propose to call evidence which will
indicate that they were having an argument regarding a proposed trip by Warren
Mann to Toronto and getting
money for the trip from Mrs. Mann. And while this was going on, I will
call evidence to indicate that Mr. Walter Balaban, the bar manager, who
was standing behind the bar, came out from behind the bar and struck and threw
Mr. Warren Mann to the floor.

It is clear that counsel for the plaintiff
did not contest the right of the defendant to eject the plaintiff, under the
circumstances, because, in the course of his charge, the learned trial judge
said this:

You see, for the plaintiff, Mr. Mann,
it is said, “Well, let us say he was arguing in the beverage

[Page 81]

room. Let us say he was using foul
language. Let us say he was creating some disturbance that nevertheless,
assuming all this to be the case, there should have been some way for
Mr. Balaban to remove him from the premises without fracturing his skull.”

The issue before the jury was stated in the
question, which had been agreed upon by counsel:

Did the defendant Balaban, without lawful
excuse, commit an assault and battery on the plaintiff Mann?

It is in the light of these circumstances that
the charge to the jury must be considered and it must be considered as a whole,
and in relation to the evidence which had been adduced. The plaintiff’s case,
upon the evidence of his witnesses, was that he had suffered serious injuries
as a result of having been hurled to the floor by the defendant. The
defendant’s case was that there had been no assault causing injury to the
plaintiff. If the laying of his hand by the defendant on the plaintiff’s
shoulder could be regarded as a technical assault it was abundantly clear that
that act could not and did not cause any injury to the plaintiff. According to
the defendant’s evidence, supported by witnesses, apart from this act, all that
the defendant did was to steady the plaintiff, when he rose to his feet, to
prevent his falling.

The essential issue was, therefore, clear. Did
the jury accept the plaintiff’s contention that he had been thrown to the
floor, or the defendant’s contention that the plaintiff had not been thrown to
the floor.

In the circumstances of this case the jury was
not called upon to determine whether a particular degree of force was or was
not excessive. If the jury believed the story told by the plaintiff’s
witnesses, the force used was obviously excessive. If they believed the
defendant’s story, no assault had been committed at all. That was the position
at the conclusion of the trial, and in the light of all the evidence the
question of onus was no longer of any significance.

[Page 82]

That issue was clearly stated by the learned
trial judge in the passage from his reasons, already quoted, when he said:

Well, there is the one story of
Mr. Balaban with force that was unreasonable and unwarranted so it is
submitted by the plaintiff picking the plaintiff up out of the chair and by the
excess of force causing him to find himself on the floor of the beverage room
with a fractured skull.

And the other picture that is presented by
the defence is that the defendant, Balaban, in keeping order in the beverage
room, as he was entitled to do, assisted, and was assisting, the plaintiff to
get from the chair in which he was sitting out so that he could be removed from
the beverage room and that he wasn’t using any more force than was reasonable
or necessary to accomplish that purpose. And that he had previously asked the
plaintiff to leave, but the plaintiff had not left.

Now, it is for you to say what you believe
in connection with this. You have heard all the witnesses as to just what
occurred.

In my opinion the charge to the jury in this
case, in the light of the pleadings, the evidence adduced, and the agreement of
the parties as to the issue to be put to the jury, was a proper one.
Furthermore, even if the charge can be said to be inadequate in relation to the
matter of onus of proof, in the circumstances of this case I can find no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occasioned to the plaintiff which
would permit the ordering of a new trial within the requirement of s. 28(1) of The
Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 197, which provides:

28.—(1) A new trial shall not be granted on
the ground of misdirection or of the improper admission or rejection of
evidence, or because the verdict of the jury was not taken upon a question that
the judge at the trial was not asked to leave to the jury, or by reason of any
omission or irregularity in the course of the trial, unless some substantial
wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned.

I would dismiss the appeal with costs.

The judgment of Hall, Spence and Pigeon JJ. was
delivered by

SPENCE J.—This is an appeal from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario pro-

[Page 83]

nounced on March 4, 1968. By that judgment, the
Court of Appeal dismissed, without written reasons, an appeal from the judgment
of King J. pronounced on February 2, 1967. That judgment was rendered on the
verdict of a jury and was one in which the plaintiff’s action was dismissed.

The action was for damages which the plaintiff
sustained in the premises of the defendant Fersu Hotel Limited on December 23,
1965. In the statement of claim, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant
Walter Balaban, being an employee of the Royal Hotel as a waiter, unlawfully
committed a grievous bodily assault on the plaintiff causing severe injuries.
The defendant Balaban denied that he unlawfully committed an assault on the
plaintiff and alleged that he was acting in the course of his employment and on
the instructions of his employer. The defendant Fersu Hotel Limited also
pleaded that the defendant Balaban had not committed an unlawful assault and
further that if he had done so he was not acting in the course of his
employment.

Counsel for the respondent in this Court relied
on the issue set up in those pleadings and submitted that the jury’s answer had
been simply a factual one that no assault had occurred. However, when one
refers to the evidence at trial, it is clear that the plaintiff’s claim was
that he had been assaulted and assaulted unlawfully, and the defendant put in
issue that the assault was merely a technical assault, that was fully justified
and that no unnecessary force had been used. The defendant also sought to prove
that the plaintiff had not been injured by any such technical assault as he had
sustained his injuries when he fell on the floor of the beverage room and that
such fall was caused by his own intoxicated condition rather than by any action
of the defendant Balaban.

The first question which the learned trial judge
put to the jury was this:

Did the defendant Balaban, without lawful
excuse, commit an assault and battery on the plaintiff Mann?

The jury’s answer to that question was “No”.

[Page 84]

Other questions were put to the jury but the
jury did not find it necessary, in view of the above answer, to deal with any
of the other questions.

The appeal to this Court is taken solely on objection
to the charge of the learned trial judge to the jury. The objection is that the
learned trial judge misdirected the jury in saying that the onus of proof was
on the appellant, that is, the plaintiff, with respect to the issues of
justification, lawful excuse and the use of reasonable force. Before I deal in
some detail with that charge, a short recital of some facts should be given.

There was a great mass of contradictory
testimony but certain circumstances are established. in the evidence without any
contradiction. The plaintiff, the appellant here, arrived at the Fersu Hotel
Limited premises, known as the Royal Hotel, in the City of Galt, at about 6:00
p.m. on the afternoon of December 23, 1965. There is no evidence that the
plaintiff, prior to that time, had on that day consumed any liquor. The
plaintiff swore that he had not done so. Following the events with which this
action is concerned, at a time firmly established by the evidence of Constable
Landry as being between 11:20 and 11:30 p.m., he saw the plaintiff sitting or
lying against the front wall of the Royal Hotel with a waiter leaning over him
who was either attempting to assist the plaintiff to his feet or lowering the
plaintiff to the sidewalk. Therefore, the plaintiff had been inside that
beverage room and of course there for the purpose of consuming beer from 6:00
p.m. until a moment or two before 11:20 p.m. The plaintiff has testified that
he had 7 or 8 drinks of draft beer during that period and little is needed to
infer that at the time of the occurrence giving rise to this action he was
intoxicated to a very considerable extent. The action, however, is simply one
for assault and is not based on any allegation that the defendant Balaban or
his co-defendant the hotel company permitted the plaintiff to become
intoxicated and incapacitated.

[Page 85]

The plaintiff himself, due to the effect of his
injuries and particularly to a concussion which he received when his head
struck the floor, has no memory whatsoever of anything following an argument
between him and his companion Mrs. Killoran with whom he was living as man
and wife at the time. Therefore, the evidence as to what occurred is given by
various patrons of the beverage room and by the defendant Balaban and other
waiters. As one might expect, under those circumstances, the evidence given on
behalf of the plaintiff would appear to be to the effect that the defendant
Balaban violently and without cause struck the plaintiff with the result that
the plaintiff fell striking his head heavily on the tile floor. The evidence by
the defendant Balaban and supported by evidence of other customers was that he
merely touched the plaintiff’s shoulder and arms and drew him to his feet and
then left him standing while he turned to pick up the plaintiff’s jacket and
the plaintiff, due to his intoxicated condition, fell to the floor and struck
his head. After the latter event, however it had been caused, another waiter
simply took the plaintiff, put him over his shoulder, carried him out to the
street and set him down against the wall. It was this latter action which was
observed by Constable Landry at between 11:20 and 11:30 p.m.

In the light of these circumstances, I turn to
the consideration of the charge by the learned trial judge. Having outlined the
essential law as to what is an assault, the learned trial judge said:

Now, in this action the plaintiff,
Mr. Mann, says he was unlawfully assaulted by the defendant,
Mr. Balaban, and that he sustained damages by reason of the injuries he
suffered because of this assault. If the plaintiff is to succeed, he must prove
it and he must prove it on the reasonable balance of probabilities. In other
words, for the plaintiff to succeed you members of the jury must be satisfied
that he was probably assaulted without lawful excuse by the defendant,
Mr. Balaban, and that, as a result of this, he probably sustained damages
and, if this has been done, you will then assess a sum which will reasonably
compensate Mr. Mann for such damages.

[Page 86]

Now, in addition to this, if the plaintiff
is to succeed against the defendant hotel company, you must be satisfied not
only that Mr. Balaban probably assaulted the plaintiff without lawful
excuse, but that he did so in the course of his employment with the defendant
hotel company. As I have said in so far as this trial is concerned, an assault
without lawful excuse may be defined as the intentional application of unlawful
force by the defendant to the person of the plaintiff.

After discussing some of the evidence, the
learned trial judge continued:

Now, for the plaintiff, of course, the case
is that Mr. Balaban used excessive force under the circumstances; that the
force he used was unreasonable and was entirely out of proportion to what the
occasion required. That is what the plaintiff submits. It is for you to say
whether that is true or not. You see, for the plaintiff, Mr. Mann, it is
said, “Well, let us say he was arguing in the beverage room. Let us say he was
using foul language. Let us say he was creating some disturbance that
nevertheless assuming all this to be the case, there should have been some way
for Mr. Balaban to remove him from the premises without fracturing his
skull.

And having dealt with some of the evidence
further, both that given on behalf of the plaintiff and that given on behalf of
the defendants, the learned trial judge continued:

And the other picture that is presented by
the defence is that the defendant, Balaban, in keeping order in the beverage
room, as he was entitled to do, assisted, and was assisting, the plaintiff to
get from the chair in which he was sitting out so that he could be removed from
the beverage room and that he wasn’t using any more force than was reasonable
or necessary to accomplish that purpose. And that he had previously asked the
plaintiff to leave, but the plaintiff had not left.

Now, it is for you to say what you believe
in connection with this. You have heard all the witnesses as to just what
occurred.

He then outlined the law, saying, in part:

Now, this is what I would like to say to
you, and this is the law, with respect to this matter of expelling

[Page 87]

a person from premises. If you wished
someone to leave your premises ordinarily no force at all is justified until he
has been requested to leave and has been given a reasonable opportunity to
leave. If it becomes necessary to use force to make someone leave your premises
then it is lawful to use only such force as may be necessary to accomplish that
purpose. It is not lawful to use more force than is necessary to accomplish
that purpose. Where greater force than necessary or reasonable has been used to
expel an intruder that constitutes an unlawful assault. That is an assault
without lawful excuse and the intruder is entitled to compensation for the
excess of force so used.

In an action for assault, it has been, in my
view, established that it is for the plaintiff to prove that he was assaulted
and that he sutained an injury thereby. The onus is upon the plaintiff to
establish those facts before the jury. Then it is upon the defendant to
establish the defences, firstly, that the assault was justified and, secondly,
that the assault even if justified was not made with any unreasonable force and
on those issues the onus is on the defence.

In Cook v. Lewis[2], the present Chief Justice of this
Court said at p. 839:

With the greatest respect, I think that the
learned trial judge did not charge the jury correctly in regard to the onus of
proof of negligence. While it is true that the plaintiff expressly pleaded
negligence on the part of the defendants he also pleaded that he was shot by
them and in my opinion the action under the old form of pleading would properly
have been one of trespass and not of case. In my view, the cases collected and
discussed by Denman J. in Stanley v. Powell (1891), 1 Q.B.D. 86,
establish the rule (which is subject to an exception in the case of highway
accidents with which we are not concerned in the case at bar) that where a
plaintiff is injured by force applied directly to him by the defendant his case
is made by proving this fact and the onus falls upon the defendant to prove
“that such trespass was utterly without his fault.” In my opinion Stanley v.
Powell rightly decides that the defendant in such an action is entitled
to judgment if he satisfies the onus of establishing the absence of both
intention and negligence on his part. 

[Page 88]

In Miska v. Sivec[3], Morden J.A. at p. 148, in
discussing the plea of self-defence in an assault charge, said:

Self-defence is an answer to a claim for
assault but only when the force used was not unreasonable in the circumstances.
The reasonableness of the force is an integral part of the defence and, in my
opinion, must be established by a defendant pleading son assault demesne.

In an action based on circumstances much similar
to the present one, O’Tierney v. Concord Tavern Ltd.[4], at p. 533 Roach J.A. said:

The Court was unanimous in the opinion that
on that ground the appeal must succeed. It had been laid down in Miska v.
Sivec, [1959] O.R. 144, that in an action of this nature where the
defendant set up a plea of justification for the force used, the burden of
proving that the force used was not excessive in the circumstances rested upon
the defendant.

With respect, I am of the view that the learned
trial judge did not put the case to the jury in accordance with the principles
which I have outlined. When the learned trial judge said:

Now in this action the plaintiff,
Mr. Mann, says he was unlawfully assaulted by the defendant,
Mr. Balaban, and that he sustained damages by reason of the injuries he
suffered because of this assault. If the plaintiff is to succeed, he must prove
it and he must prove it on the reasonable balance of probabilities. In other
words, for the plaintiff to succeed you members of the jury must be satisfied
that he was probably assaulted without lawful excuse by the defendant,
Mr. Balaban, and that, as a result of this, he probably sustained damages
and, if this has been done, you will then assess a sum which will reasonably
compensate Mr. Mann for such damages.

the learned trial judge was putting on the
plaintiff the burden of proving that he was assaulted and that there was no
lawful excuse for the assault. The defendants should have had put upon them the
burden of proving that there was lawful excuse 

[Page 89]

for the assault. Again, in the paragraph as to
excessive force which I have cited above, the charge is cast on the basis that
the plaintiff must prove that the force was “unreasonable and entirely out of
proportion to what the occasion required”, while it should plainly have been
put that the defendant had the onus of proving that the force used was
reasonable and was in proportion to what the occasion required. In my view, it
is not sufficient to say, as the learned trial judge did:

Now it is for you to say what you believe
in connection with this. You have heard all the witnesses as to just what
occurred.

without stressing to them the fact that the
burden of proving the allegation shifted from plaintiff to defendant after the
plaintiff had proved the assault and the damage which he alleged was caused by
the assault. In such a case as the present, where the evidence was wildly
contradictory, the jury should be carefully instructed on which of the two
parties bore the burden of proving a particular fact or establishing the
particular issue. So, the answer of the jury to the question which I have set
out above cannot be considered an answer that the plaintiff failed to prove
assault but rather that it may well be interpreted that the plaintiff failed to
prove an assault without legal justification and might reflect the jury’s
erroneous assumption from the learned trial judge’s charge to them that the
plaintiff had the duty of proving that there was no legal justification.

For these reasons, I am in agreement with the
submission of counsel for the appellant that the learned trial judge’s charge
was defective and defective in a most important particular.

Counsel for the respondent has pointed out that
at the close of the learned trial judge’s charge to the jury, there was no
objection made to the charge by the counsel for the plaintiff. In fact, counsel
for the plaintiff said: “I have no comments, My Lord. As far as I feel, you
properly charged the jury and I see no objection to it.” Therefore, the counsel
for the respondents con-

[Page 90]

tended that, under these circumstances, the
plaintiff cannot now successfully obtain an order for a new trial. This matter
has been considered on many occasions both in this Court and elsewhere. In Ristow
v. Wetstein[5], Smith
J., said at pp. 132-3:

There was a complete failure to direct the
attention of the jury to this evidence on which a finding of negligence on the
part of the driver might have been properly based, and in addition there was an
express direction that the jury might disregard the most vital part of it. This
was misdirection involving a mistrial and a miscarriage of justice in the sense
that the plaintiff’s case was not properly submitted to the jury. A new trial
was therefore properly ordered, notwithstanding the fact that no objection was
taken to the charge.

In Leslie v. The Canadian Press[6], Kerwin C.J. was considering the
trial judge’s charge in a libel action and said at p. 874:

… I am of opinion that the preferable rule
and the one that should be adopted is that it is sufficient for the complaining
party to show that a misdirection may have affected a verdict and not that it
actually did so; and that, if an appellate Court is in doubt as to whether it
did or not, it is then for the opposite party to show that the misdirection did
not in fact affect the verdict.

For the reasons which I have already outlined, I
am of the opinion that the misdirection might well have affected the verdict
and caused a miscarriage of justice. Therefore, despite the fact that no
objection was made by counsel for the plaintiff at the close of the charge, I
would allow this appeal and grant a new trial. In view, however, of that lack
of objection, I am of the opinion that the plaintiff should not be allowed any
costs of the first trial. However, in the notice of appeal to the Court of
Appeal for Ontario, the fourth ground of appeal is set out as follows:

4. The jury were misdirected as to the law
in respect to assault and also the law in respect to

[Page 91]

trespass and as to what is involved in law
in the excessive use of force.

Therefore, in my view, the appellant should have
the costs incurred in the Court of Appeal and in this Court. The costs of the
new trial should be in the discretion of the judge presiding thereat. I would
dispose of the appeal in the above fashion.

MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL

Criminal law—Appeals—Leave to appeal—Refusal
by trial judge to allow counsel for the accused to use French language in the
examination of French-speaking witnesses—Error in law—No wrong or miscarriage
of justice—B.N.A. Act, 1867, s. 133—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51,
s. 592(1)(b)(iii).

[Page 215]

At the trial of the petitioners on an
indictment for attempted murder, counsel for the accused sought to use the
French language in the examination of French-speaking witnesses. The trial judge
refused the request on the grounds that the two accused were English-speaking,
that the jury was made up entirely of jurors speaking that language and that
counsel for the accused, although French-speaking, was perfectly familiar with
the English language. The conviction was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The
petitioners applied for leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The
application should be dismissed.

In view of the provisions of s. 133 of
the B.N.A. Act, the refusal by the judge to accede to the request was an
error on a question of law. However, no wrong or miscarriage of justice had
resulted from that error. The appeal was therefore properly dismissed under the
provisions of s. 592(1) (b) (iii) of the Code.

APPLICATION for leave to appeal from a judgment
of the Court of Queen’s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], affirming the conviction of the
petitioners. Application dismissed.

Cyrille Goulet, for the petitioners.

Louis Carrier, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

FAUTEUX J.—On December 2, 1966, a jury of the
Court of Queen’s Bench sitting in the district of Beauharnois, province of
Quebec, Peter V. Shorteno J. presiding, found the petitioners guilty on two
counts of an indictment for attempted murder.

An appeal from this conviction was dismissed on
August 7, 1969, by a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal1,
then composed of Casey, Taschereau, Choquette, Brossard and Salvas JJ.

The petitioners apply for leave to appeal from
this judgment.

We are all of the opinion that this motion
should be dismissed. We find it desirable, how-

[Page 216]

ever, to say a few words on the main point
raised by the motion and which was urged in support of the appeal to the Court
of Queen’s Bench. This is based on the following facts.

At the trial, counsel for the accused sought to
use the French language in the examination of French-speaking witnesses. The
judge refused to allow him to do so considering that the two accused were
English-speaking, that they had elected to be tried by a jury made up entirely
of jurors speaking that language, that such was effectively the actual
composition of the jury and that, in addition, counsel for the accused,
although French-speaking, was perfectly familiar with the English language.

There is nothing to indicate, nor has it been
contended before us, that the request made by counsel for the accused was
intended to obstruct the regular course of the proceedings. It should therefore
be said that, in view of the provisions of s. 133 of the British North
America Act, the refusal by the presiding judge to accede to the
request is an error on a question of law. It may be added that, in answer to a
question put on that point to counsel for the respondent at the outset of the
hearing of the motion, the latter did not hesitate to concede that this was
indeed an error.

However, we agree with the unanimous opinion of
the Court of Appeal, that no wrong or miscarriage of justice has resulted from
that error or from the other grievances raised in support of the motion. It
follows that the appeal was properly dismissed under the provisions of
section 592(1)  (b) (iii) of the Criminal Code .

The motion for leave to appeal is dismissed.

Application dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Evidence—Act of gross
indecency—Psychiatric evidence of state of mind of
accused—Intent—Admissibility—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 149.

The respondent was convicted of attempting to
commit an act of gross indecency. He was found by the police in a hotel bedroom
in bed with another man, who was a female impersonator, and their respective
positions in relation to each other were such as to justify the police in
thinking that an act of gross indecency was taking place or was about to take
place. The respondent seemed stunned after the entry of the police and during
the interview that then took place. His defence was that he had believed his
companion to be a woman. He sought to support his own evidence in this regard
by the evidence of a psychiatrist. The trial judge excluded the psychiatric
evidence based on interviews and tests which was tendered for the purpose of
showing that the respondent had a certain type of defence mechanism which made
him react violently against any homosexual activity and that he therefore would
not have knowingly engaged in the homosexual practices which formed the subject
of the charge.

[Page 264]

The majority of the Court of Appeal held the
evidence to be admissible, set aside the conviction and directed a new trial.
The Crown appealed to this Court.

Held (Ritchie
and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the conviction
restored.

Per Martland
and Judson JJ.: The evidence in question was inadmissible. The psychiatrist was
being tasked for an opinion, not as to whether the respondent was mentally
capable of formulating an intent to commit the crime, but as to whether he did,
on the facts of this case, formulate such an intent. There is no authority
which establishes that the evidence of a psychiatrist can be introduced for a
purpose such as this. What is sought to be done here is to enable a
professional man to express his view to the jury upon the issue of the intent
of the accused, upon evidence which is not before the jury, and which is, in
part, hearsay evidence from the accused himself. The decision of this Court in Wilband
v. R., [1967] S.C.R. 14, is not contrary to this conclusion.

Per Hall J.:
The trial judge should have admitted all the evidence which the psychiatrist
was prepared to give. Whatever other causes there may be for the condition of
homosexuality, psychological factors are of great importance. It follows that
the evidence of psychiatrist is particularly relevant in cases involving
homosexuality and the admissibility of opinion evidence from psychiatrists must
be determined by its relevancy to the matter in issue at the trial. The
evidence was relevant to the defence being put forward on behalf of the
respondent, it was therefore admissible and the trial judge erred in rejecting
it.

However, this was a proper case for the
application of s. 592(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code . The
evidence against the respondent was overwhelming and the verdict would
necessarily have been the same even if the jury had heard the opinion which the
psychiatrist was prepared to give.

Per Ritchie
and Spence JJ., dissenting: The trial judge should have admitted the
evidence in question. The fact that the methods pursued by the psychiatrist in
reaching his opinion necessitated dependence on information obtained from the
respondent and others which was not before the jury, does not make his opinion
inadmissible although it may well be a fact to be considered in assessing the
weight to be attached to it. The admission of the psychiatrist’s

[Page 265]

evidence as to the respondent’s normal state
of mind would not have offended the rule against the admissibility of hearsay.
On the record, the evidence was tendered for the purpose of proving the
doctor’s opinion that this particular man had a certain type of defence
mechanism that made him react violently against homosexual behaviour. The
question of whether or not a man is homosexually inclined or otherwise sexually
perverted is one upon which an experienced psychiatrist is qualified to express
an opinion and if such opinion is relevant, as it is here, it should be
admitted at a trial such as this even if it involves the psychiatrist in
expressing his conclusion that the accused does not have the capacity to commit
the crime with which he is charged.

APPEAL by the Crown from a majority judgment
of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1],
setting aside the conviction of the respondent and directing a new trial.
Appeal allowed and conviction restored, Ritchie and Spence JJ. dissenting.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
appellant.

G.A. Martin, Q.C., and R.V. Carter, for
the respondent.

The judgment of Martland and Judson JJ. was
delivered by

MARTLAND J.—This is an appeal by the Crown from
a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1, Davey C.J.
dissenting, which set aside the conviction of the respondent of attempting to
commit an act of gross indecency, and directed a new trial.

The facts are as follows:

On February 3, 1967, in the early hours of the
morning, the respondent was observed leaving a cabaret with a person dressed
and made up as a woman and taking a taxi to a hotel where, after registering
under a false name, the two went to a room. Police officers listened at the
locked door for some minutes, heard male voices conversing

[Page 266]

in French, obtained the key for the room from
the hotel clerk and entered. They found the respondent and the other person
naked on a bed. They noticed that the other person was a male, still wearing
the blond female wig and heavy facial makeup in which he had been seen earlier.
Although the officers saw no activity between the two on the bed, at the time
of entry, their position was such that the respondent’s head was lying a very
short distance from the female impersonator’s genital organs. The officers saw
the respondent swing around on the bed away from that position. The respondent
seemed stunned after the entry and during the interview that then took place
with the police officers.

The respondent’s defence was that he had
believed his companion to be a woman.

The legal issue to be determined in this appeal
is as to the admissibility of psychiatric evidence tendered on behalf of the
respondent, which the trial judge ruled was inadmissible, but which the
majority of the Court of Appeal held to be admissible.

The nature of the proposed evidence was
described by counsel for the respondent in the following statement to the Court
at trial:

The purpose for which I am attempting to
tender this evidence is for the Doctor to describe what is the normal state of
mind of Mr. Lupien, and on that basis compare the normal state of mind to
the events that occurred in the room. When that is done then the Doctor has a
norm from which to draw, upon which to base his opinion. Now that fundamentally
is the basis upon which this evidence is being tendered.

Counsel then proceeded to review the nature and
extent of the proposed psychiatric evidence as follows:

The Doctor will say that this man had a
certain type of defensive mechanism that made him react violently to any
homosexual overtone. He will say that is the normal state. And then he will
compare that opinion with what occurred this night and say, “Taking the two
together and having regard to the impact of one upon the other I have the
following opinion to say, namely, he must have believed this

[Page 267]

person was a woman,” and in so far his
perception was diminished because of the things I did state in the hypothetical
question, that because his perception was diminished one of two things occur,
either he was not consciously aware of the genital organ he saw in front of him
in the sense of being able to understand the person was a male or as soon as he
became aware of it he should have rejected it and it would be inconceivable for
him not to reject it.

The psychiatric examination involved the
obtaining of information from the respondent and the psychiatrist said:

This is where I would have to assume the
truthfulness of what he said referable to his background, his attitudes, his
feelings, his beliefs, those things that would allow me to gain some idea and
some opinion as to the sort of person that this man is, basically. As far as an
answer to the question as to the state of this man’s mind at the time or what
happened at that time or what his thinking was at that time, no, it was not
necessary to rely upon the truthfulness of what he had to say.

Essentially, the opinion would be that, based
upon the psychiatric examination, the respondent’s defence must be true.

In criminal trials, psychiatric evidence is most
frequently introduced in cases where a plea of insanity is raised. There the
issue is as to mental capacity and the opinions of experts on the subject of
disease of the mind are clearly relevant and admissible.

In cases under s. 661  of the Criminal Code ,
involving the determination as to whether or not the accused is a dangerous
sexual offender, the Court is required to hear the evidence of at least two
psychiatrists. The reason for this provision would appear to be that the Court
is being asked to forecast the likelihood, in the future, of a particular form
of behaviour. The issue is not as to guilt in respect of a crime. It was in
respect of this kind of inquiry that Fauteux J., delivering the judgment of the
Court in Wilband v. R.[2],
defined the permissible sources of information upon which the psychiatrist
could properly rely, including second-hand information.

[Page 268]

In Fisher v. R.[3], which involved a charge of murder, the
defence was that the accused was top drunk to have been capable of forming the
requisite intent. The evidence of the Crown consisted largely of a statement
given by the accused, which gave details of his movements before and after the
killing, which he admitted. Psychiatric evidence was admitted in that case, in
relation to the issue of mental capacity. The witness, having read the
statement and being asked a hypothetical question, in which were included
substantially the material facts related in the statement, stated that, in his
opinion, anyone capable of doing what the accused was alleged to have done,
would have the capacity to form an intent to murder, even if he had consumed 25
glasses of beer, or more.

There is no submission by the respondent in this
case as to incapacity to form an intent to commit the crime charged, on the
basis of insanity, drunkenness, or any other cause. The evidence which counsel
for the respondent sought to lead was not to show that he was mentally
incapable of forming the intent to commit the crime with which he was charged.
Its purpose was to establish (partly on the basis of what the respondent had
told the witness) that because the respondent normally reacted violently to
homosexual practices he must have been telling the truth when, in the proved
situation in which he was discovered, he said he thought his companion was a
women. In other words, the psychiatrist is being asked for an opinion, not as
to whether the respondent was mentally capable of formulating an intent, but as
to whether he did, on the facts of this case, formulate such intent. We have
not been referred to any Canadian or English authority which establishes that
the evidence of a psychiatrist can be introduced for a purpose such as this. If
such evidence is held to be admissible in a case of this kind, then there would
seem to be no reason why, on a charge of murder, psychiatric evidence could not
be led as to the innate abhorrence of the accused

[Page 269]

in respect of physical violence, or on a charge
of theft, of the innate respect of the accused for private property rights.

I agree with the view expressed by Davey C.J. in
this case:

The opinion that Lupien would not have
knowingly engaged in the acts alleged is in the particular circumstances of
this case too dangerous to be admitted, because without any necessity it comes
too close to the very thing the jury had to find on the whole of the evidence.

The jury is required to determine the intent of
the accused upon the evidence before it. What is sought to be done here is to
enable a professional man to express his view to the jury upon that issue, upon
evidence which is not before the jury, and which is, in part, hearsay evidence
from the accused himself. In my opinion evidence of this kind should not be
admitted.

I do not regard the decision of this Court in
the Wilband case, supra as being contrary to this conclusion. As
I have already indicated, the psychiatric evidence in question in that case was
required to be heard by virtue of s. 661(2)  of the Criminal Code  on
a hearing to determine whether an accused person, already convicted, was a
dangerous sexual offender. That determination involved an inquiry as to whether
he was a person likely to cause injury, pain or other evil to any person
through failure to control his sexual impulses or was likely to commit a
further sexual offence. On that issue Parliament has required that the Court
have the assistance of evidence from at least two psychiatrists. The Wilband
case held that, in giving their evidence, they were entitled to form an
opinion through recognized psychiatric procedures and to consider all possible
sources of information.

In the present case the issue is as to guilt on
the basis of proved facts, which already exist, not a forecast as to future
conduct. In this case there is no statutory requirement to hear psychia-

[Page 270]

tric evidence. It is sought to adduce such
opinion evidence on the very issue which the jury is bound to determine on the
facts proved before it.

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and
restore the conviction and sentence.

The judgment of Ritchie and Spence J.J. was
delivered by

RITCHIE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
brought by the Attorney General of British Columbia under the provisions of
s. 598(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal of British Columbia[4] (Davey
C.J. dissenting) whereby that Court set aside the conviction of the respondent
for attempting to commit an act of gross indecency and ordered a new trial
limited to that issue.

The respondent was found by the police in a
hotel bedroom in bed with another man, who was a female impersonator, and there
is, in my view, no doubt that their respective positions in relation to each
other were such as to justify the police in thinking that an act of gross
indecency was taking place or was about to take place.

The respondent’s main defence was that at all
times, until just before the police entered the room, he thought that his
companion was a woman, and it was sought to support his own evidence in this
regard by the evidence of Dr. Newman, a highly qualified psychiatrist, who
was present throughout the trial and who had interviewed the respondent and
others and subjected the respondent to certain psychiatric tests for the
purpose of determining what his normal state was in relation to sex.

Counsel for the Crown took objection to the
introduction of this evidence from Dr. Newman and after lengthy argument
from counsel on both sides, the learned trial judge ruled that questioning by
defence counsel in this regard should be limited to asking the doctor a hypothetical
question based on the assumption of the truth of the evidence adduced at the
trial in order to

[Page 271]

obtain his opinion as to the effect which the
respondent’s lack of sleep, heavy work schedule and consumption of liquor had
had on his state of mind at the time when he was found in such a compromising
position by the police officers in the early hours of the morning.

The learned trial judge, however, excluded the
psychiatric evidence based on interviews and tests which was tendered for the
purpose of showing that, in Dr. Newman’s opinion, Lupien had a certain
type of defence mechanism which made him react violently against any homosexual
activity and that he therefore would not have knowingly engaged in the
homosexual practices which formed the subject of the charge.

The members of the Court of Appeal were
unanimous in expressing the opinion, with which I agree, that the doctor’s
opinion given in answer to the hypothetical question which was put to him was
properly admitted in evidence, but the majority of the Court, in ordering a new
trial, took the view that the learned trial judge had erred in excluding the
doctor’s opinion based on the interviews he had conducted and on the
psychiatric tests and procedures to which he subjected the respondent. It is the
dissenting opinion of the learned Chief Justice in this latter regard which
forms the basis of this appeal.

In excluding the opinion formed by the doctor as
a result of his own investigations and tests, the learned trial judge cited the
decision of this Court in Bleta v. The Queen[5], where it was said, at p. 564:

The question of whether or not an accused
person was in a state of automatism so as not to be legally responsible at the
time when he committed the acts with which he is charged, is a question of fact,
and indeed may be the most vital question of fact in a criminal case, and it is
because the opinion of an expert witness on such a question can serve only to
confuse the issue unless the proven facts upon which it is based have been
clearly indicated to the jury that the practice has grown up of requiring
counsel,

[Page 272]

when seeking such an opinion, to state
those facts in the form of a hypothetical question.

The case of Bleta v. The Queen, supra, was
concerned with the proper way in which to elicit an opinion from an expert
witness based upon evidence which has been adduced in his presence at the
trial. The sentence cited by the learned trial judge from the decision of this
Court is directly followed in the same paragraph by these words:

In cases where the expert has been present
throughout the trial and there is conflict between the witnesses, it is
obviously unsatisfactory to ask him to express an opinion based upon the
evidence which he had heard because the answer to such a question involves the
expert in having to resolve the conflict in accordance with his own view of the
credibility of the witnesses and the jury has no way of knowing upon what
evidence he based his opinion. Where, however, there is no conflict in the
evidence, the same difficulty does not necessarily arise and different
considerations may therefore apply.

The Bleta case came to this Court on
appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which had allowed an
appeal by the Crown and ordered a new trial on the ground, inter alia, that
a doctor called for the defence “was improperly permitted to express an opinion
based on his assessment of the evidence.” There is no such suggestion in the
present case and I do not think that the Bleta case is to be taken as
deciding that a counsel is precluded from eliciting the opinion of a doctor as
to a person’s state of health based on his medical knowledge and on his
questioning of his patient out of the presence of the jury.

It was contended in the present case that
Dr. Newman’s opinion as to the way in which the respondent would normally
react to homosexual advances was inadmissible as offending the rule against the
introduction of hearsay evidence in that it must of necessity have been based
upon what he was told by the respondent and others in the course of the
interviews he conducted and on the results of the tests which he had carried
out.

[Page 273]

The truth of any statements made to the doctor
in the course of his psychiatric enquiry was not at issue in the present case.
What was being sought here was evidence of the opinion which he had formed as
the result of applying his medical knowledge of an analysis of the respondent’s
disposition as manifested by his words, attitudes and reactions when subjected
to questioning, and to other psychiatric procedures designed to reveal his true
character. It is the admissibility or inadmissibility of an opinion so formed
which is at issue here and, in my view, the fact that the methods pursued by
the psychiatrist in reaching his opinion necessitated dependence on information
obtained from the respondent and others which was not before the jury, does not
make his opinion inadmissible although it may well be a factor to be considered
in assessing the weight to be attached to that opinion. If it were otherwise,
the Courts would be denied many medical opinions based on clinical methods of
diagnosis.

In the case of Wilband v. Her Majesty the
Queen[6], the
point was taken that certain evidence given by psychiatrists under the
provisions of s. 661(2)  of the Criminal Code  was inadmissible as
offending against the hearsay rule, and in the course of his reasons for
judgment, Mr. Justice Fauteux had this to say, at p. 21:

Dealing with hearsay:—The evidence, in this
case, indicates that to form on opinion according to recognized normal
psychiatric procedures, the psychiatrist must consider all possible sources of
information, including second-hand source information, the reliability,
accuracy and significance of which are within the recognized scope of his
professional activities, skill and training to evaluate. Hence, while
ultimately his conclusion may rest, in part, or second-hand source material, it
is nonetheless an opinion formed according to recognized normal psychiatric
procedures. It is not to be assumed that Parliament contemplated that the
opinion which the psychiatrists would form and give to assist the Court would
be formed by methods other than those recognized in normal psychiatric
procedures. The value of a psychiatrist’s opinion may be affected to

[Page 274]

the extent to which it may rest on second-hand
source material; but that goes to the weight and not to the receivability in
evidence of the opinion, which opinion is no evidence of the truth of the
information but evidence of the opinion formed on the basis of that
information.

It is true that in the Wilband case
Mr. Justice Fauteux was considering psychiatric evidence on the issue of
whether an accused person who had already been convicted was “a dangerous
sexual offender”, and that it was the status of the accused rather than his
guilt or innocence which was at issue, but I am satisfied that what was said in
that case in relation to the hearsay rule applies with equal force to the
present circumstances.

In view of the above, I am of the opinion that
the admission of the psychiatric evidence sought to be adduced from
Dr. Newman as to the respondent’s normal state of mind would not have
offended the rule against the admissibility of hearsay, but this is far from
the end of the matter as the dissent of the learned Chief Justice is based on
broader grounds. In the course of his reasons for judgment he said:

I would exclude the evidence on the broad
ground that it was not admissible for the purpose it was tendered. It must be
clearly understood what that purpose was, so I reiterate that it was to show
that Lupien’s normal personality and his defence mechanisms would cause him to
reject homosexual advances or commerce, and so in the opinion of the experts he
would not knowingly have engaged in them. They sought to explain the evidence
on the ground that Lupien must have honestly believed Boisvert to be a woman,
or by impairment of his understanding and judgment.

The opinion that Lupien would not have
knowingly engaged in the acts alleged is in the particular circumstances of
this case too dangerous to be admitted, because without any necessity it comes
too close to the very thing the jury had to find on the whole of the evidence.
But there is a more basic objection. Put in simple English the doctors were
being invited to say that Lupien was a normal man, and as a normal man he would
be instinctively repelled by and recoil from a homosexual act. The jurors were
the proper people to say what a normal

[Page 275]

man would do in those circumstances for that
would depend upon their knowledge of people.

I agree with the Chief Justice that if the
evidence had been tendered for the purpose of showing that Lupien was a normal
man, the conclusion as to how he would have acted under the circumstances would
have been a question for the jury; but, with all respect, as I understand the
record, the evidence was not tendered for this purpose at all but rather for
the purpose of proving the doctor’s opinion that this particular man bad a
certain type of defence mechanism that made him react violently against
homosexual behaviour. The evidence which the learned trial judge excluded was
described by the respondent’s counsel in the following terms:

Now, here the doctor will say—and I am
going to be a little bit inept in doing it—the doctor will say that this man
had a certain type of defensive mechanism that made him react violently to any
homosexual overtone. He will say that is the normal state. And then he will
compare that opinion with what occurred this night and say, “Taking the two
together and having regard to the impact of one upon the other I have the
following opinion to say, namely, he must have believed this person was a
woman”, and (2) in so far his perception was diminished because of the things I
did state in the hypothetical question, that because his perception was
diminished one of two things occur, either he was not consciously aware of the
genital organ he saw in front of him in the sense of being able to understand
the person was a male or (2) as soon as he became aware of it he should have
rejected it and it would be inconceivable for him not to reject it.

As I understand it, the evidence thus sought to
be adduced was directed towards obtaining Dr. Newman’s opinion to the
effect that the respondent was so constituted as to be incapable of formulating
the intention to commit a homosexual act, and it appears to me that the
question of whether or not a man has homosexual tendencies or inclinations is
one which is well adapted to the diagnosis of a psychiatrist and that such an

[Page 276]

opinion formed in this area of human behaviour
is relevant and admissible in a case such as the present one.

This was not a question of adducing character
evidence in the sense of reputation, and I think that the rule laid down in
1865 by Cockburn C.J., in Reg. v. Rowton[7],
to the effect that evidence of character can only be introduced by seeking
evidence of the accused’s general reputation in the neighbourhood to which he
belongs, is singularly inappropriate to the introduction of evidence from
psychiatrists as to the accused’s disposition.

The Rowton case was decided many years
before the development of psychiatry as an accepted branch of medicine and we
were not referred to any case in which the rule there stated was applied so as
to exclude such evidence.

In the course of his reasons for judgment in the
case of Fisher v. The Queen[8], with
which nine members of this Court were “in substantial agreement” (see [1961]
S.C.R. 535 at 538) Aylesworth J.A. said at page 21, speaking of the evidence of
the pyschiatrist called by the Crown in that case:

He was, of course, assuming the facts given
him as an hypothesis to be true, giving his opinion upon one of the vital
issues to be decided by the jury, but that does not per se render his
opinion inadmissible. …Psychiatry is a comparatively modern and special branch
of medical science which deals with the study of the mind, the working of the
mind, the mental state of an individual as demonstrated by his conversation,
attitude and actions. I entertian no doubt that Dr. Easton as a specialist
in psychiatry for many years and with the experience which his position
entails, is qualified to express an opinion upon the mental capacity of an
individual such as appellant to form a certain intent,…

In the Fisher case the accused, who was
charged with murder, had given a statement to the police in which he described
in great detail his activities during the evening up until the time when the
murder was alleged to have taken place. In the course of the cross‑examination
of certain Crown

[Page 277]

witnesses it became apparent that an attempt was
being made to make out a defence of drunkenness and before closing the case for
the prosecution, the Crown called Dr. Baston, the Director of Psychiatry
at the Ontario Hospital in New Toronto, who was asked a hypothetical question
based in large measure on the statement made by the accused to the police in
answer to which he expressed the opinion that anyone able to do what the
appellant was alleged to have done could have the capacity to form the intent
to murder, even after he had consumed 25 glasses of beer or more. It appears to
me that the opinion so sought by the Crown came as close as possible to being
evidence of the very thing that the jury had to find if the defence of
drunkenness was to be negated and the accused convicted. In approving the
admission of the psychiatrist’s evidence, Aylesworth J.A. concluded, at page
21:

The relation of appellant’s actions and
conduct, as posed to the doctor, to appellant’s mental capacity, was surely a
matter upon which the witness could call into play his special knowledge in
that field. The fact that the witness did not examine the appellant, in my
opinion, can have no bearing upon the question of the admissibility of his
evidence; the whole basis of his evidence, as has been said already, was the
effect of appellant’s activities as demonstrating to an expert in the field of
psychiatry, the presence or absence of a specific degree of mental capacity.
While the value of that evidence was for the jury, it was in my view,
admissible evidence.

(The italics are my own.)

What was sought to be introduced in the present
case was evidence from a specialist in the field of psychiatry as to the
absence of a specific degree of behavoural capacity and I think that
Mr. Justice Aylesworth’s language applies and that “while the value of
that evidence was for the jury it was… admissible evidence.”

I am far from saying that as a general rule
psychiatric evidence of a man’s disinclination to commit the kind of crime with
which he is charged should be admitted, but the present case is con-

[Page 278]

cerned with gross indecency between two men and
I think that crimes involving homosexuality stand in a class by themselves in
the sense that the participants frequently have characteristics which make them
more readily identifiable as a class than ordinary criminals. See Reg. v.
Thompson[9]. In any
event, it appears to me that the question of whether or not a man is
homosexually inclined or otherwise sexually perverted is one upon which an
experienced psychiatrist is qualified to express an opinion and that if such
opinion is relevant it should be admitted at a trial such as this even if it
involves the psychiatrist in expressing his conclusion that the accused does
not have the capacity to commit the crime with which he is charged.

For all these reasons, as well as for those
expressed in the reasons for judgment rendered by Mr. Justice Bull on
behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal, I would dismiss this appeal.

HALL J.—The facts relative to this appeal are
set out in the reasons of my brothers Martland and Ritchie.

I agree with my brother Ritchie that the learned
trial judge should have admitted all the evidence which the psychiatrist,
Dr. Newman, was prepared to give.

Homosexuality is not a disease of the mind nor a
mental illness nor a condition arising out of mental incapacity or deficiency.
It is a sexual attraction and interest between members of the same sex. There
are all gradations of the condition from those at the one end of the scale who
have never had a normal sexual impulse to those at the other end who are only
homosexual under exceptional conditions; e.g., when they are totally segregated
from the opposite sex, and in their case their homosexuality generally
disappears as soon as they return to a normal environment. In between, others
have both homosexual and heterosexual impulses and are known as “bisexuals”. In
whatever category the homosexual falls, his condition is an acquired aberration
from the normal state. No one is destined at birth to be a homosexual any more
than any given individual is earmarked to be an alcoholic or a drug addict.

[Page 279]

Heredity plays no part in the development.
Environment is said to be the decisive factor.

The literature on the subject of homosexuality
is very divergent in attributing specific causes or reasons for the condition,
but all writers are agreed that whatever other causes there may be
psychological factors are of great importance and are to be considered in what
might be termed an ascending scale of complexity of explanation. Psychiatry has
concerned itself in a special way with the study of homosexuality, and

…throughout psychiatry one finds that the
structure of the personality is an interplay between environment and
constitutional endowment, so much so that it is almost possible to devise an
equation that constitution X the environment = a constant. (“They Stand Apart”,
Windmill Press, London, 1955, p. 78.)

Accordingly it follows that the evidence of
psychiatrists is particularly relevant in cases involving homosexuality and the
admissibility of opinion evidence from psychiatrists must be determined by its
relevancy to the matter in issue at the trial. In the present case the learned
trial judge admitted all the evidence being tendered from Dr. Newman
except the opinion he was prepared to give to the effect that Lupien’s normal
personality and his defence mechanisms would cause him to reject homosexual
advances and that he would not knowingly have engaged in them. Dr. Newman
was allowed to answer the hypothetical question put to him based on the
assumption of the truth of the evidence adduced at the trial but was not
permitted to give the opinion above set out based on tests made by and for him
and in conversations with Lupien.

It is a question where the line between
admissibility and inadmissibility is to be drawn. If the evidence was relevant
to the defence being put forward on behalf of Lupien, and I think it was, then
it was admissible and the learned trial judge erred in rejecting it.

It is true, as Davey C.J.B.C. points out in his
dissent, that the answer which the psychiatrist was expected to give “comes too
close to the very

[Page 280]

thing the jury had to find on the whole of the evidence”.
I do not think that this is a valid reason for rejecting the evidence. Actually
it cannot be considered an innovation in regard to medical evidence.
Psychiatrists are permitted to testify that from their examination and study,
sometimes long after the event, of an accused, including conversations with him
and from facts proven in evidence, that the accused was incapable of forming
the intent necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged. That
type of evidence is very close, if not identical, to the conclusion the jury
must come to in such a case if it is to find that the accused was not guilty
because he did not have intent necessary to support conviction. The weight to
be given the opinion of the expert is entirely for the jury, and it is the
function of the trial judge to instruct the jury that the responsibility for
weighing the evidence is theirs and theirs alone.

The next question for decision is whether the
error in this instance was fatal to a valid conviction or whether the provisions
of s. 592(1) (b)(iii) which read:

592. (1) On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction, the court of appeal

(b) may dismiss the appeal where…

(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of
the opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a)
the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion
that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred;

should be applied.

The conditions under which this provision should
be invoked are set out in the reasons of Cartwright J. (now C.J.C.) in Colpitts
v. The Queen[10] as
follows:

A number of authorities which should guide
the Court of Appeal in deciding whether, misdirection

[Page 281]

having been shewn, it can safely be
affirmed that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred are
quoted in the reasons of my brother Spence. Upon reading these it will be
observed that, once error in law has been found to have occurred at the trial,
the onus resting upon the Crown is to satisfy the Court that the verdict would
necessarily have been the same if such error had not occurred. The satisfaction
of this onus is a condition precedent to the right of the Appellate Court to
apply the terms of the subsection at all. The Court is not bound to apply
the subsection merely because this onus is discharged.

The section recognizes that there are cases
in which, notwithstanding error on the part of the learned trial judge, the
appeal court may in its discretion, where the weight of the evidence impels it
to do so, conclude that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has
occurred. This is such a case. The evidence against the accused was
overwhelming, and in my view the verdict would necessarily have been the same
even if the jury had heard the opinion which Dr. Newman was prepared to
give.

I think that this is a proper case for the
application of the provisions of s. 592(1) (b)(iii). I would,
accordingly, allow the appeal and restore the conviction and sentence.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Trial—Capital murder—Admissions
of fact at trial—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 562.

The appellant was convicted of the capital
murder of his wife. It was conclusively proved that her death was caused by
arsenical poisoning and that she had ingested quantities of arsenic throughout
a period of several months prior to her death. This was not contested by the
defence. The first day of the trial, after the evidence of one Crown witness
had been heard, counsel for the appellant tendered a formal written admission
of facts and asked that

[Page 311]

this be received pursuant to s. 562  of
the Criminal Code . The Crown objected to the inclusion of one of these
facts. The trial judge did not permit the admission of the fact in question.
The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge should have permitted the
admission but that the error had caused no prejudice to the appellant and that
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred. The appellant
appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The trial judge was not in error. In a
criminal case, an accused cannot admit a fact alleged against him until the
allegation has been made. When recourse is proposed to be added to s. 562 ,
it is for the Crown, not for the defence, to state the fact or facts which it
alleges against the accused and of which it seeks admission. The accused, of
course, is under no obligation to admit the fact so alleged but his choice is
to admit or to decline to do so. He cannot frame the wording of the allegation
to suit his own purposes and then insist on admitting it. The idea of the
admission of an allegation involves action by two persons, one who makes the
allegation and another who admits it.

The reasons of Bull J.A. of the Court of
Appeal on all the other grounds of appeal urged in the Court of Appeal and
before this Court, should be adopted.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[1],
affirming the appellant’s conviction for capital murder. Appeal dismissed.

C.R. MacLean, for the appellant.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This is an appeal from the
unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1, pronounced on
July 19, 1968, dismissing the appellant’s appeal from his

[Page 312]

conviction before Dryer J. and a jury on October
6, 1967, of the capital murder of his wife.

Esther Castellani, the wife of the appellant,
died on July 11, 1965. It was conclusively proved by medical and scientific
testimony that her death was caused by arsenical poisoning and that she had
ingested quantities of arsenic throughout a period of several months prior to her
death. That this was the fact was not contested by the defence. The question
for the jury was whether they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the
poison had been administered to her by the appellant. The learned trial Judge
rightly instructed the jury that only two verdicts were open to them, “Not
Guilty” or “Guilty of Capital Murder”.

The grounds of appeal relied upon by the
appellant in the Court of Appeal are accurately summarized as follows in the
reasons of Norris J.A. and of Bull J.A.:

1. The learned trial Judge erred in
refusing to allow the appellant or his counsel to admit at the trial certain
facts under Section 562  of the Criminal Code .

2. The learned trial Judge erred in law in
not ordering certain portions of the address to the jury by the appellant’s
counsel to be read to the jury when the jury so requested.

3. The learned trial Judge misdirected the
jury by:

(a) failing to adequately
deal with the evidence given by Mrs. Sheila Luond, and

(b) after having the evidence
of Mrs. Sheila Luond read to the jury as it requested, made references to
certain facts which were not in evidence, thereby suggesting that a prejudicial
inference could be drawn therefrom, and not correcting that error until the
next day just before the verdict was delivered, and

(c) creating a prejudicial effect by
the combination of (a) and (b) above.

4. In view of the circumstantial nature of
the evidence, the jury could not have given proper weight to the direction of
the learned trial Judge as to the

[Page 313]

rule in Hodge’s case (1838) 2 Lewin
227, 168 E.R. 1136, or the doctrine of reasonable doubt, and so its verdict was
perverse or unreasonable.

As to the first of these grounds, it appears
that on September 25, 1967, the first day of the trial, after the evidence of
one Crown witness had been heard, counsel for the appellant tendered a formal
written admission, of facts “for the purpose of freeing the Crown of the
responsibility for proving same” and asked that this be received pursuant to
s. 562  of the Criminal Code  which reads as follows:

562. Where an accused is on trial for an
indictable offence he or his counsel may admit any fact alleged against him for
the purpose of dispensing with proof thereof.

The document tendered consisted of eight
paragraphs; following the style of cause it read as follows:

Pursuant to the provisions of
section 562  of the Criminal Code  of Canada, Counsel for Rene Emile
Castellani hereby admit the following facts:—

1. That at the Vancouver General Hospital,
in the City of Vancouver in the County of Vancouver, in the Province of British
Columbia, on July 12th, 1965, an autopsy was performed by Dr. Frank H.
Anderson on the body of Esther Castellani, deceased.

2. That on July 14th, 1965, at Forest Lawn
Memorial Park in the Municipality of Burnaby, in the Province of British
Columbia, the body of Ester Castellani, deceased, was buried in a casket placed
in a closed cement crypt.

3. That on August 3rd, 1965, the body of
Esther Castellani, deceased, was exhumed from the cement crypt of Forest Lawn
Memorial Park in the Municipality of Burnaby, and delivered to the morgue in
the City of Vancouver where a post‑mortem examination was conducted by
Dr. Thomas Redo Harmon.

4. That control specimens of embalming
fluid from the same source as were used by the undertakers who embalmed the
body of Esther Castel-

[Page 314]

lani, deceased and who buried her, namely
Simmons & McBride Ltd. of the City of Vancouver, were delivered to Eldon
Rideout at the City of Vancouver on August 3rd, 1965.

5. That on July 28th, 1965, at the Broadway
and Cambie Branch of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in the City of
Vancouver, Rene Emile Castellani signed a certain application for a loan form
from Kinross Mortgage Corporation, in the presence of Mr. R.S. Keyes.

6. That no action or proceeding for
dissolution of the marriage between Rene Emile Castellani and Esther
Castellani, which marriage was solemnized on July 16th, 1946, was ever
commenced in any Court having jurisdiction to hear such an action.

7. That scientific tests known as X-ray
diffraction procedures were done by Mrs. Thomson at the Ontario
Attorney-General’s Crime Detection Laboratory, in an effort to determine from
the hair samples removed from the body of Esther Castellani what salt or
compound the arsenic had originated from, but the results were inconclusive
because there was not a sufficient quantity of hair.

8. That Rene Emile Castellani and Adelaide
Miller mutually engaged in an extra‑marital sexual relationship from
approximately the Fall of A.D., 1964 to the Spring of A.D., 1966.

It was dated September 25, 1967, and signed by
both of the counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial.

Counsel for the Crown objected and the question
was adjourned to the following day for argument. During the adjournment counsel
for both parties agreed that the first seven paragraphs should be admitted but
Crown counsel objected to the inclusion of para. 8 while counsel for the
appellant insisted that under s. 562  he had the right to make that admission
and intended to do so.

Following argument in the absence of the jury
the learned trial Judge, after expressing regret that counsel for the Crown had
not seen fit to

[Page 315]

accept the admissions as tendered, ruled that
while the Crown’s case was being put in the defence did not have the right to
make an admission unless the Crown were willing to accept it. Later the
admission consisting of the seven paragraphs was signed and filed with the
consent of both parties but counsel for the appellant maintained that they had
the right to insist on also making the admission contained in para. 8.

The Court of Appeal were of the view that the
learned trial Judge should have permitted the admission set out in para. 8
to be made, interpreting the words of s. 562  as giving the accused an
unqualified right to make an admission of any fact alleged against him. They
held therefore that the learned trial Judge had erred in law but went on to
hold that the error had caused no prejudice to the appellant and that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred. If I were in
agreement with the Court of Appeal that the learned trial Judge had erred in
law in the manner stated I would also have agreed with their conclusion that
this occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice; but, with
respect, I do not agree that the learned trial Judge was in error in the ruling
which he made.

In a criminal case, there being no pleadings,
there are no precisely worded allegations of fact which are susceptible of
categorical admission. An accused cannot admit a fact alleged against him until
the allegation has been made. When recourse is proposed to be had to
s. 562  it is for the Crown, not for the defence, to state the fact or
facts which it alleges against the accused and of which it seeks admission. The
accused, of course, is under no obligation to admit the fact so alleged but his
choice is to admit it or to decline to do so. He cannot frame the wording of
the allegation to suit his own purposes and then insist on admitting it. To
permit such a course could only lead to confusion. The idea of the admission

[Page 316]

of an allegation involves action by two persons,
one who makes the allegation and another who admits it.

I have formed the above opinion as to the
meaning and effect of s. 562 , simply from a consideration of its words and
of what is necessarily involved in the notion of an admission of an allegation
of fact in a criminal case. If it were necessary to have recourse to rules of
construction my view would be strengthened by the application of the rules set
out by Lord Coke in Heydon’s Case[2].
It seems reasonably clear that before the enactment of s. 690 in the Criminal
Code, 1892, the predecessor of s. 562 , an accused on his trial for
felony could not be allowed to make an admission in court although he desired
to do so and counsel for the Crown was willing to accept it. This is indicated
in the following passage in the report of the Commissioners who prepared the
English draft code in 1879, which is quoted in Taschereau’s Criminal Code (1893),
3rd ed. at p. 800:

At present if the accused is proved before
his trial to have made an admission it is evidence against him, but though he
offers to make the same admission in court it is thought that in cases of
felony the judge is obliged to refuse to let him do so.

The same view as to the common law rule was
expressed by Osler J.A. giving the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Regina
v. St. Clair[3] as
follows:

… Under the former convenient
classification of crimes as felonies and misdemeanours, the abolition of which,
I think for my own part, is much to be regretted, such a charge was a
misdemeanour simply and the competency of the accused or her counsel to make
admissions at the trial for the purposes of the trial was undoubted.

In Rex v. Foster (1836), 7 C.
& P. 495, on an indictment for felony for having in his possession a

[Page 317]

mould for the purpose of coining, the prisoner
was acquitted; a second indictment for a related felony was then presented, the
evidence on which was to be the same as in the former case. Counsel for the
prosecution said that with the assent of the prisoner’s counsel he proposed not
to call the witnesses again. Patteson, J., said he doubted if that could be
done, even by consent, in a case of felony, though he knew it might be in a
case of misdemeanour. The witnesses were, therefore, recalled and resworn, and
the evidence they had given read over to them from the Judge’s notes.

In my opinion the purpose of enacting
s. 562  and its predecessors was to alter the common law rule by
eliminating the necessity, on the trial of an indictable offence, of proof by
the Crown of any fact which it desires to prove and which the accused is
prepared to admit at his trial.

On all the other grounds of appeal urged in the
Court of Appeal and before us I find myself so fully in agreement with the
reasons of Bull J.A. that I am content simply to adopt them. Nothing would be
gained by repeating or summarizing what he has said. Each of the learned
Justices of Appeal performed the duty placed upon the Court of Appeal by
s. 583A(3)  of the Criminal Code  and could find no grounds in the
record other than those alleged in the notice of appeal upon which the
conviction ought to be set aside.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Lottery—Montreal voluntary
tax—Prizes determined by lot and answers to questions printed on official
receipt—Prizes in silver ingots—Violation of Criminal Code —Court of Queen’s
Bench Reference Act, R.S.Q. 1964, c. 10, ss. 1, 5—Criminal Code , 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, s. 179(1)(d), (e)—Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259,
s. 37.

To a question referred to it by the
Lieutenant-Governor in council, the Court of Appeal answered that the carrying
out of a scheme adopted by the City of Montreal to obtain additional revenue would contravene the provisions of
s. 179  of the Criminal Code . The scheme which was well publicized
in the newspapers, consists in inviting the general public to become voluntary
taxpayers of the City by making monthly contributions of a fixed amount of $2,
or multiples thereof, and in inducing the public to participate by saying that
every month there will be drawn, from the names of all those who will have
contributed during that month, the names of 151 persons who will then be
called, at a later date, to be questioned, in an order determined by lot, on
their knowledge of the City of Montreal and win, if they answer correctly,
prizes ranging from $100 to $100,000 depending on the order in which they are
questioned, the 151st person being the only one in a position to win $100,000.
The advertisements published in the newspapers stated that the prizes will be
given after the candidates have answered correctly and in public some of the
questions which correspond to the answers printed on the reverse side of the
official receipt. By resolution of the Executive Committee prizes were to be in
the form of silver ingots. The City appealed to this Court.

[Page 333]

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The majority judgment in the Court of Appeal
rightly decided that the advertisements published in the newspapers clearly
showed that the intention of the City, as regards the examination, was to make
it as easy and as painless as possible, and that in fact, what the City had
told the public, by necessary implication if not expressly, was that the
statements printed on the reverse of the official receipt were the answers to
the questions that will be asked; that the ability to memorize these simple
statements and to repeat them in public could at best be considered as a
minimal degree of skill incapable of keeping the scheme within the law, as
attempted by the introduction of this type of examination as the final step of
an operation based essentially on chance; and that the form of the prizes was
another device to shield the scheme against the application of the law.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen’s
Bench, Appeal Side, province of
Quebec[1], on a
reference concerning the carrying out of a scheme by the City of Montreal to obtain additional revenue.
Appeal dismissed.

Michel Côté, Antonio Lamer and Jacques
Fortin, for the appellant.

Fred Kaufman, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

FAUTEUX J.—This appeal, submitted to this Court
on November 26, 1969, was inscribed under the provisions of s. 37 of the Supreme
Court Act and those of the Act Respecting a Reference to the Court of
Queen’s Bench, Statutes of Quebec, 17 Eliz. II, c. 83, assented to on May 9, 1968.

The City of Montreal appeals from a majority
opinion of the Court of Queen’s Bench (Appeal side) on a Reference ordered by
Order-in-council No. 1354, adopted on May 8, 1968, by the Lieutenant-Governor
of the Province of Quebec, to have the Court determine if the carrying out of a
scheme adopted by the City of Montreal to obtain additional revenue would
contravene any provision of the Criminal Code .

[Page 334]

Described in the Order-in-council and the
Appendices thereto, the scheme, which was well publicized in the newspapers,
consists, in brief, in inviting the general public, through the appropriate
media, to become voluntary taxpayers of the City by making monthly contributions
of a fixed amount of $2 (or multiples thereof) and in inducing the public to
participate by saying that every month there will be drawn, from the names of
all those who will have contributed during that month, the names of 151 persons
who will then be called, at a later date, to be questioned, in an order
determined by lot, on their knowledge of the City of Montreal and win, if they
answer correctly, prizes ranging from $100 to $100,000 depending on the order
in which they are questioned, the 151st person being the only one in a position
to win $100,000. The description of the examination is found, in different
terms, in the text of the resolution passed by the City council when the
principle of the scheme was approved, in the text of the resolution passed by
the Executive Committee to determine the mechanics thereof, and in the
advertisements published by the City of Montreal in various newspapers. This description, which is vague in the text
of the resolutions, becomes more precise in the advertisements meant for the
general public, in which we find the following:

[TRANSLATION] …prizes will be given after
they (the candidates) have answered correctly and in public some of the
questions which correspond to the answers printed on the reverse side of the
official receipt.

We find, printed on the reverse of that receipt
which is given to the taxpayer upon payment of the so-called voluntary tax,
twenty answers of which the following four are typical:

1. Montréal was founded in 1642.

3. Montréal is the Metropolis of Canada.

5. The great river linking Montréal to the
Atlantic Ocean is the St. Lawrence River.

9. The mountain located within the limits
of the City of Montréal is
Mount Royal.

In the advertisement, published in the newspaper
La Presse, we find the following:

[TRANSLATION] If a child is too young to
answer the questions, his father, mother or other person having paid on his
behalf may answer in his stead.

[Page 335]

Although the resolution of the Executive
Committee provides that:

[TRANSLATION] All the prizes will be
physically in the form of silver ingots, worth at least the amount advertised,

the description of the prizes is as follows in
the same advertisement:

[TRANSLATION]


 
  
  1ST PRIZE.................................... 
  
  
  $100,000 IN
  SILVER

After having heard counsel for the Attorney
General of the Province and for the City of Montreal, the Court of Appeal
(Tremblay C.J., Casey, Rinfret, Taschereau and Owen JJ.) reserved judgment and
on a later date, answered the question as follows: of the five members of the
Court, three (Casey, Taschereau and Owen JJ.) answered affirmatively on the
ground that the execution of the scheme would contravene, in the opinion of the
first two, the provisions of s. 179(1) (d) and (1) (e) of the Criminal
Code , and in the opinion of the third, the provisions of s. 179(1) (d).
The Chief Justice and Rinfret J., dissenting, answered in the negative.
However, the Chief Justice indicated that, [TRANSLATION] “if they (the persons
called for the examination) were being asked only the questions for which the
answers are provided on the reverse of the receipt given by the City” he would
have answered in the affirmative.

In his reasons, which are concurred in by
Taschereau J., Casey J. states, in brief, that the advertisements published in
the newspapers clearly show that the intention of the City, as regards the
examination which a certain number of taxpayers of this so-called voluntary tax
must undergo, is to make it as easy and as painless as possible, and that in
fact, what the City has told the public, by necessary implication if not
expressly, is that the statements printed on the reverse of the official
receipt are the answers to the questions that will be asked. In the learned
Judge’s opinion the ability to memorize these simple

[Page 336]

statements and to repeat them in public can at
best be considered as a minimal degree of skill incapable, in the light of
jurisprudential criteria, of keeping the scheme within the law, as attempted by
the introduction of this type of examination as the final step of an operation
based essentially on chance.

Casey J. adds that he is satisfied that the
prizes offered to the public in the newspaper advertisements are cash prizes
and that the above-mentioned provision of the Executive Committee’s resolution,
dealing with the form of the prizes, is another device to shield the scheme
against the application of the law.

With all due respect for the contrary opinion, I
must say that we are all in agreement with the reasons and findings stated in
the opinion of Casey J., which reasons and findings we adopt in their entirety
and to which we feel nothing can usefully be added.

With these views, it is unnecessary to pursue
any further consideration of the question submitted in the Reference. It
follows that the appeal must be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Obtaining money by false
pretences and with intent to defraud—Evidence of obtaining lesser sum than that
mentioned in charge—Conviction of obtaining amount mentioned in charge—Whether
conviction for obtaining smaller amount should be confirmed—Whether conviction
should be amended—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 304(1)(a), 592(8),
600(1).

The appellant was convicted on a charge of
obtaining a sum of $285 by false pretences and with intent to defraud, contrary
to s. 304(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code . There was evidence on
which the magistrate could find that the appellant had obtained by false
pretences a sum of $56. The conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The
appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed and a conviction entered for the lesser amount.

It was not possible to affirm the conviction
as to the obtaining by false pretences of the entire sum of $285, but the
conviction for obtaining the smaller amount should be affirmed. R. v. Scott,
34 C.C.C. 180 and R. v. Castle, 68 C.C.C. 78. It was proper to amend
the conviction as it appears that upon the evidence the appellant should only
have been convicted of obtaining the amount of $56. This Court has the
jurisdiction to make the appropriate amendment by virtue of s. 600(1) of the
Code.

Droit criminel—Obtenir de l’argent par
faux-semblants et avec intention de frauder—Preuve de l’obtention d’une somme
moindre que celle mentionnée à l’acte d’accusation—Déclaration de culpabilité
d’avoir obtenu le montant mentionné à l’acte d’accusation—Confirmation de la
déclaration d’avoir obtenu le montant moindre—Amendement de la déclaration de
culpabilité—Code criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, art. 304(1)(a), 592(3),
600(1).

L’appelant a été déclaré coupable d’avoir
obtenu une somme de $285 par faux‑semblants et avec l’intention de
frauder, contrairement à l’art. 304(1)  (a) du Code criminel . Il y
avait une preuve sur laquelle le magistrat pouvait se baser pour conclure que
l’appelant avait obtenu une somme de $56 par faux-semblants. La déclaration de
culpabilité a été confirmée par la Cour d’appel. L’appelant a obtenu la
permission d’en appeler à cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté et une déclaration de culpabilité doit être enregistrée pour
le montant moindre.

Il n’est pas possible de confirmer la
déclaration de culpabilité quant à l’obtention par faux-semblants du plein
montant de $285, mais la déclaration de culpabilité d’avoir obtenu le montant
moindre doit être confirmée. R. v. Scott, 34 C.C.C. 180 et R. v.
Castle, 68 C.C.C. 78. Il s’agit ici d’un cas où la déclaration de
culpabilité doit être amendée puisqu’il appert de la preuve que l’appelant
n’aurait dû être déclaré coupable que d’avoir obtenu la somme de $56. Cette
Cour a juridiction, en vertu de l’art. 600(1) du Code, pour faire l’amendement
qu’il convient.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’appel de
l’Ontario, confirmant une déclaration de culpabilité. Appel
rejeté.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, affirming the
appellant’s conviction. Appeal dismissed.

Reginald Lake, in person.

E.G. Achborn, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

SPENCE J.:—This is an appeal by leave of this
Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced November 23, 1967. By that judgment the Court of Appeal
dismissed the appeal from the conviction registered by the Magistrate at Ottawa on October 14, 1966, upon the charge
that:

Reginald Lake between the 6th day of June
A.D. 1966 and the twenty-eighth day of July A.D. 1966, at the City of Ottawa,
in said

[Page 51]

County of Carleton, did unlawfully obtain a
sum of or about $285.00 from Wilfred Bauer, by false pretences and with intent to
defraud, contrary to section 304(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code .

The leave to appeal granted by this Court was
upon the following questions of law:

1. Was there any evidence on which it was
open to the learned Magistrate to hold that there was a false pretence made by
the appellant which induced Wilfred Bauer to pay money to him?

2. Was there any evidence on which it was
open to the learned Magistrate to hold that the appellant had the intent to
defraud Wilfred Bauer?

3. Was there any evidence on which it was
open to the learned Magistrate to hold that Wilfred Bauer was defrauded of
anything?

It is not necessary for these purposes to recite
the evidence in any detail, and it is sufficient to say that there was evidence
on which the Magistrate could find reasonably that the appellant did obtain
from the said Wilfred Bauer by false pretences the sum of about $56, the said
false pretences being that the appellant falsely represented himself to be a
bailiff of the Division Court at Ottawa acting on a process of that Court and
in particular that he falsely represented that he was empowered to and did take
a bond from the said Wilfred Bauer and demanded and obtained certain amounts of
money for the “registration” of the said bond as fees therefor.

It is true that the Magistrate said in giving
judgment after a recess:

Continuing my remarks regarding judgment in
this case, and considering the evidence I would have to find that the whole of
the monies obtained by Mr. Lake in this case—some $285.00—that all of that
money was obtained by false pretences, and I say this because of the use of the
word “bailiff” by the accused when he wasn’t a bailiff and knew it.

Although this Court is not ready to affirm the
conviction as to the obtaining by false pretences of the whole $285, it is
apparent that the Magistrate had earlier in his reasons addressed his mind to
the obtaining by false pretences of the smaller sum only when he said:

I find him guilty of obtaining funds by
false pretences, and in particular, monies pertaining to the bond, six dollars
whatever it was on this occasion, and the monies listed on those receipts for
costs.

and that therefore the conviction for obtaining
the smaller amount by false pretences should be confirmed. That such a course
is a proper one is, I think, demonstrated by the

[Page 52]

judgments in R. v. Scott[1], Ontario Court of Appeal, as confirmed in
this Court[2] in the
same volume at p. 187, where at p. 186 Magee J. said:

The amount charged as being stolen $7,835,
no doubt corresponds with the total of the three credits; but if, instead of
five cheques amounting to $755, the accused had cashed one, two, or three
cheques for $7,000 in all, three days after the fraudulent entries, could it be
said that, although his act amounted to theft, proof could not be given of it?
What the Crown set out to prove, as I venture to think, is that Scott’s
employers had been defrauded out of $7,835, or some greater or less sum, by
some act which amounted to theft. The evidence might fail to shew theft at all.
It would be sufficient if part were stolen. The Criminal Code ,
sec. 857 , allows proof of three distinct charges of theft.

(The underlining is my own.)

and the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal
in R. v. Castle[3], where
at p. 80, Rowell C.J.O. said:

In reference to the first ground of appeal,
it is quite clear that a person accused of theft can be convicted upon an
indictment charging theft upon proof of theft of a smaller sum than that
charged in the indictment: Rex v. Scott (1920), 57 D.L.R. 309, 34 Can. C.C. 180,
48 O.L.R. 452, affirmed in the Supreme Court, 58 D.L.R. 242, 34 Can. C.C. 187.

The question arises whether this Court in
dismissing the appeal and confirming the conviction should amend the latter. I
am of the opinion that it is proper to do so. It would appear that upon the
evidence the appellant should only have been convicted of obtaining by false
pretences the amount of $56. The charge as laid contained a reference to a
figure of about $285. This Court has the jurisdiction to make the appropriate
amendment by virtue of s. 600(1)  of the Criminal Code  which
provides:

600. (1) The Supreme Court of Canada may,
on an appeal under this part, make any order that the court of appeal might
have made and may make any rule or order that is necessary to give effect to
its judgment.

The Court of Appeal for Ontario has power to amend the conviction to set out the smaller amount by
virtue of s. 592(3)  of the Criminal Code  which provides:

592. (3) Where a court of appeal dismisses
an appeal under subparagraph (i) of paragraph (b) of
subsection (1), it may substitute the

[Page 53]

verdict that in its opinion should have
been found and affirm the sentence passed by the trial court or impose a
sentence that is warranted by law.

The paragraph referred to therein, i.e., 592(1)(b)(i),
provides:

592. (1) On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction, the court of appeal

...

(b) may dismiss the appeal where

(i) the court is of the opinion that the
appellant, although he was not properly convicted on a count or part of
the indictment, was properly convicted on another count or part of the
indictment,

(The underlining is my own.)

1. In R. v. Norcross[4], (B.C.C.A.), the Court amended a conviction
of theft by reducing the amount mentioned in the charge.

I would therefore dismiss the appeal. Acting
under the provisions of the Criminal Code , I would substitute a
conviction that the appellant between the 6th day of June 1966 and the 28th day
of July 1966, at the City of Ottawa, in the County of Carleton, did unlawfully
obtain the sum of $56 from Wilfred Bauer by false pretences and with intent to
defraud, contrary to s. 304(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code .

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Appeal to Court of
Appeal—Question of law alone—Minimum resale, price specified by
manufacturer—Whether acquittal of attempt resale price maintenance subject to
appeal—Presumptions—Whether sufficiency of evidence question of fact or
law—Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 814, ss. 34(2), 41(2)—Criminal
Code , 1953-54. (Can.),
c. 51, s. 584(1)(a).

The appellant corporation, a manufacturer of
electrical appliances, was indicted on four counts of attempting to induce
retail dealers to resell its products at prices not less than the minimum
prices specified by it, contrary to s. 34(2) (b) of the Combines
Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 314. The evidence tendered consisted in
large measure of documents such as letters addressed to all dealers in certain
commodities, price lists distributed to dealers and interdepartmental
correspondence. The appellant was convicted on two counts and an order of
prohibition was granted. The trial judge acquitted on the other two counts on
the ground that there was insufficient evidence of inducement. An appeal by the
Crown from the acquittal was allowed by a majority judgment of the Court of
Appeal which also varied the order of prohibition. The corporation appealed to
this Court.

Held (Judson,
Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed in part and the
verdict of acquittal restored.

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Fauteux, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: The finding by the trial judge that
the case presented by the Crown did not

[Page 222]

establish the appellant’s guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt does not involve “a question of law alone” so as to entitle
the Attorney General to appeal to the Court of Appeal under the provisions of
s. 584(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code . Section 41(2) (c)
of the Combines Investigation Act provides that documents, such as the
letters in this case, which were in the possession of the accused “shall be
admitted in evidence without further proof thereof and shall be prima facie evidence”
that the accused had knowledge of the documents and their contents and that
anything recorded in them as having been done, said or agreed upon by the
accused or its agent, was done, said or agreed upon. The trial judge is in no
way precluded by that section from considering the weight to be attached
to that evidence in considering the issue of the accused’s guilt or innocence.
Accepting the view of the Court of Appeal that the evidence here was sufficient
to support a conviction, the further question of whether the guilt of the
accused should be inferred from that evidence, was one of fact within the
province of the judge. It is well settled that the sufficiency of evidence is a
question of fact and not a question of law. However wrong the Court of Appeal
or this Court may think that the trial judge was in reaching the conclusion
that the evidence was not sufficient to satisfy him beyond a reasonable doubt,
this error cannot be determined without passing judgment on the reasonableness
of the verdict or the sufficiency of the evidence, and these are not matters
over which the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction under s. 584(1)(a) of
the Code.

Per Judson,
Spence and Pigeon JJ., dissenting: The evidence contained in the
documents produced at the trial amounted to an admission of an attempt to
induce dealers to sell at not less than a specified minimum price. There was no
evidence which could give rise to a reasonable doubt that the accused had
committed the offence so as to rebut the presumption created by s. 41 of the Combines
Investigation Act. Reasonable doubt must be based upon evidence adduced at
the trial. There was therefore no course but to convict the accused.

The Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to
consider the appeal from the acquittal by the trial judge. It was an error in
law for the trial judge to charge himself, as it would appear that he did, that
the Crown in order to support the charges had to prove an inducing by agreement,
threat or promise. The Crown had only to prove the intent to induce and an
overt act toward the accomplishment of that intent. These were proven on prima
facie evidence which by lack of contradiction became conclusive evidence. When
there is, as in the present case, a statutory presumption to be applied, once
the facts necessary to give rise to it are found by the trial judge to be
established beyond reasonable doubt, the question whether the inference of
guilt should be made is no longer anything but a question of law alone.

[Page 223]

La compagnie appelante, qui fabrique des
appareils électriques, a été poursuivie par acte d’accusation sous quatre chefs
d’avoir tenté d’engager des marchands au détail à revendre ses produits à un
prix non inférieur à un prix minimum spécifié par elle, le tout contrairement à
l’art. 34(2) (b) de la Loi relative aux enquêtes sur les coalitions, S.R.C.
1952, c. 314. La preuve offerte consistait en grande partie en documents tels
que des lettres adressées à tous les marchands de certains produits, en listes
de prix distribuées aux marchands et en correspondance interdépartementale.
L’appelante a été déclarée coupable sous deux chefs et un ordre de prohibition
a été émis. Le juge au procès a rendu un verdict d’acquittement sur les deux
autres chefs pour le motif que la preuve d’incitation était insuffisante. Un
appel de la Couronne du jugement d’acquittement a été accueilli par un jugement
majoritaire de la Cour d’appel qui a aussi modifié l’ordre de prohibition. La
compagnie en a appelé à cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être accueilli en partie et le verdict d’acquittement rétabli, les Juges
Judson, Spence et Pigeon étant dissidents.

Le Juge en
Chef Cartwright et les Juges Fauteux, Martland et Ritchie: La conclusion du
juge au procès que la preuve de la Couronne n’établissait pas hors d’un doute
raisonnable la culpabilité de l’appelante ne comporte pas une «question de
droit seulement» permettant au procureur général d’en appeler à la Cour d’appel
en vertu des dispositions de l’art. 584(1)  (a) du Code Criminel . L’article
41 (2) (c) de la Loi relative aux enquêtes sur les coalitions stipule
que les documents qui, tels que les lettres dans cette cause, étaient en la
possession du prévenu «font foi sans autre preuve et attestent prima facie» que
le prévenu connaissait les documents et leur contenu et que toute chose
inscrite dans ces documents comme ayant été accomplie, dite ou convenue par le
prévenu ou son agent, l’a été ainsi que le document le mentionne. Cet article
n’empêche pas le juge au procès de considérer le poids qu’il doit attaché à
cette preuve lorsqu’il considère la question de la culpabilité du prévenu. Si
on accepte le point de vue de la Cour d’appel que la preuve était suffisante
pour permettre de conclure à la culpabilité, la question supplémentaire de
savoir si on doit tirer de cette preuve une conclusion de culpabilité, est une
question de fait de la compétence du juge. D’après une jurisprudence bien
établie, la suffisance de la preuve est une question de fait et non pas une
question de droit. Même si la Cour d’appel ou cette Cour sont d’avis que le
juge au procès a erré en concluant que la preuve n’était pas suffisante pour le
convaincre hors d’un doute raisonnable, cette erreur ne peut pas être constatée
sans passer un jugement sur le caractère raisonnable du verdict ou la
suffisance de la preuve, et ce ne sont pas là des questions sur lesquelles la
Cour d’appel a juridiction en vertu de Fart. 584(1) (a) du Code.

Les Juges
Judson, Spence et Pigeon, dissidents: La preuve qui se trouve dans les
documents produits au procès équivaut à l’aveu d’une tentative d’engager les
marchands à vendre à pas moins qu’à un prix minimum spécifié. Il n’y a aucune
preuve pouvant faire naître un doute raisonnable que le prévenu a commis
l’infraction de manière à ce que la présomption créée par l’art. 41 de la Loi
relative aux enquêtes sur les coalitions puisse être réfutée. Le doute
raisonnable doit être basé sur la preuve produite au procès. Dans le cas
présent, il n’y avait pas d’autre alternative qu’une déclaration de
culpabilité.

La Cour d’appel avait juridiction pour
déterminer l’appel du verdict d’acquittement. Le juge au procès a erré en droit
en se donnant les

[Page 224]

directives, ainsi qu’il semble l’avoir fait,
que la Couronne devait, en vue de supporter les chefs d’accusation, prouver une
incitation par entente, menace ou promesse. La Couronne n’avait qu’à prouver
l’intention d’engager les marchands et un acte manifeste en vue de
l’accomplissement de cette intention. Ces choses ont été prouvées par une
preuve prima facie qui, vu l’absence de contradiction, est devenue une preuve
concluante. Lorsqu’il s’agit, comme dans le cas présent, de l’application d’une
présomption statutaire, et que le juge a conclu que les faits nécessaires pour
la faire naître sont établis hors d’un doute raisonnable, la question de savoir
si on doit en tirer une conclusion de culpabilité est une question de droit
seulement.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario1 allowing an appeal by the Crown from an acquittal.
Appeal allowed in part, Judson, Spence and Pigeon JJ. dissenting.

George D. Finlayson, Q.C. and Burton
Tait, for the appellant.

B.J. MacKinnon, Q.C. and R.B. Tuer, for
the respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright C.J. and of Fauteux,
Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] (Laskin
J.A. dissenting) whereby that Court allowed an appeal by the Crown from the
acquittal of the appellant on the 3rd and 4th counts of an indictment charging
attempted resale price maintenance contrary to s. 34(2) (b) of the Combines
Investigation Act, which reads as follows:

34. (2) No dealer shall directly or
indirectly by agreement, threat, promise or any other means whatsoever, require
or induce or attempt to require or induce any other person to resell an article
or commodity

(b) at a price not less than a
minimum price specified by the dealer or established by agreement.

[Page 225]

The indictment contains four counts, each
specifying offences contrary to s. 34(2) (b) and the evidence tendered
consisted in large measure of documents such as letters addressed to “all
dealers” in certain commodities, price lists distributed by the appellant to
various dealers, and interdepartmental correspondence between some of the
appellant company’s salesmen and the company’s head office.

The circumstances giving rise to these charges
were that the appellant had devised and was seeking to implement a plan which
it described as its “minimum profitable resale price plan” or “M.R.P.” plan.
This plan purported to be conceived in conformity with the provisions of s. 34(5)
of the Act which are generally accepted as having been enacted in order to
enable dealers to control the practice employed by some retailers of selling a
product or products at a loss in order to induce customers to patronize their
sales outlet for other products. Section 34(5) reads as follows:

(5) Where, in a prosecution under this
section, it is proved that the person charged refused or counselled the refusal
to sell or supply an article to any other person, no inference unfavourable to
the person charged shall be drawn from such evidence if he satisfies the court
that he and any one upon whose report he depended had reasonable cause to
believe and did believe

(a) that the other person was making
a practice of using articles supplied by the person charged as loss-leaders,
that is to say, not for the purpose of making a profit thereon but for purposes
of advertising;

(b) that the other person was making
a practice of using articles supplied by the person charged not for the purpose
of selling such articles at a profit but for the purpose of attracting
customers to his store in the hope of selling them other articles;

(c) that the other person was making
a practice of engaging in misleading advertising in respect of articles
supplied by the person charged; or

(d) that the other person made a
practice of not providing the level of servicing that purchasers of such
articles might reasonably expect from such other person.

There was ample evidence to show that in putting
its “M.R.P.” plan into effect, in purported compliance with this section, the
appellant had in fact violated s. 34(2) (b) of the Act in the cities of
Toronto and St. Catharines in the Province of Ontario in the manner
alleged in the 1st

[Page 226]

and 2nd counts of the indictment upon which it
was convicted, but the 3rd and 4th counts related to attempts- to induce
retailers in the City of Vancouver to comply with the plan in the same fashion and, as I have
indicated, the learned trial judge did not find that these charges had been
proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

The evidence has been extensively reviewed in
the judgment rendered by Mr. Justice Schroeder on behalf of the majority
of the Court of Appeal and I do not find it necessary to deal with it in any
detail because I am satisfied that the point to be determined on this appeal is
a very narrow one and turns on the question of whether or not the grounds of
appeal alleged before the Court of Appeal involved “a question of law alone” so
as to give that court jurisdiction under the provisions of s. 584(1)  of the Criminal
Code  which read as follows:

584. (1) The Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal

(a) against a judgment or verdict of
acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by indictment on any ground of appeal
that involves a question of law alone,…

In support of the allegations of attempted
inducement contained in the 3rd and 4th counts, the Crown produced
correspondence between two of the Company’s salesmen in Vancouver, (Schell and
Thompson) and the Company’s head office which described their dealings with the
Army and Navy Department Store Limited and ABC Television & Appliances
Limited respectively in furtherance of the Company’s “M.R.P.” plan.

As to the allegation respecting the Army and
Navy Department Store Limited, (count 3), the learned trial judge, after
reviewing the Schell correspondence and pointing out that the Company’s
representative at head office had written to say that he had never called on
this retailer during the whole time that he was in Vancouver, went on to say:

This would indicate that Army & Navy
was not a Sunbeam retailer and may not have received copies of Exhibits 4 and
5. While it would appear that the period of three weeks in which the calls were
made by Schell on Army & Navy Stores was within the period set out in the
count,

[Page 227]

such fact is not clear. The evidence as to
inducement on this count does not bear that quality of certainty that ought to
exist in the case of a criminal charge and it will therefore be dismissed.

In considering the 4th count, the learned trial
judge reviewed the evidence contained in the letter from Thompson to his head
office concerning ABC Television & Appliances Limited and concluded:

There is here neither sufficient evidence
of inducement on the part of the accused nor that the alleged offence took
place within the time charged. This charge must therefore be dismissed.

As the evidence on the 3rd and 4th charges was
almost entirely documentary, the judgment of the majority of the Court of
Appeal turns in some measure on the meaning to be attached to the provisions of
s. 41(2) of the Act which read as follows:

(2) In a prosecution under Part V,

(a) anything done, said or agreed
upon by an agent of a participant, shall prima facie be deemed to have
been done, said or agreed upon, as the case may be, with the authority of that
participant;

(b) a document written or received
by an agent of a participant shall prima facie be deemed to have been
written or received, as the case may be, with the authority of that
participant; and

(c) a document proved to have been
in the possession of a participant or on premises used or occupied by a
participant or in the possession of an agent of a participant shall be admitted
in evidence without further proof thereof and shall be prima facie evidence

(i) that the participant had knowledge of
the document and its contents,

(ii) that anything recorded in or by the
document as having been done, said or agreed upon by any participant or by an
agent of a participant was done, said or agreed upon as recorded and, where
anything is recorded in or by the document as having been done, said or agreed
upon by an agent of a participant, that it was done, said or agreed upon with
the authority of that participant,

(iii) that the document, where it appears
to have been written by any participant or by an agent of a participant, was so
written and, where it appears to have been written by an agent of a
participant, that it was written with the authority of that participant.

In the course of his reasons for judgment,
Mr. Justice Schroeder expressed the view that the Crown’s proof as to the
3rd and 4th counts was “sufficiently clear and cogent to support a
conviction on these charges” (the italics are

[Page 228]

my own) and that as no evidence was called on
behalf of the defence, the trial judge was not justified as a matter of law in
acquitting the accused. In reaching this conclusion, Mr. Justice Schroeder
cited, amongst other cases, the decision of this Court in Girvin v. The King[3] where Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J.C.,
speaking for the Court at page 169, said:

I have always understood the rule to be
that the Crown in a criminal case is not required to do more than produce
evidence which if unanswered and believed is sufficient to raise a prima
facie case upon which the jury might be justified in finding a verdict.

I do not think that any authority is needed for
the proposition that, when the Crown has proved a prima facie case and
no evidence is given on behalf of the accused, the jury may convict, but
I know of no authority to the effect that the trier of fact is required to
convict under such circumstances. The Girvin case was an appeal from the
verdict of a jury which had found that the Crown’s evidence established the
accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and it was held that there was
sufficient evidence to support that verdict. In the present case the learned
trial judge found that the case presented by the Crown did not establish the appellant’s
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and as I have indicated, the main question
raised by this appeal is whether that finding involved a question of law alone
so as to entitle the Attorney General to appeal to the Court of Appeal under
the provisions of s. 585(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code , or whether
it was a finding of fact or one of mixed fact and law.

In dealing with the evidence contained in the
letters from the appellant’s salesmen in which reference was made to their
conversations with the retailers named in counts 3 and 4 of the indictment,
Mr. Justice Schroeder, applying the provisions of s. 41(2), found that the
statements so made by the salesmen “constitute direct proof by way of
admissions of the attempts charged against the respondent in both counts” and
he went on to say:

That evidence is not only sufficient to
get the case past the judge to the jury, but there being no issue as to the weight
or credit to be given to

[Page 229]

it, it is sufficient to
counterbalance the general presumption of innocence and require affirmative
action by the court in convicting the accused where, as here, it is not
countered or controlled by evidence tending to contradict it or render it
improbable, or to prove facts inconsistent with it.

The italics are my own.

With the greatest respect I cannot agree with
Mr. Justice Schroeder that the provisions of s. 41(2) in any way preclude
a judge or jury from considering the weight to be attached to the
evidence contained in the letters in question in determining the issue of
whether the Crown has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

Section 4(2)(c) simply provides that
documents, such as these letters, which were in the possession of the accused
“shall be admitted in evidence without further proof thereof and shall be prima
facie evidence” that the accused had knowledge of the documents and their
contents and that anything recorded in them as having been done, said or agreed
upon by the accused or its agent, was done, said or agreed upon. This does not
mean that the trial judge, having accepted the letters as prima facie evidence
of their contents, is precluded from assessing the weight to be attached to
that evidence in considering the issue of the accused’s guilt or innocence.

Mr. Justice Schroeder, however, went on to
say:

Looking at the correspondence between these
two salesmen and the Assistant General Sales Manager of the respondent in the
light of all the evidence as to the formulation of its carefully conceived plan
and the various steps taken to put it into execution across the country, there
is no ground upon which their statements—in effect admissions—should be
disbelieved. In simply basing his dismissal of the charge against the accused
on counts 3 and 4 on the doctrine of reasonable doubt, the learned Judge failed
to direct his mind to the fact that the Crown had raised a prima facie case
against the accused which clearly afforded evidence of facts from which the
accused might have cleared itself, but which it did not even attempt to answer
or explain. In the absence of such explanation or contradiction the Crown’s
proof was confirmed and became sufficiently clear and cogent to support
a conviction. The learned Judge’s failure to direct himself upon this
well-settled principle was nondirection amounting to misdirection, and his
consequent non-observance of it constituted an error in law which afforded the
Crown a right of appeal against the acquittal.

The italics are my own.

[Page 230]

It appears to me that Mr. Justice
Schroeder’s reasoning in the last quoted paragraph is predicated on his finding
that the Crown’s proof was “sufficiently clear and cogent to support a
conviction”. This may well be so and if a judge or jury had convicted the
accused on the 3rd and 4th counts on the evidence tendered by the Crown, I
doubt very much whether such a conviction could have been set aside, but we are
not dealing with an appeal from a conviction; here the accused was acquitted by
the trial judge and the appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was an appeal
from that acquittal. While the reasoning employed by Mr. Justice Schroeder
would be sound in the case of an appeal from a conviction it is not, in my
respectful opinion, applicable to such an appeal as this.

In considering whether or not this appeal
“involves a question of law alone” I think that reference may usefully be had
to what was said by Rinfret J., speaking on behalf of this Court in Fraser
v. The King[4], where
he was considering the submission made on behalf of the accused that
circumstantial evidence adduced by the Crown was equally consistent with
innocence as with guilt, and he had occasion to say of that argument, at p.
301:

To a certain extent, this would assimilate
verdicts based on circumstantial evidence ‘as consistent with the innocence as
with the guilt of the accused’ to verdicts where it is claimed that there is no
evidence at all to support them, the view being that the court of appeal is
empowered to set aside those verdicts on the ground that they are
unsatisfactory, whether on account of a total lack of evidence or for want of
sufficient legal evidence to support them.

Let it be granted, however, that such a
question should be deemed a question of law, or of mixed law and fact, when
once it is established that the evidence is of such a character that the
inference of guilt of the accused might, and could, legally and properly be
drawn therefrom, the further question whether guilt ought to be inferred in the
premises is one of fact within the province of the jury…

I think that these observations have a direct
bearing on the present case and that, accepting the view of Mr. Justice
Schroeder that the evidence here was sufficient to support a conviction, the
further question of whether the guilt of the accused should be inferred from
that evidence, was one of fact within the province of the judge.

[Page 231]

The law applicable to the meaning to be placed
on s. 584(1)  (a) under the present circumstances is stated in the judgment of
this Court delivered by Taschereau J. in Rose v. The Queen[5], where he said at p. 443:

The trial judge sitting without a jury was
fulfilling a dual capacity. He had, therefore, to discharge the duties attached
to the function of a judge and also the duty of a jury. As a judge he had to
direct himself as to whether any facts had been established by evidence from
which criminal negligence may be reasonably inferred. As a jury he had to say
whether from these facts submitted, criminal negligence ought to be
inferred. Metropolitan Railway Company v. Jackson, 1877 3 A.C. 193 at 197, The King v.
Morabilo, 1949 S.C.R. 172 at 174. I think that the trial judge directed
himself properly and that when he decided on the facts submitted to him that
criminal negligence ought not to be injerred, he was fulfilling the
functions of a jury on a question of fact.

The italics are in the original judgment.

In the quotations which I have taken from the
judgment of the trial judge and of Mr. Justice Schroeder, I have
italicized the words “sufficient” and “sufficiently” wherever they occur, as it
appears to me that the fundamental difference between the trial judge and the
majority of the Court of Appeal was that the Court of Appeal was of opinion
that the evidence on the 3rd and 4th counts was sufficient to require a
verdict of guilty, whereas the trial judge did not consider it to be sufficient
to support such a verdict. It is well-settled that the sufficiency of
evidence is a question of fact and not a question of law and the law in this
regard is well stated by Trenholme J., speaking on behalf of the Quebec Court
of King’s Bench in Rex v. White[6], where
he said at p. 75:

We hold White had gone through his trial
legally and the question of sufficiency of the evidence to convict is a
question of fact for the judgment of the magistrate. A question of no evidence
is a question of law. But it is a question of sufficiency of evidence here; it
is not a question of law. Sufficiency of evidence, is always a matter for the
jury to decide, or the Judge in place of the jury, and the Judge is entitled to
say there is no evidence to go to the jury, but as to whether the evidence
brought before the jury-supports the condemnation or acquittal is for the jury
alone, and is a question of fact. Therefore, the question of the sufficiency of
the evidence in the case is a question of fact and not a question of law.

[Page 232]

The reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice
St. Jacques in Regina v. Boisjoly[7]
are to the same effect. He there said, at page 23:

Alors, le jury a rendu son verdict et a
déclaré le prévenu non coupable, et cela a été dit par chacun des jurés. Il y a
donc eu un verdict et c’est, en effet, ce verdict que la Couronne demande à la
Cour d’Appel de mettre de côté.

Comment cette Cour peut-elle le faire, à
moins de prendre connaissance de toute la preuve versée au dossier, afin de
déclarer, contrairement à l’opinion du juge et au verdict du jury, qu’il y
avait suffisamment de preuve pour rendre un autre verdict que celui qui a été
prononcé? Est-ce là un appel en droit uniquement? Assurément non, puisque la
Cour aurait à étudier les faits prouvés pour déduire une autre conclusion que
celle à laquelle le jury en est arrivé.

These cases were both followed in the Quebec
Court of Queen’s Bench in 1961 in the case of Regina v. Ferland[8], and it will be found that the courts of
the other Provinces have been uniform in their adoption of the views above
expressed. See for example, Rex v. Gross[9],
per Roach J.A., page 19; R. v. J.[10]
(Alberta); The King v. Toubret and Davis[11] (N.S.); Rex v. F.W. Woolworth Company[12] (B.C.), in which latter case the
respondent company was charged with discriminating against its employees
contrary to s. 4(2) (a) of the Industrial Conciliation Arbitration
Act, 1947 (B.C.), c. 44, and Chief Justice Sloan, speaking on behalf of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia, said, at page 176:

I am unable to see how we can say that the
learned judge below erred in finding that the Crown had failed to prove the
offence charged, unless we ourselves weigh the evidence and reach our own and
differing conclusions of fact thereon.

This, however, as a Crown appeal, is
limited to questions of law alone. It follows therefore that in my opinion we
have no jurisdiction to entertain it.

In the case of The Queen v. Warner[13], the Court of Appeal of Alberta had allowed an appeal from a conviction
of murder on the ground that the evidence at trial was not sufficient to
support it and this Court decided that

[Page 233]

that ground did not raise a question of law so
as to give it jurisdiction to hear a further appeal. In the course of the reasons
for judgment which he rendered on behalf of himself, Taschereau and Abbott J.,
Chief Justice Kerwin said, at page 147:

In my opinion there is no jurisdiction in
the Court to hear this appeal. The first two sentences of the reasons for
judgment of the Chief Justice of Alberta, speaking on behalf of the Appellate
Division, are as follows:

I am strongly of opinion that the verdict
of murder cannot be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go further,
and set out other reasons for setting aside the conviction.

I read the first sentence as meaning that
the Chief Justice considered that the evidence was not sufficient to support a
conviction,—which is a question of fact.

In the same case, the present Chief Justice,
with whom Taschereau and Abbott J. agreed, said, at page 149:

I do not find it necessary to consider the
several errors of law alleged by the appellant to have been made by the
Appellate Division as I think it is clear that the Appellate Division allowed
the appeal on two main grounds:

(1) that, in the opinion of the Appellate
Division, the verdict of guilty of murder should be set aside on the ground
that it could not be supported by the evidence, and

(2) that there had been errors in law in
the charge of the learned trial judge.

So far as the judgment of the Appellate
Division is based on the first ground mentioned, this Court is powerless to
interfere with it. The question whether the Appellate Division was right in
proceeding on this ground is not a question of law in the strict sense. It is a
question of fact or, at the best from the point of view of the appellant, a
mixed question of fact and law.

The effect of these observations, which
represent the view of the majority of the Court, is that the question of
whether or not the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction is a
question of fact.

Mr. Justice Schroeder, however, while
recognizing that there was nothing in the reasons for judgment of the learned
trial judge to “disclose ex facie what may be denoted as a positive
error of law…” went on to say:

It is not essential that a misconception of
law should appear on the face of the judgment or the reasons therefor if the
determination upon the evidence was such that, in the opinion of a reviewing
court, no person acting judicially and properly instructed as to the relevant
principles of law could have reached. If that is readily apparent, as I believe
it is here, then this Court is entitled to assume that some misconception of
law is responsible for the decision.

[Page 234]

It appears to me that Mr. Justice Schroeder
has cited an excerpt from the reasons delivered on behalf of this Court by
Anglin C.J., in Belyea and Weinraub v. The King[14] as some authority in support of this
proposition. That was a case in which the trial judge had acquitted the
appellants on charges of offences against the Combines Investigation Act,
R.S.C. 1927, c. 26, and of conspiracy contrary to the provisions of s. 498 
of the Criminal Code  and, holding that the error of the trial judge
raised a question of law, this Court affirmed the judgment of the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario which had reversed the acquittal on
the following grounds:

…the Appellate Division…s of the opinion
that the learned trial judge had misdirected himself, in that he held that,
although it was proven, if not admitted, that they (the appellants) ‘took an
active part in the original scheme,—the conspiracy which formed the basis for
the prosecution,…use (they) were not proved to have taken part in subsequent
overt acts,’ they should be acquitted,…

In my view that case is distinguishable from the
case at bar because the trial judge had there made a clear finding of fact
against the accused, (i.e., that they had participated in the formation
of the combine or agreement which was charged as a conspiracy) from which it
followed as a matter of law that they were guilty of the offence with which
they were charged. The trial judge did not appear to appreciate the fact that
the agreement was the essence of the offence and seems to have thought that in
order to find the accused guilty there had to be evidence from which he could
conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that they had participated in overt acts
done in furtherance of the agreement. This was a manifest error in law which
raised a question over which the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction. I cannot see
that any such question as was there decided arises in the present case because
here there was no finding of fact against the accused in respect of the 3rd and
4th counts which, as a matter of law, required the trial judge to convict.

In the present case the trial judge accepted the
evidence as contained in the letters above referred to and thus gave

[Page 235]

full effect to s. 41(2) of the Combines
Investigation Act, but he concluded that this evidence was not sufficient
to satisfy him beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused were guilty on the
3rd and 4th counts. However wrong the Court of Appeal or this Court may think
that he was in reaching this conclusion, I am of opinion, with all respect for
those who hold a different view, that this error cannot be determined without
passing judgment on the reasonableness of the verdict or the sufficiency of the
evidence, and in my view these are not matters over which the Court of Appeal
has jurisdiction under s. 584(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code .

Mr. Justice Schroeder, however, further
relies upon the case of Edwards (Inspector of Taxes) v. Bairstow[15] and he makes particular reference to the
reasons for judgment of Lord Radcliffe in that case. That was an appeal from a
decision of the Commissioners for the General Purpose of the Income Tax Act on
a case stated by them. The facts were not in dispute and the sole question was
whether a taxpayer’s profits arose out of an “adventure or concern in the nature
of trade” within the meaning of s. 237 of the English Income Tax Act,
1918.

In the course of his reasons for judgment, Lord
Radcliffe said, at page 33:

My Lords, I think that it is a question of
law what meaning is to be given to the words of the Income Tax Act ‘trade,
manufacture, adventure or concern in the nature of trade’ and for that matter
what constitute ‘profits or gains’ arising from it. Here we have a statutory
phrase involving a charge of tax, and it is for the courts to interpret its meaning,
having regard to the context in which it occurs and to the principles which
they bring to bear upon the meaning of income.

His Lordship then observed that:

…the law does not supply a precise
definition of the word ‘trade’:…

and went on to say:

In effect it lays down the limits within
which it would be permissible to say that a ‘trade’ as interpreted by
section 237 of the Act does or does not exist.

But the field so marked out is a wide one
and there are many combinations of circumstances in which it could not be said
to be wrong to arrive at a conclusion one way or the other. If the facts of any
particular case are fairly capable of being so described, it seems

[Page 236]

to me that it necessarily follows that the
determination of the Commissioners, Special or General, to the effect that a
trade does or does not exist is not ‘erroneous in point of law’; and, if a
determination cannot be shown to be erroneous in point of law, the statute does
not admit of its being upset by the court of appeal. I except the occasions
when the commissioners, although dealing with a set of facts which would
warrant a decision either way, show by some reason they give or statement they
make in the body of the case that they have misunderstood the law in some
relevant particular.

All these cases in which the facts warrant
a determination either way can be described as questions of degree and
therefore as questions of fact.

Lord Radcliffe was, however, of the opinion that
the agreed facts in the Bairstow case were consistent only with the
conclusion that the profit there in question “was the profit of an adventure in
the nature of trade”. In concluding his judgment, Lord Radcliffe made the
following general observation concerning appeals from income tax commissioners
at page 38:

As I see it, the reason why the courts do
not interfere with commissioners’ findings or determinations when they really
do involve nothing but questions of fact is not any supposed advantage in the
commissioners of greater experience in matters of business or any other
matters. The reason is simply that by the system that has been set up the
commissioners are the first tribunal to try an appeal, and in the interests of
the efficient administration of justice their decisions can only be upset on
appeal if they have been positively wrong in law. The court is not a second
opinion, where there is reasonable ground for the first. But there is no reason
to make a mystery about the subjects that commissioners deal with or to invite
the courts to impose any exceptional restraints upon themselves because they
are dealing with cases that arise out of facts found by commissioners. Their
duty is no more than to examine those facts with a decent respect for the
tribunal appealed from and if they think that the only reasonable conclusion on
the facts found is inconsistent with the determination come to, to say so
without more ado.

I am satisfied, after having read the reasons
for judgment of Lord Radcliffe, that the Bairstow case was one in which
the court was required to decide whether the facts found by the Commissioners
were such as to bring the taxpayer within the language employed in s. 237 of
the English Income Tax Act, 1918, and that the question of law upon
which the House of Lords decided that case was “what is the meaning to be given
to the words of the Income Tax Act of ‘trade, manufacture, adventure or
concern in the nature of trade’ “? I must say, with all respect, that that case
does not appear to me to afford any authority

[Page 237]

for the proposition that in an appeal against a
judgment of acquittal under s. 584(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code  “a
question of law alone” is involved whenever a reviewing court is of opinion
that the finding of the trial judge was unreasonable and improper having regard
to the evidence.

If the phrase “a question of law alone” as it
occurs in that section were to be so construed, then the result in my
opinion would be not only to extend the Attorney General’s right to appeal
under that section, but also to enlarge the meaning of the phrase “a question
of law” as it occurs in other sections of the Criminal Code  dealing
with appeals not only to the Court of Appeal but to this Court. In my opinion
such an interpretation could result in a broadening of the scope of appellate
jurisdiction under the Criminal Code  beyond the limitations which are
stipulated in the express language of the Code itself.

The provisions of s. 592(1) (a) of the
Code provide that:

592. (1) On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction, the court of appeal

(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the
opinion that

(i) the verdict should be set aside on the
ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.

(ii) the judgment of the trial court should
be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or

(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage
of justice;…

The italics are my own.

Parliament has thus conferred jurisdiction on
the Court of Appeal to allow an appeal against a conviction on three separate
grounds, one of which is the very ground upon which the Court of Appeal allowed
the present appeal, i.e., that “the verdict should be set aside on the ground
that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence”. The fact that
s. 592(1) (a) recognizes this ground as being separate and distinct from
“the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law” appears to me to be the
best kind of evidence of the fact that Parliament did not intend the phrase “a
question of law” as it is used in the Code to include the question of whether
the verdict at trial was unreasonable or could not be supported by the
evidence. It is noteworthy that having accorded the Court of Appeal

[Page 238]

jurisdiction to hear appeals against conviction
on the ground that the verdict was unreasonable, Parliament did not confer the
same jurisdiction on that Court in appeals by the Crown. No authority is needed
for the proposition that appellate jurisdiction must be expressly conferred and
with all respect for those who may hold a different view, I am of opinion that
the Court of Appeal has exceeded its jurisdiction by allowing this appeal on a
ground reserved for appeals against conviction which does not extend to appeals
by the Attorney General.

For all these reasons I would allow the
appellant’s appeal against the verdict of guilty on counts 3 and 4 of the
indictment which was substituted by the Court of Appeal for the verdict of
acquittal at trial on these counts and I would set aside the judgment of the
Court of Appeal in this regard.

The appellant has also appealed from that part
of the judgment of the Court of Appeal which varied the Order of Prohibition
made by the learned trial judge. As Mr. Justice Laskin has said:

The heart of the variation lies in
extending the prohibition to cover the commission of the like offence in
respect of any person other than the retailers particularly mentioned in the
counts on which convictions were made and to cover the use of any other means
by which, within the definition of the offence, it may be committed. In my
view, section 31 of the Combines Investigation Act is ample enough to
comprehend a prohibitory order in such terms.

I would not disturb the order of the Court of
Appeal in this regard.

In the result, I would allow the appellant’s
appeal in part.

The judgment of Judson, Spence and Pigeon JJ.
was delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting):—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[16]
delivered on March 31, 1967, whereby that Court in a majority judgment allowed
an appeal from the judgment of Grant J. delivered

[Page 239]

on March 18, 1966, by which he convicted the
accused (here appellant) on counts 1 and 2 in the indictment and acquitted the
accused (here appellant) on counts 3 and 4 in the said indictment.

From the acquittal on counts 3 and 4, the Crown
appealed to the Court of Appeal and the accused (here appellant) cross-appealed
from the conviction on counts 1 and 2.

At the hearing of the appeal before the Court of
Appeal for Ontario, the accused
abandoned its appeal against the conviction on counts 1 and 2. The Court of
Appeal for Ontario by reasons delivered by Schroeder J.A. and concurred in by
Porter C.J.O., F.G. MacKay and J.L. McLennan JJ.A., allowed the appeal of the
Crown and registered a conviction upon the said counts 3 and 4, and also
altered and extended the form of the order for prohibition which had been
granted by Grant J. after trial. Laskin J.A., dissenting, would have dismissed
the appeal by the Crown.

The accused corporation was charged as follows:

1. The Jurors for Her Majesty the Queen
present that Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited, a corporation having its
chief place of business at the City of Toronto, in the County of York and being
a dealer within the meaning of Section 34 of The Combines Investigation

by actions taking place partly in the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in
the County of York, in the Province of Ontario and culminating in the City of
St. Catharines, in the Province of Ontario, unlawfully did by agreement,
threat, promise or other means attempt to induce Cavers Brothers Limited,
sometimes known as Cavers Bros., of the said City of St. Catharines to
resell articles or commodities, to wit, electric shavers at prices not less
than the minimum prices specified therefor by said Sunbeam Corporation (Canada)
Limited and did thereby contravene the provisions of The Combines Investigation
Act, Section 34(2)(b).

2. The said Jurors further present that
Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited, a corporation having its chief place of

actions taking place partly in the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the
County of York, in the Province of Ontario and culminating in the City of
Vancouver, in the Province of British Columbia, unlawfully did by agreement,
threat, promise or other means attempt to induce Army & Navy Department
Store Limited, sometimes known as Army & Navy Stores, of the said City of
Vancouver to resell articles or commodities, to wit, electric fry pans at
prices not less than the minimum prices specified therefor by said Sunbeam
Corporation (Canada) Limited and did thereby contravene the provisions of The
Combines Investigation Act, Section 34(2) (b).

4. The said Jurors further present that
Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited, a corporation having its chief place of
business at the City of Toronto, in the County of York and being a dealer
within the meaning of Section 34 of The Combines Investigation Act,
between the 1st day of September, 1960 and the 31st day of December, 1960 by
actions taking place partly in the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the
County of York, in the Province of Ontario and culminating in the City of
Vancouver, in the Province of British Columbia, unlawfully did by agreement,
threat, promise or other means attempt to induce ABC Television &
Appliances Ltd., sometimes known as ABC T.V. to resell articles or commodities,
to wit, electric floor conditioners at prices not less than the minimum prices
specified therefor by said Sunbeam Corporation (Canada) Limited, and did
thereby contravene the provisions of The Combines Investigation Act,
Section 34(2) (b).

At trial, before Grant J. sitting without a
jury, as directed by s. 40(3) of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 314, the Crown’s case was put simply by the production of the
admission of the accused given under the provisions of s. 562  of the Criminal
Code , and by producing and having filed as exhibits a very large number of
documents which had been seized by investigators in the premises of the accused
corporation in Toronto, Ontario, and which were submitted as proof under the
provisions of s. 41 of the said Combines Investigation Act, as amended.
Specified reference will be made to this section hereafter.

Section 34 of the said Combines
Investigation Act was amended in the year 1960 by c. 45 of the Statutes of
Canada for that year by the addition of subs. (5) thereto. This section, which
has been referred to from time to time as the “loss leader section”, was as
Schroeder J.A. points out in his reasons for judgment, enacted as a measure of
relief to a dealer who had refused to sell or supply or who had counselled the
refusal to supply of commodities contrary to s. 34(3) of the statute if he could
establish certain things.

[Page 241]

Almost immediately thereafter the accused
corporation evolved a scheme known as the Minimum Profitable Resale Price
Scheme, to which I shall refer hereafter as MPRP, and proceeded to put into
effect throughout Canada the
said MPRP scheme.

The representatives of the accused attended
meetings with retail dealers in many cities throughout Canada, forwarded, first
to their distributors and later to the retail dealers, literature outlining the
scheme making statements therein which statements proved relevant to the counts
in the indictment.

To summarize very briefly, the scheme was as
follows: The accused corporation was in the business of manufacturing and
selling a very large range of electrical appliances including such things as
electric razors, toasters, coffee percolators, floor polishers, and many
others. The accused corporation sold directly to a very limited number of large
retailers such as the T. Eaton Company Limited, the Robert Simpson Company
Limited, the Hudson Bay Company and some few others. The remainder of its sales
was made by the accused corporation to distributors throughout Canada and those distributors in turn sold
the products to retail dealers who again resold to the consuming public. The
accused corporation purported, through its long experience in the marketing of
electrical appliances, to know the average gross profit which a distributor
needed in order to carry on its business profitably and also the average gross
profit which a retail dealer, in turn, needed to carry on its own business
profitably. The accused corporation having fixed its selling price on each of
the appliances to the distributors calculated the gross profit which in its
opinion any distributor should obtain on the sale of such appliances to a
retail dealer and thereby to use its own words, “establish the distributors’
price”. Then again it calculated the gross profit which a retail dealer should
obtain upon its cost on the purchase of an appliance from the distributor and
established what it calls the Minimum Profitable Resale Price, i.e., the MPRP.
The circular which was forwarded to all the distributors and with which was

[Page 242]

enclosed a schedule showing the various
appliances and in successive columns the distributors’ net price, the suggested
dealers’ price (i.e., the price from distributor to dealer), the Minimum
Profitable Resale Price (i.e., the price from dealer to consumer), the fair
retail value and sales tax allowance, concluded with a paragraph:

hereafter if we find that sales are being
made at prices less than those suggested above, we shall give consideration as
to whether such sales are loss leader sales and assess our position as it
relates to the marketing of our products.

Similarly, the circular to retail dealers in
which was included a price list containing in columns the suggested dealer
price, the minimum profitable resale price (MPRP), and fair retail value,
contained these two paragraphs:

It is our opinion that a person loss-leads
our products when he sells them at a gross margin less than his average cost of
doing business plus a reasonable profit.

We have drawn conclusions from evidence
available as to the operating costs of a variety of dealers who sell appliances
and are efficiently organized to merchandise effectively and provide reasonable
service. These conclusions are set forth specifically in the column headed
“Minimum Profitable Resale Price” in our new Dealer Price Sheet enclosed,
effective September 15, 1960. The offering of our products below these prices
will be investigated as cases of loss-leading. It is our intention to withhold
supply, from persons who make a practice

—of loss leading our products…

It was the contention of counsel for the accused
corporation throughout that this MPRP scheme was only intended as notice that
distributors and dealers advertising for sale and selling at less than that
MPRP price would be investigated as possible examples of loss leading and that
if after investigation such loss leading were established then supply could be
cut off from the offending dealer.

The Crown showed as to the first two counts
involving Cavers Brothers Limited of St. Catharines, and the New Era Home Appliances Limited of Toronto, that in fact the said corporation
had attempted to induce the dealer to sell the article at not less than a
specified minimum price. The learned trial judge therefore convicted the
accused corporation on those counts which were, it should be noted, counts of
breach of s. 34(2) (b) of the Combines Investigation Act, which
provides:

[Page 243]

34. (2) No dealer shall directly or
indirectly by agreement, threat, promise or any other means whatsoever, require
or induce or attempt to require or induce any other person to resell an article
or commodity

(b) at a price not less than a
minimum price specified by the dealer or established by agreement.

Count 3 in the indictment laid exactly the same
charge against the accused corporation as to the Army and Navy Stores of the
City of Vancouver, and count 4
of the said indictment again laid the same charge against the accused
corporation as to ABC Television and Appliances Limited, also of the City of Vancouver. It should be noted that the
charge was of an attempt to induce the specified dealer to resell appliances at
not less than the specified minimum price. The same evidence as to those two
counts as had been relevant to counts 1 and 2, was adduced, i.e., the circular
letter to the distributor with its attached price list and the circular letter
to the dealer with its attached price list. I have already referred to these
documents.

There was in addition as to count 3, the count
in reference to the Army and Navy Stores, a letter from one A. R. D. Schell, an
employee of the accused corporation in British Columbia, to one J. C. Hall, an officer in the head office of the
corporation in Toronto, dated
October 9, 1960, which I quote in full:

Dear Joe:

Army & Navy Stores, Vancouver, have
been stocking some of our items and selling them at very low prices. For
instance, they have the S 5 iron on at $14.49, FPM—$15.95 FPL $19.49 and a few
other items.

I have called on Mr. Ludwig who is
in charge of this department and presented our resale pricing programme to him.
Each time I called, he would agree to bring the prices up to the minimum, but when
I went back, they were exactly the same. This has now been going on for three
weeks, in which time I have called on Mr. Ludwig five times.

As yet I have had no complaints from any
Account on this matter, but I feel should we let it go, it just might start
something. He has been giving G.E. the same run around.

They have been buying their Sunbeam and
G.E. from Mc. & Mc.

Joe, these are the details, and am passing
them on to you for your advice.

                                                                                                                           R.
D. Schell.

(The underlining is my own.)

[Page 244]

The learned trial judge pointed out that that
letter had been replied to by one from Mr. J. C. Hall to R. D. Schell,
dated October 14, 1960, which
read, in part:

I would suggest, Dick, that seeing you are
going in and calling on this Mr. Ludwig that you continue to do so
endeavouring to obtain his co-operation by pointing out that no one will be
selling any less than he is and doing your best to get him to come up to our
prices on this basis.

The trial judge pointed out that there is no
evidence that Schell ever made any further calls on Ludwig or in any way
thereafter attempted to carry out Hall’s suggestion or passed on any of the
contents of Hall’s letter to Ludwig, and. the learned trial judge then
concluded:

The evidence as to inducement on this count
does not bear that quality of certainty that ought to exist in the case of a
criminal charge and it will therefore be dismissed.

It must be remembered that the evidence at trial
as I have pointed out consisted so far as the Crown’s case was concerned of the
admissions and of the production of all of these documents. Counsel for the
accused corporation called two witnesses neither of whom in his evidence dealt
with the two letters of October 9 and of October 14, 1960, to which I have just
referred.

Section 41 of the Combines Investigation
Act provides:

41. (1) In this section,

(a) “agent of a participant” means a
person who by a document admitted in evidence under this section appears
to be or is otherwise proven to be an officer, agent, servant, employee or
representative of a participant,

(b) “document” includes any document
appearing to be a carbon, photographic or other copy of a document, and

(c) “participant” means any accused
and any person who, although not accused, is alleged in the charge or
indictment to have been a co-conspirator or otherwise party or privy to the
offence charged.

(2) In a prosecution under Part V,

(a) anything done, said or agreed
upon by an agent of a participant shall prima facie be deemed to have
been done, said or agreed upon, as the case may be, with the authority of that
participant;

(b) a document written or received
by an agent of a participant shall prima facie be deemed to have been
written or received, as the case may be, with the authority of that
participant; and

(c) a document proved to have been
in the possession of a participant or on premises used or occupied by a
participant or in the possession of an agent of a participant shall be admitted
in evidence without further proof thereof and shall be prima facie evidence

[Page 245]

(i) that the participant had knowledge of
the document and its contents,

(ii) that anything recorded in or by the
document as having been done, said or agreed upon by any participant or by an
agent of a participant was done, said or agreed upon as recorded and, where
anything is recorded in or by the document as having been done, said or agreed
upon with the authority of that participant,

(iii) that the document, where it appears
to have been written by any participant or by an agent of a participant, was so
written and, where it appears to have been written by an agent of a
participant, that it was written with the authority of that participant.

Therefore, by virtue of s. 41(2) (c), the
documents, i.e., those two letters of the 9th and 14th of October 1960,
having been proved to be in the possession of the accused or on its premises,
were prima facie evidence (1) that the accused had knowledge of the
documents and their contents, and (2) that anything recorded therein as having
been done was done and was done by the agent with the authority of the accused.
Therefore, the only evidence before the learned trial judge as to count 3 was
the evidence that the agent Schell with the authority of the accused, had on
five occasions in the three weeks prior to October 9, 1960, called on
Mr. Ludwig in the Army and Navy Stores in Vancouver and presented to him a
resale pricing programme and that on each of those occasions Ludwig “would
agree to bring the prices up to the minimum”. Under those circumstances, it
matters not whether Mr. Ludwig or the Army and Navy Stores had ever
received a copy of the circular to dealers to which I have referred above, or
had any previous knowledge of the MPRP programme, the plain statement in the
letter reporting is that on five different occasions Schell had attempted to
have Ludwig agree to increase his prices to a specified minimum price.

There can be no doubt as to the occasions having
been within the time specified in the indictment and that therefore the attempt
in count 3 was between September 1, 1960, and December 31, 1960. The letter
reporting was dated October 9, 1960, and it speaks of actions within the previous three weeks, i.e.,
commencing some time after September 1, 1960. In fact, the letters to
distributors had only gone out on September 14, 1960, and the report by the
head office

[Page 246]

of the accused corporation in Toronto to the U.S. head office in Chicago, Illinois, outlining the MPRP scheme which was produced at trial as
an exhibit was only forwarded on September 14,
 1960.

As I have already pointed out, this was the only
evidence before the learned trial judge. Reasonable doubt must be based upon
evidence adduced at the trial and there was, therefore, no basis upon which
reasonable doubt that the accused had committed the offence as charged in the
indictment could arise.

In prosecuting on the 4th count, i.e., that
dealing with ABC Television, the Crown relied on the said circulars to
distributors and dealers to which reference has been made above, and also on a
letter from one Bill Thompson, an agent of the accused corporation in
Vancouver, to Mr. J. C. Hall, dated September 20, 1960, the third
paragraph of which read:

I have been checking with dealers, and not
one of the dealers I have contacted have received the letter from Sunbeam that
I understood was to be sent out the 15th. Has there been a change of plans?
Dick and I are trying to get prices set here, and without actual price sheets
it is a difficult job. As far as my Floor Care Div dealers go, the only dealer
that is cutting our polishers at present (that I know about) is Collin Ryan of
A.B.C. TV. I talked to Collin today, but he wouldn’t assure me of raising and I
hesitate to do anything until the before-mentioned letters and price sheets are
here.

Mr. Hall replied to that letter by his of
September 29, 1960. The third paragraph of that letter reads as follows:

I can imagine that Collin Ryan of A.B.C.
Television is causing you a problem. I have had similar ones with him in the
past, Bill, but after a lot of hard talking I have managed to persuade him to
come up to the price that I wanted him to do so. I can only suggest first
that you try every means you can to get him to raise his prices to our minimum
profitable resale prices, then if he absolutely refuses and if he runs any ads,
let us have them and we will take action immediately. I would like you to
keep me posted on this or any other discrepancies there may be with other
dealers in the British Columbia
area.

(The underlining is my own.)

The learned trial judge in dealing with count 4
concluded:

There is no evidence that Thompson carried
out Hall’s instructions concerning Ryan except that the latter had put his
prices up after a

[Page 247]

long talk. There is.here neither sufficient
evidence of inducement on the part of the accused nor that the alleged offence
took place within the time charged. This charge must therefore be dismissed.

Therefore, the only evidence upon this count in
addition to the outline of the scheme as contained in the circulars to dealers
and distributors was Thompson’s report of September 20, in which he said “I
talked to Collin today but he wouldn’t assure me of raising and I hesitate to
do anything until the before mentioned letters and price sheets are here” and
his report of October 15 where he said Ryan had put his price up yesterday
“after quite a long talk”. Surely, this being the only evidence, it is the
plain statement by Thompson, the agent of the accused corporation, that he had
attempted, before the 20th of September, to induce Ryan to raise his sale price
to a specified minimum price and that he had again made an attempt, which was
successful, on October 13, 1960, there can be no other conclusion than that
none of the acts took place prior to the 1st of September 1960 as the scheme
only went into effect in the middle of that month and since the inducement and
successful inducement was reported on October 14, 1960, and that the acts took
place within the period charged. Again I point out that the charge was a charge
of attempting to induce and these letters amount to an admission of an attempt
to induce a dealer to sell at not less than a specified minimum. That such
minimum was the MPRP price is shown clearly by Mr. Hall’s letter to Bill
Thompson dated September 29, 1960 which I have quoted. Since a reasonable doubt must be based on
evidence and there was no evidence which could give rise to any such reasonable
doubt to rebut the presumption created by s. 41 of the Combines
Investigation Act, there was no course but to convict the accused.

The problem arises as to the jurisdiction of the
Court of Appeal to consider the appeal from the acquittal by the learned trial
judge. The appeal to the Court of Appeal was taken by virtue of s. 584  of the Criminal
Code  which provides:

584. (1) The Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal

[Page 248]

(a) against a judgment or verdict of
acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by indictment on any ground of
appeal that involves a question of law alone,…

(The underlining is my own.)

Counsel for the accused corporation took the
position before the Court of Appeal for Ontario and before this Court that the appeal of the Crown was not based on
a ground of law alone but at best was upon a ground of mixed law and fact and
upon such ground no appeal lay.

Schroeder J.A. in his reasons sets out the
grounds of law advanced by the Crown in, the Court of Appeal for Ontario as follows:

1. He erred in law in refusing to consider
the entire documentation as relevant to each count;

2. He erred in law in failing to give
effect to uncontradicted documentary evidence which had made out a prima facie
case under section 41 and which, not having been contradicted or explained
by the accused, became conclusive;

3. He erred in the effect which he gave to
the words “attempt to induce” as they are used in section 34(2)(b).

With respect, I agree with Schroeder J.A. that
it does not appear from the record that the learned trial judge erred in
refusing to consider the entire documentation as relevant to each count and
that ground, therefore, need not be considered further.

I turn next to ground 3 in the list above.
Laskin J.A. said in his reasons:

Counsel for the Crown did not press the
third ground because it did not involve a question of law alone on the basis on
which he proposed to argue it.

I am unable to understand this statement. It
would appear at any rate that counsel for the Crown held no such view before
this Court as in the first paragraph of the argument in the respondent’s factum
it is set out:

37. It is respectfully submitted that the
learned trial judge misdirected himself as to the meaning and effect of
Section 34(2) (b) of The Combines Investigation Act in considering
the evidence relating to inducement and thereby erred in law.

Schroeder J.A. in reference to the third ground
of appeal said:

The third ground of error assigned by
counsel is more serious, since in stating that the “evidence of inducement” in
counts 3 and 4 was

[Page 249]

inadequate to support a criminal charge,
the learned Judge either overlooked the fact that the charge was confined to
attempted inducement or disregarded the decision of this court in Regina v.
Moffatts Limited. (1957) O.R. 93, as stated at p. 106, . . .

With respect, I agree with Schroeder J.A.
Although the learned trial judge on the same page of his reasons said:

The substance of the third count is that
the accused within the same period of time by actions taken [sic] place partly
in Metropolitan Toronto, partly in the City of Vancouver, unlawfully by
agreement, threat, promise or other means attempted to induce Army and
Navy Department Stores to resell…

(The underlining is my own.)

when he concluded his consideration of the third
count, he said:

The evidence as to inducement on this
count does not bear that quality of certainty that ought to exist in the case
of a criminal charge and it will therefore be dismissed.

(The underlining is my own.)

The learned trial judge pointed out earlier in
his reasons what Estey J. said in, this court in Rex v. Quinton[17]:

This section requires that one to be
guilty of an attempt must intend to commit the completed offence and to have
done some act toward the accomplishment of that objective, that act must be
beyond preparation and go so far toward the commission of the completed offence
that but for some intervention he is prevented or desists from the completion
thereof. It is the existence of both the intent and the act in such a
relationship that the former may be regarded as the cause of the latter. The
intent unaccompanied by the act does not constitute a criminal offence.

In the present case, the charge in count 3 was
that the accused, here appellant, “…unlawfully did by agreement, threat,
promise or other means, attempt to induce Army and Navy Department Stores…to
resell articles or commodities. at prices not less than the minimum prices
specified…”

The intention to commit the completed offence is
quite clearly demonstrated by Mr. Hall’s letter to Mr. Schell dated
October 14, 1960, to which I have referred, when he states:

I would suggest, Dick, that seeing you are
going in and calling on this Mr. Ludwig that you continue to do so
endeavouring to obtain his

[Page 250]

co-operation by pointing out that no one
will be selling any less than he is and doing your best to get him to come up
to our prices on this basis.

(The underlining is my own.)

Again, in his general reporting letter dated September 13, 1960, to Mr. R.P. Gwinn, the
chief officer of the U.S. head
office, E.F. Bond, the vice-president of the appellant corporation said, in
part:

We have held and will hold distributor
meetings in all major marketing centres throughout Canada for the purpose of explaining our programme. Actually it is similar
to GE’s in that we will do the following two things:

(1) Establish maximum discounts allowed by
distributors for quantity purchases by dealers (5% on any assortment of 12)

(2) Establish minimum profitable
resale prices for dealers.

The second item is a clear statement of the
intent. The acts toward the accomplishment of the objective in the case of
count 3 were Schell’s five attendances upon Mr. Ludwig in an attempt to
obtain Ludwig’s agreement to sell only at the specified minimum prices. Whether
or not Schell was successful in such attempt is irrelevant. I accept the law as
outlined in Regina v. Moffatts Limited[18]
that it is not essential on an attempt-charge under s. 34(2) (b) of the Combines
Investigation Act to prove that the attempt was successful.

Similarly, when one deals with count 4 which was
that the appellant, “unlawfully, did by agreement, threat, promise or other
means attempt to induce…ABC Television and Appliances Ltd. to resell articles
or commodities…at prices not less than the minimum prices specified…”, one
finds the attempt specified in the Bond letter to Gwinn of September 13, 1960,
to which I have referred, and also in the paragraph I have quoted from the
letter of Bill Thompson to J.C. Hall dated September 20, 1960. The overt act
toward the accomplishment of the objective is set out in the same letter, i.e.,
the attendance upon Collin Ryan, and in the further report of October 15,

[Page 251]

1960 “Collin Ryan of ABC TV took his price up to
that figure yesterday after quite a long talk”. Again, in this case, both
elements necessary to prove an attempt to induce, which was the offence
charged, are proved conclusively in the documentation. There was no evidence
given to contradict them although Mr. Bond was called as a witness for the
defence. The prima facie case wrought by s. 41 (2) (c) of the Combines
Investigation Act being the only evidence upon the topic therefore becomes
the uncontradicted evidence and it was the duty of the learned trial judge upon
such uncontradicted evidence to register convictions. It was an error in law to
charge himself as, with respect, it would appear that the learned trial judge
had charged himself, that the Crown in order to support the charges had to
prove an inducing by agreement, threat or promise. “Other means” seems to have
been forgotten. In order to prove the offence charged all the Crown had to
prove was the intent to induce and an overt act toward the accomplishment of
that intent. As I have said the Crown in each of the counts proved these on
prima facie evidence which by lack of contradiction became conclusive evidence.

There is, therefore, in this ground 3 submitted
by the appellant an error in law sufficient to give the Court of Appeal
jurisdiction under the provisions of s. 584(1)  of the Criminal Code . It
will be realized that in coming to this conclusion I have in fact dealt with
the second ground of appeal in that I have stated that the prima facie evidence
wrought by the provisions of s. 41 of the Combines Investigation Act not
having been contradicted became conclusive. It has been objected by counsel
that such a view of the effect of s. 41  takes from the learned trial judge the
right and the duty to weigh all the evidence and to come to his conclusion upon
the whole case whether the Crown has proved the necessary ingredients of the
offence beyond a reasonable doubt.

I, of course, agree that the Court is always
under the duty of so weighing all the evidence in order to come to that
conclusion. The learned trial judge had already con-

[Page 252]

sidered in reference to counts 1 and 2 and in
his general outline of the MPRP scheme the establishment of the intent to
induce the dealers to resell at not less than the minimum specified prices and
before he could have registered a conviction on counts 1 and 2 had come to the
conclusion that such intent had been established beyond reasonable doubt. The
intent was exactly the same in the case of counts 3 and 4 as it had been in the
case of counts 1 and 2. If it were established beyond reasonable doubt as to
counts 1 and 2 it had been established also beyond reasonable doubt as to
counts 3 and 4.

The only evidence as to the overt act toward the
accomplishment of that end in the case of counts 3 and 4 is in the
correspondence to which I have referred. If the learned trial judge had weighed
that evidence upon the question as to whether it proved beyond reasonable doubt
that such overt act had taken place rather than upon the question of whether or
not there had been an inducing then he could not have failed to find such an
overt act proved beyond reasonable doubt as there was no evidence to weigh
contra. The faults which the learned trial judge cites as to this evidence were
faults as to its evidentiary value in proving beyond reasonable doubt the
inducing and not the overt act in a charge of attempting to induce.

In my view, my conclusion, therefore does not
infringe on the right and duty of a trial judge to weigh all the evidence in
order to determine whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable
doubt.

So in Girvin v. The King[19], as pointed out by Sohroeder J.A. in his
reasons for judgment, Fitzpatrick C.J. said at p. 169:

I have always understood the rule to be
that the Crown, in a criminal case is not required to do more than produce
evidence which, if unanswered, and believed, is sufficient to raise a prima
facie case upon which the jury might be justified in finding a verdict.

And in Belyea v. The King[20], the learned trial judge had found as a
fact upon the evidence and this Court was of

[Page 253]

the opinion that such was fully justified on the
evidence, that the accused took an active part in the original scheme—the
conspiracy which formed the basis of the prosecution—but acquitted him on the
ground that there was no evidence which connected him with any of the illegal
operations subsequent thereto. The Appellate Division was of the opinion that
the learned trial judge had misdirected himself in that he held that the latter
finding entitled the accused to an acquittal. This Court upheld the decision of
the Appellate Division finding that there was a ground of error in law which
entitled the Crown to appeal to the Appellate Division.

In that case as in the instant case, it must be
noted, the trial judge’s error in law was not expressly formulated in his
judgment. On the contrary he had, as here, expressed his erroneous conclusion
as resting on a question of fact:

In arriving at this conclusion I have in
mind the provisions of s. 69  of the Criminal Code , but, notwithstanding that
section, I cannot find upon the evidence that there was any
participation or complicity by O’Connor in the offences established in evidence
and therefore a verdict of not guilty must be found in this case.

(The underlining is my own.)

However, having quoted, among others, the above
passage, Anglin C.J.C. speaking for the Court had no difficulty in holding that
on the basis of the whole judgment and record, the acquittal was not actually
based on wrong findings of fact nor on an incorrect weighing of the evidence,
but on an unstated error of law that should be inferred. He said at p. 292:

Presumably on the ground that the purpose
of the organization was “professedly” (i.e., ostensibly) lawful, and that there
is not sufficient evidence that the appellants participated in, or were privy
to, the subsequent admittedly illegal acts of the Windsor group, the learned judge acquitted them.

And at p. 296:

Here, the learned trial judge apparently
had already found facts from which the conclusion was inevitable that there was
participation on the part of Belyea and Weinraub in the formation of the
illegal combine and the conspiracy, the existence of which he had already found
to be proven. On these findings, coupled with the admissions made by Belyea

[Page 254]

and Weinraub in their testimony, and the
documents of which they were proved to have had knowledge, their convictions,
as was held by the Appellate Division, were a necessary consequence.

Concerning the extent of the jurisdiction of
this Court in such a case, the Chief Justice said on the same page:

The right of appeal by the Attorney-General,
conferred by s. 1013(4) , Cr.C ., as enacted by c. 11, s. 28, of the Statutes of
Canada, 1930, is, no doubt, confined to “questions of law”. That implies, if it
means anything at all, that there can be no attack by him in the Appellate Divisional Court on the
correctness of any of the findings of fact. But we cannot regard that provision
as excluding the right of the Appellate Divisional Court, where a conclusion of
mixed law and fact, such as is the guilt or innocence of the accused, depends,
as it does here, upon the legal effect of certain findings of fact made by the
judge or the jury, as the case may be, to enquire into the soundness of that
conclusion, since we cannot regard it as anything else but a question of
law,—especially where, as here, it is a clear result of misdirection of himself
in law by the learned trial judge.

It is contended that even if the evidence is
found to be sufficient to support a conviction, the further question of whether
the guilt of the accused should be inferred from that evidence is a question of
fact and reference is made to Fraser v. The King[21] and Rose v. The Queen[22]. Those were cases in which facts necessary
to establish the guilt of the accused had to be inferred, in the first, from
circumstantial evidence, in the other, from other proven facts. In neither case
was there a statutory provision enacting that the proven facts would constitute
prima facie evidence of the other facts required to establish the guilt
of the accused and, therefore, the making or not making of an inference was not
a question of law alone although it might be unreasonable. However, when there
is, as in this case, a statutory presumption to be applied, once the facts
necessary to give rise to it are found by the trial judge to be established
beyond reasonable doubt, the question whether the inference should be made is
no longer anything but a question of law alone: the statute does not provide
that the facts to be inferred may be deemed to exist but that they shall
be. To say that such evidence does not bear the quality of certainty that
ought to exist

[Page 255]

in the case of a criminal charge is to ignore or
contradict the statute and is, therefore, an error in law and nothing else.

As against this, it is contended that the legal
presumption is not a presumption of guilt but a presumption of some facts and
that the trier of the facts has to weigh the evidence before reaching a final
conclusion.

In Rose v. The Queen, supra, Taschereau
J., as he then was, said at p. 443:

The trial judge sitting without a jury was
fulfilling a dual capacity. He had, therefore, to discharge the duties attached
to the functions of a judge, and also the duties of a jury. As a judge he had
to direct himself as to whether any facts had been established by evidence from
which criminal negligence may be reasonably inferred. As a jury he had to say
whether, from those facts submitted, criminal negligence ought to be
inferred. Metropolitan Railway Company v. Jackson, (1877), 3 App. Cas. 193 at 197, King
v. Morabito, [1949] S.C.R. 172 at 174. I think that the trial judge
directed himself properly, and that when he decided on the facts submitted to
him that criminal negligence ought not to be inferred, he was fulfilling
the functions of a jury on a question of fact.

However, in that case, the trial judge in coming
to his decision that the accused should have been acquitted was performing a
function of weighing the evidence. The charge was one of causing death by the
operation of a motor vehicle, and the evidence dealt with the conduct of the
accused in driving his automobile against a red traffic signal. The learned
trial judge found that the accused was not keeping a proper lookout but that
his speed was not above the normal at the intersection and reached the
conclusion that the accused had not seen the red light. The trial judge,
weighing those facts, came to the conclusion that they did not show the wanton
or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons required for
conviction of the offence charged. Therefore, the learned trial judge had
evidence one way and the other way to weigh and a conclusion to arrive at as a
result of that weighing whether such conduct showed the standard of negligence
required by the provisions of the Criminal Code . In the present case,
the learned trial judge had no such task of weighing. There was no evidence
contra; there was nothing which needed to be inferred

[Page 256]

beyond the inference required by the
section of the statute. There was a simple admission established as prima
facie evidence by the provisions of s. 41 of the Combines Investigation Act that
the accused through its agent had attempted to induce these persons to sell at
not less than the specified minimum price. I am, therefore, of the opinion that
the enunciation of the varying duties of the judge and jury as set out above
with which, with respect, I agree, do not apply in the present case to make the
learned trial judge’s acquittal of the accused a mere matter of fact.

With respect, I agree with the view expressed by
Evans J.A. in Regina v. Torrie[23] where
he said at p. 11:

I recognize that the onus of proof must
rest with the Crown to establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable
doubt, but I do not understand this proposition to mean that the Crown must
negative every possible conjecture, no matter how irrational or fanciful, which
might be consistent with the innocence of the accused.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal
and confirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario including its direction as to the amendments of the Order of
Prohibition issued by Grant J.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Motor vehicles—Negligence—Pedestrian struck
in crosswalk of traffic-controlled intersection—Failure of driver to give
right-of-way—Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 253, s. 128(9)(b),
(11)(a).

Trial—Questions to jury as to negligence of
parties—Usual order reversed—Effect thereof—Indication by trial judge that
ultimate negligence doctrine could be invoked—Jury misled.

Evidence—Witness identifying injured person
as woman seen running at intersection ten minutes before accident—Evidence
improperly admitted.

The female plaintiff was injured when she was
struck by an automobile owned and driven by the defendant while she was
crossing an intersection of a main arterial highway running north and
south and a road running east and west. The said intersection was a
controlled intersection within the meaning of s. 128 of the Motor-vehicle
Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 253. It was dark at the time of the accident
and the plaintiff was crossing to the west in a crosswalk. She was wearing a
long, light coloured winter coat. She testified that she looked to the north
and to the south, and seeing no vehicles approaching, started to cross. She
remembered taking a few steps but nothing more. She was rendered unconscious,
sustaining extremely serious injuries.

The defendant was travelling southward on the
west side of the highway. He said that he saw a form darting from his left to
his right in the crosswalk area and immediately applied his brakes. The
plaintiff was hit by the front of the car towards the left centre. She had
travelled westward some 55 feet in the crosswalk before she was struck. The
defendant knew of the crosswalk and that pedestrians might be expected to be
crossing the highway at this point. He had been travelling at about 50 m.p.h.
as he came southward, and as he approached the intersection took his foot
off the accelerator and poised it over the brake pedal.

At the trial of the plaintiffs’ action for
damages, the jury found that the accident was caused solely by the negligence
of the female plaintiff. The judgment dismissing the action was affirmed by the
Court of Appeal and the plaintiffs then appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial held limited to the question of
damages.

The first question put to the jury should
have been as to whether there was any negligence on the part of the defendant
which caused or contributed to the accident. If the jury found negligence on
the part

[Page 258]

of the defendant and gave particulars, the
next question would be whether there was any contributory negligence on the
part of the plaintiff which caused or contributed to the accident. The
reversing of this order had a serious effect upon the manner in which the trial
judge charged the jury and in the jury’s consideration of the whole question of
liability.

It was a serious error on the part of the
trial judge to indicate that the ultimate negligence doctrine could be invoked
in this case, and evidence given by the driver of another car to the effect
that some ten minutes before the accident he had seen a woman, whom he later
identified as the injured person, run out from a curb at the
intersection and then dart back was improperly admitted.

There was no evidence on which the jury could
find or infer that the female plaintiff left a curb or other place of safety or
that she walked or ran into the path of the defendant’s vehicle and,
accordingly, s. 169(2) of the Motor-vehicle Act did not apply.

The defendant had failed in his duty to (1)
keep a proper look-out; (2) to enter the intersection at such a speed that
he could slow down or stop, if necessary, before striking a pedestrian who was
lawfully in the pedestrian crosswalk; and (3) to yield right-of-way to the
pedestrian as he was required to do by s. 128(11)(a) of the Act.
There being no evidence upon which a finding could be made that the female
plaintiff started across the highway without looking to see if it was safe to
do so or that she did anything to jeopardize her own safety, she was entitled
to assume that the driver of the motor vehicle in question would obey the law
and yield right-of-way.

Jardine v. Northern Co-operative Timber
and Mill Association, [1945] 1 W.W.R. 533; Toronto
Railway Co. v. King, [1908] A.C. 260, applied.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia, rejecting an appeal from a judgment of Macdonald J. with
a jury, dismissing the appellants’ action for damages. Appeal allowed and new
trial ordered.

Thomas Braidwood and Robert Brewer, for
the plaintiffs, appellants.

R.E. Ostlund, for the defendant,
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

HALL J.:—This is an appeal from the Court of
Appeal of British Columbia which rejected an appeal from a judgment of
Macdonald J. with a jury, dismissing the appellants’ action for damages. The
appellants are husband and wife.

The female appellant was injured when she was
struck by an automobile owned and driven by the respondent while she was
crossing from east to west on the King George Highway near Vancouver at the
intersection of the highway with what is known as Kennedy Road (88th

[Page 259]

Avenue). King George Highway is a main arterial
highway. There are residential areas on either side. Provision for pedestrians
to cross was made at the intersection of Kennedy Road by a pedestrian
crosswalk on the south side of the intersection. This crosswalk was outlined by
lines painted on the pavement.

The situation at the intersection in
question was as shown on the following plan:



There was no safety island or curbed area in the
centre of the highway, only the painted lines as indicated.

[Page 260]

At or about 5:30 p.m. on December 16, 1963, the
female appellant, age 51, was on her way home from visiting her daughter who
lives in the area east of the King George Highway. She had to cross the highway
to reach her home which was on Kennedy Road west of the highway. On her way
home she purchased some loaves of bread and arrived at the south‑east
corner of the intersection of the highway and Kennedy Road where she
proceeded to cross to the west in the crosswalk shown on the plan. It was dark
at this time. She was wearing a long, light coloured winter coat and carrying
the bread in a paper bag. She testified that she looked to the north and to the
south, and seeing no vehicles approaching, started to cross. She remembers
taking a few steps but nothing more. She was rendered unconscious, sustaining
extremely serious injuries and she remained unconscious for several days.

The respondent was travelling southward on the
west side of the highway, and as he came towards the intersection in
question he was in the lane to the west of the left turn lane as shown on the
plan. He knew the intersection well and that there was a pedestrian
crosswalk on the south side of the intersection. It was the only pedestrian
crosswalk for a considerable distance north or south of the area. He had driven
over this intersection a great many times. He said he saw “this form
darting from my left to my right” in the crosswalk area and immediately applied
his brakes. Skid marks extending from 40 feet north of the crosswalk were
identified and traced to his car which came to rest some 91 feet south of the
crosswalk. The overall skid marks measured 141 feet. The skid marks north of
the crosswalk came in a straight line, showing that the car had not been turned
nor had it swerved either to right or to left. The respondent said that his car
struck this form or object at about the south side of the crosswalk at a point
some 8 to 10 feet into the lane for southbound traffic. It was only then that
he realized that it was a pedestrian that had been hit. His evidence as to this
was as follows: “Yes, I hit at this time an object. I understand later it was a
pedestrian, and I carried her on the hood of my car for some distance…” The
female appellant was hit by the front of the car towards the left centre. The
distance from the edge of the asphalt at the north side of the crosswalk

[Page 261]

was, as the plan shows, some 85 feet. This means
that the pedestrian had travelled westward at least 55 feet in the: cross-walk
before she was struck. The respondent also testified that when he first saw
her, she was running and that she moved about 8 or 9 feet from when he first
saw her until the car hit her. His testimony as to the impact was as follows:

Q. How many steps would you say you saw
this object move before you struck it?

A. I don’t believe I would even attempt
to—as soon as I saw this object I tried to avoid it.

Q. Did you continue to look at this object
or did you direct your attention to something else?

A. I tried to avoid it.

Q. I am asking you what you did with your
eyes, with your vision. Did you continue to look at this object or did you
direct—

A. You naturally look at it.

Q. You did continue to look at it until you
struck it?

A. Yes.

Q. And you cannot say how far you saw it
move or how many steps at any rate?

A. No.

Q. Can you say how far you saw it move in
terms of feet or yards?

A. Well, it was—I first saw it in through
my windshield running from my left to my right.

Q. Yes. How far did you see it?

A. Now, it hit the left front of my car.

Q. Or may we also put it this way, the left
front of your car hit the pedestrian?

A. Well, I say the pedestrian was running.

Q. Yes?

A. My car, we’ll put it this way, my car
came in contact or vice versa, we came in contact.

Q. How far did you see this object move,
can you say?

A. A very short distance from when I first
saw it.

On his examination for discovery he said:

175 Q. Now, what was she doing when you
first saw her?

A. Moving rapidly from my left to my right,
and I presume she was running.

The respondent said that he did not see the
pedestrian (object) sooner because the lighting conditions at the
intersection were bad; that the intermittent flashing amber light
suspended above the intersection as indicated on the plan caused a blind
area to the south which was the area which contained the crosswalk. He knew the
crosswalk was there and that pedestrians might be expected to be crossing

[Page 262]

the highway at this point. He had been
travelling at about 50 miles per hour as he came southward, and as he
approached the intersection took his foot off the accelerator and poised
it over the brake pedal. He estimates that his speed was reduced to about 45
miles per hour. However, it must be noted that the highway in question has a
slight downhill grade from north to south at this point which could negative
the effect of taking the foot off the accelerator. Other than the respondent,
no eye witness gave evidence as to the impact.

As the intersection in question was a
controlled intersection within the meaning of s. 128 of the Motor-vehicle
Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 253, the provisions of subss. 9(b) and 11(a)
apply. These read:

(9) When rapid intermittent flashes of red
light are exhibited at an intersection by a control signal,

(b) A pedestrian facing the
flashes of red light may proceed across the roadway within a marked or unmarked
crosswalk with caution.

(11) When rapid intermittent flashes of
yellow light are exhibited at an intersection by a traffic-control signal,

(a) The driver of a vehicle facing
the flashes of yellow light may cause the vehicle to enter the
intersection and proceed only with caution, but shall yield the right‑of‑way
to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk;

The learned trial judge put the following
questions to the jury and these questions were answered as shown:

THE CLERK: Number one, was the plaintiff
Rodojka Petijevich guilty of negligence which caused or contributed to the
cause of the accident? Yes. If so, what was her negligence? One, proceeded
without reasonable caution through crosswalk. Two, by running through
crosswalk. Three, did not employ an evasive action, such as stopping or
stepping back.

Two, was the defendant guilty of negligence
which caused or contributed to the cause of the accident? No. If so, what was
his negligence? None.

It will be observed that the usual order of
questions was reversed. The first question should have been as to whether there
was any negligence on the part of the defendant which caused or contributed to
the accident. This is the prime question. If the answer is “No” that ends the
matter. The foundation of the action are the allegations of negligence made
against the defendant. Then, if the jury finds

[Page 263]

negligence on the part of the defendant and
gives particulars, the next question would be whether there was any
contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff which caused or contributed
to the accident. This reversing of the order had, I think, a serious effect
upon the manner in which the learned trial judge charged the jury and in the
jury’s consideration of the whole question of liability.

Although a question involving ultimate
negligence was not put to the jury, the learned trial judge, in charging the
jury, indicated that the ultimate negligence doctrine could be invoked, and he
proceeded to tell the jury that they might, in effect, find that the female
appellant had had the last clear chance to avoid the accident. This was not a
case for the application of the ultimate negligence doctrine. It was a serious
error which, apart from everything else, must have misled the jury and which,
according to the record, caused the jury to ask questions which showed that
they did not correctly understand the law applicable to the case.

Evidence was tendered on behalf of the
respondent and received without objection from one Jack Melvin Shaw to the
effect that some minutes before the female appellant was struck he had been
driving westward on Kennedy Road intending to turn north on the King George
Highway. He had come to a stop before entering the highway as he was required
to do and he said that as he started up a woman ran out from the curb at the
north-east corner of the intersection and that when she saw his vehicle
was moving towards her, she darted back. He continued northward, picked up a
passenger and returned some 10 minutes later to the intersection, and seeing
that an accident had happened, stopped and said he identified the injured
person as the woman he had seen a few minutes before by recognizing the coat
she was wearing. That was his only item of identification. Now, regardless of
whether he was able to identify the woman or not, his evidence was not
admissible and its admission was, in my view, fatal to the verdict because not
only was the evidence improperly admitted, but in his charge to the jury the
learned trial judge said:

Then the defendant says to you that she
failed to take reasonable care for her own safety because she was running, and
points out to you

[Page 264]

that this is the evidence that the
defendant Law gave. The defendant says that you should infer from what happened
according to Mr. Shaw’s evidence, when he testified that he saw the female
plaintiff running from the northeast corner in a westerly direction, and from
evidence suggesting that she was late in getting home, that from these things
you should infer that she was running just before impact in this case.

Norris J.A., in his reasons for judgment in the
Court of Appeal, stated that in his opinion the evidence of Shaw was admissible
as part of the res gestae. I cannot agree. He also said that in any
event, even if the evidence was not admissible, no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice was occasioned thereby. With respect, I am of the view
that the admission of this evidence, coupled with the reference thereto in the
learned trial judge’s charge to the jury, was bound to have an adverse effect
on the appellants’ case with the jury.

In addition to quoting the relevant
subsections of s. 128 to the jury, the learned trial judge instructed
the jury that s. 169(2) of the Motor-vehicle Act of British
Columbia applied in the instant case and had to be considered. Section 169(2)
reads:

No pedestrian shall leave a curb or other
place of safety and walk or run into the path of a vehicle that is so close
that it is impracticable for the driver to yield the right-of-way.

There was no evidence on which the jury could
find or infer that the female appellant left a curb or other place of safety or
that she walked or ran into the path of respondent’s vehicle. She was more than
half way across the intersection when she was hit and was at least 55 feet
from the curb or east edge of the highway and had only two or three steps to go
before she would be clear of the path of respondent’s vehicle and out of harm’s
way. Accordingly, s. 169(2) was not applicable in the circumstances of
this case.

Section 128(11)(a) says that the driver
of a vehicle facing flashes of yellow (amber) light may cause his vehicle to
enter the intersection and proceed only with caution but shall yield
right‑of-way to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an
adjacent crosswalk. The female appellant was lawfully in the crosswalk and the
respondent was, accordingly, required to yield right-of-way to her. The reason
he gave for not doing so was because he did not see

[Page 265]

her soon enough and he did not see her sooner
because the lighting conditions at the intersection in question were such
that the crosswalk area was a blind area to him as he came from the north. His
duty in those circumstances was to enter the intersection at such a speed
and keeping such a look-out that if a pedestrian should be in the crosswalk he
would be able to yield the right-of-way to that pedestrian. There is nothing in
the evidence to justify any suggestion that the female appellant ran from the
east side of the highway because she says she started across walking slowly,
and the evidence as to her running comes at a time almost coincident with being
struck and perhaps she was making a last second effort to avoid being hit.

I have no doubt that the jury’s verdict cannot
stand. The next question is whether there should be a new trial on the question
of liability and damages or as to damages only. The Court of Appeal of British
Columbia has the power to give the judgment which the trial court could have
given: Rex v. Hess (No. 2)[1]. The
power of the Court is discussed by O’Halloran J.A. at pp. 597 and 598 and this
Court has the power to do the same. The principle to be applied in determining
whether there should be a new trial as to liability or as to damages only was
discussed by O’Halloran J.A. in Jardine v. Northern Co-operative Timber and
Mill Association[2], where
he says at p. 535:

Where as here the evidence is of such a
character that only one view can reasonably be taken of its effect, it is not a
case for a new trial, see McPhee v. E. & N. Ry. Co. (1913) 5 W.W.R.
926, 49 S.C.R. 43, Duff, J. at p. 55 (with whom Sir Charles Fitzpatrick,
C.J. and Brodeur, J. concurred) and also the decision of the old Full Court
(Hunter, C.J., Irving and Martin, JJ.) in Yorkshire Guar. & Securities
Corpn. v. Fullbrook & Innes (1902) 9 B.C.R. 270, but we ought now give
the judgment which the plain facts proven conclusively at the trial demanded,
and that is, judgment for the plaintiff-appellant as asked for in the statement
of claim, less the sum of $286.48, mentioned shortly; see also Paquin Ltd.
v. Beauclerk [1906] A.C. 148, 75 L.J.K.B. 395 (H.L.) and also Canada
Rice Mills Ltd. v. Union Marine and Gen. Insur. Co. (No. 1) [1941] 3 W.W.R.
401, [1941] A.C. 55, 110 L.J.P.C. 1, Lord Wright at 65.

In the instant case all the evidence that could have
any bearing on the liability of the respondent or on the contributory
negligence, if any, of the female appellant was before the Court. There is no
suggestion that anything new

[Page 266]

in the way of evidence would be forthcoming if
the question of liability were to be retried. Any verdict which would exonerate
the respondent from negligence in this case would, in my view, be perverse
because on the evidence of the respondent himself, it is incontrovertible he
failed in his duty to (1) keep a proper look-out; (2) to enter the
intersection at such a speed that he could slow down or stop, if
necessary, before striking a pedestrian who was lawfully in the pedestrian
crosswalk; and (3) to yield right-of-way to the pedestrian as he was required
to do by s. 128(11)(a) of the Motor-vehicle Act. On the
other hand, the only evidence lawfully before the Court regarding the
contributory negligence, if any, of the female appellant is that of the
respondent that as he saw her she was running or walking very fast and this
was, as he says, within “a very very short time” of the impact. There is no
evidence upon which any finding could be made that the female appellant started
across the highway in question without looking to see if it was safe to do so
or that she did anything to jeopardize her own safety once she had made a
substantial entry into that intersection. She was then entitled to assume that
the driver of a motor vehicle coming from the north would obey the law and
yield her right-of-way: Toronto Railway Co. v. King[3].

I would accordingly allow the appeal and direct
a new trial limited to the question of damages only. The appellants will have
judgment against the respondent for the damages so assessed. The appellants are
entitled to their costs in this Court and in both Courts below.

Appeal allowed and new trial ordered with costs.

Queen Respondent

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA,
APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Plea of guilty—Charge of non
capital murder—Accused represented by counsel—Whether Court should have
questioned the accused before accepting plea.

The appellant, who was a 22 year old Cree
Indian with a Grade II education, was charged with capital murder to which he
pleaded not guilty. The charge was subsequently reduced to non capital murder,
and in the presence of his counsel, the appellant pleaded guilty thereto and
was sentenced to life imprisonment. The Court of Appeal dismissed his
application for leave to withdraw that plea and affirmed the conviction on the
charge of non capital murder. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this
Court on the question as to whether the trial judge erred in law in accepting
the plea of guilty without making inquiry as to whether the appellant
understood the nature of the charge and the effect of such plea.

Held (Spence
J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Cartwright
C.J. and Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: When a plea of guilty is offered and
there is any reason to doubt that the accused understands what he is doing,
there is no doubt that the judge will make inquiry to ascertain whether he does
so; and the extent of the inquiry will vary with the seriousness of the charge
to which the accused is pleading. Failure to make due inquiry may well be a
ground on which the Court of Appeal will exercise its jurisdiction to allow the
plea of guilty to be withdrawn if it is made to appear that the accused did not
fully appreciate the nature of the charge or the effect of his plea or if the
matter is left in doubt. However, it cannot be said that where, as in the case
at bar, an accused is represented by counsel and tenders a plea of guilty to
non capital murder, the trial judge is bound as a matter of law to interrogate
the accused before accepting the plea.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: It is the duty in law of the trial tribunal to
satisfy itself that the accused understands the nature of the charge and the
effect of the plea before it is entitled to accept a plea of guilty. The trial
judge could not, in the circumstances of this case, in exercising his
discretion to accept the plea of guilty, rely only on the fact that the accused
was represented by counsel. In so doing, he could not satisfy himself that the
accused knew either the nature of the plea or the consequences thereof.

Droit criminel—Plaidoyer de
culpabilité—Accusation de meurtre non qualifié—Accusé représenté par un

plaidoyer.

[Page 182]

L’appelant, un Indien Cri âgé de 22 ans et
ayant une éducation allant jusqu’au grade II, a été accusé d’un meurtre
qualifié auquel il a plaidé non coupable. L’accusation a été subséquemment
réduite à celle de meurtre non qualifié, et en présence de son avocat,
l’appelant a plaidé coupable à cette accusation et a été condamné à
l’emprisonnement à vie. La Cour d’appel a rejeté sa demande pour obtenir la
permission de retirer ce plaidoyer et a confirmé la déclaration de culpabilité
sur l’accusation de meurtre non qualifié. L’appelant a obtenu la permission
d’appeler à cette Cour sur la question de savoir si le juge au procès a erré en
droit en acceptant le plaidoyer de culpabilité sans faire une enquête pour
déterminer si l’appelant comprenait la nature de l’accusation et l’effet d’un
tel plaidoyer.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté, le Juge Spence étant dissident.

Le Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges
Martland, Judson et Ritchie: Lorsqu’un plaidoyer de culpabilité est offert et
qu’il y a raison de douter que l’accusé comprend ce qu’il fait, il n’y a aucun
doute que le juge fera une enquête pour s’assurer qu’il comprend; et l’étendue
de cette enquête variera selon la gravité de l’accusation à laquelle l’accusé
plaide. Le défaut de faire l’enquête requise peut être un motif sur lequel la
Cour d’appel s’appuiera pour exercer la juridiction qu’elle possède de
permettre que le plaidoyer de culpabilité soit retiré s’il appert que l’accusé
n’a pas complètement apprécié la nature de l’accusation ou l’effet de son
plaidoyer ou si la chose est laissée dans le doute. Cependant, on ne peut pas
dire que lorsqu’un accusé est, comme dans le cas présent, représenté par un
avocat et offre un plaidoyer de culpabilité à une accusation de meurtre non
qualifié, le juge au procès est tenu en droit d’interroger l’accusé avant
d’accepter le plaidoyer.

Le Juge Spence, dissident: En droit,
le juge au procès doit s’assurer que l’accusé comprend la nature de l’accusation
et l’effet du plaidoyer avant qu’il lui soit permis d’accepter un plaidoyer de
culpabilité. Dans les circonstances de cette cause, le juge au procès ne
pouvait pas, dans l’exercise de sa discrétion d’accepter le plaidoyer de
culpabilité, s’appuyer uniquement sur le fait que l’accusé était représenté par
un avocat. En ce faisant, il ne pouvait pas s’assurer que l’accusé connaissait
la nature du plaidoyer ou ses conséquences.

[Page 183]

The judgment of Cartwright C.J and of Martland,
Judson and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—This appeal is brought,
pursuant to leave granted by this Court on October 17, 1968, from a judgment of
the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta pronounced on September
10, 1968, dismissing, without recorded reasons, the application of the
appellant for leave to withdraw his plea of guilty, granting leave to appeal
and dismissing the appellant’s appeal from his conviction on a charge of
non-capital murder.

Leave was granted to appeal on the following
question:

Did the learned trial judge err in law in
accepting the Appellant’s plea of guilty to non‑capital murder without
making inquiry to satisfy himself that the Appellant understood the nature of
the charge and the effect of such a plea?

It appears that the appellant was indicted on
the charge that on or about March 11, 1967, he unlawfully killed Robert George
Sidener, thereby committing capital murder. The indictment is dated September
5, 1967. The appellant appeared before Primrose J. on September 5, 1967, was
arraigned and pleaded not guilty and the case was remanded to October 30, 1967,
for the purpose of fixing a date for trial. The appellant appeared on October
30 before Greschuk J.; he appeared on January 2, 1968, before Primrose J.;
he appeared on January 15, 1968, before Manning J.; on each of these
occasions the case was further remanded for the purpose of fixing a date for
trial. The appellant appeared on February 26, 1968, before Greschuk J. and was
remanded to March 11, 1968, for trial. On March 11, 1968, he appeared before
O’Byrne J. and the notation on the back of the indictment as to what occurred
on that day is as follows:

The transcript of the proceedings on March 11,
1968, opens as follows:

MR. STAINTON: In this case, my Lord, might
the amendment which has been proposed and which has been written into the
indictment be granted so that the charge will read non-capital murder instead
of capital murder?

THE COURT: Yes, the amendment is granted.

MR. STAINTON: Might the accused be
rearraigned, my Lord?

THE COURT: Yes. Mr. Clerk:

THE CLERK OF THE COURT: Lawrence Willard
Brosseau, you stand charged that you on or about the 11th day of March, A.D.
1967, at or near Tulliby Lake in the Judicial District of Edmonton, did
unlawfully kill and slay Robert George Sidener, thereby committing non-capital
murder contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code . How say you to this
‘charge, do you plead guilty or not guilty?

THE ACCUSED: Not guilty.

THE CLERK OF THE COURT: Harken to your plea
as the Court doth record it, Lawrence Willard Brosseau, not guilty.

MR. MOUSSEAU: My Lord, if we may, would the
Court grant a five-minute adjournment?

THE COURT: Yes, we will adjourn for five
minutes.

The Court adjourned at 10.05 a.m. and reconvened
at 10.20 a.m., at which time Mr. Mousseau asked the Court to stand the
matter over to two o’clock in the afternoon, Mr. Stainton stated that he
had no objection, and the trial Judge adjourned the matter accordingly. The
transcript as to what occurred at 2 p.m. is as follows:

MR. MOUSSEAU: I might at this time, my
Lord, before Mr. Brosseau arrives, explain that whilst Mr. Brosseau
appears to have a sufficient command of the English language, I have on prior
occasions interviewed him with an interpreter, and when I spoke with
Mr. Brosseau earlier this morning he did indicate to me that he preferred
that the present proceedings be interpreted to him. Mr. Callihoo, who is
an ex-agent of the then Department of Indian Affairs, has agreed to do so, and
I would request of Your Lordship that he be sworn in order to perform his
function.

THE COURT: Very well.

PATRICK CALLIHOO, sworn in as English/Cree
interpreter.

THE COURT: It’s just a matter of reading
the charge again to the accused, Mr. Mousseau?

[Page 185] 

MR. MOUSSEAU: It is, yes, my Lord.

THE CLERK: Lawrence Willard Brosseau, you
stand charged that you on or about the 11th day of March, A.D. 1967, at or near
Tulliby Lake, in the Judicial District of Edmonton, did unlawfully kill and
slay Robert George Sidener, thereby committing non‑capital murder,
contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code . How say you to this charge, do
you plead guilty or not guilty?

THE ACCUSED: Guilty.

THE CLERK: Harken to your plea as the Court
doth record it, Lawrence Willard Brosseau, guilty.

Mr. Stainton then outlined the
circumstances of the killing to the trial Judge at some length. The trial Judge
then asked Mr. Mousseau if he wished to say anything and Mr. Mousseau
addressed the Court as follows:

MR. MOUSSEAU: Only to indicate to the Court
that the accused is describable only in terms of an absolute primitive. I don’t
pretend to have any particular understanding of his mind or of his intent. I
can point out to evidence given in the preliminary both by the wife of the
deceased as well as by Mr. Wendt, that there was absolutely no antagonism
or ill feeling between the accused and Mr. Sidener. I can point out also
the accused’s evidence to the effect that he drank what for him was a
substantial amount of beer. I can point out also the fact that whilst he did
give one profession or did make certain admissions to Mr. Nolin, as my
friend has pointed out, he gave a totally different reason for the commission
of the act when speaking to the police.

These factors, of course, in view of the
statutory penalty, do not involve this Court presently. However, this Court, to
the extent that it is a Court of law, is involved with the matter of justice
generally, and whilst I am not absolutely certain as to the Court’s powers with
respect to cases of like nature, I would ask of the Court that it recommend
that this matter be gone into by the Parole Board and that it may, upon
examination, prove to be one of the special cases that the enactment setting
out the Parole Board envisages. That is my submission, my Lord.

The transcript continues as follows:

THE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Mousseau.

Stand up, Mr. Brosseau. Section 206(2) 
of the Criminal Code  provides that a person guilty of non-capital murder shall
be sentenced to imprisonment for life. I have no discretion in the matter. I
sentence you to imprisonment for life. At the request of Mr. Mousseau a
report will be made to the Parole Board along the line suggested by him.

MR. MOUSSEAU: Thank you, my Lord.

THE COURT: That’s all, Mr. Stainton?

MR. STAINTON: Yes, my Lord.

THE COURT: Thank you.

(Court
adjourned at 3:01 p.m.)

[Page 186]

It will be observed that no inquiry was made by
the learned trial Judge either of the appellant or of his counsel as to whether
the appellant understood the charge and the consequences of his plea of guilty.

On March 18, 1968, the appellant gave a written
notice of appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta
stating that he wished to apply “for leave as required” and to appeal his
conviction and sentence on the following grounds:

(a) I wish to appeal my conviction
and sentence on the grounds that I only have a grade 2 education and my lawyer
told me that if I didn’t plead guilty to the charge that they would sentence me
to hang. When he told me this I was scared and pleaded guilty.

On August 26, 1968, the appellant swore an
affidavit stating that he is a Cree Indian, that he reached only grade 2 in
school and left school when he was fifteen years old, that he is now twenty-two
years old, that he was drunk at the time of the offence and did not know what
he did, that he was drunk when he gave a statement to the police, that he
understood that for capital murder he would be hanged but that non-capital
murder was not so serious, that his lawyer told him in February 1968 that he
might get five or seven or eight years but did not say on what charge he could
get this sentence, that, in March 1968, his lawyer told him that if he was
found guilty they would sentence him to be hanged, that he pleaded not guilty
in Court and the case was put over till two o’clock and that his lawyer told
him that if he was found guilty he could be sentenced to be hanged but that if
he pleaded guilty, he would get life imprisonment; that he pleaded guilty
because he was scared of being hanged, that when he pleaded guilty he did not
understand that the Judge had no choice but to impose a life sentence. He
concluded by saying that he did not believe he had killed Robert George Sidener
as he always got along well with him when he worked for him over six years and
that he had no grudge against him.

Mr. Mousseau, at the specific request of
counsel then acting for the appellant and with the written authorization of the
appellant, made an affidavit which appears to have beep sworn on September 12,
1968. (This would seem to be

[Page 187]

in error as the judgment of the Appellate
Division refers to the affidavit of Mr. Mousseau). In this affidavit,
Mr. Mousseau states that he arranged the delays in the case being brought
to trial in the expectation of a change in the legislation regarding capital
crimes, “that the amendments made the Criminal Code , and relevant to the
proceedings at bar, were not of a nature as would assist the Appellant”, that
subsequent to the enacting of the amendment aforesaid a tentative arrangement
was entered into between counsel for the Crown and himself, as a result of
which it was suggested that the charge should be reduced to non‑capital
murder.

The amendments referred to were doubtless those
contained in Statutes of Canada 1967-68, c. 15, and by virtue of
s. 3 of that Act, as the date of the killing of Sidener was March 11,
1967, and the indictment was dated September 5, 1967, prior to the date that
the amendments were brought into force, December 29, 1967, it is clear that had
the appellant been convicted on the indictment for capital murder the
imposition of a sentence of death would have been mandatory.

The affidavit continues as follows:

6. THAT subsequent to the above, I met with
my client on a number of occasions (the last of those meetings took place on
either of the 9th or the 10th days of March, A.D. 1968); we together
reviewed the facts of the matter; I discussed with him the nature of the charge
with which he was faced, as well as the consequences attendant upon a finding
of guilty thereon; I also indicated that, on the evidence, the charge might, at
trial, be reduced to one of either ‘non-capital murder’ or ‘manslaughter’—I
explained to him the nature of these charges as well as the consequences
attendant thereon; I recommended that, in my opinion, his interests would best
be served by his pleading guilty to a reduced charge of ‘non-capital murder’—I
indicated to him that the sentence in a case of this nature was dictated by the
Statute; that, notwithstanding, the Parole Regulations permitted review and
release upon his having served seven years of his sentence or, in the event
that special circumstances be shown to exist, at the Board’s discretion—I was
able, in this last regard, to assure him of the co-operation and assistance of
officials of the Native Friendship Centre as well as to indicate to him that I would
move that the Court, in its ‘Report’, recommend review in the light of the very
peculiar nature of his person and circumstances; MR. BROSSEAU indicated that he
would be guided by my recommendation.

7. On March 11th, A.D. 1968, MR. BROSSEAU
appeared before O’BYRNE, J., and. was re-arraigned on a charge of non-capital
murder he recorded a plea of “not guilty”; in view of the circumstances
surrounding the reduction of the charge as well as of my uncertainty as to
whether he was fully cognizant of that which he had done—I requested
adjournment of the matter to the afternoon.

[Page 188]

8. I then called upon P. CALIHOO, an
interpreter, and together with MR. CALIHOO, attended upon MR. BROSSEAU at the
R.C.M. Police cells; at that time, through the intermediary of MR. CALIHOO I
clearly indicated to MR. BROSSEAU that he was wholly at liberty to proceed to
trial and that, should he so desire, I would request a further adjournment of
the proceedings; I again reviewed the circumstances of the occurrence; explained
the consequences attendant upon a finding of “guilty” on each of the three
charges aforementioned; I reiterated my advice to the effect that his best
interests would be served by his pleading “guilty” to the reduced charge as it
presently stood; I requested that he indicate his desire and assured him that I
would do as he requested; at 2:00 o’clock that afternoon he again appeared
before The Honourable, Mr. Justice M.B. O’BYRNE, the charge was re-read to
him and translated into the Cree language by MR. CALIHOO—he recorded a plea of
“guilty” thereto.

9. THAT MR. BROSSEAU’S circumstances are
such that, in my opinion, notwithstanding the above, it may well be that he was
throughout incapable of understanding or appreciating the nature and
consequences of the plea instantly recorded; that his background is such that
he cannot be regarded other than as a true ‘primitive’.

There was also before the Appellate Division an
affidavit exhibiting a letter from an M.D., a psychiatric consultant,
concluding with the sentence:

Certainly he (the appellant) would not rate
higher than a Borderline I.Q.—that is, just above the Defective level.

and a psychological report of which the last
sentence reads:

It can be concluded that he is functioning
within the borderline group.

I have recited the evidence which was before the
Appellate Division at perhaps undue length. It was within the powers of that
Court, if it saw fit to do so, to make an order permitting the appellant to
withdraw his plea of guilty and directing a new trial but their decision not to
do so was one involving questions of fact or mixed fact and law, not a question
of law in the strict sense, unless it can be said that the question on which
leave to appeal to this Court was granted should be answered in the affirmative.

The question before us is whether the learned
trial Judge erred in law in accepting the plea of guilty without making inquiry
as to whether the appellant understood the nature of the charge and the effect
of such plea.

No doubt when a plea of guilty is offered and
there is any reason to doubt that the accused understands what he is doing, the
judge or magistrate will make inquiry to ascertain whether he does so and the
extent of the inquiry will vary with the seriousness of the charge to which the

[Page 189]

accused is pleading. An illustration of the care
exercised in a case where the accused pleaded guilty to murder at a time when
the imposition of the death sentence was obligatory, is furnished by the case
of Rex v. Bliss[1].

The extent of the duty of inquiry resting on a
judge or magistrate before whom a plea of guilty is offered is discussed in R.
v. Johnson and Creanza[2] and
in Rex v. Hand (No. 1)[3], both
decisions of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. In the second of these,
Bird J.A., as he then was, speaking for the Court said at page 389:

This Court in two recent cases has had
occasion to express the opinion that a plea of guilty ought not to be accepted
unless the Judge or Magistrate is sufficiently informed in open Court of the
facts upon which the accused pleads guilty, to provide assurance that the
accused understands the offence to which his plea relates: Cf. R. v.
Theriault (unreported) and R. v. Johnson & Creanza, (1945) 4
D.L.R. 75, 85 Can. C.C. 56. This course is more particularly essential where
the offence, as here, involves a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and
whipping.

In Rex v. Milina[4], the Court of Appeal for British Columbia
consisting of Sloan C.J.B.C. and O’Halloran, Robertson, Sidney Smith and Bird
JJ.A. again considered the cases above referred to. Sidney Smith J.A., with
whom Sloan C.J.B.C. and Robertson J.A. agreed, said at page 592, after
referring to the language used in the Hand case:

But however that may be, it is desirable to
state now quite plainly that in my opinion when an accused person pleads guilty
it is not the law that the magistrate must go into the facts in order to
satisfy himself that the accused is in fact guilty. If that were so there would
be an end at once to any efficacy in a plea of guilty.

What the quoted language does mean is that
upon a plea of guilty the magistrate should satisfy himself that the accused
knows exactly what he is doing when he so pleads, and knows and understands the
exact nature of the offence with which he is charged. And the accused must
plead guilty in “plain, unambiguous and unmistakable terms” (Rex v. Golatham
(1915) 84 L.J.K.B. 758, 112 L.T. 1048, per Lord Reading, C.J.). The cases
will be rare indeed in which a magistrate will feel himself obliged to make any
special inquiry when the accused, as here, is represented by counsel. The
circumstances which are contemplated by the expressions used in the above cases
are those in which the accused may be a foreigner, or illiterate, or the charge
is one of unusual complexity or of an unusually grave nature. Instances of
these are to be

[Page 190]

found in Crankshaw’s Criminal Code, 6th
ed., pp. 1062-3. The practice in England is to the same effect and is thus
stated in Kenny’s Outlines of Criminal Law, 15th ed., at p. 558:

If he confesses, i.e., ‘pleads guilty’, he
may be at once sentenced. But in certain cases, lest he should be confessing
under some misapprehension as to the law or even as to the facts of his case,
the Court often advises him to withdraw his plea of guilty, and so let the
matter be fully investigated.

This passage, in my view, furnishes a useful
guide to the practice which should be followed when a plea of guilty is offered
and there is reason to doubt that the accused understands what he is doing.
Failure to make due inquiry may well be a ground on which the Court of Appeal
will exercise its jurisdiction to allow the plea of guilty to be withdrawn if
it is made to appear that the accused did not fully appreciate the nature of
the charge or the effect of his plea or if the matter is left in doubt; but in
my opinion, it cannot be said that where, as in the case at bar, an accused is
represented by counsel and tenders a plea of guilty to non-capital murder, the
trial Judge before accepting it is bound, as a matter of law, to interrogate
the accused.

I have reached the conclusion that the question
on which leave to appeal was granted should be answered in the negative.

I would dismiss the appeal.

SPENCE J. (dissenting):—I have read the
reasons of the Chief Justice as set out herein. In those reasons, the facts are
set out with considerable clarity and detail and there is no need to repeat
them in these reasons. With respect, I am of the opinion that it is the duty in
law of the trial tribunal, whether it be magistrate or judge, to satisfy
himself that the appellant understands the nature of the charge and the effect
of the plea before he is entitled to accept a plea of guilty. I am in accord
with the analysis made by Sidney Smith J.A. in Regina v. Milina[5], when he said, referring to the language
used in Rex v. Hand (No. 1)[6]:

What the quoted passage does mean is that
upon a plea of guilty the magistrate should satisfy himself that the accused
knows exactly what he is doing when he so pleads, and knows and understands the
exact nature of the offence with which he is charged.

[Page 191]

I realize, as Avory J. said, in Vent v. The
Queen[7]:

It is only in a case where there is some
reason to doubt whether an accused person appreciates the nature of his
confession or the consequences resulting from it that a jury is empanelled to
try that issue.

I also agree with Smith J.A. when he pointed out
in Rex v. Milina, supra, that the cases will be rare indeed in which a
magistrate will feel himself obliged to make any special inquiry when the
accused, as here, is represented by counsel; but Smith J.A. pointed out that
one of those cases may well be where “the accused may be a foreigner or
illiterate or the charge is of unusual complexity or of an unusually grave
nature”. Certainly even the reduced charge of non-capital murder was a charge
of an unusually grave nature. Moreover, the accused man, a Cree Indian, was
certainly an illiterate, an illiterate who was described by counsel to the
learned trial judge as a “primitive”.

I am of the opinion that the present case is not
one in which the learned trial judge exercised his discretion. Perhaps, to put
it more accurately, if it is such a case then it is one in which the learned
trial judge failed to exercise his discretion in accordance with judicial
principles. It would appear that the judge, in exercising the discretion to
accept the plea of guilty, relied only on the fact that the accused was
represented, and apparently very adequately represented, by counsel. I am of
the respectful opinion that he could not, under the circumstances, so rely on
counsel for in doing so he could not satisfy himself that the accused
knew either the nature of the plea or the consequences thereof. Therefore, in
failing to so satisfy himself, the learned trial judge was wrong in law.

I would grant the appeal and direct a new trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA,
APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Rape—Complainant’s evidence
uncorroborated—Identity of accused—Misdirection as to burden of proof—Criminal
Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 134.

The complainant, a married woman, accepted an
offer of a ride home by a stranger, while waiting for a bus. Having refused to
have sexual intercourse, she was physically and sexually assaulted and then
forced from the stranger’s automobile. When interviewed in the hospital, she
described her attacker and the automobile. Some four months later, she
identified the appellant as her attacker. The appellant’s car was different
from the one described as the car which the attacker drove. The appellant did
not testify nor was any evidence called on his behalf. The evidence of the
complainant was uncorroborated. It appears from the record that the trial judge
was in some doubt that he had to apply s. 134 of the Criminal Code to
the question of identity as well as to the assault. The appellant’s conviction
was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted
on the question as to whether the trial judge, having regard to the terms of
s. 134, misdirected himself as to the burden of proof.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

Per Cartwright C.J. and Hall and Spence JJ.:
The trial judge had to instruct himself in accordance with s. 134 of the
Code not only as to the fact of the rape but also on the matter of identity.
The record discloses that either the judge concluded that corroboration was not
necessary on the question of identity, or he found that he could satisfy
himself beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant’s story (her
identification of the appellant) was true from the fact

[Page 214]

that the appellant offered no explanation or
contradiction. In either case, the judge was in error. The appellant’s failure
to deny the charge could not be corroboration under s. 134. A burden was
placed on the appellant which the law says does not exist.

Per Cartwright C.J. and Fauteux and Martland
JJ.: It was necessary for the trial judge, as a judge of the facts, to instruct
himself in accordance with s. 134 of the Criminal Code. There is,
in the judge’s reasons for judgment, the implication that he was finding the
appellant guilty not because he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
the complainant’s evidence was true, but partly because the appellant had not
gone into the witness box to deny what she had said. It was not enough, in
order to find guilt, to have evidence tending toward the appellant’s guilt. It
was necessary for the Court to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the
complainant’s evidence was true. There was not due compliance with the
requirements of s. 134 of the Code.

Droit criminel—Viol—Témoignage de la plaignante
non corroboré—Identité du prévenu—Directives erronées quant au fardeau de la
preuve—Code criminel, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 61, art. 134.

La plaignante, une femme mariée, a accepté alors
qu’elle attendait un autobus, l’offre faite par un étranger de la reconduire
chez elle en automobile. Ayant refusé d’avoir des rapports sexuels, elle a été
attaquée physiquement et sexuellement, et, après coup, elle a été forcée hors
de l’automobile de l’étranger. A l’hopital, elle a décrit son assaillant ainsi
que l’automobile. Quelque quatre mois plus tard, elle a identifié l’appelant
comme étant celui qui l’avait attaquée. L’automobile de l’appelant était
différente de celle qu’elle avait précédemment décrite. L’appelant n’a pas
témoigné et aucune preuve n’a été offerte en sa faveur. La preuve de la
plaignante n’était pas corroborée. Le dossier fait voir que le juge au procès
n’était pas certain que l’art. 134 du Code criminel s’appliquait à la
question d’identité aussi bien qu’à celle de l’assaut. La déclaration de
culpabilité a été confirmée par la Cour d’appel. L’appelant a obtenu la
permission d’appeler à cette Cour sur la question de savoir si le juge au
procès, vu les termes de l’art. 134, s’était donné des directives erronées quant
au fardeau de la preuve.

Arrêt: L’appel doit
être accueilli et un nouveau procès ordonné.

Le Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Hall et
Spence: Les directives que le juge au procès devait se donner devaient être
conformes à l’art. 134 du Code non seulement sur le fait du viol mais aussi sur
la question d’identité. Le dossier montre soit que le juge a conclu que la
corroboration n’était pas nécessaire sur la question d’identité, ou qu’il
pouvait se convaincre au delà d’un doute raisonnable que la version de la
plaignante (sur l’identification de l’appelant) était véridique du fait que
l’appelant n’a offert aucune explication ou contradiction. Dans l’un ou l’autre
cas, le juge a erré. Le défaut de l’appelant de nier l’accusation ne peut pas
être une corroboration sous l’art. 134. Un fardeau que la loi dit ne pas
exister a été placé sur les épaules de l’appelant.

Le Juge en Chef Cartwright et les Juges Fauteux
et Martland: Il était nécessaire que le juge au procès, comme juge des faits,
se donne des

[Page 215]

directives conformes à l’art. 134 du Code
criminel. Il est implicite dans les notes de jugement du juge qu’il
déclarait l’appelant coupable non pas parce qu’il était convaincu au delà d’un
doute raisonnable que la preuve de la plaignante était véridique, mais en
partie parce que l’appelant n’a pas témoigné pour réfuter ce qu’elle a dit.
Pour conclure à la culpabilité, il n’était pas suffisant d’avoir une preuve
tendant à la culpabilité de l’appelant. Il était nécessaire que la Cour soit
convaincue au delà d’un doute raisonnable que le témoignage de la plaignante
était véridique. Les conditions requises par l’art. 134 du Code n’ont pas été
suivies.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’Appel de
l’Alberta confirmant une déclaration de culpabilité pour viol. Appel accueilli.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta,
Appellate Division, affirming the appellant’s conviction for rape. Appeal
allowed.

Ian G. Scott, for the appellant.

Brian Crane, for the respondent.

Cartwright C.J. and Spence J. concurred with the
judgment delivered by

HALL J.:—The accused was charged with rape and
tried by Manning J. in the Supreme Court of Alberta without a jury. He was
convicted and sentenced to ten years in prison. An appeal to the Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta was dismissed. This appeal is by leave
on the following question of law:

Did the learned trial judge, having regard
to the terms of Section 134 of the Criminal Code, misdirect himself as to the
burden of proof?

On August 22, 1966, the complainant, a married
woman, Dorothy Rose Smith, spent the late evening in a beverage room in the
Royal Hotel at the City of Edmonton. After leaving the hotel at approximately
11:00 p.m. and while waiting for a bus, she was offered a ride homeward by a
stranger who was alone in an automobile. After some hesitation, she accepted
and got in the car. They had only driven a short distance when the driver
proposed intercourse which she refused. The automobile was then driven into a
laneway where the complainant was physically and sexually assaulted. The
assault was a vicious one, and having had intercourse the driver shoved the
complainant

[Page 216]

from the automobile and abandoned her in a
semi-nude and hysterical condition. The complainant ran to the nearest house and
was given assistance. The police were called and the complainant taken to
Misericordia Hospital. The complainant’s story of the attack was wholly
credible and the place where she had been attacked was identified by parts of
her clothing and effects which were found there. There is no question but that
a rape took place. This appeal is concerned solely with the question of the
identity of the appellant as the assailant.

As a new trial is being ordered, I will not
refer to the evidence except in general terms,

Mrs. Smith was interviewed in the hospital
by Detective Waite. She described her assailant as a man with blonde, bushy
hair, 5 feet 8 inches in height, 160 pounds, wearing dark pants and a white
shirt, who talked with an accent, German or Hungarian. She also described the
automobile as one she believed to be an older model Chrysler product, cream or
off-white in colour and very dirty.

On December 21, 1966 four months later,
Mrs. Smith purported to identify the appellant as the man who had attacked
her. Prior to the lineup, she was shown an automobile which she said she
identified as the one in which she had been attacked. This automobile which
belonged to the appellant was a 1957 Chevrolet, blue body with white top, very
dirty both inside and out.

The appellant did not testify nor was any
evidence called on his behalf. In his summation, counsel for the appellant drew
Manning J.’s attention to s. 134 of the Criminal Code which reads:

134. Notwithstanding anything in this Act
or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, where an accused is charged with
an offence under section 136, 137, subsection (1) or (2) of
section 138 or subsection (1) of section 141, the judge shall,
if the only evidence that implicates the accused is the evidence, given under
oath, of the female person in respect of whom the offence is alleged to have
been committed and that evidence is not corroborated in a material particular
by evidence that implicates the accused, instruct the jury that it is not safe
to find the accused guilty in the absence of such corroboration, but that they
are entitled to find the accused guilty if they are satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that her evidence is true.

Even though this was not a jury case, it is
beyond question that the learned trial judge had to instruct himself in
accordance with this section, not only as to the fact

[Page 217]

of the rape but also on the matter of identity: Regina
v. Ethier[1].
In Regina v. McMillan[2],
which was a case of an appeal from a magistrate who had convicted on a complainant’s
uncorroborated testimony, Kirby J. quashed the conviction. The headnote in the
case reads:

It was held that, in the absence of
any words by the magistrate indicating that he had directed himself as to the
danger of convicting in the absence of any corroboration of complainant’s
story, the appeal must be allowed and the conviction quashed. Such a direction
must be given, and must appear to have been given, no less in the case of a
judge sitting alone, than in the case of a judge sitting with a jury, not only
in cases of charges under the Criminal Code, 1953-54, ch. 51, but
in all judicial inquiries involving sexual offences;…

The same point was dealt with by the Privy
Council in Chiu Nang Hong v. Public Prosecutor[3], where Lord Donovan
said at p. 1285:

Their Lordships would add that even had
this been a case where the judge had in mind the risk of convicting without
corroboration, but nevertheless decided to do so because he was convinced of
the truth of the complainant’s evidence, nevertheless they do not think that
the conviction could have been left to stand. For in such a case a judge,
sitting alone, should, in their Lordship’s view, make it clear that he has the
risk in question in his mind, but nevertheless is convinced by the evidence,
even though uncorroborated, that the case against the accused is established
beyond any reasonable doubt. No particular form of words is necessary for this
purpose: What is necessary is that the judge’s mind upon the matter should be
clearly revealed.

It appears from the record that Manning J. was
in some doubt that he had to apply the provisions of s. 134 of the Criminal
Code to the question of identity as well as to the assault. This is made
manifest in the record where the following appears:

THE COURT: Mr. Buchanan, it is
dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence, dangerous to convict, does
this apply also to the question of corroboration, not corroboration, but as to
identity?

MR. BUCHANAN: Yes, it does My Lord, if I
may refer Your Lordship to the case of—

THE COURT: Where identity is not denied.

MR. BUCHANAN: Each issue must be
corroborated.

THE COURT: When the accused does not deny
identity?.

Having heard further submissions from counsel
for the appellant which concluded with, “however I do base my

[Page 218]

final argument on the question of identity sir.”
the learned; trial judge said: “I would like to think this over until two
o’clock. We will adjourn until that time.”

When Court reconvened at 2:00 o’clock, the
record is as follows:

THE COURT: Gentlemen, it seemed to me at
the conclusion of the evidence this morning and at the conclusion of the
arguments that I have heard from you two that I could not come to any other
conclusion than that the charge had been established, and this was after taking
into consideration the provisions of Section 134. However, as you know I wanted
to consider this over the noon adjournment, and having given it more careful
consideration I still feel that I should not come to any other conclusion than
that the charge has been established.

I particularly refer to this statement of
the law in Regina and Coffin, 1956 Supreme Court Reports at Page 228 in which
Mr. Justice Kellock has referred with approval to a statement of Lord
Tenterden in which Lord Tenterden said this:

“No person is to be required to explain or
contradict, until enough has been proved to warrant a reasonable and just
conclusion against him, in the absence of explanation or contradiction; but
when such proof has been given, and the nature of the case is such as to admit
of explanation or contradiction, if the conclusion to which the proof tends be
untrue, and the accused offers no explanation or contradiction; can human
reason do otherwise than adopt the conclusion to which the proof tends?”

And accordingly I find the accused guilty
of the offence with which he has been charged.

It seems clear that when Manning J. said in the
extract just quoted:

Gentlemen, it seemed to me at the
conclusion of the evidence this morning and at the conclusion of the arguments
that I have heard from you two that I could not come to any other conclusion
than that the charge had been established, and this was after taking into
consideration the provisions of Section 134.

he was referring to the assault aspect of the
case and not to the question of identity. Were it otherwise, there was no need
for him to give the matter further consideration and that becomes even clearer
when he found it necessary to consider the effect of appellant’s failure to
deny the charge.

I cannot but hold that in applying the statement
of Lord Tenterden as he did, and concluding with “And accordingly I find
the accused guilty of the offence with which he has been charged.” (Emphasis
added) the learned trial judge erred in law and misdirected himself as to the
bur-

[Page 219]

den of proof. It is manifest either that he
concluded that corroboration was not necessary on the question of identity or,
alternatively, that he found he could satisfy himself beyond a reasonable doubt
that the complainant’s story (her identification of the appellant) was true
from the fact that the appellant offered no explanation or contradiction. In
either case, he was in error.

Appellant’s failure to deny the charge could not
be corroboration under s. 134, and in imposing an onus on the appellant to
offer an explanation or contradiction he was placing a burden on him which the
law says does not exist.

I would, accordingly, allow the appeal, quash
the conviction and direct a new trial.

Cartwright C.J. and Fauteux J. concurred with
the judgment delivered by

MARTLAND J.:—The essential facts in this case
have been stated in the reasons of my brother Hall. I am in agreement with him
that this appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

My reasons for reaching this conclusion are
these. The offence with which the appellant was charged was under s, 136 of the
Criminal Code. Section 134 of the Code provides:

134. Notwithstanding anything in this Act
or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, where an accused is charged with
an offence under section 136, 137, subsection (1) or (2) of
section 138 or subsection (1) of section 141, the judge shall,
if the only evidence that implicates the accused is the evidence, given under
oath, of the female person in respect of whom the offence is alleged to have
been committed and that evidence is not corroborated in a material particular
by evidence that implicates the accused, instruct the jury that it is not safe
to find the accused guilty in the absence of such corroboration, but that they
are entitled to find the accused guilty if they are satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that her evidence is true.

As has been pointed out by my brother Hall,
although the trial in this case was by judge alone, it was necessary for the
learned trial judge, as a judge of the facts, to instruct himself in accordance
with this section.

The only evidence in this case which implicated
the appellant was that of the complainant. Her evidence, in that respect, was
not corroborated by any evidence which implicated the appellant.

[Page 220]

In these circumstances, while it was open to him
to find the appellant guilty of the offence charged, it was only proper for him
to do so if he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that her evidence was
true.

The learned trial judge, in stating his reasons
at the conclusion of the trial, had this to say:

Gentlemen, it seemed to me at the
conclusion of the evidence this morning and at the conclusion of the arguments
that I have heard from you two that I could not, come to any other conclusion than
that the charge had been established, and this was after taking into
consideration the provisions of Section 134. However, as you know I wanted to
consider this over the noon adjournment, and having given it more careful
consideration I still feel that. I should not come to any other conclusion than
that the charge has been established.

I particularly refer to this statement of
the law in Regina and Coffin, 1956 Supreme Court Reports at Page 228 in which
Mr. Justice Kellock has referred with approval to a statement of Lord
Tenterden in which Lord Tenterden said this:

“No person is to be required to explain or
contradict, until enough has been proved to warrant a reasonable and just
conclusion against him, in the absence of explanation or contradiction; but
when such proof has been given, and the nature of the case is such as to admit
of explanation or contradiction, if the conclusion to which , the proof tends
be untrue, and the accused offers no explanation or  contradiction; can human
reason do otherwise than adopt the conclusion to which the proof tends?”

And accordingly I find the accused guilty
of the offence with which he has been charged.

There is, to me, in this statement, the
implication that he was finding the appellant guilty not because he was satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant’s evidence was true, but partly
because the appellant had not gone into the witness box to deny what she had
said. The passage quoted from Lord Tenterden’s judgment in R. v. Burdett[4], as applied in the
circumstances of this case, meant that the learned trial judge, in a situation
where the appellant had offered no explanation or contradiction, felt that he
could not “do otherwise than adopt the conclusion to which the proof tends”
(the italics are my own).

In my view this reasoning is not satisfactory in
a case to which s. 134 applies. It was not enough, in order to find guilt,
to have evidence tending toward the appellant’s guilt, coupled with the absence
of any denial by him, It

[Page 221]

was necessary for the Court to be satisfied
beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant’s evidence was true.

As I am not satisfied that there was due
compliance with the requirements of s. 134, I feel the appeal should be
allowed and a new trial ordered.

Appeal allowed and new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Dangerous sexual
offender—Sentence of preventive detention—Evidence of psychiatrists—Whether
admissible—Whether rule of hearsay evidence offended—Whether rule of confession
evidence offended—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 61, ss. 659, 660, 661.

The appellant was found by the trial judge to
be a dangerous sexual offender and was sentenced to preventive detention. The
evidence relied on by the Crown showed that the accused had been twice
convicted of sexual offences against young girls, and included the opinion of
two psychiatrists, whose opinion rested, in part, on material found in prison
files and dealing with the accused’s background and also on the accused’s
admissions to the psychiatrists. The appellant submitted that since the
material in the prison files had not been proven in open Court and that the
admissions made to the psychiatrists had not been proven to have been made
voluntarily, both rules governing hearsay and confession evidence had been
offended, with the result that the evidence of the two psychiatrists was
inadmissible.

[Page 15]

The Court of Appeal affirmed the finding made
by the trial judge as well as the sentence of preventive detention. The
appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

As to the confession rule. The rule of
evidence governing the admissibility of statements made by a person charged
with an offence has no application in the case of statements made by a sexual
offender to psychiatrists conducting examinations in accordance with recognized
normal psychiatric procedures, in order to assist the Court in proceedings
under s. 661  of the Criminal Code . These proceedings do not involve
the conviction of an offence, but the determination of the sentence which may
be pronounced after conviction. The rule has not been established for
proceedings related to the determination of a sentence. Furthermore, the
position of the psychiatrists during the examination of an accused pursuant to
s. 661(2) of the Code is not that of persons in authority but is that of
free and independent medical experts.

As to the hearsay rule. In order to form an
opinion according to recognized normal psychiatric procedures, the psychiatrist
must consider all possible sources of information, including second-hand source
information, the reliability, accuracy and significance of which are within the
recognized scope of his professional activities, skill and training to
evaluate. In the present case, the evidence indicated that the information
gathered from the prison files was not considered by the two psychiatrists as
having any real significance in the formation of their opinion which was
grounded ultimately on the examinations of the appellant and on evidence given
at the hearing of the application. In any event, the trial judge found that the
relevant evidence before him, exclusive of that of the psychiatrists, was
conclusive, and this finding was upheld by the Court of Appeal.

Droit criminel—Délinquant sexuel
dangereux—Sentence de détention préventive—Témoignage de
psychiatres—Admissibilité—Règle concernant la preuve par ouï-dire a-t-elle été
violée—Règle concernant la preuve d’aveux a-t-elle été violée—Code criminel ,
1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 659, 660, 661.

La Cour de première instance a jugé que
l’appelant était un délinquant sexuel dangereux et l’a condamné à une sentence
de détention préventive. La preuve sur laquelle la Couronne s’est appuyée
montre que l’accusé, à deux occasions, avait été trouvé coupable d’offenses
sexuelles contre des fillettes, et comporte aussi l’opinion de deux psychiatres
reposant, en partie, sur des documents provenant des dossiers de prison et
portant sur les antécédents de l’appelant et aussi sur des aveux faits par
l’appelant aux psychiatres. L’appelant soutient que puisque les documents
provenant des dossiers de la prison n’avaient pas été prouvés en Cour et que
les aveux faits aux psychiatres n’avaient pas été prouvés avoir été faits
volontairement, les règles concernant la preuve par ouï-dire et la preuve par
aveux avaient toutes deux été violées, avec le résultat que le témoignage des
deux psychiatres n’était pas admissible. La Cour d’appel a confirmé le verdict
du juge au procès ainsi que la sentence de détention préventive. L’appelant a
obtenu permission d’en appeler devant cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté.

[Page 16]

En ce qui regarde la règle concernant les
aveux. La règle de preuve gouvernant l’admissibilité de déclarations faites par
une personne accusée d’une offense ne s’applique pas dans le cas de
déclarations faites par un délinquant sexuel aux psychiatres à l’occasion
d’examens que ces derniers lui font subir selon les procédures psychiatriques
normales et reconnues, en vue d’aider la Cour dans les procédures en vertu de
l’art. 661  du Code criminel . Ces procédures n’entraînent pas la
condamnation pour une offense, mais la détermination de la sentence qui doit
être prononcée après la condamnation. La règle n’a pas été établie pour des
procédures concernant la détermination d’une sentence. De plus, la position des
psychiatres durant l’examen d’un accusé en vertu de l’art. 661(2) du Code n’est
pas celle de personnes représentant l’autorité mais celle d’experts médicaux
libres et indépendants.

En ce qui regarde la règle concernant la
preuve par ouï-dire. Pour se former une opinion selon les procédures
psychiatriques normales et reconnues, le psychiatre doit prendre en
considération toute source possible d’information, y compris une source de seconde
main. Ses activités professionnelles, son art et son entraînement lui
permettent d’évaluer la véracité, l’exactitude et la signification de ces
informations. Dans le cas présent, la preuve indique que les deux psychiatres
n’ont pas considéré que les renseignements obtenus des dossiers de la prison
avaient contribué d’une façon significative à la formation de leur opinion qui,
en définitive, était basée sur l’examen de l’appelant et sur la preuve entendue
lors de l’audition de la demande en vertu de l’art. 661 du Code. A tout
événement, le juge au procès a été d’opinion que la preuve pertinente devant
lui, à l’exclusion de celle des psychiatres, était concluante, et cette opinion
a été partagée par la Cour d’appel.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’appel de la
Colombie-Britannique1, confirmant un verdict que l’appelant était un
délinquant sexuel dangereux. Appel rejeté.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[1],
affirming a finding that the appellant was a dangerous sexual offender. Appeal
dismissed.

T.G. Ison, for the appellant.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

FAUTEUX J.:—This is an appeal, brought by leave
from a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1,
affirming (i) a finding made by Munroe J., that the appellant is a dangerous
sexual offender and (ii) the sentence imposed upon him as a sequence.

[Page 17]

At the conclusion of the hearing before us, the
Court, indicating that reasons would be delivered later, dismissed the appeal.

The grounds of appeal which were raised, are
related to the evidence which, so far as relevant to the principal and, indeed,
only ground that needs to be dealt with, can be briefly stated. As indicated in
the reasons for judgment of the trial Judge, the evidence relied on by the
Crown at trial, shows that:—on November 26, 1960, the appellant was convicted
by a jury of an indecent assault committed the preceding month, upon a 12 year
old girl and was sentenced to 2 years’ imprisonment; on November 16, 1963, he
was convicted by a jury of having had sexual intercourse, in May of the same
year, again with a 12 year old girl, and was sentenced to 8 years’
imprisonment; the appellant, a stranger to the victim of the last mentioned attack,
forced her into his car and on the floor thereof, on the threat of killing her,
and drove her to a secluded area where, by force, he removed her clothing and
had sexual relations without her consent. The evidence relied on by the Crown
also includes the opinion of two experienced and well-qualified psychiatrists,
namely Dr. J.C. Thomas and Dr. R.C. Whitman. Both called by the
Crown, they testified, in chief, that, as a result of their personal and
separately conducted examination of the appellant at the B.C. Penitentiary and
of the evidence they heard at trial, they formed the opinion that the appellant
was a person who, by his conduct, in any sexual matter, has shown his failure
to control his sexual impulses, that he is likely to cause injury, pain or
other evil to any person through failure in the future to control his sexual
impulses, and that he is likely to commit further sexual offences. Counsel for
the appellant, having then asked for and obtained permission to cross-examine
the psychiatrists as to their conversations with the appellant, thereby
elicited that the latter had thought of killing the victim of the last
mentioned offence in order to destroy her evidence and that he had had similar,
though undetected, experiences with other young girls, his nieces. Appellant’s
counsel also elicited from the doctors that, for the purpose of obtaining
background information upon the appellant and his family, they had examined
prison files containing, amongst other material, a psychiatric report made earlier
by another psychiatrist, the results

[Page 18]

of a psychological test, a classification
report, an Alberta hospital report and that such material was taken into
account in reaching their conclusion which, in essence, however, was based on
their examination of the appellant and the evidence given at the hearing.

The appellant did not testify, nor was any
defence evidence called on his behalf.

Appellant’s counsel submitted, at trial, that
since the opinion of the psychiatrists rested, in part, on the above material
found in prison files and not proved in open court and also on appellant’s
admissions or confessions to the psychiatrists, not proved to have been made
voluntarily, both rules governing hearsay and confession evidence were offended
with the consequence that the evidence of the two doctors was not only
worthless but wholly inadmissible.

The trial Judge did not find it necessary to
decide whether the hearsay rule had been offended. He noted that
Dr. Thomas had stated that such reports were used to save time, were of no
significance and merely confirmed his own finding reached independently thereof
and that Dr. Whitman had testified that while such reports were helpful,
his opinion, based only on his interview with the appellant and the evidence he
had heard in court, would nevertheless be the same. Finally, the trial Judge
found that the relevant evidence before him, exclusive of that of the
psychiatrists, was conclusive.

The contention that there had been a breach of
the rule governing confession, was rejected. The trial Judge referred to Regina
v. Leggo[2] and
quoted the following part of a statement made by Norris J.A., at page 407:

…the psychiatrists were entitled to rely on
statements made by the appellant to them, in forming their opinions…

In the Court of Appeal[3], the appellant’s submission with respect to
the admissibility of the psychiatrists’ evidence was also, and unanimously,
rejected. The Court decided that there was no obligation for the Crown to prove
the voluntariness of the admissions or confessions made by the appellant to the
doctors, for the reason that the proceedings under s. 661  of the Criminal
Code  do not involve the conviction of a crime, but are held for the purpose
of

[Page 19]

deciding whether a sentence of preventive
detention should be substituted for the sentence pronounced on the substantive
offence.

The Court of Appeal, like the trial Judge, did
not find it necessary to decide whether the examination of the material found
in the prison files offended the hearsay rule. The Court was satisfied from the
evidence that this examination did not greatly influence either doctors who
based their opinion mainly on the examination of the appellant and the evidence
given at the hearing. Finally, the Court relied on the fact that the trial
Judge had expressly stated, in his reasons for judgment, that, exclusive of
such material, he would have reached the same view. Hence, the dismissal of the
appeal.

Dealing at first with the applicability of the
confession rule:—There are cogent reasons to hold, as did the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia, in this case, and the Courts of Appeal for Manitoba and
Alberta, respectively, in Regina v. Johnston[4] and Regina v. McKenzie[5], that the rule of evidence governing the
admissibility of statements made by a person charged with an offence has no
application in the case of statements made by a sexual offender to
psychiatrists conducting examinations in accordance with recognized normal
psychiatric procedures, in order to assist the Court in proceedings under
s. 661  of the Criminal Code .

One of the reasons flows from the very nature of
the issue involved in these proceedings. The issue, in these proceedings which
can only be resorted to if the accused has been convicted of a sexual offence,
is not whether he should be convicted of another offence, but solely whether he
is afflicted by a state or condition that makes him a dangerous sexual offender
within the meaning of s. 659 (b) of the Criminal Code . To be
so afflicted is not an offence. As to this aspect of the matter, the line of
reasoning adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the King v. Hunter[6] and this Court in Brusch v. The Queen[7], holding that a charge of being a habitual
criminal is not a charge of an offence but merely the assertion of a status or
condition, applies here on a charge of being a dangerous sexual offender.

[Page 20]

Indeed, a reference to subs. 3 of s. 661  of
the Criminal Code  makes it clear that the object sought by Parliament,
in enacting these special provisions, is not to create an offence but to enable
the Court, in cases where a sexual offender is found to be a dangerous sexual
offender, to pass upon him a further sentence in lieu of or in addition to the
sentence passed or which could have been passed for the sexual offence of which
he was convicted. These proceedings do not involve the conviction of an
offence, but the determination of the sentence which may be pronounced after
conviction. The confession rule, which excludes incriminatory statements not
affirmatively proved to have been made voluntarily, is a rule which has been
designed for proceedings where, broadly speaking, the guilt or innocence of a
person charged with an offence is the matter in issue. The rule has not been
established for proceedings related to the determination of a sentence. I know
of no binding authority holding that its application extends, and can think of
no valid reason why it should be held to extend to examinations conducted by
psychiatrists, in compliance with subs. 2 of s. 661  of the Criminal
Code , in order that they could form and subsequently convey to the Court an
opinion as to the mental state or condition of a sexual offender.

Another reason why the confession rule does not
obtain to exclude statements made by a sexual offender to psychiatrists
examining him pursuant to subs. 2 of s. 661 of the Code, is that the
latter are not, as it has been decided particularly by the Court of Appeal for
Alberta in Regina v. McKenzie, supra, persons in authority. Indeed, the
nature of their position, in relation to the proceedings under s. 661 of
the Code, does not enable them to control or influence the course of such
proceedings in the sense and the manner in which the course of proceedings may
be controlled or influenced by persons who have a concern with the
apprehension, prosecution or examination of prisoners conducted to collect
evidence leading to the conviction of an offence. On the contrary, and as the
purpose to be inferred from subs. 2 of s. 661 of the Code indicates, the
position of the psychiatrists, in relation to the proceedings under
s. 661 , is that of free and independent medical experts, specialists in
mental health, whose only part and concern in the proceedings is to give to the
Court the assistance, which the latter

[Page 21]

is required by subs. 2 to seek from them, for
the assessment of the mental state or condition of a sexual offender and the
determination of the application made under the section. Except in rare cases,
where indications to the contrary might possibly appear,—and none have been
shown in this case—psychiatrists called to assist the Court in these
proceedings cannot be considered as being persons in authority. In this
respect, their position, in relation to proceedings under s. 661 of the
Code, does not differ from their position in relation to proceedings where
insanity is raised as an issue, and never, as far as I know, was it suggested
that, in the latter case, they have the status of persons in authority.

Dealing with hearsay:—The evidence, in this
case, indicates that to form an opinion according to recognized normal
psychiatric procedures, the psychiatrist must consider all possible sources of
information, including second-hand source information, the reliability,
accuracy and significance of which are within the recognized scope of his
professional activities, skill and training to evaluate. Hence, while
ultimately his conclusion may rest, in part, on second-hand source material, it
is nonetheless an opinion formed according to recognized normal psychiatric
procedures. It is not to be assumed that Parliament contemplated that the
opinion, which the psychiatrists would form and give to assist the Court, would
be formed by methods other than those recognized in normal psychiatric
procedures. The value of a psychiatrist’s opinion may be affected to the extent
to which it may rest on second-hand source material; but that goes to the
weight and not to the receivability in evidence of the opinion, which opinion
is no evidence of the truth of the information but evidence of the opinion
formed on the basis of that information. I find it unnecessary, in this case,
to pursue these considerations which, I think, would generally obtain in
proceedings under s. 661 of the Code, where the hearing and determination
of the application are entrusted to a judge alone. In the present case, the
information gathered from prison files was not considered by the two
psychiatrists as having any real significance in the formation of their opinion
which was grounded ultimately on the examinations of the appellant and the
evidence given at the hearing of the application. And, in any event, the trial
Judge found, as he was entitled

[Page 22]

to after considering all the evidence, that,
exclusive of the evidence of the psychiatrists, the relevant evidence before
him was conclusive.

In these circumstances, the present appeal could
not be allowed and was, as above indicated, dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR THE
NORTHWEST TERRITORIES

Criminal law—Dangerous sexual
offender—Homosexual—Preventive detention—Whether a dangerous sexual
offender—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 149, 659(b) [as enacted by
1960-61 (Can.), c. 43, s. 32], 661.

The appellant pleaded guilty to four charges
of gross indecency under s. 149  of the Criminal Code . Following the
imposition of a sentence, an application was made under s. 661  of the Criminal
Code  to have him declared a dangerous sexual offender within the meaning of
s. 659(b) of the Code. The appellant’s previous record showed a
conviction some five years before on eighteen charges for similar offences. The
evidence of the two psychiatrists was to the effect that the appellant was
likely to commit further sexual offences of the same kind with other consenting
adult males, that he had never caused injury, pain or other evil to any person
and was not likely to do so in the future. The judge imposed a sentence of
preventive detention. His appeal to the Court of Appeal for the Northwest
Territories was dismissed. He was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the
following questions of law: (i) whether there was evidence that he was a person
who had shown a failure to control his sexual impulses, and (ii) whether the
evidence could support the conclusion that he had shown such a failure and was
likely to cause injury, pain or other evil to any person, through failure in
the future to control his sexual impulses or was likely to commit a further
sexual offence.

Held (Cartwright
and Hall JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux,
Judson and Spence JJ.: Under the new definition of “dangerous sexual offender”,
as enacted by 1960-61 (Can.), c. 43, s. 32,

[Page 823]

the likelihood of the commission of a further
sexual offence has been added and made an alternative element to that of the
danger of injury to others. Applied to this case, this new definition justified
the concurrent findings of the Courts below that the appellant, having shown a
failure to control his sexual impulses and that he was likely to commit further
sexual offences of the same kind, was a dangerous sexual offender within the
meaning which Parliament ascribed to this expression. The intent and object of
the provisions dealing with dangerous sexual offenders is not solely to protect
persons from becoming the victims of those whose failure to control their
sexual impulses rendered them a source of danger.

Per Cartwright
and Hall JJ., dissenting: The intent and object of the sections of
the Code dealing with dangerous sexual offenders is to protect persons from
becoming the victims of those whose failure to control their sexual impulses
renders them a source of danger. The words “a further sexual offence” are
general words wide enough to embrace every type of offence containing a sexual
element. Applying the maxim verba generalia restringuntur ad habilitatem rei
vel personae to s. 659(b) of the Code, the concluding words of
the section should be given the meaning “or is likely to commit a further
sexual offence involving an element of danger to another person”. On this view
of s. 659(b), it was clear that the finding that the appellant was
a dangerous sexual offender could not stand as it would be directly contrary to
the evidence.

Droit criminel—Délinquant sexuel
dangereux—Homosexuel—Détention préventive—Est-il un délinquant sexuel
dangereux—Code Criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 149, 659(b) [tel que
décrété par 1960-61 (Can.), c. 43, art. 32], 661.

L’appelant a admis sa culpabilité sur quatre
chefs d’accusation de grossière indécence sous l’art. 149  du Code Criminel . Une
fois la sentence imposée, une demande a été présentée en vertu de l’art. 661  du
Code Criminel  pour qu’il soit déclaré que l’appelant était un délinquant
sexuel dangereux dans le sens de l’art. 659(b) du Code. Le dossier
antérieur de l’appelant montrait une condamnation, quelque cinq ans plus tôt,
sur dix-huit chefs d’accusation pour des infractions semblables. Le témoignage
des deux psychiatres fut à l’effet que l’appelant commettrait vraisemblablement
d’autres infractions sexuelles de la même nature avec d’autres adultes mâles
consentants, qu’il n’avait jamais causé de lésions corporelles, douleurs ou
autre mal à quelqu’un et que vraisemblablement il n’en causerait pas à
l’avenir. Le juge a imposé une sentence de détention préventive. L’appel à la
Cour d’Appel des Territoires du Nord-Ouest a été rejeté. Il a obtenu la
permission d’en appeler devant cette Cour sur les questions de droit suivantes:
(i) Existait-il une preuve à l’effet que l’appelant était une personne ayant
manifesté une impuissance à maîtriser ses impulsions sexuelles? (ii)
Existait-il une preuve pouvant supporter la conclusion qu’il avait démontré une
telle impuissance et qu’il causerait vraisemblablement des lésions corporelles,
des douleurs ou autre mal à quelqu’un, à cause de son impuissance à l’avenir à
maîtriser ses impulsions sexuelles ou qu’il commetrait vraisemblablement une
autre infraction sexuelle?

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté, les Juges Cartwright et Hall étant dissidents.

[Page 824]

Les Juges
Fauteux, Judson et Spence: Dans la nouvelle définition de l’expression
«délinquant sexuel dangereux» telle que décrétée par 1960-61 (Can.), c. 43,
art. 32, on a ajouté comme élément alternatif à la probabilité de lésions
corporelles à d’autres personnes, la probabilité de la commission d’une autre
infraction sexuelle. L’application de cette nouvelle définition au cas présent
justifie les conclusions concordantes des Cours inférieures à l’effet que
l’appelant, ayant démontré son impuissance à maîtriser ses impulsions sexuelles
et que vraisemblablement il commettrait d’autres infractions sexuelles de la
même nature, était un délinquant sexuel dangereux dans le sens que le Parlement
a attribué à cette expression. L’intention et le but des dispositions se
rapportant aux délinquants sexuels dangereux n’est pas seulement d’empêcher les
autres de devenir les victimes de ceux dont l’impuissance à maîtriser leurs
impulsions sexuelles en fait une source de danger.

Les Juges
Cartwright et Hall, dissidents: L’intention et le but des articles du
Code se rapportant aux délinquants sexuels dangereux est d’empêcher les autres
de devenir les victimes de ceux dont l’impuissance à maîtriser leurs impulsions
sexuelles en fait une source de danger. Les mots «une autre infraction
sexuelle» sont des mots au sens général et ayant une portée assez grande pour
englober toute offense ayant un élément sexuel. Appliquant la maxime verba
generalia restringuntur ad habilitatem rei vel personae à l’art. 659(b)
du Code, on doit donner aux derniers mots de l’article la signification «ou qui
commettrait vraisemblablement une autre infraction sexuelle comportant un
élément de danger pour une autre personne». Si l’on interprète l’art. 659(b)
de cette manière, il est clair que la conclusion que l’appellant était un
délinquant sexuel dangereux ne peut pas être maintenue puisqu’elle serait
directement en conflit avec la preuve.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’Appel des
Territoires du Nord-Ouest, confirmant une sentence de détention préventive. Appel rejeté, les Juges Cartwright et Hall étant dissidents.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for the Northwest Territories, affirming a sentence of preventive detention.
Appeal dismissed, Cartwright and Hall JJ. dissenting.

B.A. Crane, for the appellant.

John A. Scollin, for the respondent.

The judgment of Cartwright and Hall JJ. was
delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—This is an
appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories
pronounced on October 26, 1966, dismissing an appeal from a judgment of Sissons
J. pronounced on March 9, 1966, finding that the appellant was a dangerous
sexual offender within the meaning of the Criminal Code 

[Page 825]

and imposing a sentence of preventive detention
upon him in lieu of the sentences imposed by Magistrate Parker to be mentioned
hereafter.

The appeal to this Court was by leave granted on
March 22, 1967, under the provisions of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act,
R.S.C. 1952, c. 259. The order of this Court granted leave to appeal on the
following questions of law:

(1) Whether there was evidence before
Mr. Justice Sissons that Klippert was a person who had shown a failure to
control his sexual impulses.

(2) Whether the evidence before
Mr. Justice Sissons can support the conclusion that the accused “has shown
a failure to control his sexual impulses and is likely to cause injury, pain or
other evil to any person, through failure in the future to control his sexual impulses
or is likely to commit a further sexual offence”.

The facts are not in dispute and may be stated
briefly.

On the morning of August 16, 1965, the appellant
was arrested by the R.C.M.P. at Pine Point, N.W.T., as a result of an
investigation with respect to a charge of arson (in which he was not involved).
In the evening of August 16 he was taken to Hay River after he had given the
police a statement. On August 17 the accused was arraigned before Magistrate
Parker on four charges of gross indecency under s. 149  of the Criminal
Code  as follows:

1. That Everett George Klippert, mechanic’s
helper of Pine Point, Northwest Territories, between the 21st day of December,
1964 and the 6th day of August 1965 at or near the settlement of Pine Point in
the Northwest Territories, being a male person, did unlawfully commit an act of
gross indecency with William Gordon Mellett, another male person, contrary to
Section 149  of the Criminal Code .

2. That Everett George Klippert, mechanic’s
helper of Pine Point, Northwest Territories, between the 1st day of May, 1965
and the 15th day of July, 1965, at or near the settlement of Pine Point in the
Northwest Territories, being a male person, did unlawfully commit an act of
gross indecency with Patrick Betty, another male person, contrary to Section
149  of the Criminal Code .

3. That Everett George Klippert, mechanic’s
helper of Pine Point, Northwest Territories, between the 10th day of July,
1965, and the 31st day of July, 1965, at or near the settlement of Pine Point
in the Northwest Territories, being a male person, did unlawfully commit an act
of gross indecency with David Frank L’Heureux, another male person, contrary to
Section 149  of the Criminal Code .

4. That Everett George Klippert, mechanic’s
helper of Pine Point, Northwest Territories, between the 1st day of July, 1965
and the 10th day of August, 1965, at or near the settlement of Pine Point in
the Northwest Territories, being a male person, did unlawfully commit an act of
gross indecency with Christopher Logan Wolff, another male person, contrary to
Section 149  of the Criminal Code .

[Page 826]

Pleas of guilty were entered to each charge and
the appellant was remanded in custody until August 24, 1965, at Fort Smith, at
which time Magistrate Parker imposed a sentence of three years concurrent with
respect to each charge.

Following such conviction and sentence a notice
of application under s. 661  of the Criminal Code  to have the
appellant declared a dangerous sexual offender was served on him. The appellant
was examined by two psychiatrists on behalf of the Crown, Dr. Donald
Griffith McKerracher, nominated by the Attorney General pursuant to
s. 661(2)  of the Criminal Code , and Dr. Ian McLaren McDonald.

The application was heard before Sissons J. The
Crown proved the four convictions before Magistrate Parker. Corporal Armstrong
of the R.C.M.P., who had laid the information and had been present at the trial
before the Magistrate, identified the appellant as the person convicted but was
not asked by either counsel for the Crown or for the defence for any
particulars of the offences to which the appellant had pleaded guilty. Corporal
Armstrong produced the fingerprints and fingerprint certificates of the
appellant which included a record of his conviction on May 4, 1960, on eighteen
charges of gross indecency contrary to s. 149  of the Criminal Code  on
which he was sentenced to four years imprisonment on each charge, the sentences
to run concurrently.

No evidence was adduced as to the nature of the
acts committed by the appellant in respect of either the four substantive
charges to which he had pleaded guilty before Magistrate Parker or the eighteen
other charges upon which he had been convicted in 1960.

The Crown called the evidence of the two
psychiatrists mentioned above, each of whom gave evidence as to, inter alia,
statements made to him by the appellant during his examination.

It was held by this Court in Wilband v. The
Queen[1], that a
psychiatrist acting pursuant to s. 661(2)  of the Criminal Code  is
not a person in authority to whom the rule as to proof by the Crown of the
voluntary nature of a statement applies and no question is raised as to the
admissibility of any of the evidence which these two witnesses gave.

[Page 827]

The effect of their evidence is shown by the
following extracts.

Dr. Donald Griffith McKerracher testified:

He (the appellant) did say that he had had
homosexual activities at the age of 15 for the first time;…

* *
*

Further that he had not married; that
sexual behaviour, homosexual behaviour had existed since the age of 15; that to
him homosexual activity provided his only satisfactory method of the release of
sexual tensions. It was his only satisfactory sexual outlet. He found the
thought of heterosexual conduct abhorrent. He told me he never had had
heterosexual relations, that during 24 years of fairly active homosexual
practice he had many partners whose ages varied from the middle teens to 30 or
35. He obtained his sexual partners through previous contacts through some,
what I would judge, was discreet soliciting because others in the same pattern
of behaviour would, one would judge, be tending to make contacts too. There was
no suggestion whatsoever of any violence at any time; that he was most
co-operative throughout the interview, restrained in manner, courteous,
coherent, relevant and frank.

* *
*

Q. What are your conclusions from those
observations?

A. Well in the first place my opinion is
that Mr. Klippert is not inhibited, let us put it this way, his sexual
drive is not inhibited and it is my opinion based on my experience with others
with similar patterns of conduct that he would have difficulty in inhibiting
them in the future.

* *
*

DR. McKERRACHER: Yes. My conclusion was in
terms of this pattern of sexual behaviour that he would have the same drive—a
drive toward homosexual relations in the future that he had had in the past. I
also concluded that in my opinion there was no danger, this is strictly my
opinion, of him doing physical violence or injury to anyone. He did not fit
that pattern. If I might put it the same way, if I might make an analogy with
the heterosexual activity of a man with heterosexual drives he will continue to
seek heterosexual outlets for those drives, some men would do it violently,
some would not. I did not feel the accused showed any evidence that he would
behave in a violent fashion.

* *
*

Q. On the question of his sexual conduct in
the past what are you able to conclude from that?

A. I conclude—it is based on a homosexual
pattern and has been since he was sexually active.

Q. Has he been able to control this?

A. No—I would put it inhibit. He has not
inhibited these drives.

Q. Now as to…

THE COURT: Just to make it clear what do
you mean by “not inhibited”? A. The drive is a desire, to inhibit it is to
refuse to follow the desire. It is like a heterosexual drive—most people do not
inhibit their heterosexual drives, they follow their drives, the impulse is a
drive to seek heterosexual relief.

Dr. Ian McLaren McDonald testified:

Q. And what information did you receive on
those points? A. He informed me that he had pleaded guilty to four charges of

[Page 828]

having engaged in homosexual activity; that
he was sentenced in August of 1965. He told me that this was the second
sentence for similar behaviour. He told me that he had engaged in homosexual
activity since the age of 14 or 15. He told me that the people with whom he
engaged in these activities ranged in age from 15 to the mid or late 30’s. The
15 year old, he said, took part in an incident when he was 17 or 18. He had
little or no heterosexual experience, certainly no complete heterosexual
experience never having completed a sexual act with a female. He said that he
had no desire to partake in heterosexual activity. He said this filled him with
revulsion, as I believe his words were “some people are revolted at the idea of
having homosexual relations while I am revolted at the idea of having
heterosexual relations”. He stated that he had engaged in homosexual activity
actively when he started work in the dairy in Calgary which would be about the
age of 16 or 17; that he had continued this up until his being confined to the
penitentiary I believe in 1960. Having been discharged from the penitentiary he
was aware of the need to refrain from engaging in this behaviour again. He
stated that some attempt, some contacts had been made with him by ex-friends
and for this reason, as well as the feeling of his continued presence bringing
shame on his family, he decided to leave Calgary and head North.

He acknowledged that he had been warned, or
at least a discussion had taken place between himself and a member of the
Mounted Police Force at Pine Point some time in the summer of 1964, the
implication being that his record was known and that he should more or less
watch his behaviour. He said he was able to do this until these events
transpired of which he was charged and sentenced.

In describing his behaviour, his homosexual
behaviour, he said first of all that he was very careful of the person whom he
approached, he was very careful to ascertain whether or not they preferred
heterosexual outlets and if they did then he didn’t make an overture. If they
were ambivalent, that is they had no strong feelings one way or the other then
he would make some overtures, generally conversationally. He denied ever having
physically assaulted or coerced any of these people he engaged in these
pursuits. He acknowledged that in the past he had a good number of short term
affairs. These were not lasting relationships.

Q. Short term affairs with whom? A. The
men. He also stated that he denied having any preference for young men, his
preference was for people who were responsive, that is people who shared his
enthusiasm about the endeavour. As a result of this information that he told
me, and based on past experience with people who have presented this kind of
sexual behaviour pattern I came to the conclusion that Mr. Klippert was (a)
primarily and essentially a homosexual, that this was the prime outlet for
sexual drives (b) I thought it unlikely that he could refrain from
indulging in this behaviour again without assistance, that is assistance from
other people, trained people. I felt that this man was not the type who would
physically injure or coerce people to take part in these activities.

Q. Dr. McDonald then on the point of
past sexual conduct and the question of control, briefly what can you tell us
about his control from his past conduct? Does he have control, I mean can

[Page 829]

he stop, as indicated from his past
conduct? A. He obviously cannot stop for long periods of time on past
performance, on his own.

I have perhaps quoted at unnecessary length from
the evidence of these witnesses as it is clear from reading their testimony as
a whole that in the opinion of each of them there was no danger of the
appellant using violence of any sort or attempting coercion of anyone. They do
not suggest that he sought out youthful partners for his misconduct. What they
did foresee was the likelihood of the appellant committing further acts of
gross indecency with other consenting adult males.

The question before us is whether on this state
of facts the finding that the appellant is a dangerous sexual offender can be
sustained in law.

In the case of an application under s. 661 
of the Criminal Code  the onus lies upon the Crown to establish beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused is a dangerous sexual offender. In the case
at bar not only is there no evidence that the accused if at liberty would
constitute a danger to any person but the evidence of the two psychiatrists,
quoted from and summarized above, expressly negatives the existence of any such
danger. This would be an end of the matter if it were not for the definition of
the phrase “dangerous sexual offender” contained in s. 659  which reads as
follows:

659. In this Part,…

(b) “dangerous sexual offender”
means a person who, by his conduct in any sexual matter, has shown a failure to
control his sexual impulses, and who is likely to cause injury, pain or other
evil to any person, through failure in the future to control his sexual
impulses or is likely to commit a further sexual offence.

For the purposes of this appeal I will assume
that the evidence in the record was sufficient to support a finding that the
accused has shown a failure to control his sexual impulses and that, if at
liberty, he is likely to commit a further sexual offence of the same sort as
those to which he pleaded guilty; there is not a tittle of evidence to suggest
that he is likely to commit any other type of sexual offence.

In construing the definition of “dangerous
sexual offender” it must be borne in mind that by the combined effect of
s. 2(2), s. 2(3) and s. 2(1)(a)(i) and (ii) of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 158, s. 659(b) of the

[Page 830]

Criminal Code  must
be read as if it concluded with the words “except in so far as this definition
is inconsistent with the intent or object of this Part or would give to the
expression ‘dangerous sexual offender’ an interpretation inconsistent with the
context”.

The intent and object of those sections in
the Criminal Code  which deal with dangerous sexual offenders is to
protect persons from becoming the victims of those whose failure to control
their sexual impulses renders them a source of danger. To construe the
definition as compelling the Court to impose a sentence of preventive detention
on a person shown by the evidence led by the Crown not to be a source of danger
would be to give it an effect inconsistent with the intent or object of the
Part.

The words “a further sexual offence” are general
words wide enough to embrace every type of offence containing a sexual element
and in construing them resort may properly be had to the maxim verba
generalia restringuntur ad habilitatem rei vel personae (Bac. Max. reg.
10). The following statement, now found in Maxwell on Interpretation of
Statutes, 11th ed., at pages 58 and 59, is supported by the authorities cited
and has often been quoted with approval:

It is in the interpretation of general
words and phrases that the principle of strictly adapting the meaning to the
particular subject-matter with reference to which the words are used finds its
most frequent application. However wide in the abstract, they are more or less
elastic, and admit of restriction or expansion to suit the subject-matter.
While expressing truly enough all that the legislature intended, they
frequently express more in their literal meaning and natural force; and it is
necessary to give them the meaning which best suits the scope and object of the
statute without extending to ground foreign to the intention. It is, therefore,
a canon of interpretation that all words, if they be general and not express
and precise, are to be restricted to the fitness of the matter. They are to be
construed as particular if the intention be particular; that is, they must be
understood as used with reference to the subject-matter in the mind of the
legislature, and limited to it.

A case often referred to on this point is Cox
v. Hakes[2], in
which it was held by the House of Lords that the following words in s. 19
of the Judicature Act, 36 & 37 Vict., c. 66: “The said Court of
Appeal shall have jurisdiction and power to hear and determine appeals from any
judgment or order of Her Majesty’s High Court of Justice or any Judges or Judge
thereof” did not confer jurisdiction to hear an appeal from an order
discharging a prisoner

[Page 831]

under a habeas corpus although such an
order fell plainly within the literal meaning of the words of the enactment.

Applying this principle to s. 659(b)
it is my opinion that the concluding words “or is likely to commit a further
sexual offence” should be given the meaning “or is likely to commit a further
sexual offence involving an element of danger to another person”.

If this is the right construction of
s. 659(b), as I think it is, it is clear that the finding that the
appellant is a dangerous sexual offender cannot stand; it would be directly
contrary to the evidence.

I am glad to arrive at this result. It would be
with reluctance and regret that I would have found myself compelled by the
words used to impute to Parliament the intention of enacting that the words
“dangerous sexual offender” shall include in their meaning “a sexual offender
who is not dangerous”.

Before parting with the matter I wish to mention
a further consideration which is not, I think, irrelevant in seeking to
ascertain the intention of Parliament. It is not wholesome that the existing
criminal law should not be enforced. A law which ought not to be enforced
should be repealed. If the law on this subject matter is as interpreted by the
Courts below, it means that every man in Canada who indulges in sexual
misconduct of the sort forbidden by s. 149  of the Criminal Code  with
another consenting adult male and who appears likely, if at liberty, to
continue such misconduct should be sentenced to preventive detention, that is
to incarceration for life. However loathsome conduct of the sort mentioned may
appear to all normal persons, I think it improbable that Parliament should have
intended such a result. It may be that we cannot take judicial notice of the
probable effect which such an interpretation would have on the numbers of those
confined to penitentiaries; no one, I think, would quarrel with the suggestion
that it would bring about serious overcrowding.

I would allow the appeal and quash the sentence
of preventive detention.

The judgment of Fauteux, Judson and Spence JJ.
was delivered by

FAUTEUX J.:—The circumstances giving rise to
this appeal can be briefly stated. In August 1965, the appellant

[Page 832]

pleaded guilty before Magistrate Parker on four
charges under s. 149  of the Criminal Code , namely gross indecency,
and on August 24, he was sentenced to three years concurrent with respect to
each charge. On an application, subsequently made under s. 661  Cr. C.,
before Sissons J., he was declared a dangerous sexual offender within
the meaning of s. 659 (b) of the Criminal Code , Being of the
view that a penitentiary term would be harmful rather than beneficial to the
appellant, the learned judge sentenced him to preventive detention,—a detention
for an indeterminate period—cf. 659(c), in lieu of the sentence of three
years in penitentiary imposed by Magistrate Parker, and recommended to the
Minister of Justice to review the case of the appellant, at the earliest
possible moment, and that he be released on licence on condition that he submit
himself to such treatment which, in the opinion of psychiatrists, could be
helpful to him.

An appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice
Sissons was launched and was, ultimately, unanimously dismissed by the Court of
Appeal for the North West Territories.

Leave to appeal to this Court was thereafter
sought and granted on the two following questions of law:

(i) Whether there was evidence before
Mr. Justice Sissons that Klippert was a person who had shown a failure to
control his sexual impulses.

(ii) Whether the evidence before
Mr. Justice Sissons can support the conclusion that the accused has shown
a failure to control his sexual impulses and is likely to cause injury, pain or
other evil to any person, through failure in the future to control his sexual
impulses or is likely to commit a further sexual offence.

The evidence before Sissons J. consists of the
four convictions before Magistrate Parker, a conviction in 1960 on eighteen
charges for similar offences—for which appellant was sentenced to four years’
imprisonment with respect to each charge, sentences to run concurrently,—and,
as required by s. 661(2) , the evidence of two qualified psychiatrists,
namely Dr. Donald Griffith McKerracher and Dr. Ian McLaren McDonald.
The substance of the evidence of these doctors appears in the excerpts from
their testimony, quoted in the reasons for judgment of my brother Cartwright.
Considered as a whole, the evidence reasonably indicates that the appellant is
a person who, by his conduct in sexual matters, has shown a failure to control

[Page 833]

his sexual impulses and that he is likely to
commit further sexual offences of the same kind, though, he never did cause
injury, pain or other evil to any person and is not likely to do so in the
future through his failure to control his sexual impulses.

On this state of facts, the determination of the
questions of law mentioned above, depends on the meaning given by Parliament to
the expression dangerous sexual offender.

Part XXI of the Criminal Code , which
deals with Preventive Detention, contains its own interpretation provisions in
s. 659 . Section 659 (b) defines dangerous sexual offender as
follows:

659. In this Part,

(a)…

(b) “dangerous sexual offender”
means a person who, (i) by his conduct in any sexual matter, has shown a
failure to control his sexual impulses, and (ii) who (a) is likely
to cause injury, pain or other evil to any person, through failure in the
future to control his sexual impulses or (b) is likely to commit a
further sexual offence, and

(c)…

Underlining, numerals and letters have been
added to point out the necessary or alternative constituent elements in the
definition.

This is a new definition. It was enacted by
Parliament in 1961, by 9-10 Elizabeth II, c. 43, s. 32, of which the
opening words are:

32. Paragraph (b) of
section 659 of the said Act is repealed and the following substituted
therefor:

Prior to this change, s. 659 (b)
read:

659. In this Part,

(a)…

(b) “criminal sexual psychopath”
means a person who, (i) by a course of misconduct in sexual matters, has
shown a lack of power to control his sexual impulses and who (ii) as a
result is likely to attack or otherwise inflict injury, pain or other evil on
any person.

Underlining and numerals have been added to
point out the necessary constituent elements in this former definition.

Thus, it appears that, under the new definition,
(i) the element of psychological ability to control has been replaced by that
of a straight factual investigation and (ii) the likelihood of the commission
of a further sexual offence, has been added and made an alternative element to
that of the danger of injury to others.

[Page 834]

Applied to this case, the new definition
justifies the concurrent finding of the Courts below, that the appellant who,
on the evidence, (i) has shown a failure to control his sexual impulses and
(ii) is likely to commit further sexual offences of the same kind, is a dangerous
sexual offender within the meaning which Parliament itself ascribed to this
expression.

During the hearing of this appeal, reference was
made to a certain part of the French version of the former and of the new
definition and some reliance appears to have been placed, by counsel for the
appellant, on a lack of difference between the two texts to support the
contention that the psychological ability to control has not been replaced by a
straight factual investigation and is still a constituent element in the
definition. The part of the definition to which we were referred reads as
follows:

in the former definition:

“…qui, d’après son inconduite en matière
sexuelle, a manifesté une impuissance à maîtriser ses impulsions sexuelles…”

and in the new definition:

“…qui, d’après sa conduite en matière
sexuelle, a manifesté une impuissance à maîtriser ses impulsions sexuelles…”

Both texts are obviously identical in substance.
In my opinion, this, in no way, supports the proposition contended for by the
appellant. We are not dealing here with a situation where each of the English
and of the French text is capable of assisting the other, in a matter of
interpretation, but with a situation where one has to elect between either the
English text, which manifests the actual intervention of Parliament to change
the existing law with respect to one of the constituent elements in the
definition, or the French text, which is indicative of no change at all. In Blackford
v. McBain[3],
Taschereau J., as he then was, disposed of a similar question by ignoring the
version which left the law in the state in which it was, prior to the Act
adopted to change it, cf. p. 275. Indeed, to give priority to the French
version would, in this case, render the change made in the English version
meaningless and the actual intervention of Parliament, to make this change,
futile.

With deference, I cannot either agree with the
view that the intent and object of the provisions dealing with dan-

[Page 835]

gerous sexual offenders, is solely to protect persons from becoming the victims of those
whose failure to control their sexual impulses renders them a source of danger
and that to apply the definition to a person, who is not to be a source of
danger, would give the definition an effect inconsistent with the intent or
object of these provisions. Obviously, the intent and object of an Act is to be
found in its provisions and, in the case of this particular legislation, the
provisions which are relevant in this respect are those of s. 659 —the
interpretation section—and those of s. 661 —the operative section. Section
659 (b), as above indicated, clearly added, as an alternative element in
the definition to the danger of injury to others, that of the likelihood of the
commission of a further sexual offence, and a consideration of s. 661 
shows that the operative provisions are only consistent with this view of the
matter. Section 661  reads as follows:

661. (1) Where an accused has been
convicted of

(a) an offence under

(i) section 136,

(ii) section 138,

(iii) section 141,

(iv) section 147,

(v) section 148, or

(vi) section 149 ; or

(b) an attempt to commit an offence
under a provision mentioned in paragraph (a),

the court shall, upon application, hear
evidence as to whether the accused is a dangerous sexual offender.

(2) On the hearing of an application under
subsection (1) the court shall hear any relevant evidence, and shall hear
the evidence of at least two psychiatrists, one of whom shall be nominated by
the Attorney General.

(3) Where the court finds that the accused
is a dangerous sexual offender it shall, notwithstanding anything in this Act
or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, impose upon the accused a
sentence of preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that might be
imposed for the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed for such
offence, or in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such offence if
the sentence has expired.

(4) At the hearing of an application under
subsection (1), the accused is entitled to be present.

In some of the offences referred to in
s. 661(1)(a), such as rape, indecent assault on female, indecent
assault on male, violence is involved to a variable degree as an element of
the offence. In others, such as sexual intercourse with a female under 14,
sexual intercourse with a female between

[Page 836]

14 and 16, buggery and gross indecency, violence is not an element of the
offence. Particularly, the offence of gross indecency, in which appellant has
indulged, is one which necessarily implies consent of the person which must
participate with the accused for its commission and one which excludes danger
of injury to the participants. With respect to the offences of the first
category, it may well be said that the object and intent of Parliament is, as
indicated by my brother Cartwright, to protect persons from becoming the
victims of those whose failure to control their sexual impulses renders them a
source of danger, but, in my respectful view, the same thing cannot be said
with respect to the offences of the second category which also includes the
offence of bestiality. The language of s. 661  is clear; if an
accused is convicted of one of the offences mentioned in the section, be that
one of the first or of the second category, the Court shall, upon application,
hear evidence and decide whether the accused is a person who, (i) by his
conduct, has shown a failure to control his sexual impulses, and (ii) who (a)
is either likely to cause injury, pain or other evil to any person through his
failure in the future to control his sexual impulses or (b) is likely to
commit a further sexual offence. The general words further sexual offence are
clearly embracing the offences mentioned in s. 661(1) of which, as above
indicated, many exclude, as being one of their constituent elements, a source
of danger of injury to other persons.

I would, therefore, affirmatively answer the two
questions of law upon which leave to appeal was granted.

Whether the criminal law, with respect to sexual
misconduct of the sort in which appellant has indulged for nearly twenty-five
years, should be changed to the extent to which it has been recently in
England, by the Sexual Offences Act 1967, c. 60, is obviously not for us
to say; our jurisdiction is to interpret and apply laws validly enacted.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Disorderly houses—Keeper of
common bawdy house—No evidence of prior use of house as such—Whether accused
properly convicted—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 168.

As a result of a sexual proposition by
telephone made by a police agent provocateur, the appellant arranged to procure
another girl who would make arrangements for a suitable place of assignation
where both could entertain the caller and three male friends, also police officers.
The appellant met the police officers at an agreed location and under her
direction they drove to the home of her confederate. There, they were told that
the confederate intended to take them to another house as soon as a telephone
call, which she was expecting, confirmed the arrangements she had already made.
Eventually, a telephone call came and the confederate was heard to say “leave
the front door open”. The men and the two girls then drove to a private home in
a suburban residential area, the owner of which was not disclosed in the
record. Money exchanged hands and after the girls had removed some of their
clothing, they were arrested. There was no evidence in the record that the home
had ever been used for the purpose of prostitution or the practice of acts of
indecency. It had no such reputation nor was there any evidence of undue
traffic to or from the premises. The appellant was convicted of keeping a
common bawdy house, and her conviction was affirmed by a majority judgment in
the Court of Appeal. An appeal was launched to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be allowed and a
verdict of acquittal entered.

To obtain a conviction of keeping a common
bawdy house, the Crown must prove that there had been a frequent or habitual
use of a place for the purpose of prostitution. There was no such evidence in
this case nor was there any evidence upon which the magistrate could properly
base an inference that the place had been habitually so used.

Droit criminel—Maisons de désordre—Tenancier
de maison de débauche—Aucune preuve que la maison utilisée antérieurement à ces
fins—Verdict de culpabilité peut-il être soutenu—Code criminel , 1953-54 (Can.),
c. 51, art. 168.

A la suite d’un appel téléphonique d’un
officier de police, un agent provocateur, aux fins de rapports sexuels
illicites, l’appelante a convenu d’embaucher une autre fille qui ferait des
arrangements pour obtenir un local où les deux filles pourraient recevoir celui
qui téléphonait ainsi que trois amis, aussi des officiers de police.
L’appelante a rencontré les officiers de police à l’endroit convenu et, sous sa
direction, ils se sont tous dirigés en automobile à la maison de l’autre fille.
A cet endroit, on leur a dit que cette fille avait l’intention de les amener à
une autre maison dès qu’elle aurait reçu un appel téléphonique confirmant les

[Page 158]

arrangements qu’elle avait faits
antérieurement. Éventuellement, l’appel téléphonique a été reçu et on entendit
la fille demander de laisser la porte d’en avant ouverte. Les hommes et les
deux filles se sont alors dirigés en automobile vers une maison privée dans un
quartier résidentiel de banlieue. Le nom du propriétaire de cette maison
n’apparaît pas au dossier. Les officiers ont donné de l’argent aux filles et
après que ces dernières eurent enlevé quelques-uns de leurs vêtements, elles
furent mises sous arrêt. Il n’y avait aucune preuve dans le dossier que la
maison avait en aucun temps servi à des fins de prostitution ou pour la
pratique d’actes d’indécence. La maison n’avait pas cette réputation et il n’y
avait aucune preuve d’entrées ou de sorties inusitées. L’appelante a été
trouvée coupable d’avoir été la tenancière d’une maison de débauche, et le
verdict de culpabilité a été confirmé par un jugement majoritaire en Cour
d’Appel. Un appel a été logé devant cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel doit être maintenu et une
déclaration de non culpabilité doit être enregistrée.

Pour obtenir une déclaration de
culpabilité d’avoir été le tenancier d’une maison de débauche, la Couronne doit
prouver que le local a été employé fréquemment ou habituellement à des fins de
prostitution. Il n’y avait aucune telle preuve dans le dossier et il n’y avait
non plus aucune preuve sur laquelle le juge aurait pu baser à bon droit une
inférence que le local avait été employé habituellement à de telles fins.

APPEL d’un jugement de la Cour d’Appel de

confirmant une déclaration de culpabilité. Appel maintenu.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario1, affirming the conviction of the appellant. Appeal
allowed.

John F. Hamilton, for the appellant.

C.J. Meinhardt, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

SPENCE J.:—This is an appeal from the judgment
of the Court of Appeal for Ontario1 delivered on January 5, 1967,
whereby that Court dismissed the appeal from the conviction of the accused on February 8, 1966, by a police magistrate. The
accused was charged with unlawfully keeping a common bawdy house, situate and
known as 43 Harding Boulevard.

[Page 159]

In the Court of Appeal for Ontario, MacKay J.A., with whom Porter
C.J.O. concurred, gave reasons for dismissing the appeal and Schroeder J.A.
gave reasons for allowing the appeal and quashing the conviction. The facts
were accurately stated in considerable detail in the judgment of Schroeder J.A.
as follows:

On December 2, 1966 (sic-a, misprint
for 1965) a morality squad officer of the Metropolitan Toronto Police
Department, Detective John Leybourne, telephoned the appellant, using an
assumed name, and made an instigative sexual proposition to her. In the result,
it was arranged that she should procure another girl who would make
arrangements for a suitable place of assignation where both could satisfy the
sexual appetites of the agent provocateur and of three male friends (fellow
officers of the morality squad but not so made known to the appellant).

Subsequently Detective Leybourne and two fellow
detectives, all attired in plain clothes, met the appellant at an agreed
location on Bloor Street, and under her direction they drove to the home of her
confederate, one Beverley Dixon. Upon their arrival Dixon informed them that she intended to take them to another house and
was awaiting a telephone call to confirm the plans which she had set afoot. A
call eventually came and in responding to it Dixon was heard to say “leave the front door open”.

The three detectives and the two girls then
repaired to a suburban home in a quiet residential section of Richmond Hill, known and described for
municipal purposes as 43 Harding Boulevard. The record discloses nothing as to the identity of the owner or
occupant of that property.

Detective Leybourne had given the appellant $75
as compensation for the favours to be bestowed upon him and his two companions
and an additional $10 to pay for the use of the premises. After their arrival
the appellant and her female companion repaired to another part of the house,
and later returned to the presence of the detectives wearing nothing but their
under-garments. At this point the three police officers disclosed their identity
and after Detective Leybourne had repossessed himself of the $85 previously
paid to the appellant he charged her and her companion with the offence out of
which the present appeal arises.

[Page 160]

Beverley Dixon, who had made the necessary
arrangements for the use of the Harding Boulevard premises, was acquitted by the Magistrate and a conviction was
entered against the appellant only.

There is not the remotest suggestion in the
record that house number 43 Harding Boulevard in Richmond Hill, a
private residence in a quiet and respectable residential subdivision, had ever
been used by the appellant or any other person for the purpose of prostitution
or the practice of acts of indecency. No evidence was adduced as to any undue
traffic to and from the said premises which would reflect prejudicially upon
the reputation of the house or its occupants. The only evidence offered was
that of the three detectives which undoubtedly proved the intent of the
appellant and her co-accused to commit an act of prostitution with these
witnesses at the place in question.

The appellant has stated the points at issue in
this appeal as follows:

1. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in finding 43 Harding Boulevard was a common bawdy
house?

2. Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in holding that the appellant
was the keeper of a common bawdy house, pursuant to s. 168  of the Criminal
Code ?

The majority in the Court of Appeal found that
the premises at 43 Harding Boulevard were a common bawdy house and that the appellant was the keeper
thereof. Schroeder J.A., dissenting, was of the opinion that the premises were
not a common bawdy house and that the appellant was not the keeper thereof. I
am of the opinion that this appeal may be disposed of by considering the first
question only and I have come to the conclusion for the reasons which I shall
outline that the premises were not a common bawdy house within the meaning of
those words as used in s. 168  of the Criminal Code . Therefore, as Roach
J.A. said in giving judgment for the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. King[2]:

Since this place was not a common bawdy
house, it is irrelevant who the keeper was.

[Page 161]

Section 168  of the Criminal Code  provides
in subs. (1), paras. (b), (h), and (i):

168. (1) In this Part,

(b) “common bawdy house”
means a place that is

(i) kept or occupied, or

(ii) resorted to by one or more persons for
the purpose of prostitution or the practice of   acts of indecency;

* * *

(h) “keeper” includes a
person who

(i) is an owner or occupier of a place,

(ii) assists or acts on behalf of an owner
or occupier of a place,

(iii) appears to be, or to assist or act on
behalf of an owner or occupier of a place,

(iv) has the care or management of a place,

or

(v) Uses a place permanently or
temporarily, with or without the consent of the owner or occupier; and

(i) “place” includes any place,
whether or not

(i) it is covered or enclosed,

(ii) it is used permanently or temporarily,

or

(iii) any person has an exclusive right of
user with respect to it.

Schroeder J.A. was of the opinion that the words
“kept or occupied” and the words “resorted to” as used in s. 168(1) (b) (i) and
(ii) connote a frequent or habitual use of the premises for the purposes of
prostitution. I am in accord with that view. I have considered all the cases
cited and I have noted that there has been evidence, in each case where
conviction has resulted, of one of three types,

firstly, there
has been actual evidence of the continued and habitual use of the premises for
prostitution as in The King v. Cohen[3]
and Rex v. Miket[4],

secondly, there
has been evidence of the reputation in the neighbourhood of the premises as a
common bawdy house, or

thirdly, there
has been evidence of such circumstances as to make the inference that the
premises were resorted to habitually as a place of prostitution, a proper
inference for the court to draw from such evidence.

Examples of the latter are, particularly, Rex
v. Davidson[5], where
Stewart J.A. giving judgment for the majority of the Court said at p. 54:

It might very well happen that a clerk in a
hotel who had become friendly with a man, a guest or inmate or a regular
customer of the hotel,

[Page 162] 

might, on receiving a wink, shut his eyes
to his friend’s proposed escapade and allow him to take a woman to his room on
one occasion without protest, and yet not be guilty at all of habitually
allowing any casual guest to do so.

And at p. 55:

The way in which the whole thing happened
was such that the magistrate might quite properly infer that it was not an
isolated instance but rather a matter of course and of custom or habit.
Moreover, I think the decision in Rex v. James, 25 Can. Cr. Cas. 23, 25
D.L.R. 476, 9 A.L.R. 66, 9 W.W.R. 235, went upon the same principle,
viz., that the existence of a habit or custom of doing a certain thing might be
inferred from the circumstances surrounding the doing and the manner of doing
or even of offering to do that thing on a single occasion.

This is sufficient to sustain the
conviction and the motion should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.

It was admitted that though the accused was
only a night clerk he came within the definition of a “keeper” given in sec.
228(2) of the Code.

Also, in Rex v. Clay[6], Bissonnette J. said at
p. 40:

As a general rule, proof of an isolated act
of prostitution cannot suffice to establish the offence of keeping a disorderly
house. But if, from circumstances surrounding the evidence of this isolated
act, a certainty arises that this house is habitually used for purposes of
prostitution, the magistrate is thereupon justified in not requiring direct
proof of the bad reputation or delictual character of this house.

It would therefore appear that the element of
habitual or frequent use of the place will remain the necessary interpretation
of proof despite the amendment of the definition of “common bawdy house” to add
the words “resorted to by one or more persons” and in fact that the word
“resorted” itself has been relied upon to support the view that such habitual
or frequent use of a place is required. (See Rex v. Davidson, supra). So
in cases where the Crown has failed to prove a habitual or frequent use of a
place for the purposes of prostitution, the conviction has not been upheld. In Rex
v. King, supra, Roach J.A. said at p.325:

It was not a place kept or occupied or
resorted to by one or more persons for the purposes of prostitution or the
practice of acts of indecency. The authorities make it clear that to come
within that definition the place must be one that is habitually so kept or
resorted to.

I echo the words of Hanrahan P.M., in Rex v.
Martin[7], when
he said:

It is true convictions have been registered
and sustained on appeal on evidence of a single act of prostitution, but always
in such cases the

[Page 163]

surrounding circumstances established the
premises had been habitually used for such a purpose and in most cases had
acquired such a reputation in the community.

As I have said, there was no evidence in the
present case of any reputation in the community and there was no evidence of
the use of the premises for prostitution on any other occasion than the one
which was the subject of this prosecution. There was moreover no evidence upon
which the learned magistrate properly could base an inference that the place
had been habitually so used.

I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction,
and direct a verdict of acquittal.

Appeal allowed, conviction quashed and
verdict of acquittal directed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Fraud—Real estate
transaction—Lawyer for vendor acting also for purchaser—Existence of second
mortgage not disclosed to purchaser—Whether case correctly put to jury—Criminal
Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 323(1).

The appellant, a lawyer, was convicted by a
jury of having defrauded O by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means,
contrary to s. 323(1)  of the Criminal Code . The appellant, who was
engaged on a monthly fee basis by the vendors, represented also the purchaser O
in a transaction in respect of the sale of a motel. The evidence was that the
appellant had failed to disclose to O the existence of an outstanding second
mortgage on the property. The Crown contended that this failure constituted
fraud within the meaning of s. 323(1) of the Code. The accused admitted
that he knew of this second mortgage but that his failure to inform the
purchaser was due to inadvertence on his part and without any intent to
defraud. It was conceded that the accused did not personally profit from the
alleged fraud. In his charge to the jury, the trial judge said that the
evidence, if believed, was that a false statement had been made by the accused
to the purchaser. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed. The accused
was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and the appellant acquitted.

[Page 23]

The trial judge’s charge amounted to
misdirection. The Crown’s case against the appellant was not that he had given
false information but that he had fraudulently withheld material information
from O, a situation essentially different in character from that put to the
jury by the trial judge. It was not possible to say that no substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice had occurred by reason of this misdirection.

Droit criminel—Fraude—Opération
immobilière—Avocat du vendeur agissant aussi pour l’acheteur—Existence d’une
seconde hypothèque non dévoilée à l’acheteur—La cause a‑t‑elle été
soumise correctement au jury—Code criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51,
art. 323(1).

L’appelant, un avocat, a été trouvé coupable par
un jury d’avoir frustré O par supercherie, mensonge ou autres moyens dolosifs,
le tout contrairement à l’art. 323(1)  du Code criminel . L’appelant, qui
touchait des honoraires mensuels du vendeur, a représenté aussi l’acheteur O
lors d’une opération immobilière concernant la vente d’un motel. La preuve
était à l’effet que l’appelant n’avait pas dévoilé à O l’existence d’une
seconde hypothèque en vigueur sur la propriété. La Couronne prétend que cette
négligence constituait une fraude dans le sens de l’art. 323(1) du Code.
L’appelant a admis qu’il était au courant de la seconde hypothèque mais que son
défaut d’en informer l’acheteur était dû à une inadvertance de sa part et sans
aucune intention de frustrer. Il est admis que l’appelant n’a retiré
personnellement aucun profit de la fraude alléguée. Dans son adresse au jury,
le juge au procès a dit que la preuve, si elle était crue, était à l’effet que
l’accusé avait fait à l’acheteur une fausse déclaration. La Cour d’appel a
rejeté l’appel. L’appelant a obtenu permission d’en appeler devant cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel doit
être maintenu, la condamnation mise de côté et l’appelant acquitté.

Les instructions du juge au procès étaient
erronées. L’accusation portée contre l’appelant n’était pas qu’il avait donné
de faux renseignements mais qu’il avait frauduleusement caché à O des
renseignements pertinents, une situation ayant un caractère essentiellement
différent de celle qui avait été soumise au jury par le juge au procès. Il
était impossible de dire qu’aucun tort important ou qu’aucune erreur judiciaire
grave ne s’était produite en raison des instructions erronées.

Colombie-Britannique, confirmant un verdict de fraude. Appel
maintenu.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia, affirming a conviction for fraud. Appeal allowed.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

[Page 24]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

HALL J.:—The appellant was tried jointly with
one Arthur Bennett by a judge and jury in the month of January 1963 at
Vancouver in the Province of British Columbia upon three counts as follows:

1. That at the City of Vancouver, in the County
and Province aforesaid, between the 1st day of January, A.D. 1959, and the 30th
day of March, A.D. 1959, they, the said ARTHUR BENNETT and JOHN MacKROW,
together with HYCREST HOLDINGS LIMITED and HYCREST MOTELS LIMITED by deceit,
falsehood, or other fraudulent means, did defraud SAMUEL NORWOLL of property,
money or valuable security, contrary to the form of the statute in such case
made and provided and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her Crown and
Dignity.

2. That at the City of Vancouver, in the County
and Province aforesaid and at the City of New Westminster, in the Province
aforesaid, between the first day of May, A.D. 1959, and the 30th day of June,
A.D. 1959, they, the said ARTHUR BENNETT and JOHN MacKROW, together with
HYCREST INVESTMENTS LIMITED, IDEAL MOTELS LIMITED and HYCREST MOTELS LIMITED by
deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, did defraud JAMES JACK ORAN of
property, money or valuable security, contrary to the form of the statute in
such case made and provided and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her
Crown and Dignity.

3. That at the City of Vancouver, in the County
and Province aforesaid, between the 1st day of May, A.D. 1959, and the 30th day
of June, A.D. 1959, he the said JOHN MacKROW, being a trustee of money for the
use and benefit of JAMES JACK ORAN did convert, with intent to defraud and in
violation of his trust, the said money or a part of it to a use that was not
authorized by the trust, contrary to the form of statute in such case made and
provided and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her Crown and Dignity.

“Amended
15.1.63
A.B.C.”

The jury acquitted MacKrow on Count 1, but
convicted him on Counts 2 and 3. Bennett was convicted on Counts 1 and 2. MacKrow
was sentenced by Mr. Justice Ruttan, the trial judge, to serve a term of
five years in the penitentiary on each of Counts 2 and 3, the sentences to be
served concurrently. He appealed to the Court of Appeal for

[Page 25]

British Columbia which, on October 17, 1963,
dismissed the appeal as to Count 2 but quashed the conviction on Count 3.
Accordingly, Count 2 in respect of MacKrow only is the one issue now before the
Court. The Court of Appeal did not disturb the five years’ sentence when it
dismissed the appeal in respect of Count 2. MacKrow was a prisoner in the
penitentiary until paroled on July 8, 1965. Shortly after his release from the
penitentiary, MacKrow applied to this Court for an order extending the time
within which to make application for leave to appeal and for an order granting
leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal pronounced on the 17th
day of October, 1963. This application was dealt with on December 8, 1965, when
the following order was made:

THIS COURT DID ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the
time for applying for leave to appeal to this Court be and the same was
extended to the 8th day of December, 1965.

AND THIS COURT DID FURTHER ORDER AND
ADJUDGE that leave to appeal from the Judgment of the Court of Appeal for the
Province of British Columbia pronounced on the 17th day of October, 1963 be and
the same was granted on the following questions of law, namely:

“(1) Did the Court of Appeal err in holding
that there was evidence upon which the jury could reasonably convict the appellant
on Count No. 2 of the indictment.

(2) Did the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia err in holding that any defence which was available to the accused was
properly and adequately put by the learned trial judge in view of the
appellant’s contention that:

(a) The learned trial judge
instructed the jury that there was evidence on the part of the witness Oran
that a false statement was made to him at the time specified in the said Count
No. 2 whereas there was no such evidence;

(b) The learned trial judge
instructed the jury that it was not challenged that the appellant had given
false information to Oran whereas it was a part of the appellant’s defence that
he had not done so;

(c) The learned trial judge
instructed the jury that the appellant’s sole defence was that he had been
negligent whereas it was part of his defence that he had given no false
information.”

The substantive question argued on the hearing
of the appeal was whether the learned trial judge had erred in his direction to
the jury in respect of the law and evidence relating to Count 2. MacKrow was
not present on the hearing of the appeal nor was he represented by counsel.
However, he did file a factum and a memorandum in reply to the respondent’s
factum pursuant to leave granted by the Chief Justice of this Court.
Mr. Burke-Robertson, Q.C.,

[Page 26]

appeared for the Crown and developed the
evidence and points in issue with scrupulous fairness to the Crown and to the
appellant.

While the Crown was within its rights in
including Counts 1 and 2 in the one indictment, the fact that the two counts
were proceeded with in the one indictment did make for a very long and
complicated trial (over three weeks) in which it was difficult to keep separate
the evidence relating to Count 1 from that relating to Counts 2 and 3,
particularly as the wheelings and dealings of Bennett and the corporate
manipulations and financial difficulties of his companies, Hycrest Holdings
Limited and Hycrest Motels Limited, named in Count 1, were involved in both
Counts 1 and 2 and the same corporate manipulations and difficulties of these
companies and of a third company, Ideal Motels Limited, named in Count 2, were
also involved in respect of Count 2 as well as those of a fourth company,
Pacific American Motels Limited, not named in the count. The offence charged in
Count 2 was alleged to have taken place, according to the evidence, on or about
the 15th day of May, 1959. The evidence shows that the appellant was arrested
on the charge on January 5, 1962, and that in the interval civil litigation
over the transactions in question had taken place resulting in James Jack Oran,
the man named in Counts 2 and 3 recovering judgment against Bennett and MacKrow
in an amount of approximately $5,000 and costs. I mention this because in the
address of Mr. Mussallem, who was counsel for MacKrow at the trial, he
made reference to this lapse of time. He was interrupted by Ruttan J. and
directed to go no further with that submission as follows:

THE COURT: But you are criticizing the
Crown for not bringing the case earlier which, I think, is in fact criticism,
and I ask you not to go ahead with it.

Considered alone, perhaps nothing substantial
turns on this point although it is related to the question as to whether any
defence which was available to the appellant was properly and adequately put to
the jury by the learned trial judge. The fact that criminal proceedings were
not instituted for some 32 months after the alleged offence is said to have
been committed and then only after civil proceedings had been taken and a
judgment for some $5,000 obtained which was unsatisfied when the charge was

[Page 27]

laid, was in my view, a proper matter for
comment when the issue was, as in this case, one relating to whether or not a
person has been defrauded by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means.
Criminal proceedings brought long after the event complained of and following
civil proceedings that result in an unsatisfied judgment without any
explanation for the delay may well be looked upon with some suspicion by a jury
where the issue is financial loss arising out of a commercial transaction.

The basic facts upon which Counts 2 and 3 are
based are that on or about the 15th day of May, 1959, the person named in
Counts 2 and 3, the said James Jack Oran, had answered an advertisement in a
Saskatchewan paper relating to a motel which was for sale at White Rock,
British Columbia. He called at the Hycrest office in Vancouver on May 12, 1959,
and saw a Mrs. Young and Bennett. Following a discussion with these parties,
he decided to purchase the property. He signed a document (Exhibit 48) which is
headed “Offer for Purchase, Acceptance and Interim Receipt”, the vendor being
Pacific American Motels Limited. The purchase price was stated to be $47,500
payable $18,000 cash and an Agreement for Sale for the balance, $29,500 payable
over 15 years with interest at 6 per cent. He made a deposit of $1,000. He was
told at this time that there was a mortgage in favour of Associated Investors
Limited against the property for $12,000 payable at $225 per month. The offer
was submitted to Pacific American Motels Limited. Two days later he was
communicated with, and following a discussion, agreed to increasing the
interest rate to 7 per cent. He was then brought to MacKrow’s office which was
in the office of Hycrest Investments Limited, a motel on Denman Street in
Vancouver. MacKrow, who had been called to the Bar May 1, 1954, was engaged
principally in doing work for Bennett and his companies on a $1,200 a month fee
basis. This was the first time Oran had met MacKrow. In so far as going to
MacKrow, Oran testified:

A. I did say to Mrs. Young if I decide
to buy this property I will have to get a lawyer to draw up the transactions.

Q. Yes.

A. And she says, “Well, we have a lawyer
working with us, Mr. MacKrow, and that would be the most convenient, to
have him do the work.” And I said, “Well, he works for your company. Probably I
should still get a lawyer, some other lawyer.” And she was

[Page 28]

very emphatic, she said that it will cost
more to get some other lawyer, it will take more time, and besides MacKrow, he
does this work every day, it will be quicker, and the effect of what she said
was that it would be quicker and cheaper and it would be the best to have
MacKrow do the work. As a result of her suggestion I did engage MacKrow.

Then, in connection with the actual Agreement
for Sale which was prepared by MacKrow, Oran said that some two days later he
got a call to come to MacKrow’s office. This is when the Agreement for Sale
(Exhibit 51) was prepared and signed. Respecting the agreement, Mr. Oran
testified:

MR. COLTHURST:

Q. Who produced the agreement for sale,
Mr. Oran?

A. MacKrow did.

Q. And what, if any, discussion took place
about the document?

A. Well, I read over the first page terms.

Q. Yes?

A. And we agreed verbally with the terms,
the full amount $47,500.00, the down payment $18,000.00, of which I had already
paid $1,000.00.

Q. Yes?

A. And the monthly payments $263.51.

Q. Yes?

A. And there was a 15-year basis we agreed
verbally.

Q. Let me see that. Do you recall any
further discussion in connection with that agreement for sale?

A. Yes, I particularly noticed the
Associated Investors mortgage.

Q. And that is the mortgage that is
referred to on the first page of that document, is it?

A. That is right.

Q. Where it says subject to a mortgage in
favour of Associated Investors Limited, registered in the Land Registry office
under No. 238252C, which the vendors herein covenant to pay according to the
terms thereof?

A. Yes.

Q. And save harmless the purchasers
therefrom provided that should the vendors default in the payment of any monies
due under the said mortgage the purchaser may make payment of such monies to
the said mortgagee and the vendors shall allow the purchaser full credit
hereunder to the amount of such payment.

A. That is what I am referring to, yes.

Q. And was there any discussion in that
connection?

A. Well, we discussed the amount of the
mortgage and the standing and he said that is the mortgage that was on the
listing. It is approximately $12,000.00.

Q. And when you say “he”, who was “he”?

A. MacKrow.

Q. Yes. He said that is it. I am sorry, you
have already told us what he said. Yes, and what else?

A. That is the mortgage in good standing,
it is being paid off at $225.00 a month.

[Page 29]

Q. Yes.

A. I think there was another ten years to
go. So I did say, “Well, couldn’t I pay that directly to Associated Investors?”
Well, he said it really didn’t matter. The effect of what he said was that it
didn’t matter, the difference between $12,000.00 and the agreement for sale was
$29,500.00, and this particular mortgage is only $12,000.00 so even if the
vendor did default in the payments that I still had there was still $17,000.00
left. So it really didn’t matter, he said.

Q. And did you look at any other portion of
that agreement for sale?

A. Well, I went over all of it and they
said, I probably didn’t read all of the second page. MacKrow said, “Well, that
is the usual form,” and he emphasized paid in 15 years, I will get a clear
title, and that is all I asked to have the agreement for sale be what it is.

Q. And as far as looking now at the second
page of that agreement you say that you, as I recall the effect of what you
said, was you probably didn’t read it all. Did you read any of it or notice any
of it?

A. Well, I probably didn’t read it all, but
I noticed there were, this blank space.

Q. Yes?

A. And I think we discussed that. MacKrow
mentioned that if there were any changes or alterations it would be here. But
this is the usual blank space, the usual form that is used and I felt that that
was good enough.

Q. And you are referring to what blank
space? Just hold it up and show?

A. This one here.

Q. That is the blank space where again?

A. Right here.

Q. Where there is certain typewritten
words, is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. The typewritten words being what?

A. No exceptions.

After signing the agreement, Oran made out two
cheques totalling $17,060.18 payable to MacKrow. Oran then left and did not see
or speak to MacKrow again until some months later. Meanwhile, MacKrow proceeded
to have the agreement registered and in due course, on June 2, 1959, wrote Oran
at White Rock, British Columbia, as follows:

Dear Sir: Re sale to you of Ideal Motel,
White Rock.

The registration of the above-mentioned
sale has now been completed and I enclose herewith your copy of the agreement
for sale, which was registered in the New Westminster Land Registry Office
under No. 261951C. Also is enclosed a copy of the statement of adjustments for
your records.

As stated previously, Oran was advised of the
mortgage in favour of Associated Investors Limited before he saw MacKrow. The
charge against MacKrow was that in addition to the Associated Investors’
mortgage there was also registered against the title to the property which Oran
was buying a second mortgage given by Ideal Motels Limited to Issie Feldstein
dated September 19, 1958, for the sum of $12,000 payable on or before March 25,
1959. Oran was not advised of the existence of this mortgage when he signed the
offer to purchase (Exhibit 48) and did not learn of it until, in the month of
September 1959, he had a call from Feldstein advising him of the mortgage and
demanding payment and threatening foreclosure as the mortgage was then overdue.
He immediately got in touch with MacKrow who he says assured him the matter
would be taken care of. MacKrow communicated with Bennett who, after some delay
and because neither he nor Hycrest Motels Limited were able to pay off the
Feldstein mortgage, arranged along with solicitors for Oran to have Credit
Foncier Franco‑Canadien take title and pay off the two mortgages. This
left Oran to settle with Credit Foncier but the transaction resulted in an
actual loss of $2,507.80 to Oran. The motel cost him that much more than he had
agreed to pay for it in the first place. This loss was part of the unsatisfied
judgment previously mentioned which he subsequently recovered against MacKrow
and Bennett.

[Page 31]

The Crown alleged that MacKrow had knowledge of
the existence of the Feldstein mortgage on May 15, 1959, both from the fact
that he had prepared the mortgage in the first place in September 1958 and from
the fact that he participated in a meeting on April 8, 1959, at which a
document (Exhibit 35) was prepared by him and which dealt specifically with the
Feldstein mortgage. Exhibit 35 reads as follows:

Vancouver,
B.C.
April 8, 1959.

Hycrest
Motels Ltd.,
1120 Denman St.,
Vancouver, B.C.
Dear Sirs:

Re:
Transfer to us of El Rancho
Columbia, Fairlane, Triway
Motels.

This is to confirm our agreement with you
made this date with reference to the above transfer of motel properties, as
follows:—

1. We are to have full possession and title
to the above motels, together with all shares in companies owning any of the
said properties.

2. All adjustments between us with
reference to the said transfers are to be taken as settled by the transfer to
us of all shares in the company known as Ideal Motels Ltd., and by the transfer
to us of the property known as Buena Vista Motel, White Rock, B.C. You agree to
discharge at your expense “by April 26, 1959” the mortgage now on the Ideal
Motel property in the approximate amount of $13,800.00 held by one Issie Feldstein.

3. A full mutual release is to be executed
by both you and us.

Yours
very truly,

Pacific
American Motel Corp. Ltd.

The Crown says that MacKrow’s failure to bring
to Oran’s attention the fact of the existence on May 15, 1959, of the Feldstein
mortgage was fraud within the meaning of s. 323(1)  of the Criminal
Code . There is no evidence that MacKrow said in so many words that the
property was subject only to the Associated Investors’ mortgage or that there
was only one mortgage. Rather he inserted a clause in the Agreement for Sale
(Exhibit 51) to safeguard Oran in respect of the Associated Investors’ mortgage
only of which Oran had knowledge. The Crown’s position is that MacKrow’s
silence and failure to make known the existence

[Page 32]

of the Feldstein mortgage to Oran at that time
was fraud on his part. MacKrow, while admitting that he knew of the Feldstein
mortgage in September 1958 and that it was still unpaid as of April 8, 1959,
said that his failure to inform Oran of it was due to inadvertence on his part,
and while admitting negligence as a solicitor in failing to have a search made
of the title which would have shown the mortgage still on the title, he
insisted that it had been done innocently and in a hurry and without any intent
to defraud. The issue, therefore, which the jury had to decide was whether the
Crown had made out its case of fraud against MacKrow beyond a reasonable doubt.

The burden of proof was on the Crown to
establish the fraud. It relied strongly on Exhibit 35 quoted above, but it must
be noted that this exhibit specifically contained the statement that the
Feldstein mortgage was to be discharged by April 26, 1959. There was no direct
evidence that the appellant knew that this had not been done when he dealt
with. Oran on May 15. The jury was asked to conclude that because this mortgage
was registered against the property to MacKrow’s knowledge in April that it was
necessarily fraud on his part when he failed to communicate that fact to Oran
on May 15 even though the document (Exhibit 35) relied on so strongly by the
Crown itself provided for the mortgage being off the title by April 26. Much
stress was placed by the Crown on a document (Exhibit 56) dated May 22, 1959,
signed by one Ellen M. Rodgers, MacKrow’s secretary, which accompanied the
Agreement for Sale when it was tendered for registration in the Land Registry
Office on May 27, 1959. This document in which Rodgers said she was the
authorized agent of Oran stated that the Agreement for Sale was being
registered subject to both mortgages and listed the registered numbers of the
two mortgages. According to this witness, these numbers may have been typed in
after the document was prepared between May 22 and May 27, 1959. Obviously by
May 27, 1959, some one in MacKrow’s office was or became aware that the
Feldstein mortgage was still on the title because its registered number was
inserted at or prior to the time the Agreement for Sale was being tendered for
registration. MacKrow denied having prepared the document and there was no
evidence of the source from which the witness Rodgers got the number of the
Feldstein mortgage if, in

[Page 33]

fact, she was the one who actually typed in the
number. She did not identify MacKrow as the source from which she got the
number.

This summarizes the evidence relied on by the
Crown to bridge the gap between the time the Feldstein mortgage should have
been discharged according to Exhibit 35 and May 15 and upon which the Crown
argued that the jury must infer that MacKrow knew the mortgage had not been
discharged as of May 15 and that he fraudulently withheld that fact from Oran
in order to get the $17,000 cash for his principal client Bennett. It was
conceded that MacKrow did not personally profit from the alleged fraud.

This was the case which MacKrow had to answer.
The defences open to him on the evidence included (1) the contention that he
had made no false or any statement to Oran respecting the Feldstein mortgage
and (2) that his failure to tell Oran of the Feldstein mortgage was due to
inadvertence and was not deliberate or intended to mislead or defraud Oran.
Ruttan J. put the case to the jury as follows:

Now on the other hand in the second count,
in the Oran count, there is, I suggest to you, no evidence of a promise to do
something in the future. The evidence, if you accept it, on the part of Oran
is that a false statement was made to him at that time. In fact, I do not think
it is challenged that he was given false information. The defence is that it
was by negligence, by inadvertence, but I do not think it is disputed that he
was given false information, the false statement being once again, that there
was only one encumbrance on the property when, in fact, there was a second
encumbrance, once again a mortgage in the name of Issie Feldstein which was
never revealed to Oran until Feldstein himself called him up some months later
to warn him that he was going to foreclose.

(The italics are my own.)

In my view this was misdirection. The case against
the appellant was not that he had given false information but that he
had fraudulently withheld material information from Oran in order to
obtain the money which Oran paid to him on May 15, a situation essentially
different in character from that put to the jury in the quotation set out
above. See Regina v. Charters[1].

I am unable to say that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has occurred by reason of this misdirection. It follows
that the conviction against the appellant on Count 2 cannot stand.

[Page 34]

There remains the question as to whether a new
trial should be ordered. Crown counsel did not ask for a new trial in the event
that the conviction was set aside. The conviction will, accordingly, be quashed
and MacKrow acquitted on Count 2. His previous acquittals on Counts 1 and 3
completely dispose of the charges against him.

Appeal allowed, conviction quashed and appellant
acquitted.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Possession of obscene material
for purpose of publication, distribution or circulation—Retail
bookseller—Charge under s. 150(1) (a) of the Criminal Code —Whether three
offences included in charge—Whether accused should properly be charged under
s. 150(2) (a)—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 150.

The appellant company, the owner of two
retail bookshops and a warehouse for the storage of books, was convicted,
together with the individual appellants, of unlawfully having in their
possession obscene material for the purpose of publication, distribution or
circulation, contrary to s. 150(1) (a) of the Criminal Code . The
convictions were affirmed by a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal. The
accused were granted leave to appeal to this Court. There was no appeal from
the finding that the material was obscene. The accused submitted that the
information was void for duplicity and multiplicity and further that it had
been laid under the wrong subsection of s. 150 of the Code.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The gravamen of the offences charged in this
case is possession of a quantity of obscene matter. Once possession is
established it only remains for the Crown to lead evidence to prove one of the
various

[Page 39]

purposes for which the possession was had,
namely, publication, distribution or circulation. It is one offence only which
may be committed in different ways. In the circumstances of this case it was
not necessary to make each book or pamphlet the subject of a separate count.
The various titles recited in the different counts constituted nothing more
than particulars of the offences charged.

On the facts of this case, the submission
that the offence defined in s. 150(1) (a) of the Code could have no
application to retail booksellers, such as the appellants, and that the charges
should have been laid, under s. 150(2)(a), could not be
entertained. The evidence fully justified the inference that the distribution
of obscene matter was a part of the business in which the appellants were
engaged.

Droit criminel—Possession de matières
obscènes aux fins de les publier, distribuer ou mettre en
circulation—Libraire—Accusation portée sous l’art. 150(1) (a) du Code
criminel —L’accusation contient-elle trios infractions—L’acte d’accusation
aurait-il dû être porté sous l’art. 150(2) (a)—Code criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c.
51, art. 150.

La compagnie appelante, propriétaire de deux
librairies et d’un entrepôt servant à l’emmagasinage de livres, a été trouvée
coupable, ainsi que les autres appelants, d’avoir eu illégalement en leur
possession des matières obscènes aux fins de les publier, distribuer ou mettre
en circulation, le tout contrairement à l’art. 150(1)  (a) du Code
criminel . Le verdict de culpabilité fut confirmé par un jugement
majoritaire de la Cour d’appel. Les accusés ont obtenu permission d’en appeler
devant cette Cour. Aucun appel ne fut porté à l’encontre du verdict que les
matières étaient obscènes. Les accusés ont soutenu que l’acte d’accusation
était nul parce qu’il était double et multiple et en plus qu’il avait été porté
sous le mauvais alinéa de l’art. 150 du Code.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être rejeté.

La matière de l’infraction reprochée dans
cette cause est la possession d’une quantité de matières obscènes. Une fois que
la possession est établie, la Couronne n’a qu’à produire une preuve établissant
une des diverses fins pour lesquelles on en avait la possession, à savoir, la
publication, distribution ou mise en circulation. Il ne s’agit que d’une seule
infraction qui peut être commise de diverses manières. Dans les circonstances,
il n’était pas nécessaire de faire de chaque livre ou pamphlet le sujet d’un
chef d’accusation séparé. Les titres énumérés aux divers chefs d’accusation ne
constituaient autre chose qu’une communication de détails sur les infractions
reprochées.

En se basant sur les faits de cette cause, la
prétention que l’infraction telle que définie à l’art. 150(1)(a) du Code
ne peut s’appliquer à des libraires, tels que les appelants, et que l’acte
d’accusation aurait dû être porté sous l’art. 150(2)(a), ne peut pas
être admise. La preuve justifie amplement l’inférence que la distribution de
matières obscènes faisait partie des entreprises des appelants.

APPELS de trois jugements de la Cour d’appel
de la Colombie-Britannique[1],
confirmant un verdict de culpabilité. Appels rejetés.

[Page 40]

APPEALS from three judgments of the Court of
Appeal for British Columbia[2],
affirming a conviction. Appeals dismissed

Joseph Sedgwick, Q.C., and W.H. Deverell,
for the appellants.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—This is an appeal from three
judgments of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia1 rendered in accordance
with a decision of the majority of that Court (Bull J.A. dissenting) which
affirmed the convictions of the various appellants before Magistrate
G.W. Scott on three separate informations each alleging that the various accused
therein named “unlawfully had in their possession… for the purpose of
publication, distribution or circulation a quantity of obscene written matter
and pictures…” and each containing separate counts wherein the titles of a
number of allegedly obscene publications were recited.

The appellant Company, Fraser Book Bin Ltd., is
the owner of two retail book shops and a warehouse for the storage of books at
Vancouver and Ted Fraser, who is a Director and General Manager of that
Company, was at all material times in charge of the Company’s book shop at 1247
Granville Street where he was assisted by the appellant Harris while the
appellant Poirier was in charge of the Company’s other book shop at 6184 Fraser
Street.

The first information relates only to the shop
at 1247 Granville Street, the second to the shop at 6184 Fraser Street and the
third to the warehouse at 1390 Granville Street. Ted Fraser and Fraser Book Bin
Limited are charged in each of the informations but Harris is charged only in
the first and Poirier only in the second.

The learned Magistrate found that all the
publications referred to, except those specified in Count 3 of the first and
second informations and Count 1 of the third information, were obscene within
the meaning of s. 150(8)  of the Criminal Code  and Fraser, Harris
and Fraser Book Bin

[Page 41]

Ltd. were found guilty on the first and fourth
Counts of the first information on evidence which disclosed that the offending
books referred to in those counts were found on the shelves of the shop at 1247
Granville Street at a time when customers were present. The Magistrate
acquitted the accused on the second Count of this information on the ground
that he had a doubt as to whether they had the motion pictures therein referred
to in their possession “for the purpose of publication, distribution or
circulation”.

When the second and third informations came on
to be heard no evidence was given as counsel in both cases formally admitted
that the accused had the publications and motion pictures therein referred to
in their possession “for the purpose of publication, distribution or
circulation” and it was further admitted that the publications referred to in
Counts 1 and 2 of the second information and Counts 2 and 3 of the third
information were “identical in nature” with publications which the learned
Magistrate had found to be “obscene” at the trial of the first information.

Fraser, Harris and the Company appealed their
conviction on the first information on the ground that the shop at 1247
Granville Street was a retail book store exclusively operated for the purpose
of selling books to individuals and that the charges contained in that
information, alleging as they did that they had the publications “in their
possession… for the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation” were
charges framed in the language of s. 150(1)  (a) of the Criminal
Code  which section was intended to be reserved for the prosecution of
makers, publishers and wholesale distributors of obscene material and had no
application to the selling of such material by retail which is the subject of
s. 150(2) (a) of the Code.

The two subsections in question read as
follows:

150 (1) Every one commits an offence who

(a) makes, prints, publishes,
distributes, circulates, or has in his possession for the purpose of
publication, distribution or circulation any obscene written matter, picture,
model, phonograph record or other thing whatsoever, or…

150 (2) Every one commits an offence who
knowingly, without lawful justification or excuse,

(a) sells, exposes to public view or
has in his possession for such a purpose any obscene written matter, picture,
model, phonograph record or other thing whatsoever,…

[Page 42]

The essence of the submission in this regard is
that the accused in the first information were charged under the wrong
subsection and the distinction between the two sub-sections is said
to be reinforced by the fact that s. 150(6) provides that ignorance of the
nature or presence of the material by means of or in relation to which the offence
was committed is not a defence to a charge under s. 150(1)  (a)
whereas when a charge is laid under s. 150(2) (a) the burden rests
upon the Crown to prove that the accused had knowledge of the nature and
presence of the material in respect of which it was laid.

It was upon this latter ground that Bull J.A.,
in the course of his dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeal found that the
first information should have been quashed. This ground of appeal was, however,
not open to those convicted on the second and third informations because of the
formal admissions hereinbefore referred to.

The second ground of appeal, which applies to
all the informations, was unanimously dismissed by the Court of Appeal for
British Columbia and was the subject of an order granting leave to appeal to
this Court by which it was expressly confined to the issue raised by the
contention:

That each of the counts in each of the said
informations is bad and void for duplicity and multiplicity.

There is no appeal from the finding of the
learned Magistrate with respect to obscenity which was unanimously affirmed by
the Court of Appeal.

The appellants’ submission that all the counts
are void for “duplicity and multiplicity” is twofold. In the first place it is
contended that the charge of having in their “possession… for the purpose of publication,
distribution and circulation, a quantity of obscene written matter…”
involves three separate charges each of which should be the subject of a
separate count; and in the second place it is argued that possession of each
publication constitutes a separate offence which should have been charged
separately and that the counts each charging the accused with having a number
of different publications in their possession are therefore void.

I agree with the members of the Court of Appeal
that the gravamen of the offences charged in these informations

[Page 43]

is “possession” of a “quantity of obscene
matter…” and that the various titles recited in the different Counts constitute
nothing more than particulars of the offences charged of the kind which the
Court would have been justified in ordering to be delivered to the accused
under the provisions of s. 497 of the Code. In this regard I can do no
better than to adopt the language used by Maclean J.A., in the course of his
reasons for judgment in the Court of Appeal where he said:

In my view the gravamen of the charge is
‘possession’. Once possession is established it only remains for the Crown to
lead evidence to prove one of the various purposes for which the possession was
had, namely, publication, distribution or circulation. In other words, it is
one offence only which may be committed in different ways.

I am fortified in this view by Couture
v. The Queen, supra, where the charge of ‘having in possession for sale,
distribution or circulation’ was regarded as one offence. Duplicity was found
in that case only because the full charge alleged that the accused ‘made,
printed and had in possession for sale, distribution or circulation’.

Dealing with the second branch of the
appellants on duplicity, it is my view that the enumeration of a number of book
titles is merely a particularization of the expression ‘a quantity of obscene
written matter’. In my view, in the circumstances of this case it was not necessary
to make each book or pamphlet the subject of a separate count.

The submission that the offence defined in
s. 150(1)  (a) as charged in the first information could have no
application to retail booksellers such as the appellants named therein, was
advanced with great force by Mr. Sedgewick. In this regard it was argued
that a retail bookseller might well have acquired his stock in bulk and never
have read any of the offensive books or, indeed, that he might be a blind man,
and it was strenuously contended that Parliament could never have intended that
such a person could be exposed to a charge under s. 150(1)  (a) and
thus, by virtue of s. 150(6), be deprived of the defence that he was
ignorant of the presence or contents of such books which defence would have
been open to him if he had been charged as a “seller” under s. 150(2) (a).

However persuasive this argument may be thought
to be, it does not appear to me to fit the circumstances of the present case.
Here the appellant company, with the appellant Fraser as its General Manager,
was proved to be operating a warehouse from which books were distributed to its
two retail outlets one of which was referred to in the

[Page 44]

first information and was the place where the
third appellant, Harris, was employed. This was, in my opinion, an organization
for the distribution of books, a substantial number of which were found to be
obscene.

In this regard the following excerpt from the
evidence of the detective who supervised the seizure of the offending books
appears to me to be revealing:

I did go with Detective Matches to 1247
Granville Street, where I met Mr. Fraser and he told us at that time that
he was the General Manager of Fraser Book Bin and that particular store. He
took us to a warehouse at 1390 Granville and he told us he also had another
store at 6184 Fraser, that they did a large volume of business in mail order as
well as counter business, all over the world, both buying and selling.

I agree with the view expressed by Maclean J.A.
on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal that the word “distribution”
as used in s. 150(1)  (a) “is obviously a word of wider connotation
than ‘sale’ as sale is only one of a number of means of distribution”. The
appellant submitted that this construction would mean that everyone who “sells”
within the meaning of s. 150(2) (a) would also be guilty of the
offence defined in s. 150(1)  (a) and that the provisions of the
former section would thus be “reduced to a futility” to employ the
language used in the factum filed on behalf of the appellants. Like
Mr. Justice Maclean, however, I can envisage cases of individual sales
which would constitute an offence under s. 150(2) (a) and yet would
not be a “distribution” within the meaning of s. 150(1)  (a), and I
think also that there may well be cases of a bookseller who has in his shop a
scattered few of these publications amongst a mass of inoffensive books, where
a charge of possession for the purpose of sale contrary to s. 150(2) (a)
would be more appropriate than one relating to “distribution” under
s. 150(1)  (a).

There may, indeed, be many cases in which it is
difficult to determine which of these two subsections should be invoked in
a prosecution but, in my opinion, the present circumstances do not present any
such difficulty. I am satisfied that the evidence called in respect of the
first information fully justifies the inference that the distribution of
obscene written matter was a part of the business in which the appellants
Fraser and Fraser Book Bin Ltd. were engaged and that the appellant Harris was
employed as an active participant in that business.

[Page 45]

For these reasons I would dismiss the appeals of
all the appellants and affirm the convictions entered by the learned
Magistrate.

Appeals dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Unlawful and wilful damage to
public property—Defence of having acted under threat—Whether trial judge erred
in ruling evidence of compulsion inadmissible—Whether accused in danger as a
result of threats—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 7, 17, 371, 372.

The respondent was convicted of having
unlawfully and wilfully damaged public property. At trial, he admitted having
damaged the plumbing fixtures in the cell where he was incarcerated but,
through his counsel, he sought to introduce evidence to show that he had
committed this offence under the compulsion of threats and was therefore
entitled to be excused by virtue of s. 17  of the Criminal Code  and
that he was also entitled to avail himself of the Common Law defence of
“duress” by virtue of s. 7 of the Code. The nature of this evidence, as
outlined by counsel for the accused, was that the offence had been committed
during a disturbance in the course of which a substantial body of prisoners,
shouting in unison from their separate cells, threatened the respondent, who
was not joining in the disturbance, that if he did not

[Page 115]

break the plumbing fixtures in his cell he
would be kicked in the head, his arms would be broken and he would get a knife
in the back at the first opportunity. The trial judge ruled that the proposed
evidence did not indicate a defence or excuse available at law and ruled the
evidence inadmissible. The Court of Appeal held that the evidence should have
been presented to the jury, quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial. The
Crown appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed, and the conviction restored.

The trial judge was right in deciding that
the proposed evidence did not afford an excuse within the meaning of s. 17 
of the Criminal Code . The question of whether immediate threats of
future death or grievous bodily harm constitute an excuse for committing a
crime within the meaning of s. 17 of the Code and the question of whether
a person can be present within the meaning of that section when he is
locked in a separate cell from the place where the offence is committed are
both questions which depend upon the construction to be placed on
section 17  and they are therefore questions of law and not questions of
fact for the jury. Accepting the outline made by defence counsel as being an
accurate account of the evidence which was available, there was nothing in it
to support the defence that the act was not done wilfully within the meaning of
ss. 371(1) and 372(1) of the Code, and there was accordingly no ground to
justify the trial judge in permitting the proposed evidence.

Droit criminel—Dommage à un bien public
causé illégalement et volontairement—Défense de contrainte exercée par des
menaces—Le juge au procès a-t-il erré en décidant que la preuve de contrainte
était inadmissible—L’accusé était-il en danger comme résultat des menaces—Code
Criminel , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, arts. 7, 17, 371, 372.

L’intimé a été trouvé coupable d’avoir causé
illégalement et volontairement du dommage à un bien public. Lors du procès, il
a admis avoir endommagé la tuyauterie dans la cellule de la prison où il était
détenu mais, par l’entremise de son avocat, il a tenté d’introduire une preuve
démontrant qu’il avait commis cette offense sous l’effet de la contrainte
exercée par des menaces et qu’il avait droit en conséquence d’être excusé en
vertu de l’art. 17  du Code Criminel  et qu’il avait aussi le droit de se
prévaloir de la défense de droit commun de «coercition» en vertu de l’art. 7 du
Code. La nature de cette preuve, telle qu’exposée par son avocat, était à
l’effet que l’offense avait été commise à l’occasion d’un tumulte durant lequel
une partie considérable des prisonniers, criant tous ensemble à tue-tête de
leurs cellules respectives, avaient menacé l’intimé, qui ne s’était pas joint
au tumulte, que s’il ne brisait pas la tuyauterie de sa cellule on le
frapperait à la tête, on lui briserait les bras et on le poignarderait dans le
dos à la première occasion. Le juge au procès décida que la preuve que l’on
voulait offrir ne démontrait pas une défense ou une excuse disponible en droit
et rejeta la preuve comme n’étant pas admissible. La Cour d’appel jugea que la
preuve aurait dû être présentée au jury, cassa le verdict de culpabilité et
ordonna un nouveau procès. La Couronne en appela devant cette Cour.

Arrêt: L’appel
doit être maintenu et le verdict de culpabilité rétabli.

[Page 116]

Le juge au procès a eu raison de décider que
la preuve que l’on voulait offrir n’était pas une excuse selon le sens de
l’art. 17  du Code Criminel . La question de savoir si des menaces
immédiates de mort future ou de lésions corporelles graves constituent une
excuse pour commettre un crime dans le sens de l’art. 17 du Code et la question
de savoir si une personne peut être présente dans le sens de cet article
lorsqu’elle est enfermée sous clef dans une cellule séparée de l’endroit où
l’offense est commise, sont deux questions qui dépendent de l’interprétation de
l’art. 17  et qui sont en conséquence des questions de droit et non pas des
questions de fait pour le jury. Si l’on accepte l’exposé fait par l’avocat de
l’accusé comme étant un récit fidèle de la preuve qui était disponible, il n’y
a rien dans cet exposé pour supporter la défense que l’offense n’avait pas été
commise volontairement dans le sens des arts. 371(1) et 372(1) du Code, et en
conséquence il n’y avait aucune raison justifiant le juge au procès de
permettre la présentation de cette preuve.

APPEL de la Couronne d’un jugement de la Cour
d’appel de la Colombie-Britannique1, ordonnant un nouveau procès. Appel
maintenu.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1],
ordering a new trial. Appeal allowed.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
appellant.

Frank G.P. Lewis, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—This is an appeal by the Attorney
General of British Columbia from a judgment of the Court of Appeal1
of that Province, from which Mr. Justice MacLean dissented, and by which
it was ordered that the respondent’s conviction for unlawfully and wilfully
damaging public property and thereby committing mischief, should be set aside
and that a new trial should be had.

At the trial the respondent admitted having
damaged the plumbing fixtures in the cell where he was incarcerated at Oakalla
Prison Farm in British Columbia but, through his counsel, he sought to
introduce evidence to show that he had committed this offence under the
compulsion of threats and was therefore entitled to be excused for committing
it by virtue of the provisions of s. 17  of the Criminal Code 

[Page 117]

and that he was also entitled to avail himself
of the common law defence of “duress” having regard to the provisions of
s. 7  of the Criminal Code .

Under the latter section it is provided
that:

Every rule and principle of the common law
that renders any circumstance a justification or excuse for an act or a defence
to a charge continues in force and applies in respect of proceedings for an
offence under this Act… except in so far as they are altered by or are
inconsistent with this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.

The italics are my own.

I agree with the learned trial judge and with
MacLean J.A. that in respect of proceedings for an offence under the Criminal
Code  the common law rules and principles respecting “duress” as an excuse
or defence have been codified and exhaustively defined in s. 17  which
reads as follows:

17. A person who commits an offence under
compulsion by threats of immediate death or grievous bodily harm from a person
who is present when the offence is committed is excused for committing the
offence if he believes that the threats will be carried out and if he is not a
party to a conspiracy or association whereby he is subject to compulsion, but
this section does not apply where the offence that is committed is
treason, murder, piracy, attempted murder, assisting in rape, forcible
abduction, robbery, causing bodily harm or arson.

At the outset of the proceedings at the trial in
the present case and in the absence of the jury, Mr. Greenfield, who acted
on behalf of the accused, informed the Court that he intended to call evidence
of compulsion and duress and he elected to outline the nature of this evidence
which was that the offence had been committed during a disturbance, apparently
organized by way of protest, to damage property at the Prison Farm in the
course of which a substantial body of prisoners, shouting in unison from their
separate cells, threatened the respondent, who was not joining in the
disturbance, that if he did not break the plumbing fixtures in his cell he
would be kicked in the head, his arm would be broken and he would get a knife
in the back at the first opportunity.

The question which the learned trial judge was
required to determine on Mr. Greenfield’s application was whether the
proposed evidence which had been outlined to him indicated a defence or excuse
available at law; he decided

[Page 118]

that it did not and the majority of the Court of
Appeal having taken a different view, the Attorney General now appeals to this
Court.

There can be little doubt that the evidence
outlined by Mr. Greenfield, which was subsequently confirmed by the
evidence given by the ringleaders of the disturbance in mitigation of sentence,
disclosed that the respondent committed the offence under the compulsion of
threats of death and grievous bodily harm, but although these threats were
“immediate” in the sense that they were continuous until the time that the
offence was committed, they were not threats of “immediate death” or “immediate
grievous bodily harm” and none of the persons who delivered them was present in
the cell with the respondent when the offence was committed. I am accordingly
of opinion that the learned trial judge was right in deciding that the proposed
evidence did not afford an excuse within the meaning of s. 17  of the Criminal
Code ,

In the course of his most thoughtful judgment in
the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Norris had occasion to say:

The question of whether or not a person
threatening was present goes to the question of the grounds for the fear which
the appellant might have. In my opinion a person could be present making a
throat although separated by the bars of the cell. These are all matters which
should have gone to the jury, as was the question of whether or not the threat
of death or grievous bodily harm was an immediate one—a question of degree.
They might well consider that the threat was immediate as being continuous, as
it was in this case, that it would be all the more frightening because of the
uncertainty as to when it actually might happen, and therefore force him to act
as he did.

With the greatest respect it appears to me that
the question of whether immediate threats of future death or grievous bodily
harm constitute an excuse for committing a crime within the meaning of
s. 17  and the question of whether a person can be “present” within the
meaning of that section when he is locked in a separate cell from the
place where the offence is committed are both questions which depend upon the
construction to be placed on the section and they are therefore questions
of law and not questions of fact for the jury. See Vail v. The Queen[2] and The Queen v. Sikyea[3].

[Page 119]

In support of the suggestion that the threat in
the present case was “immediate and continuous” Mr. Justice Norris relied
on the case of Subramaniam v. Public Prosecutor[4], in which the Privy Council decided that
the trial judge was wrong in excluding evidence of threats to which the
appellant was subjected by Chinese terrorists in Malaya. In that case it was
found that the threats were a continuous menace up to the moment when the
appellant was captured because the terrorists might have come back at any time
and carried them into effect. Section 94 of the Penal Code of the Federated
Malay States, which the appellant sought to invoke in that case provided:

94. Except murder and offences included in
Chapter VI punishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a
person who is compelled to do it by threats, which, at the time of doing it,
reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person will
otherwise be the consequence;…

The distinctions between the Subramaniam case
and the present one lie in the fact that Subramaniam might well have had
reasonable cause for apprehension that instant death would result from his
disobeying the terrorists who might have come back at any moment, whereas it is
virtually inconceivable that “immediate death” or “grievous bodily harm” could
have come to Carker from those who were uttering the threats against him as
they were locked up in separate cells, and it is also to be noted that the
provisions of s. 17  of the Criminal Code  are by no means the same
as those of s. 94 of the Penal Code of the Federated Malay States; amongst
other distinctions the latter section contains no provision that the
person who utters the threats must be present when the offence is committed in
order to afford an excuse for committing it.

Both Mr. Justice Norris and
Mr. Justice Branca in delivering their separate reasons for judgment in
the Court of Appeal, expressed the view that the evidence which was tendered
should have been admitted on the issue of whether the respondent acted wilfully
in damaging the prison plumbing or whether he was so affected by the threats
uttered against him as to be incapable of adopting any other course than the
one which he did.

[Page 120]

The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code  read
as follows:

372(1) Every one commits mischief who
wilfully

(a) destroys or damages property,…

(3) Every one who commits mischief in
relation to public property is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for fourteen years.

On this phase of the matter, Mr. Justice
Norris had this to say:

In making the ruling which he did the
learned trial judge deprived the appellant of what could be a substantial
defence to the charge or an excuse under s. 17  without hearing the
evidence. The jury could not decide whether the act was in fact wilful. This
was not a matter on which the judge might rule. The length to which the
evidence might go to disprove the essentials of the charge or to prove the
requirements of s. 17  could never in the absence of the evidence of witnesses
be apparent either to the learned judge or to the jury.

With the greatest respect, this portion of
Mr. Justice Norris’ reasons for judgment appears to overlook the fact that
“the length to which the evidence might go…” was fully outlined to the learned judge
by counsel for the respondent when he was making the application.

In this regard it is important to bear in mind
the fact that “wilful” as it is used in Part IX of the Criminal Code  is
defined in s. 371 (1)  which reads, in part, as follows:

371(1) Every one who causes the occurrence
of an event by doing an act or by omitting to do an act that it is his duty to
do, knowing that the act or omission will probably cause the occurrence of the
event and being reckless whether the event occurs or not, shall be deemed, for
the purposes of this Part, wilfully to have caused the occurrence of the event.

The evidence outlined to the learned trial judge
discloses that the criminal act was committed to preserve the respondent from
future harm coming to him, but there is no suggestion in the evidence tendered
for the defence that the accused did not know that what he was doing would
“probably cause” damage. Accepting the outline made by defence counsel as being
an accurate account of the evidence which was available, there was in my view
nothing in it to support the defence that the act was not done “wilfully”
within the meaning of s. 371(1)  and 372(1)  of the Criminal Code  and
there was accordingly no ground to justify the learned trial judge in
permitting the proposed evidence to be called in support of such a defence.

[Page 121]

In view of all the above, I would allow this
appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the
conviction.

Appeal allowed and conviction
restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Common gaming
house—Premises occupied by branch of Canadian Legion—Bingo—Whether bona fide
social club—Criminal law, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 168 (2) (a) (i), (ii),
176.

The respondents, an incorporated branch of the Canadian Legion
and its secretary, were convicted on a charge of keeping a common gaming house,
contrary to s. 176  of the Criminal Code . They operated bingo games
afternoons and evenings, six days per week, at which the daily attendance
averaged 1,800 persons. The games were open to the public. The participants had
to pay an admission fee of 50 cents, and if they wished to share in the prize
money (and everybody did), they had to pay a further 50 cents. The respondents
retained only the 50 cents admission fee; all other moneys received were
returned on the same day as prizes to successful participants. The respondents
were acquitted by the Court of Appeal. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to
this Court on the question as to whether the premises were used by an
incorporated bona fide social club within the meaning of s. 168(2) (a)
of the Code.

Held: The appeal should be allowed and the convictions
restored.

The premises in question were not being used as a bona fide
social club. Their use for bingo on such a wide-spread scale contradicted any
possible inference of their use as a bona fide social club. The whole or
a portion of the bets on or proceeds from the games were directly or indirectly
paid to the keeper. The significant feature of subs. (2)(a)(i) of s. 168
is not the ultimate disposition of the moneys received by the keeper but the
simple fact of payment to the keeper. It was also apparent that the respondents
failed to qualify for the exemption under subs. (2)(a)(ii). It was
impossible to break down what the participants paid into a 50 cents charge for
admission and a further charge for the cards for the purpose of paying lip
service to the requirements of that subsection. The word ""persons"" in
subs. (2)(a)(ii) means persons who play bingo in premises while used by
a social club in a bona fide manner in keeping with the objects for
which it was incorporated.

168(2)(a)(i), (ii), 176.

Les intimés, une branche de la Légion
canadienne constituée en corporation et son secrétaire, ont été trouvés
coupables sur une accusation d'avoir

[Page 4]

tenu une maison de jeu, contrairement à
l'art. 176  du Code criminel . Ils exploitaient des jeux de bingo l'après-midi
et le soir, six jours par semaine, et auxquels 1,800 personnes assistaient en
moyenne chaque jour. Les jeux étaient accessibles au public. Les joueurs
devaient payer une cotisation d'admission de 50 sous, et s'ils désiraient
obtenir des prix, ils devaient payer une autre somme de 50 sous, ce que tous
les joueurs faisaient. Les intimés gardaient seulement le 50 sous de cotisation
d'admission; tous les autres argents reçus étaient remis le même jour comme
prix aux joueurs gagnants. Le verdict de culpabilité fut renversé par la Cour
d'Appel. La Couronne a obtenu la permission d'en appeler devant cette Cour sur
la question de savoir si le local en question était utilisé par un club social
authentique constitué en corporation selon le sens de l'art. 168(2) (a)
du Code.

Arrêt: L'appel doit être maintenu et le verdict
de culpabilité rétabli.

Le local en question
n'était pas utilisé comme club social authentique. Son usage pour des jeux de
bingo sur une échelle aussi étendue contredisait toute inférence possible qu'il
pouvait être utilisé comme club social authentique. La totalité ou une partie
des paris sur les jeux ou des recettes de ces jeux était directement ou
indirectement payée au tenancier. La caractéristique significative du sous-para.
(2) (a) (i) de l'art. 168 n'est pas la disposition finale des argents
reçus par le tenancier mais le simple fait du paiement au tenancier. Il était
évident de plus que les intimés n'avaient pas réussi à se qualifier sous
l'exemption du sous-para. (2)(a)(ii). Il était impossible de répartir ce
que les joueurs avaient payé entre une cotisation pour admission de 50 sous et
une charge additionnelle pour les cartes dans le but de satisfaire seulement
des lèvres les exigences du sous-paragraphe. Le mot « personnes »
dans le sous-para. (2)(a)(ii) signifie les personnes qui jouent le bingo
dans le local alors qu'il est utilisé par un club social d'une manière
authentique selon les objets pour lesquels il avait été incorporé.

APPEL d'un jugement
de la Cour d'Appel de la Colombie-Britannique, renversant un verdict de
culpabilité. Appel maintenu.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia, reversing a conviction. Appeal allowed.

W. G. Burke-Robertson,
Q.C., for the appellant.

W. J. Wallace, for the
respondents.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

JUDSON J.:—The respondents were
charged under s. 176  of the Criminal Code  with keeping a common gaming
house. The issue in the appeal is whether the case is covered by the exception
contained in s. 168(2)  (a) of the Criminal Code , which reads:

(2) A place is not a common
gaming house within the meaning of subparagraph (i) or clause (B) or (C) of
subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (d) of subsection (1)

[Page 5]

(a) while it is
occupied and used by an incorporated bona fide social club or branch
thereof if

(i) the whole or any portion
of the bets on or proceeds from games played therein is not directly or
indirectly paid to the keeper thereof, and

(ii) no fee in excess of ten
cents an hour or fifty cents a day is charged to persons for the right or
privilege of participating in the games played therein;…

The accused were convicted by the
magistrate but acquitted on appeal. Leave to appeal was granted to this Court
on the following question of law:

Was the place No. 2655 Main
Street, Vancouver, in the circumstances of the charge, used by an incorporated bona
fide social club within the meaning of Section 168 , Subsection (2) (a) of
the Criminal Code  of Canada?

The facts are not in dispute. The
respondent, Branch 177 of the Royal Canadian Legion, is an incorporated branch
of the Royal Canadian Legion. The respondent Elmer MacDonald is the secretary-manager
of Branch 177. The premises occupied by Branch 177 are at 2655 Main Street, Vancouver, a building
constructed and owned by Mount Pleasant War Memorial Community Co-operative
Association, which was organized by and operated by Legion members. This
building consists of four floors, including the basement. The basement is
leased to persons who run a bowling alley. The other three floors are leased to
Branch 177 for an annual rental of approximately $75,000. The first floor is
used for bingo games afternoons and evenings, six days per week, at which the
daily attendance has averaged 1,800 persons.

Members of the public wishing to
play bingo were admitted upon payment of a fifty cent admission fee. In order
to participate in prize money, a further fifty cents was then paid. Although it
was possible to play bingo without payment of a further fifty cents, and
without, therefore, the right to participate in prize money, no one did so. The
evidence of the respondent MacDonald was that this rule came into effect in
1962 but that no one availed himself of the opportunity although nearly half a
million persons played bingo in this establishment in the year 1963 alone.

The opportunity to share in the
prize money came from the sale of cards at fifty cents and a dollar each.
Branch 177 

[Page 6]

retained only the fifty cent
admission fee; all other moneys received were returned on the same day as
prizes to successful participants.

On these undisputed facts, the
prosecution succeeds on the ground that 2655
 Main Street was not being used as a bona
fide social club. It was a place open to the public without discrimination
and in daily use as a centre of public gambling. Nothing turns in this case
upon s. 168(3), which places the onus on the accused of proving that a place is
not a common gaming house. The undisputed facts speak for themselves. The
public was admitted on payment of a fifty cent admission fee. Then, if they
wished, they could all participate in gambling, and they all did. This is not
occupation and use by a bona fide social club. It is unnecessary to go
into the objects of the Canadian Legion or its incorporated Branch 177. The use
of these premises for bingo on such a widespread scale contradicts any possible
inference of the use as a bona fide social club.

The whole or a portion of the
bets on or proceeds from the games played at 2655 Main Street were directly
or indirectly paid to the keeper. The respondents were required to show under
s. 168(3) that this was not so in order to come within the exception. Again,
nothing turns upon presumptions or onus of proof. The evidence is clear that
the admission fees collected at the door plus all further moneys received from
players were paid to cashiers and persons selling cards and tickets who were
assisting and acting on behalf of Branch 177. These persons and Branch 177 were
keepers within the meaning of the section. All the moneys were paid to the
keeper directly and the keeper then retained all admission fees and disbursed
the other moneys paid by players in the form of prizes for those who won. The
significant feature of subs. (2) (a) (i) is not the ultimate disposition
of the moneys received by the keeper but the simple fact of payment to the
keeper. This alone is sufficient to take the respondents outside the operation
of subs. (2) (a) (i).

On the above facts it is also
apparent that the respondents failed to qualify for the exemption under subs.
(2)(a)(ii). More than fifty cents per day was charged to persons for the
right or privilege of participating in the games. Again, it is clear on the
evidence that all those who went to the premises, went for the purpose of
participating in the game in the hope of winning a prize. All bingo players 

[Page 7]

during the period covered by the
charge and as far back as 1962 paid more than fifty cents per day. It is
impossible to break down what they paid into a fifty cent charge for admission
and a further charge for the cards for the purpose of paying lip service to the
requirements of subs. (2) (a) (ii).

Both the learned magistrate and
the Court of Appeal felt that it was necessary to put an interpretation on the
word ""persons"" in subs. (2)(a)(ii). The magistrate held that
the word meant persons who were members of the club or guests of the members of
the club. The Court of Appeal was of the contrary opinion and held that the
word was completely general in its scope. One must, however, read the section
as a whole. There are only two exceptions to the general definition of
""common gaming house"". These are social clubs and charitable or
religious organizations. We are not concerned with the latter in this case.
They may hold an occasional bingo if the proceeds go to charity. The other
exception is ""use or occupation by an incorporated bona fide social
club"" on certain conditions. In this context the word ""persons""
in subs. (2) (a) (ii) means persons who play bingo in premises while
used by a social club in a bona fide manner in keeping with the objects
for which it was incorporated. It does not mean the public at large who played
bingo in the circumstances of the charge, because the social club, assuming
that it was one, was not being operated in a bona fide manner.

I would answer the question on
which leave was granted in the negative and restore the conviction of both
respondents.

Appeal allowed.

APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN

corpus—Leave to appeal—Criminal Code , 1953-64 (Can.), c.51, ss. 597(1)(b),
691(2)—Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c.259,s. 41(3).

The appellant was found guilty of breaking and entering, and
his appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. His subsequent application for
a writ of habeas corpus was dismissed, and an appeal from that dismissal

[Page 195]

was rejected by the Court of Appeal. He appealed to this Court
from that judgment and also applied for leave to appeal to this Court. 

Held: Both the appeal and the application for leave to
appeal should be dismissed.

The appellant is confined in a penitentiary in consequence of
his conviction and sentence by a Court of competent jurisdiction. The writ was
therefore properly refused. 

Subsection 3 of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act precludes the
granting of leave to appeal to this Court under that Act.

There was no question of law raised by the appellant which
would warrant the granting of leave to appeal under s. 597(1)  (b) of the
Criminal Code .

There was no other remedy which the appellant was entitled to
seek in this Court.

No one appearing for the
appellant.

S. Kujawa, for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

MARTLAND J.:—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, which dismissed an
appeal by the appellant, based upon s. 691(2)  of the Criminal Code , from
the dismissal by Chief Justice Bence of the appellant's application for a writ
of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum.

I have considered all of the
submissions made by the appellant, and in my opinion this appeal fails. The
appellant is confined in a penitentiary in consequence of his conviction and
sentence by a court of competent jurisdiction, and I think the learned Chief
Justice was right in refusing to grant the writ.

The appellant further requests
leave to appeal to this Court under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act.
Subsection (3) of that section precludes the granting of such leave.

There is no question of law
raised by the appellant which would warrant the granting of leave to appeal
under s. 597(1)  (b) of the Criminal Code .

Other than the foregoing, there
is no remedy which the appellant is entitled to seek in this Court.

EN APPEL DE LA COUR DU BANC DE LA REINE,
PROVINCE DE QUÉBEC.

Criminal law—Possession of stolen
article—Proof of possession within
meaning of s. 296  of the Criminal Code .

The appellant was found guilty of having in his possession an
automobile radio knowing that it had been stolen. The radio was stolen by one
Corbin and hidden by him somewhere in the lower town of Montreal. A few hours
later, in the evening, Corbin and two other persons were in an automobile
driven by the appellant who was accompanied by one Whitworth. The car was
driven towards the lower town and stopped in the vicinity of the place where
Corbin had hidden the radio. At that time or a few minutes earlier Corbin told
the appellant that he had something to give him. Corbin went to get the radio
and brought it back, hiding it under his coat. After dropping off Corbin and
his two companions, the appellant drove Whitworth to a place where the latter
hid the radio. The appellant testified that during the trip he had declared ""Moi je veux rien avoir avec ça"".

The Court of Appeal, by a majority
judgment, dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge held that it has not been
established that the appellant had had physical possession or control of the
radio. The appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the question
as to whether there was in the record legal proof justifying the conclusion
that he had had possession within the meaning of s. 296  of the Criminal
Code .

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

The evidence reasonably established that the trial judge could
judicially conclude—as he did—that the appellant knew that the article given to
him by Corbin was the radio, that he knew that this was a stolen article and
that he had possession at least for an appreciable time. If the declaration of
the appellant, as testified to by him, justified the

[Page 141]

trial judge to
conclude that the appellant knew that this was a stolen article, the trial
judge was free to believe or disbelieve that the appellant had really made that
declaration. Having regard to ss. 3(4) and 300 of the Code and having regard to
the record, nothing could justify-to validly set aside the verdict of guilty.

Droit criminel—Possession d'un objet volé—Preuve
de possession au sens de l'art. 296  du Code Criminel .

L'appelant fut trouvé coupable d'avoir eu en sa
possession un radio d'automobile sachant qu'il avait été volé. Ce radio fut
volé par un nommé Corbin qui le cacha dans le bas de la ville de Montréal.
Quelques heures plus tard, dans la soirée, Corbin et deux autres personnes
prirent place dans le nord de la ville dans l'automobile de l'appelant qui
était accompagné d'un nommé Whitworth. Ils descendirent vers le bas de la ville
pour s'arrêter dans le voisinage de l'endroit où Corbin avait caché le radio. A
ce moment ou quelques instants auparavant Corbin informa l'appelant qu'il avait
quelque chose à lui donner. Corbin alla chercher le radio et le rapporta en le
cachant sous son manteau. Après avoir laissé Corbin et ses deux compagnons en
cours de route, l'appelant conduisit Whitworth à un endroit où celui-ci cacha
le radio. L'appelant témoigna qu'au cours de la randonnée il avait déclaré:
«Moi je veux rien avoir avec ça».

La Cour d'Appel, par un jugement majoritaire,
rejeta l'appel. Le juge dissident jugea qu'il n'avait pas été établi que
l'appelant avait eu la possession physique ou le contrôle du radio. L'appelant
a obtenu permission d'appeler devant cette Cour sur la question de savoir s'il
y avait au dossier une preuve légale justifiant la conclusion qu'il y avait eu
possession au sens de l'art. 296  du Code Criminel .

Arrêt: L'appel doit
être rejeté.

L'ensemble de la preuve établit raisonnablement
que le juge au procès pouvait judicieusement conclure—comme il le fit—que
l'appelant savait que l'objet dont Corbin lui fit don était le radio, qu'il
savait qu'il s'agissait d'un objet volé, et qu'il en avait eu, au moins pour un
temps appréciable, la possession. Si la déclaration de l'appelant, rapportée
dans son témoignage, permettait au juge de déduire qu'il savait alors qu'il
s'agissait d'un objet volé, le juge était libre de croire ou de ne pas croire
que l'appelant avait véritablement fait cette déclaration. Au regard des arts. 3(4)
et 300 du Code et du dossier, rien ne permet d'écarter validement
la déclaration de culpabilité.

l'appelant.

J. Bellemare,
pour l'intimée.

Le jugement de la Cour fut rendu par

Le Juge
Fauteux:—Accusé d'avoir à Montréal, le 30 mars 1961, (i)
volé un radio d'automobile, d'une valeur de $135, et (ii) eu en sa possession
ce radio, sachant qu'il était

[Page 142]

volé, l'appelant, à l'issue du procès, fut
acquitté du vol et trouvé coupable de recel.

Il appela de cette condamnation à la Cour du
banc de la reine2
siégeant en appel, où il soutint en somme que les éléments du recel n'avaient
pas été légalement prouvés. Cette prétention fut rejetée comme non fondée par
MM. les Juges Taschereau et Owen, formant
la majorité. M. le Juge Bissonnette, dissident, fut d'avis qu'il n'était pas
établi que l'accusé avait eu la possession physique ou le contrôle du radio.
L'appel fut rejeté.

Dans un pourvoi subséquent à cette Cour,
l'appelant invoqua la dissidence prononcée en Cour d'Appel et soumit
particulièrement, comme grief d'appel, suivant la permission d'appeler par lui
obtenue, qu'il n'y a au dossier aucune preuve légale justifiant la Cour de
conclure que l'appelant a eu la possession de ce radio au sens de l'art. 296  du
Code Criminel  sous lequel il avait été accusé.

Les témoins entendus sur les circonstances
précédant et accompagnant le fait reproché à l'appelant sont tous plus ou moins
impliqués en l'affaire. Leurs témoignages, non dépourvus de réticences ou de
contradictions, permettent d'en faire ce résumé.

Dans l'après-midi du 30 mars 1961, Fernand Corbin vola le radio en question alors
qu'il était fixé à une automobile stationnée dans le bas de la ville en arrière
d'un immeuble de la rue St-Denis, près de la rue Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes,
véhicule qu'il avait illégalement déplacé aux fins de ce vol. Il cacha le radio
dans une cour privée attenante à la rue Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes et dont l'accès
était protégé par une clôture. Le même jour, vers les neuf heures du soir,
Corbin, Marcel Plante et Charles Vincent, se trouvant alors dans le nord de la
ville, prirent place dans une automobile conduite par l'appelant, en compagnie
duquel se trouvait déjà Wayne Whitworth. Tous ces occupants de la voiture, à
l'exception de Rotondo qui était âgé de près de quarante ans, étaient des
jeunes gens de quinze à dix-neuf ans. Ils descendirent tous vers le bas de la
ville pour s'arrêter dans le voisinage immédiat de l'endroit où Corbin avait
caché le radio. C'est alors que Corbin, muni d'outils, se rendit dans la cour
privée, prit le radio et le rapporta à l'automobile en le cachant sous son

pants de la voiture, à l'exception de Rotondo
et Wayne Whitworth, se firent laisser à une salle de pool et Rotondo conduisit
Whitworth à un endroit où celui-ci cacha le radio. A un certain moment, avant
ou au moment d'arriver à la cour privée, Corbin informa Rotondo qu'il avait
quelque chose à lui donner. Il ne fait aucun doute, suivant la preuve, que ce
quelque chose était le radio que Corbin avait rapporté à l'automobile avec ses
outils, au vu de certains sinon de tous les occupants de la voiture. Sans
entrer dans le détail et la discussion des témoignages rendus par ces jeunes
gens et l'appelant, l'ensemble de la preuve faite par ces témoins, dont la
tenue en Cour aussi bien que les témoignages ont pu être appréciés par le Juge
au procès, établit raisonnablement que ce dernier pouvait judicieusement
conclure—comme il le fit—que l'appelant savait que l'objet dont Corbin lui fit
don était le radio, qu'il savait qu'il s'agissait d'un objet volé, et enfin
qu'il en avait eu, au moins pour un temps appréciable, la possession. Entendu
comme témoin, pour sa propre défense, Rotondo admit avoir déjà été condamné
pour vol avec effraction et recel. Il témoigna qu'à un moment, au cours de
cette randonnée en automobile, il avait déclaré:—«Moi je veux rien avoir à
faire avec ça». Si cette déclaration, rapportée dans son témoignage, permettait
au Juge de déduire que Rotondo savait alors qu'il s'agissait d'un objet volé,
le Juge était libre de croire ou de ne pas croire que Rotondo avait
véritablement fait cette déclaration au cours de l'affaire. La section 4 de
l'art. 3  du Code Criminel  définit ainsi la possession:

Aux fins de la présente loi,

a) Une personne est en possession d'une chose lorsqu'elle l'a en sa
possession personnelle ou que, sciemment,

(i) elle l'a en la
possession ou garde réelle d'une autre personne, ou

(ii) elle l'a en un
lieu qui lui appartient ou non ou qu'elle occupe ou non, pour son propre usage
ou avantage ou celui d'une autre personne; et

b) Lorsqu'une de deux ou plusieurs personnes, au su et avec le
consentement de l'autre ou des autres, a une chose en sa garde ou possession,
cette chose est censée sous la garde et en la possession de toutes ces
personnes et de chacune d'elles.

Et l'article 300 édicté:

Pour l'application de l'article 296  et de
l'alinéa b) du paragraphe (1) de l'article 298, l'infraction
consistant à avoir en sa possession est consommée lorsqu'une personne a, seule
ou conjointement avec une autre, la

[Page 144]

possession ou le contrôle d'une chose mentionnée
dans ces articles ou lorsqu'elle aide à la cacher ou à en disposer, selon le
cas.

Ayant attentivement considéré la preuve et
tous les moyens de droit soulevés de la part de l'appelant, je dirais qu'au
regard de la loi et du dossier, rien ne permet d'écarter validement
la déclaration de culpabilité prononcée contre l'appelant
en première instance et confirmée par le jugement de la Cour du banc de la
reine siégeant en appel.

Je renverrais l'appel.

Appel rejeté.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Indictment—Duplicity—Charge of
selling as food “dead animals” contrary to s. 25 (b) of Food and Drugs Act ,
1952-53 (Can.), c. 88 and regulations—“Dead animals” defined by regulations as
either improperly killed or affected with disease—Whether indictment void for
duplicity—Whether two different modes of committing single offence—Criminal
Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 703.

Criminal law—Mandamus—County Court judge
erroneously quashing indictment for duplicity on preliminary objection—Whether
order lies to compel judge to proceed with indictment.

The appellant was charged with having sold as
food “dead animals” in violation of s. B.14.010 of the Food and Drug
Regulations, thereby committing an indictable offence contrary to s. 25 (b)
of the Food and Drugs Act , 1952-53 (Can.), c. 38. At the trial after the
indictment was read and before a plea was entered, the appellant moved to have the
indictment quashed for duplicity. The County Court judge quashed the indictment
on that ground. The basis for his judgment being that by the definition in s.
14.012 of the regulations, “dead animals” could mean either animals not
properly killed or diseased animals. The Crown then moved for an order of
mandamus directing the County Court judge or some other judge of the County
Court to proceed with the trial on the indictment as framed. The order was
granted and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The appellant
was granted leave to appeal to this Court, and argued that mandamus did

[Page 58]

not lie in this case, and secondly, that the
indictment was void for duplicity.

Held (Cartwright
and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Taschereau
C.J. and Judson and Ritchie JJ.: There was no duplicity on the face of the
indictment. It charged only the one offence of selling dead animals, and
regulation B.14.012 did no more than define two different modes of committing
the same offence. The phrase “dead animals” was not a synonym for meat. A
butcher sells meat, not “dead animals”.

Mandamus was available to the Crown in this
case. The cases of Re McLeod v. Amiro, 27 O.L.R. 232, R. v. Justices
of Middlesex (1877), 2 Q.B.D. 516 and R. v. Hannah and MacLean, 77
C.C.C. 32, did not touch the problem in the present case where the indictment
was quashed before plea and no trial was held. The trial judge can be compelled
to give a decision on the merits and it was no answer to such an application to
say that he had exercised his jurisdiction in quashing the indictment and that
such a decision could not be reviewed. The trial judge had the power to deal
with the form of the indictment and he was acting within his jurisdiction when
he erroneously quashed the indictment. He was there to try the charge. It was
proper, in the circumstances, to issue the writ of mandamus.

Per Cartwright
J., dissenting: The phrase “dead animal” is, for the purpose of the
regulations, given two special meanings to the exclusion of all other meanings.
The indictment must be read as if the extended meanings of that phrase were set
out in it. Regulation B.14.010, read, as it must be to render it intelligible,
with the definition of “dead animal”, creates two distinct offences and not one
offence which could be committed in two modes. The indictment was therefore
void for duplicity.

On the assumption that the trial judge’s
decision that the indictment was void for duplicity was wrong in law, mandamus
did not lie.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: There is no doubt that mandamus is an extraordinary remedy by which
a superior Court may direct any inferior tribunal to do some particular thing
which appertains to its duty and which it has declined to do, and where, as in
the present case, there is no other remedy available. But the argument of the
Crown that mandamus will lie to compel the trial judge to hear this case on the
merits, could not be supported. The trial judge did not decline jurisdiction
but accepted it and, as part of the legal merits of the case, found that the
indictment was void for duplicity. His decision was a decision upon the legal
merits. Consequently, mandamus to compel him to do his duty did not lie despite
the fact that the lower Courts were of the opinion that he was in error in the
performance of his duty.

The indictment, furthermore, was void for
duplicity.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, affirming the
granting of an order of mandamus by Grant J. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright and Spence
JJ. dissenting.

[Page 59]

J.R. Maurice Gautreau, for the appellant.

T.D. MacDonald, Q.C., and Arthur C.
Whealy, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Judson and
Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

JUDSON J.:—The appellant Raymond Joseph Kipp was
charged with the offence of selling as food, dead animals or parts thereof in
violation of the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act . He was committed
for trial after a preliminary hearing and he elected to be tried under Part XVI
of the Criminal Code  by a judge without a jury.

At the trial after the indictment was read and
before a plea was entered by the appellant, his counsel objected to the form of
the indictment. The County Court Judge quashed the indictment on the sole
ground that it was void for duplicity. The Crown then moved for an order of
mandamus directing the County Court Judge or some other Judge of the County
Court Judges’ Criminal Court for the County of Carleton to proceed with the trial of the
accused on the indictment as framed. Grant J. made this order and also set
aside the quashing of the indictment[1]. The
Court of Appeal affirmed the order of Grant J. Kipp now appeals with leave of
this Court.

I agree with Grant J. that this indictment is
not void for duplicity. It reads as follows:

That he, the said Raymond Joseph Kipp,
between the 9th day of August, A.D. 1961, and the 20th day of October, A.D.
1961, at the then Town of Eastview in the Province of Ontario, did unlawfully
sell as food dead animals or parts thereof in violation of Section B.14.010 of
the Food and Drug Regulations made by Order-in-Council P.C. 1954-1915 of the
8th December, 1954, as amended by Order-in-Council P.C. 1961-1097 of the 31st July,
1961, thereby committing an indictable offence contrary to paragraph (b)
of Section 25  of the Food and Drugs Act , Statutes of Canada 1952-53,
Chapter 38.

Regulation 14.010 simply provides that “No
person shall sell as food a dead animal or any part thereof.”

“Dead animal” is defined in Regulation B.14.012
as follows:

B.14.012 For the purpose of Section
B.14.010 and B.14.011, “dead animal” means a dead animal that

[Page 60]

(a) was not killed for the purpose
of food in accordance with commonly accepted practise of killing animals for
the purpose of food, which shall include exsanguination, or

(b) was affected with disease at the
time it was killed.

To me it is plain that there is no duplicity on
the face of this indictment. It charges only the one offence of selling dead
animals or parts thereof, and Regulation B.14.012 does no more than define two
different modes of committing the same offence. I cannot accept the phrase
“dead animals” as a synonym for meat. A butcher sells meat, not “dead animals”.

It is common ground that the Crown has no right
of appeal from this erroneous quashing of the indictment. The only remaining
question is whether an order of mandamus should issue directing the County
Court Judge to proceed with the trial. Again, for the reasons given by Grant
J., I am of the opinion that it should.

The appellant relies on Re McLeod v. Amiro[2]; The Queen v. Justices of Middlesex[3]; and Rex v. Hanna & McLean[4]. These are cases involving appeals
from summary convictions which in the opinion of the reviewing court were
finally but erroneously decided on the merits. The cases merely hold that such
decisions are not reviewable by way of mandamus. They do not touch the problem
in the present case where an indictment is quashed before plea and no trial is
held. All that the Crown is seeking is an order directing the County Court Judge
to proceed with the trial. If he proceeds with the trial and gives a decision,
that decision is open to appeal and is not reviewable on mandamus. But he can
be compelled to give a decision on the merits and it is no answer to such an
application to say that he has exercised his jurisdiction in quashing the
indictment and that such a decision cannot be reviewed.

The use of the word “jurisdiction” in this
context does not help one towards a solution. There is no dispute that the
judge had the power to deal with the form of the indictment and that he was
acting within his jurisdiction when he quashed the indictment. But he made an
error in quash-

[Page 61]

ing this indictment. He was there to try the
charge. As the matter stands now, unless the order of mandamus issues, the case
as framed cannot be tried and it should be so tried. It is proper, in the
circumstances, to issue the writ of mandamus. I approve of the reasons of Grant
J. on this point in their entirety[5].

I would dismiss the appeal. This being an indictable
offence, there can be no order as to costs either here or in the Court of
Appeal.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—The
proceedings in the courts below out of which this appeal arises are set out in
the reasons of my brother Spence.

Two questions were fully argued before us, (i)
whether in the circumstances mandamus lies, and (ii) whether the learned County
Court Judge erred in holding that the indictment was void for duplicity.

On the first of these questions I agree with the
reasons and conclusion of my brother Spence. As he points out, the decision
that mandamus does not lie renders it unnecessary, for the disposition of this
appeal, to deal with the second question; I think, however, that it is
desirable to express an opinion upon it because if this appeal be allowed the
respondent will be free to prefer a new indictment in the same words as that
which was quashed by Gibson C.C.J. and the Judge before whom it comes for
trial, in the absence of any expression by this Court, would, no doubt, follow
the judgment of Grant J., affirmed by the Court of Appeal, holding that the
indictment as framed was not void for duplicity.

The wording of the indictment is set out in full
in the reasons of my brother Spence. The important words are:

…did unlawfully sell as food dead animals
or parts thereof in violation of section B.14.010 of the Food and Drug
Regulations…

Regulation B.14.010 of the Food and Drug
Regulations reads as follows:

B.14.010—No person shall sell as food a
dead animal or any part thereof.

[Page 62]

The phrase “dead animal” is defined in
Regulation B.14.012 which reads as follows:

B.14.012 For the purpose of sections
B.14.010 and B.14.011, “dead animal” means a dead animal that

(a) was not killed for the purpose
of food in accordance with commonly accepted practice of killing animals for
the purpose of food, which shall include exsanguination, or

(b) was affected with disease at the
time it was killed.

It is obvious that the words of Regulation
B.14.010, standing alone, cannot have been intended to be given their plain and
ordinary meaning. The words are clear and simple English words; they are
unambiguous and if applied literally would bring about the result that every
retail dealer in the country commits an indictable offence whenever he makes a
sale of meat to a customer. Butchers do not sell parts of live animals.

The definition section, quoted above, makes this
plain. The phrase “dead animal” is, for the purpose of the regulation, given
two special meanings to the exclusion of all other meanings. I agree with
Gibson C.C.J. that the indictment must be read as if the extended meanings of
the phrase “dead animal” were set out in it. So read, the words of the charge
to which the appellant was called upon to plead were as follows:

…did unlawfully sell as food dead animals
or parts thereof which were not killed for the purpose of food in accordance
with commonly accepted practice of killing animals for the purpose of food,
which shall include exsanguination, or which were affected with disease at the
time they were killed.

The question is whether these words describe but
one offence which may be committed in two modes or describe two different
offences.

Counsel for the respondent relies on ss. 492  and
500  of the Criminal Code , which, so far as relevant read as follows:

492 (1) Each count in an indictment shall
in general apply to a single transaction and shall contain and is sufficient if
it contains in substance a statement that the accused committed an indictable
offence therein specified.

(2) The statement referred to in subsection
(1) may be…

(b) in the words of the enactment
that describes the offence or declares the matters charged to be an indictable
offence,…

[Page 63]

(6) Nothing in this Part relating to
matters that do not render a count insufficient shall be deemed to restrict or
limit the application of this section.

* * *

500. (1) A count is not objectionable by
reason only that

(a) it charges in the alternative
several different matters, acts or omissions that are stated in the alternative
in an enactment that describes as an indictable offence the matters, acts or
omissions charged in the count…

The effect of the corresponding sections dealing
with offences punishable on summary conviction was fully considered in the
reasons of this Court in Archer v. The Queen[6] and the effect of the sections
quoted above was dealt with as follows in the unanimous judgment of this Court
in Cox and Paton v. The Queen[7].
After quoting the relevant portions of ss. 492  and 500  the reasons
continue:

It is clear since the judgment of this
Court in Archer v. The Queen that these provisions do not render a count
good if the words of the enactment which are adopted in framing the count
describe more than one offence.

There is no difficulty in stating the applicable
principle of law; if the indictment in one count charges more than one offence
it is bad for duplicity. The question as to which there is room for differences
of judicial opinion is whether in a particular case the words of a count
describe one offence which may be committed in different modes or describe more
than one offence.

In the case at bar, in order to support the
submission that only one offence is charged, it is necessary to define the
single offence which is committed (a) when a butcher sells parts of a perfectly
healthy animal killed, for example, by being run into by a motor vehicle and
therefore not “in accordance with commonly accepted practice” and, (b) when a
butcher sells parts of a diseased animal.

Grant J. deals with this point as follows:

Here, as in Gatto v. The King (1938)
S.C.R. 423, there is only one offence charged, namely, that of selling.

The difficulty I have in accepting this is that
selling meat, simpliciter, is not an offence at all.

[Page 64]

To suggest that there is only one offence, “selling
meat for food in contravention of the regulations”, would be to beg the
question which is whether the prohibitions as to the sale of meat for food
contained in the regulations create more than one offence.

The one offence cannot be “selling meat for food
which is unfit for human consumption” because as in case (a) suggested above,
the flesh of an animal might be perfectly fit for human consumption but its
sale nonetheless forbidden because of the manner in which it was killed.

In my opinion, Regulation B.14.010, read, as it
must be to render it intelligible, with the definition of “dead animal”,
creates two distinct offences and I agree with Gibson C.C.J. that the
indictment was void for duplicity. It follows that I would allow the appeal.

I base my judgment on the two grounds, (i) that
Gibson C.C.J. was right in law in holding that the indictment was void for
duplicity and (ii) that, even on the assumption that his decision was wrong in
law, mandamus does not lie.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the orders
of the Court of Appeal and of Grant J. and direct that the application for an
order of mandamus stand dismissed. I would make no order as to costs in any
Court.

SPENCE J. (dissenting):—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario made on October 18, 1963, dismissing an appeal from the order of
Grant J. made on May 27, 1963.
By the latter order, Grant J. had issued a mandamus requiring Gibson C.C.J. to
hear and determine a charge against the appellant.

The appellant had been charged before Gibson
C.C.J. on an indictment which read as follows:

that he did, between the 9th day of August,
A.D. 1961, and the 20th day of October, A.D. 1961, at the then Town of Eastview
in the Province of Ontario, unlawfully sell as food dead animals or parts
thereof in violation of section B.14.010 of the Food and Drug Regulations made
by Order in. Council P.C. 1954-1915 of the 8th December, 1954, as amended by
Order in Council P.C. 1961-1097 of the 31st July, 1961, thereby committing an
indictable offence contrary to paragraph (b) of section 25  of the Food
and Drugs Act , Statutes of Canada 1952-53, Chapter 38,

On the commencement of the trial before Gibson
C.C.J. counsel for the appellant raised two points of law:

(1) whether the indictment is void for
duplicity, and

[Page 65]

(2) whether the pertinent regulations were
in force during the time covered by the alleged offence or offences.

Counsel later withdrew the second objection but
after argument Gibson C.C.J., in written reasons, allowed the first objection
and concluded his judgment with the words “the bill of indictment is,
therefore, quashed”.

Counsel for the appellant in this Court based
his appeal upon two propositions: firstly, that mandamus does not lie when the
trial judge quashes an indictment on the preliminary objection that the charge
is void for duplicity, and secondly, that the charge being void for duplicity,
even had Grant J. jurisdiction, he should not have allowed the mandamus.

It is my purpose in these reasons to deal only
with the first ground as I am of the opinion that is sufficient to dispose of
the appeal to this Court.

Counsel for the Attorney General of Ontario
submits in reply to the first ground the following propositions: firstly, that
mandamus, generally speaking, lies to compel the execution of a public duty
where no other specific remedy for enforcing the performance of that duty
exists. Secondly, that in the present case there is no other remedy available.
Thirdly, that mandamus will lie to compel the trial judge to hear a case on the
merits where he has wrongly declined jurisdiction on a preliminary point of
law, notwithstanding that his decision therein can be judicial in character.

There can be no doubt that mandamus is an
extraordinary remedy by which the superior Court may direct any inferior
tribunal to do some particular thing which appertains to its duty and which it
has declined to do: The Queen et al. v. Leong Ba Chai[8]; Halsbury, 3rd ed., vol. 2, pp.
84-5.

The writ will not issue when there is other
specific remedy available: The Queen v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue[9], (in Re Nathan 1884). It would
appear that in the present case there is no other remedy available for the
reconsideration of the judgment of Gibson C.C.J. As I have said, he concluded
his judgment by quashing the bill of indictment. The sole right of appeal by
the Attorney-General is found in s. 584(1) (a) of the Code and it is

[Page 66]

“against a judgment or verdict of acquittal of a
trial court…”

In Regina v. Leveille[10], the accused, a married woman,
although only 16 years of age, was charged with having stolen goods in her
possession. When she came before the municipal court her counsel moved that she
should be tried in the Social Welfare Court due to her age despite her marital status. The judge upheld the
motion and declined jurisdiction. Rinfret J. at p. 99, said:

(I quote the translation from page 100):

It is clear from the judgment of the
Municipal Court judge, at p. 10 of the record, that this was not a judgment of
acquittal.

The consequence is unavoidable: in the
circumstances the Crown has no right of appeal.

In Rex v. Hansher and Burgess[11], a County Court judge in general
sessions quashed the indictment. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal.
Masten J.A., at p. 74, said:

The nature and effect of the order in
question appears to be procedural merely and does not acquit the accused of the
charge which stands against him and the Crown is at liberty forthwith to lay a
new indictment: R. v. Bainbridge (1918) 30 C.C.C. 214 at 231.

The Attorney-General’s difficulty is in the
support of his third proposition. In Re McLeod v. Amiro[12], Riddell J. considered an application by
way of mandamus to compel a division court judge to reopen an appeal from a
police magistrate’s conviction and to hear and adjudicate upon the same. When
the appeal before the division court judge commenced, counsel for the appellant
took objection to the information as insufficient in form and substance. No
evidence was taken and the division court judge acceded to the argument of
counsel for the appellant and allowed the appeal on the sole ground that the
information was insufficient. At p. 234, Riddell J. said:

It is, of course, contended in the present
case that if the Court below decides on a preliminary point without going into
the merits, there is no real decision on the case, and mandamus will lie.

No doubt—but we must be sure that the point
upon which the decision rested was preliminary in reality and not on the
merits.

It is in the view that what the learned
judge decided was preliminary, that both the applicant and his solicitor swear
that “there was no argu-

[Page 67]

ment before the said judge of the legal
merits of the case—the only question being argued was the question of the
insufficiency of the information and complaint”. And, it is pointed out that
the Code (sec. 753) expressly provides that no judgment shall be given in
favour of the applicant upon an objection to the information and complaint
which objection was not taken before the magistrate. The learned Judge was, in
my opinion, wrong in the view he took of the appeal (I am of course speaking
only upon the material before me, and the facts may be quite different); but he
has the same power to go wrong that any other Judge has.

That such a decision is not on a matter
preliminary, but on the merits, is, to my mind, quite clear.

In coming to that conclusion, Riddell J. relied
upon the well-known and oft-quoted case of The Queen v. Justices of
Middlesex[13].
There, the appellant had been convicted before a metropolitan police magistrate
under a charge of breach of a statute which made punishable as a rogue and
vagabond “every person…using any subtle craft or device, by palmistry or
otherwise, to deceive and impose on any of His Majesty’s subjects”. The
conviction described the offence omitting the words “by palmistry or
otherwise”. On appeal to the Middlesex Sessions, counsel for the appellant
commenced with an objection that the omission of the above words made the
conviction bad. The justices after hearing the point argued retired and on
their return the assistant judge gave, it was alleged contrary to the view of
the majority, a decision quashing the conviction on the objection taken against
it. An application was made for a mandamus but the court composed of Mellor J.
and Lush J. dismissed 

However, they declined to adopt either
course and I think they are not the application. Mellor J., at p. 520, having
discussed the remedy of mandamus, said: amenable to our control, for they have
exercised their jurisdiction, and it is a cardinal rule when jurisdiction is
vested in magistrates or any body of men, which they may exercise so long as
they act within their authority, that however erroneously they decide, we
cannot supervise their decision.

Lush J. said at p. 521:

They returned, and they found the
conviction bad on the face of it. That is a decision upon the legal merits of
the case. If they decided upon the merits of the appeal, the legal merits, or
the merits of the matters of fact, we cannot order them to rescind that
decision. We are not a Court of Appeal from decisions of the magistrates, and,
however erroneously they may have decided, we have no power to interfere.

[Page 68]

Those two judgments have been followed in a
series of cases in the Courts throughout Canada. The judgment in McLeod v. Amiro has been criticized and
counsel for the Attorney‑General in this Court sought to distinguish it
on the ground that it was an appeal while the decision of the learned county
court judge in this case was at trial, but I can see no valid distinction here
as despite the fact that it was an appeal the appeal took the form of a trial
de novo in the McLeod case. Again, it is submitted, the McLeod case
was the decision of a single judge and against the weight of authority; it was,
however, the decision of Riddell J., a very great judge, and has been quoted
and adopted by many courts of appeal and by this Court: Re Ault[14]; Re Sigurdson[15]; Re R. v. Spiers[16]; R. v. Stacpoole[17]; R. v. Lebrecque et al.[18]

Although it was decided upon consent and without
argument on behalf of the accused, at p. 234 Riddell J. said: “Amiro, through
his counsel, consents: and a consent is also filed signed by the learned
Judge,” in my view, that certainly does not lessen the authority of the
decision. Counsel who applied for the grant of the mandamus was present and
evidently argued it extensively. Finally, it is said that the decision was
overruled by Regina
ex rel. Hickman v. Marshall[19].

In the latter case, the accused was charged
before the magistrate with a breach of s. 400 of the Air Regulations. On the
opening of the accused’s trial, his counsel made an objection that the charge
was barred by s. 693 (2) of the Code as it had been laid more than 6 months
after the time when the subject-matter of the proceedings arose. Counsel for
the informant submitted that the Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 23,
providing for a 12-months’ limitation was the effective provision. After
hearing argument the magistrate reserved his decision, accused pleaded not
guilty, and evidence was taken. The magistrate later delivered reasons that
because of the Code, s. 693(2), he lacked jurisdiction to

[Page 69]

try the accused and he endorsed the information
“no jurisdiction”. The informant appealed to the county court of the County of York and his appeal was dismissed
on the ground that no appeal lay. The Attorney-General for Ontario obtained leave to appeal to the
Court of Appeal of Ontario and
on that appeal Morden J. said at p. 79:

The right of appeal from summary
convictions is one created by statute and is of strict law, and unless such a
right is clearly given, it does not exist.

And at p. 80, speaking of the judgment of
Cartwright J. in this Court in R. v. Karpinski[20]:

In any event in that case the magistrate
did not decline jurisdiction as was done here and I am unable to equate a
denial of jurisdiction with an acquittal.

In view of my opinion that no appeal lay to
the County Court from the Magistrate’s ruling, it is unnecessary, in fact it
would be improper, to decide the second question upon which leave was granted
to appeal to this Court.

And at p. 81:

If the Magistrate persists in his opinion
that he has no jurisdiction, then mandamus would be the proper remedy…

The learned justice in appeal cited a number of
cases, inter alia, McLeod v. Amiro, but did not indicate whether he
disagreed or agreed with those decisions.

In my view, the distinction between the present
case on one hand and Regina ex rel. Hickman v. Marshall and the many
other cases cited by counsel for the Ontario Attorney-General is that in each
of the latter the court declined jurisdiction and did so usually in express
words. In the present case, the court accepted jurisdiction. It was an ordinary
case of a trial of an indictable offence where there had been a proper commitment
for trial on preliminary hearing. The trial judge, Gibson C.C.J., commenced the
trial and as part of the legal merits of the case found that the indictment was
void for duplicity. Therefore, the decision in The Queen v. Justices of
Middlesex was applicable. There the justices allowed the appeal because the
conviction was bad on the fact of it; as Lush J. said, “That is a decision upon
the legal merits of the case”. I am of the opinion that those words are

[Page 70]

exactly applicable to the actions of Gibson
C.C.J. in this case. His decision was a decision upon the legal merits.
Therefore, the learned county court judge having accepted jurisdiction and
acted on it, mandamus to compel him to do his duty does not lie despite the
fact that Grant J. and the Court of Appeal for Ontario were of the opinion that he was in error in the performance of his
duty.

As Riddell J. said in McLeod v. Amiro at
p. 236:

It makes no difference if the learned Judge
misconstrued sec. 753 of the Code—he has the power, untrammelled by me, to make
mistakes: and I can find no reason why a misconception of the meaning of a
statute is any worse than a misconception of a common law principle or
equitable rule.

McDonald J.A. in the British Columbia Court of
Appeal said in Rex v. Hanna & McLean[21]:

When a Court has entered upon a case and
has given a decision, however outrageous, it seems to me impossible to say it
has refused jurisdiction. To take that course is simply to sit in appeal on a
tribunal and to make mandamus another form of appeal. Although, as stated
above, Courts have often taken that course, I think that on the weight of
authority it cannot be justified. In order to justify awarding a mandamus to a
County Court Judge who has given a judgment, however absurd, the Court must say
that his judgment is no judgment, but a complete nullity… In my opinion the
County Court Judge has jurisdiction to enter upon the hearing of this appeal;
he did enter upon it; he was entirely wrong I think, in the course he took, for
the plain intention of the Criminal Code  is that he ought to have tried
the case on the merits. Nevertheless, I have concluded that Robertson J., for
the reasons given in his judgment and on the authorities above mentioned, was
right in holding that he was powerless to compel the Judge in those proceedings
to do otherwise than he has done.

In that case, the respondent had been convicted
by a police magistrate on the charge of dangerous driving. He appealed to the
County Court judge pursuant to the provisions of the Code and when the appeal
came on he moved to quash on the ground that the evidence as disclosed by the
magistrate’s notes did not justify the conviction. The County Court judge
looked at the depositions, refused Crown’s counsel the right to call witnesses
and quashed the conviction on that ground.

In Dressler v. Tallman Gravel & Sand
Supply Ltd.[22], the
appellant laid an information against his employer under The Employment
Standards Act, 1957 (Man.), c. 20, charg-

[Page 71]

ing that the respondent had unlawfully failed to
pay him overtime rates. Upon the matter coming on before the magistrate for
trial, he, without hearing any evidence, ordered the charges dismissed on the
ground that the information was in reference to an offence which took place
more than six months before the institution of proceedings and also that the
information was void for duplicity. The employee appealed by way of stated case
and the respondent moved in the Court of Appeal, before any hearing on the
merits, to dismiss the appeal on the ground, inter alia, that no appeal
lay and that the appellant’s proper procedure was to move for mandamus. By
majority decision in the Court of Appeal of Manitoba the respondent’s motion was granted and the stated case quashed. On
appeal to this Court, the court adopted the dissenting judgment of Tritschler
J.A. in the Court of Appeal of Manitoba. Locke J. giving the judgment of the Court quoted from the judgment
of the learned justice in appeal and said at p. 569:

As to the objection that the proper
procedure was not by way of stated case but by mandamus to compel the
magistrate to exercise his jurisdiction, he pointed out that this was not the
case of a magistrate declining to enter upon a hearing because he was of the
opinion that he had no jurisdiction, but one in which, exercising his
jurisdiction, he had dismissed the information on grounds of law which appeared
to him sufficient.

With these conclusions, I agree and, with
the greatest respect for the contrary opinion of the learned Chief Justice of
Manitoba, I consider that the motion of the respondent to dismiss or quash the
stated case, as it was expressed, should have been dismissed and the questions
of law, which appear to me to be clearly raised, determined.

In the present case, I am of the opinion that the
learned County Court judge did not decline his jurisdiction but accepted it and
that therefore no mandamus lies. To the objection that this will result in
there being no way of reviewing the allegedly erroneous decision of the County
Court judge, it must be pointed out that such result need not be fatal. As was
said by Masten J.A. at p. 174, in Rex v. Hansher & Burgess, supra, the
Crown is at liberty forthwith to lay a new indictment. Boyd J. in Re
Ratcliffe v. Crescent Mills & Timber Company[23] said at p. 333:

That the plaintiff has no right of appeal
in this case under the Division Courts Act may be a defect of legislation but
it does not enlarge the remedy by mandamus.

[Page 72]

And in High, on Extra-Ordinary Remedies, 3rd
ed., at p. 186, the learned author states:

So when a court of appellate jurisdiction
has dismissed an appeal, upon the ground that the act allowing appeals in such
cases was unconstitutional and void, the writ will not go to compel the court
to revise its actions and to reinstate the appeal. And this is true, even
though the party aggrieved may have no other remedy to review the action of the
court, since the absence of another adequate or specific remedy is not of
itself ground for relief by mandamus. (The underlining is my own.)

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal.

Since drafting these reasons I have had the
opportunity of perusing the reasons of my brother Cartwright. I agree with his
conclusion that the indictment was void for duplicity and I concur in the
disposition of the appeal which he proposes.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Fraud—Employee
filing false expense accounts as a means of increasing salary—Belief by accused
of employer's sanction—Whether intention to defraud—Conviction quashed by Court
of Appeal—Whether quashing based on grounds of law—Whether quashing should be
upheld—Criminal Code  1953—54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 323(1).

The respondent, the Chief of the Quebec Liquor Police, was
convicted at trial under s. 323(1)  of the Criminal Code  on a number of
counts charging him with having defrauded the public and the Government of the Province
 of Quebec of various sums of money. In 1952, he applied for an increase in his
salary. He was told by the head of his Department, the Solicitor General who
had referred his application to the Attorney General, that he was entitled to
an increase but due to the fact that a general survey of salaries in the Civil
Service was in progress, an increase could not be granted at the time. However,
he was told that he could draw a certain amount per month by way of expenses. A
large number of the expense accounts which were thereafter submitted by the
respondent were admittedly fictitious. This practice continued until 1960 when
his salary was increased. Thereafter the presentation of expense accounts
ceased. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction. The Crown was granted leave
to appeal to this Court.

Held (Taschereau C.J., and Cartwright and Spence JJ., dissenting):
The appeal should be allowed and the verdict of guilty restored.

[Page 175]

Per Fauteux, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ.: On the
uncontradicted evidence of the respondent himself, no other conclusion could be
reached than that he received provincial funds on the basis of the presentation
of expense accounts admittedly false and, that being so, no other conclusion in
law could be reached save that he had defrauded the provincial government and
the public of the amounts which he thus obtained. With the exception of certain
counts in the indictment on which he was acquitted, there was no evidence on
the basis of which any doubt, let alone a reasonable doubt, could arise as to
the respondent having incorporated, to effectuate the agreed scheme, items of
expenses which were fictitious and false. On an appeal from a conviction, if an
Appellate Court allows the appeal on the ground that certain specified evidence
creates a reasonable doubt, when, on a proper view of the law, that evidence is
not capable of creating any doubt, there is an error in law. It is no answer to
a charge of fraud to say that the fraud was suggested by the superior of the
accused nor is the proposition that the province and the public were not
defrauded by paying, out of public funds, false expense accounts, merely
because the respondent's salary was less than what he and his superiors thought
it ought to be. To hold so was an error in law.

The guilt of the respondent in the present appeal depended
upon the legal effect of facts found, or inferred, in the Courts below. This
raised questions of law in respect of which there was error. There was,
therefore, a right of appeal to this Court by the Crown.

Per Taschereau C.J., and Cartwright and Spence JJ., dissenting:
The judgment of the Court of Appeal was founded on grounds of fact or of mixed
fact and law and not solely on any ground of law in the strict sense. It
follows that this Court had no power to review the judgment of the Court of
Appeal, since it is a well-settled proposition that the Crown's right of appeal
to this Court is limited to questions of law in the strict sense and that when
a Court of Appeal has quashed a conviction on two grounds of which one is, and
the other is not, appealable to this Court, the appeal to this Court must be
dismissed.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment
of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, Province of Quebec[1]

and Cartwright and Spence J.J., dissenting.

Yvan Mignault, for the
appellant.

René Letarte and Cyrille
Goulet, for the respondent.

LE JUGE EN CHEF
(dissident):—Mon collègue M. le Juge
Cartwright a résumé tous les faits essentiels à la détermination de cette
cause, et il est donc inutile de les relater de nouveau. ll me suffira de dire
simplement que le juge de première instance a acquitté le prévenu sous sept des
chefs d'accusation, qu'il l'a trouvé coupable de tentative 

[Page 176]

de fraude sous trois chefs
distincts et a rendu un jugement de culpabilité sous tous les autres chefs.

La Cour du banc de la reine[2]
a cassé le jugement rendu en première instance, et permission spéciale a été
accordée au prévenu de loger un appel devant cette Cour. (Code Criminel
598).

Cet appel cependant ne peut
porter que sur des questions de droit et nullement sur des questions de faits
ou des questions mixtes de droit et de faits.

Dans le cas qui nous occupe, il
me semble clair que la majorité de la Cour du banc de la reine, en délivrant
son jugement, a fait reposer en partie ses conclusions sur des questions de
faits, ou au moins sur des questions mixtes de droit et de faits qu'il nous est
interdit de reviser.

II faut, pour que la Cour Suprême
du Canada ait juridiction, qu'il s'agisse d'une question de droit stricte dans
le vrai sens du mot. (508 C. Cr) (Rex. v. Décary[3]
).

Comme je crois que cet appel
comporte l'appréciation de questions de faits, je suis d'opinion que cette Cour
n'a pas juridiction et que l'appel doit être rejeté.

The judgment of Cartwright and
Spence JJ. was delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—This
is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, of the
District of Quebec1, dated July 26, 1963, allowing an appeal from the judgment
of His Honour Judge Dumontier dated September 28,1962, and directing that the
respondent be acquitted on all the counts on which he had been convicted.

On July 16, 1962, the
respondent, who had elected to be tried by a Judge without a jury, was
arraigned before His Honour Judge Dumontier on an indictment containing three
counts to which he pleaded ""not guilty"". We are concerned only with
count 3, which reads as follows:

3°. entre le 1er
janvier 1952 et le 1er juillet 1960, dans les cité et district de
Québec, étant Directeur de la Police des Liqueurs, donc Commandant à Québec,
par la supercherie, le mensonge et d'autres moyens dolosifs, soit en faisant ou
en faisant faire par des subalternes, des comptes de dépenses faux et fictifs
pour lui-même, fraudé le public en général et le Gouvernement de la Province de
Québec, pour une somme d'au moins $8,999.10, C.Cr. 323, par. 1 et 21.

[Page 177]

On July 17, 1962, the learned
trial judge ordered that this count be divided into 235 separate counts which
are set out in his judgment and in that of the Court of Queen's Bench. The
first of these reads as follows:—

3.-1. Le ou vers le 31 mai
1952, dans les cité et district de Québec, étant Directeur de la Police des
Liqueurs donc Commandant à Québec, par la supercherie, le mensonge et d'autres
moyens dolosifs, soit en faisant ou en faisant faire par des subalternes, des
comptes de dépenses faux et fictifs pour lui-même, fraudé le public en général
et le Gouvernement de la Province de Québec, pour une somme de $50.00, C.Cr.
323, par. 1 et 21;

The remaining 234 counts were
similarly worded except as to date and amount; the last charged an offence
committed on May 9, 1960.

The learned trial judge acquitted
the respondent on counts 15, 18, 38, 46, 89, 100 and 221; he found him guilty
of attempted fraud on count 128; on counts 23 and 229 he found him guilty for
lesser amounts than those charged; on all the other counts he found him guilty
as charged.

While the printed record consists
of many volumes the relevant facts may be stated comparatively briefly.

In May, 1940, the respondent was
appointed Chief of the Quebec Liquor Police at a yearly salary of $4,000; in
August, 1941, this was increased to $4,500. In 1952 the respondent applied for
an increase in salary to the then Solicitor-General who referred the matter to
Mr. Duplessis who was then both Attorney-General and Prime Minister. Mr.
Duplessis told the Solicitor-General that an enquiry was going on before the
Civil Service Commission into the question of raising the salaries of the
Quebec Liquor Police and of civil servants in general and that if he granted
the respondent an increase he would immediately be pressed with requests by
others and then said words to the following effect:

Vous direz à Lemire, ou vous
lui ferez dire que je l'autorise à retirer cinquante piastres ($50.00) par
mois, à titre de frais de représentation, ou de dépenses,

The evidence of the Solicitor-General
continued:

De retour à mon
bureau, j'ai dit à Lemire — je ne sais pas si c'est à lui personnellement ou si
c'est peut-être à Côté, ma mémoire n'est pas assez fidèle pour vous l'affirmer
que je l'ai dit à lui — mais je sais qu'il l'a su, ou à son adjoint, qui était
Wellie Côté, que le Procureur Général l'autorisait à retirer mensuellement un
montant de cinquante dollars ($50.00) à titre de frais de représentation, et
que dans le fond, était pour tenir lieu d'une augmentation de salaire qui
s'élevait à six cents piastres ($600.00) par année.

[Page 178]

The substance of this
conversation was communicated to the respondent by Wellie Côté who had been
appointed associate director of the Quebec Liquor Police in January, 1951, and
of whom Tremblay C.J. says that unofficially he was the respondent's superior.
At this time Côté handed the respondent a cheque of the Québec Liquor Police
for $50. Some days later Côté presented a document to the respondent for
signature. This was a printed form partially filled in in typewriting. The
following phrase was type-written:

Déplacement et frais de
séjour pour surveillance du travail.

Several blank spaces in the form
intended for the insertion of details were left blank. Above the signature of
the respondent appeared the following certificate:

Je certifie que les dépenses
plus haut mentionnées ont été nécessairement encourues dans l'intérêt de cette
cause et que le tout est conforme aux allocations accordées.

The form did not specify any
""cause"". It was dated ""May"".

Thereafter from time to time Côté
presented the respondent with a cheque and a similar form which the respondent
signed and in this manner the respondent received amounts totalling $50 a month
until the form dated February 17, 1953, was returned to the respondent marked
""annulé"".

On receipt of this the respondent
went to the office of the Provincial Auditor and had an interview with an
employee. The learned trial judge ruled that evidence of their conversation was
inadmissible and we do not know what was said between them. The question
whether this evidence was rightly excluded is not before us, and consequently,
I express no opinion on it.

Following this interview the
forms signed by the respondent were filled up in detail, specifying the place
visited, the hotel at which respondent stayed, the amount paid for railway fare
and the price paid for meals. There appears to be no doubt that a large number
of these forms were entirely false in fact and described trips which the respondent
had not taken.

In the year 1954 Côté advised the
respondent that he was authorized to draw $100 a month in this manner instead
of $50. This practice continued until May, 1960, when the respondent's annual
salary was increased to 

[Page 179]

$7,400 and he ceased to withdraw
any further sums in augmentation of his salary.

The learned trial judge finds as
a fact that the authorization to withdraw the sum of $50 was given orally by
the Attorney-General and communicated to the respondent but concluded as a
matter of law that it was ""nulle, de nullité absolue"". He goes on to
hold that the respondent could not have had an honest belief that he was
entitled to obtain the moneys which he did obtain by rendering expense accounts
which were false in fact. He finds as a fact that the great majority of the
expense accounts signed by the respondent were false and fictitious but does
not specify which particular ones were false and finds that about twice a year
the respondent went on trips of inspection in connection with which he would
have been entitled to receive his expenses. He does not make an express finding
as to whether Côté told the respondent he was authorized to draw $100 monthly
instead of $50. At the time of the trial both the Attorney-General and Côté had
died.

The respondent appealed against
his convictions. On October 1, 1962, the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side,
granted him leave to appeal on questions of fact.

The appeal was heard by a Court
composed of Tremblay C.J.P.Q. and Casey and Taschereau JJ. The appeal was
allowed and it was directed that the respondent be acquitted on all the counts
on which he had been convicted. All the members of the Court reached the same
result but each gave separate reasons.

On October 2, 1963, leave was
granted to the Crown to appeal to this Court on the following three questions:

1. La Cour d'Appel du
district de Québec a-t-elle erré en droit dans l'interprétation et
l'application de l'article 592(1)  (a) de Code Criminel  du Canada?

2. La Cour d'Appel du
district de Québec a-t-elle erré si elle a ignoré les lois gouvernant la
manipulation et la dépense des deniers publics et a-t-elle mal interprété les
lois applicables dans l'espéce?

3. La Cour d'Appel du
district de Québec a-t-elle erré en droit dans l'interprétation et
l'application de l'article 323(1)  du Code Criminel ?

This leave was granted pursuant
to s. 598(1) (b) of the Criminal Code . Authority is not required for the
wellsettled proposition that the Crown's right of appeal is limited to
questions of law in the strict sense.

[Page 180]

It is clear from the judgment of
this Court in The Queen v. Warner[4],
that where a Court of Appeal has quashed a conviction on two grounds of which
one is, and the other is not, appealable to this Court, the appeal to this
Court must be dismissed.

I am satisfied that in the case
at bar the judgment of the Court of Appeal was founded on grounds of fact or of
mixed fact and law and not solely on any ground of law in the strict sense.

Tremblay C.J. holds that as to
the first 17 counts, in regard to which the certificates signed by the
respondent named no ""cause"" and gave no details, the money was paid
over to the respondent before he signed the certificates which constituted
rather receipts for money paid than demands for payment and that no one was in
fact deceived or induced to pay over the money by any representation on the
part of the respondent. This is a finding of fact or, at the highest from the
point of view of the appellant, a mixed finding of fact and law.

As to the remainder of the counts
the learned Chief Justice expresses himself as follows:

Quant aux autres
chefs, entre en jeu une considération différente qui me paraît péremptoire.

La preuve révéle hors de
tout doute—l'appelant l'a d'ailleurs admisque certains frais inscrits sur les
formules n'ont pas été encourus par l'appelant. Mais il résulte aussi de la
preuve que la Couronne n'a pas prouvé hors de doute raisonnable qu'aucun de ces
frais n'a été encouru. Le malheur, c'est qu'il est impossible de pointer du
doigt ceux qui ont été réellement encourus et ceux qui ne l'ont pas été. La seule preuve apportée par la Couronne sur
ce point révèle que l'appelant était à son bureau de Québec la plupart du
temps. Les témoins admettent cependant
qu'il s'absentait quelques fois par année. L'appelant a retrouvé deux formules
qui contenaient des frais réellement encourus. Il a juré qu'il y en avait
sûrement d'autres mais que sa mémoire ne lui permettait pas de les retracer
après tant d'années. Il faut dire que l'appelant était âgé de 74 ans lors de
son témoignage. Son assertion, rendue plausible par la preuve de la Couronne,
me paraît nettement suffisante pour engendrer un doute raisonnable. D'ailleurs,
le premier juge a acquitté l'appelant des deux chefs d'accusation qu'il a pu
préciser. De son propre chef, il a retranché du montant allégué dans d'autres
chefs les frais du permis de conduire de l'appelant que celui-ci avait le droit
de recouvrer.

De ce qui précède il
résulte que, même si j'admets l'existence du lien de causalité entre le
paiement et les représentations, je ne puis dire quant à quels chefs
d'accusation en particulier les représentations sont fausses et quant à quels
chefs elles sont vraies, sauf quant au chef numéro 18 qui fait double emploi
avec le chef numéro 17 et sur lequel l'appelant a été acquitté. Le substitut du procureur général a d'ailleurs
franchement admis

[Page 181]

lors de l'audition qu'il est
impossible de prouver quels chefs d'accusation précis sont bien fondés. La
seule conclusion logique, c'est qu'aucun n'a été prouvé hors de tout doute
raisonnable et que l'appelant doit être acquitté sur tous les chefs.

This appears to me to be a
finding of fact. The learned Chief Justice has considered the evidence and
reached the conclusion that it does not establish, beyond a reasonable doubt,
the guilt of the accused upon any of the counts on which he was convicted. I
find it impossible to say that the question whether he was right in reaching
this conclusion is one of law in the strict sense.

TASCHEREAU J. delivered the
following reasons:

Les faits révélés par la
preuve et qu'ont exposés M. le Juge en chef et M. le Juge Casey démontrent que
de graves irrégularités ont été commises par l'appelant. Mais la question vitale est celle de savoir si
Lemire, un homme maintenant âgé de 74 ans qui a été directeur de la police des
liqueurs à Québec, pendant vingt ans, avait l'intention coupable de frauder le
public et le gouvernement de la Province de Québec, lorsqu'il a posé les actes
qu'on lui reproche.

L'étude du dossier m'a convaincu
qu'il fallait répondre négativement â cette question. Aussi, commes mes
collègues, j'accueillerais l'appel et libérerais l'accusé:

The first paragraph accurately
states a question which the Court of Appeal was called upon to answer. It
involves an inquiry into the respondent's state of mind. The state of a man's
mind is, in the often quoted words of Bowen L.J., as much a fact as the state
of his digestion; vide Edgington v. Fitzmaurice[5].
The decision of Taschereau J. to allow the appeal appears to me to be based on
a finding of fact certainly it cannot be said that the sole ground on which he
has proceeded is a question of law in the strict sense.

From this it appears that a
majority of the Court of Appeal, in quashing the convictions, have proceeded on
grounds which this Court has no power to review and it follows that the appeal
must be dismissed.

Having reached this conclusion it
becomes unnecessary for me to consider whether it could be said that the
judgment of Casey J. was based only on grounds which this Court has
jurisdiction to review and I express no opinion on that question.

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 182]

The judgment of Fauteux, Abbott,
Martland and Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.:—The material facts
involved in this case are not in dispute. At all relevant times the respondent
Lemire (hereinafter referred to as ""Lemire"") was the Chief of the
Quebec Liquor Police. There was an Associate Chief, one Wellie Côté, who was in
fact, though not in name, the real head of the force. In the year 1952 Lemire
applied to the Solicitor-General of Quebec for an increase in his salary, which was then $4,500
per annum. The Solicitor-General referred the application to the Attorney-General,
Mr. Duplessis, who was then also the Prime Minister of the Province. The
latter, while he approved of an increase for Lemire, was not prepared to grant
it, because it might provoke other similar requests, and the whole salary
structure of the Quebec civil service was then under review. He told the
Solicitor-General to tell Lemire that he would authorize Lemire to draw $50 per
month by way of expenses. This information was communicated to Lemire by Côté.

I agree with Casey J. in the
Court[6] below
when he says that the instructions given by the Attorney-General necessarily
implied the making of fictitious expense accounts.

Lemire commenced, in May, 1952,
to put in expense accounts, initially for $50 per month and then, commencing on
July 15, 1952, for $25 for each half month, represented to be for ""Frais
de déplacement et de séjour pour surveillance du travail."" Each of these
expense accounts contained the following certificate, signed by Lemire:

Je certifie que les dépenses
plus haut mentionnées ont été nécessairement encourues dans l'intérêt de cette
cause et que le tout est conforme aux allocations accordées.

The expense account dated
February 14, 1953, was returned to Lemire, by the Provincial Auditor's
Department, marked ""annulé"". Lemire then saw an employee of that
Department who is unkown. The learned trial judge ruled that evidence by Lemire
as to his interview with the employee was not admissible. In any event Lemire
filed an expense account, dated February
 15, 1953, purporting to contain the
details of his expenditures, totalling $25.

[Page 183]

Thereafter, until the beginning
of the year 1954, he proceeded to file two, and occasionally three, expense
accounts each month, appearing to contain items of expenditure which he had
incurred, each one of which contained the certificate previously quoted. Each
of these was for an odd amount and not for an even $25.

Early in the year 1954 Lemire
says that he was advised by Côté that his monthly expense accounts could be
increased to $100. At the time of the trial Côté was dead. Evidence was given
by the former Solicitor-General that he was unaware of any authority having
been given for any increase beyond the initial, fixed amount of $50 per month.
Commencing in 1954, Lemire's total expense accounts rendered each month became
larger. In most instances two accounts were filed in each month, although on
some occasions there would be three or more.

This practice continued until the
year 1960, when Lemire received a salary increase to $7,400 per annum.
Thereafter the presentation of expense accounts ceased.

The procedure respecting expense
accounts was that two forms were required to be filed, one white and one
yellow, the latter being retained in the office of the Liquor Police. The white
one, signed by the person seeking payment of expenses, had to be verified by
the accountant of the Liquor Police, was then forwarded to the Department of
the Attorney-General and, from there, was transmitted to the office of the
Provincial Auditor for approval. Section 17 of the Provincial Audit Act,
R.S.Q. 1941, c.72, required that such accounts be examined and that it be
ascertained that the payments charged be supported by voucher.

It is clear, from this brief
outline of the facts, the material portions of which are admitted by Lemire,
that, over a period of years, he submitted expense accounts which he knew to be
false and obtained payment out of the public funds of the Province of Quebec of those amounts which were claimed in the expense accounts.

Lemire was charged under s.
323(1)  of the Criminal Code , which provides:

323. (1) Every one who, by
deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, whether or not it is a false
pretence within the meaning of this Act, defrauds the public or any person,
whether ascertained or not, of any property, money or valuable security, is
guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten years.

[Page 184]

The learned trial judge required
that the original count, which had charged Lemire with defrauding the public
and, in particular, the Government of the Province of Quebec, of the sum of $8,999.10,
be divided into 235 separate counts, each dealing with one expense account.

Count No. 1 will serve as an
example of the form in which these various charges were made:

1. le ou vers le 31
mai 1952, dans les cité et district de Québec, étant Directeur de la Police des
Liqueurs dont Commandant à Québec, par la supercherie, le mensonge et d'autres
moyens dolosifs, soit en faisant ou en faisant faire par des subalternes, des
comptes de dépenses faux et fictifs pour lui-même, fraudé le public en général
et le Gouvernement de la Province de Québec, pour une somme de $50.00, C.Cr.
323, par. 1 et 21;

The learned trial judge acquitted
the respondent on counts 15, 18, 38, 46, 89, 100 and 221; he found him guilty
of attempted fraud on count 128; on counts 23 and 229 he found him guilty for
lesser amounts than those charged; on all the other counts he found him guilty
as charged.

Lemire's appeal to the Court of
Queen's Bench, Appeal Side[7], was
allowed by unanimous decision. The Court was composed of Tremblay C.J.P.Q. and
Casey and Taschereau JJ., each of whom gave separate reasons.

As to the first 17 counts, which
dealt with those expense accounts rendered by Lemire prior to and including
that dated February 14, 1953, which was annulled by the Auditor-General, Tremblay
C.J. says:

Pour ces 17 premiers
cas, l'appelant témoigne, et il n'est pas contredit, que les chèques lui
étaient remis soit avant, soit au moment même où on lui demandait de signer les
formules. Ce ne sont donc pas les
représentations contenues dans ces formules qui ont amené le consentement au
paiement. C'était un reçu que l'appelant signait plutôt qu'une demande de
paiement.

De plus, il ne me paraît pas
raisonnable de croire que quelqu'un ait pu être trompé par ces formules. Bien
que la partie imprimée de la formule l'exigeât, aucune date de départ ou de
retour, aucun détail des supposés frais ne sont donnés. Le certificat qui réfère à «l'intérêt de cette cause»
n'a pu tromper personne puisqu'aucune cause n'est mentionnée. ll manque donc un
élément de l'offense: le lien de causalité entre le consentement au paiement et
les représentations de l'appelant. ll est possible que ceux qui ont payé
n'avaient pas le pouvoir de disposer ainsi des fonds publics, mais il y aurait
alors recours civil en répétition de l'indû mais non crime de fraude.

L'on dira peut-être
que ce raisonnement est exact quant au «gouvernement de la province de Québec»
mais non quant «au public en général» que l'appelant est aussi accusé d'avoir «fraudé».
Si l'on considère le public indépendamment de son mandataire, le gouvernement
de la province, il faut décider que, si l'appelant est coupable d'un crime, ce
n'est pas de

[Page 185]

celui de fraude,
parce que le public n'a jamais consenti au paiement et que le consentement de
la personne frustrée est un élément essentiel du crime de fraude.

With respect, I think it is an
error in law to construe the forms signed by Lemire as being receipts, rather
than demands for payment, merely because, according to his evidence, after the
first occasion, the signed form was handed him by Côté at the same time that he
received the cheque from Côté. The cheques which were delivered by Côté were
drawn on the account of the Liquor Police. They were signed by Côté, as
director, and also by the accountant of the Liquor Police. They represented
payments from public funds, which, admittedly, could only be validly justified
by proper vouchers, and these Côté had to obtain. Expense moneys were payable
only on the basis of a certified statement of actual expense. Each such
statement had to be verified and thereafter to be approved by the Auditor-General.
It is obvious that Lemire could not have continued to receive the cheques
without having provided the false statements which were the basis for their
issuance. The scheme must be examined as a whole and, when that is done, there
is no question but that false expense accounts were submitted by Lemire as a
basis for his receipt of public funds. This constitutes the ""lien de
causalite"" between the vouchers and the payments which the learned Chief
Justice felt was lacking in this case.

It is suggested that no one was
deceived by these expense accounts because they did not contain a detailed list
of the expenditures as contemplated by the form. To say this is to say either that
the persons required by law to check the forms were themselves also parties to
the fraud, or that they failed to perform their duties properly. However, even
if this be so, and whichever is the case, this does not provide Lemire with an
answer in law to the charges under s. 323(1) . Whether or not they deceived the
people who were supposed to check and verify them, the point is that, without
filing of the expense accounts, the payments to Lemire from public funds could
not have been obtained or continued. Section 323(1) , in addition to mentioning
deceit and falsehood, also refers to ""other fraudulent means"".
Whether or not they deceived the people who saw them, they were the necessary
means used to obtain the payments and without them the payments would not have

[Page 186]

been made. They were fraudulent.
In my opinion the ground taken in the second paragraph above quoted is wrong in
law.

In the third paragraph of the
passage above quoted it is said that the public was not defrauded because the
public never consented to the payment. There is here an error in law. The
public, through its elected representatives, had consented to the expenditure
of public funds only on the basis of compliance with the requisite statutory
procedures. In my opinion any one who, by fraudulently purporting to fulfill
those requirements, obtained payment of public moneys, to which he was not
lawfully entitled, would thereby have defrauded the public within the meaning
of s. 323(1) .

I find it impossible to see how,
on the uncontradicted evidence of Lemire himself, any other conclusion can be
reached than that he received provincial funds on the basis of the presentation
of expense accounts admittedly false and, that being so, I do not see how any
other conclusion in law can be reached save that he had defrauded the
Provincial Government and the public of the amounts which he thus obtained.

In this connection the reasoning
of Cartwright J., who delivered the unanimous decision of this Court in Cox
and Paton v. The Queen[8],
is relevant. In that case the accused were charged with having conspired to
commit an indictable offence; i.e., by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent
means to defraud Brandon Packers Limited. It was contended in argument that
there was no evidence that any official of that company had been deceived,
particularly as the president of the company and its controlling shareholder
was fully aware of all that was being done by the accused. Dealing with this
argument, Cartwright J., at p. 512, said:

In the course of argument on
this branch of the appeal counsel for the appellants submitted that there was
no evidence that the appellants defrauded Brandon Packers Limited or that they
intended to do so because, as it was said, there was no evidence of any false
representation made to the company or of any official of the company have been
deceived into parting with the moneys referred to in the particulars furnished.
Assuming, without deciding, that there was a dissent on this point within the
meaning of s. 597(1)  of the Criminal Code ,, I would reject this
argument. I will examine it only in connection with the transaction relating to
the $200,000 which is the first item in the particulars. I have already
indicated my agreement with the statement of Freedman J.A.

[Page 187]

that ""implicit in the
entire transaction was the representation of the accused that this was a
legitimate bona fide investment for Brandon Packers Limited to
make"" and with his view that there was ample evidence to warrant a finding
that this representation was false to the knowledge of the accused. If it
deceived Donaldson, who was still nominally at least in control of the company
into paying over the $200,000 to Fropak that would be a fraud on the company.
If, on the other hand, it is suggested that Donaldson was not deceived but paid
the money over knowing that the transaction was not bona fide, that the
Fropak shares were worthless and that their purchase was merely a step in a
scheme to enable the accused to buy the shares of Brandon Packers Limited with
its own money, that would simply be to say that Donaldson was particeps
criminis. If all the directors of a company should join in using its funds
to purchase an asset which they know to be worthless as part of a scheme to
divert those funds to their own use they would, in my opinion, be guilty under
s. 323(1) of defrauding the company of those funds. Even supposing it could be
said that, the directors being ""the mind of the company"" and well
knowing the true facts, the company was not deceived (a proposition which I
should find it difficult to accept), I think it clear that in the supposed case
the directors would have defrauded the company, if not by deceit or falsehood,
by ""other fraudulent means"".

As to the expense accounts
submitted after February 14, 1953, the learned Chief Justice says:

Quant aux autres chefs,
entre en jeu une considération différente qui me paraît péremptoire.

La preuve révèle
hors de tout doute—l'appelant l'a d'ailleurs admis—que certains frais inscrits
sur les formules n'ont pas été encourus par l'appelant. Mais, il résulte aussi
de la preuve que la Couronne n'a pas prouvé hors de doute raisonnable qu'aucun
de ces frais n'a été encouru. Le malheur, c'est qu'il est impossible de pointer
du doigt ceux qui ont été réellement encourus et ceux qui ne l'ont pas été. La seule preuve apportée par la Couronne sur ce point
révèle que l'appelant était à son bureau de Québec la plupart du temps. Les
témoins admettent cependant qu'il s'absentait quelques fois par année. L'appelant a retrouvé deux formules qui
contenaient des frais réellement encourus. ll a juré qu'il y en avait sûrement
d'autres mais que sa mémoire ne lui permettait pas de les retracer après tant
d'années. ll faut dire que l'appelant était âgé de 74 ans lors de son
témoignage. Son assertion, rendue plausible par la preuve de la Couronne, me
paraît nettement suffisante pour engendrer un doute raisonnable. D'ailleurs, le premier juge a acquitté l'appelant des
deux chefs d'accusation qu'il a pu préciser. De son propre chef, il a retranché
du montant allégué dans d'autres chefs les frais du permis de conduire de
l'appelant que celui-ci avait le droit de recouvrer.

De ce qui précède il
résulte que, même si j'admets l'existence du lien de causalité entre le
paiement et les représentations, je ne puis dire quant à quels chefs
d'accusation en particulier les représentations sont fausses et quant à quels
chefs elles sont vraies, sauf quant au chef numéro 18 qui fait double emploi
avec le chef numéro 17 et sur lequel l'appelant a été acquitté. Le substitut du
procureur général a d'ailleurs franchement admis lors de l'audition qu'il est
impossible de prouver quels chefs d'accusation précis sont bien fondés. La
seule conclusion logique, c'est qu'aucun chef n'a été prouvé hors de tout doute
raisonnable et que l'appelant doit être acquitté sur tous les chefs.

[Page 188]

Before this Court, counsel for
the appellant impressed upon us that there must have been a misunderstanding
with respect to the admission referred to in the last paragraph, in the passage
above quoted, as having been made by counsel for the Attorney-General. Counsel
before us advised that he did not think that such an admission had been made.
It certainly had not been intended to make any such admission on behalf of the
Crown, and the record would not support the making of it.

In my opinion the conclusion
reached in this passage is also wrong. Lemire was asked, in his evidence, to
indicate which of the expense accounts in evidence represented expenditures
really incurred by him. He was able to identify only two. The following is the
evidence which he gave in chief in this connection:

PAR Me RENÉ LETARTE,

De la part de l'accusé:

Q. Alors, en somme,
monsieur Lemire, dans cette période, allant de mai, mil neuf cent-cinquante-deux
(1952), à mai, mil neuf cent-soixante (1960), vous dites que vous avez été
autorisé à recevoir cinquante dollars ($50.00) par mois jusqu'en mil neuf cent
cinquante-quatre (1954)?

R. Oui.

Q. C'est-à-dire huit (8)
mois en mil neuf cent cinquante-deux (1952), c'est ça?

R. C'est ça.

Q. Et douze (12) mois, en
mil neuf cent cinquante-trois?

R. Oui.

Q. Ce qui fait vingt (20)
mois à cinquante dollars ($50.00), soit mille dollars ($1,000.00)?

R. C'est ça.

Q. Et ce que vous
dites, c'est qu'à partir de mil neuf cent cinquante-quatre (1954), jusqu'à mil
neuf cent soixante (1960), c'était cent dollars ($100.00) par mois?

R. C'est ça.

Q. Est-ce que vous pourriez
nous dire, effectivement, combien vous avez pris sur ces montants-là, pendant
cette période-là?

R. Bien, je calcule que je dois
avoir pris entre huit mille (8,000) et huit mille six cents piastres
($8,600.00).

Q. Je comprends également
qu'il y a des comptes de dépenses, pour plus ce montant là?

R. Absolument.

Q. Comment expliquez-vous
cette difference-là?

R. Bien ça, je ne peux pas
le dire, parce que j'ai fait des voyages, et dans les comptes, je ne les ai pas
vus.

Q. Alors, est-ce que vous
voulez dire que la différence représenterait vos dépenses réelles?

R. Oui.

[Page 189]

Q. Et, vous avez dit tout à
l'heure que vous êtes même d'opinion qu'il en manque des comptes de dépenses?

R. Je le crois.

PAR LA COUR:

Q. Seriez-vous
capable, en examinant chacun des exhibits, nous dire si vous ne pourriez pas
reconnaître des comptes, pour des dépenses que vous auriez réellement faites
pour des voyages?

R. Bien, j'ai
regardé avec Me Letarte, j'en ai vu une couple.

D'autre part, j'ai des
comptes qui ont été faits pour des voyages, et je ne les ai pas vus.

Q. Alors, est-ce que vous
pourriez m'indiquer ceux-là que vous avez vus?

Si vous avez besoin d'un
ajournement pour examiner les comptes attentivement, je vais vous permettre de
le faire.

R. On les a examinés tous
les deux.

PAR Me RENÉ LETARTE,

De la part de l'accusé:

Moi, je ne peux pas
témoigner.

PAR LA COUR:

Q. Mais, vous m'avez dit, si
j'ai bien compris, que dans les exhibits produits, il y en aurait deux (2) que
vous avez reconnus comme représentant des dépenses que vous auriez réellement
faites à l'occasion de voyages?

R. Oui.

Q. Pour le bénéfice de la
Police des Liqueurs?

R. Oui.

Q. Alors, pourriez-vous les
indiquer à la Cour, dans les exhibits, ces deux-là?

R. Oui, il y a un
voyage en Gaspésie, je pense, au commencement de septembre, mil neuf cent
cinquante-neuf (1959).

Q. Il s'agit de quel
exhibit?

PAR LE GREFFIER:

P.-221.

PAR LE TÉMOIN:

R. Oui, quarante-deux
piastres et trent-cinq ($42.35).

PAR LA COUR:

Q. Ce sont des dépenses
réelles que vous avez assumées pour du travail à la Police des Liqueurs?

R. Oui.

Et il y en a un autre, je me
rappelle pas de la date, c'est un voyage aux environs de La Tuque et Berthier.

PAR Me LETARTE,

De la part de l'accusé:

Q. Maintenant, voici à part
ces deux voyages-là, voulez-vous dire qu'intégralement . . .

PAR LA COUR:

J'aimerais bien qu'on le
retrace avant de clore la Défense; j'aimerais bien qu'on le retrace.

[Page 190]

PAR Me RENÉ
LETARTE,

De la part de l'accusé:

Q. Ce serait en quelle
année, çà, celui-là en particulier?

R. Je me rappelle
pas, je ne sais pas si c'est en cinquante-six (56), ou en cinquante-sept (57),
c'est pas mal loin en arrière.

Q. Est-ce qu'il y
aurait eu une note particulière, sur ce compte-là?

R. Oui, il y aurait eu le
nom de Letarte et de Laforest, dessus.

PAR LE GREFFIER:

Alors, ce serait P.-38.

PAR Me RENÉ LETARTE,

De la part de l'accusé:

Q. C'est ça, P.-38, en
novembre, mil neuf cent cinquante-trois (1953)?

R. Oui, pour un montant de
vingt-neuf et vingt-cinq ($29.25).

Q. Alors, ça, ce sont deux
comptes, dans les comptes auxquels vous venez de référer, pour lesquels vous
vous souvenez positivement qu'il s'agit intégralement de dépenses réelles?

R. Absolument.

Q. Maintenant, dans les
autres cas, dans les autres comptes, qu'est-ce qu'il y a là-dedans?

R. C'est parce qu'on a fait
un voyage à Saint-Hilaire, aussi, dans le temps, c'est près de Beloeil, ça.

PAR LA COUR:

Q. Dans le comté de Rouville?

R. Oui.

Ensuite, j'en ai fait à Chicoutimi.

PAR Me RENÉ LETARTE,

De la part de l'accusé:

Q. Maintenant, est-ce que
des comptes séparés et distincts étaient faits pour ces autres voyages-là, ou
bien non, si vos dépenses étaient dissimulées dans d'autres comptes?

R. Je ne faisais pas de
distinction, des fois je le marquais dans le mois, avec l'autre, là.

Q. Vous mêliez ça ensemble?

R. Oui.

Q. Et ce que nous allons
appeler votre allocation, et les dépenses réelles qui vous étaient occasionnées
dans le mois?

R. Absolument.

Q. C'était fondu ensemble?

R. Oui.

Q. Maintenant, vous dites
que, toutefois, dans cette liste-là, il y a deux cas où ce sont des comptes
réellement distincts pour des voyages en particulier?

R. Oui.

This evidence can be summarized
as follows:

1. Of the expense accounts which
were exhibits, Lemire could identify only two as representing genuine expenses.

2. He thought there were other
expense accounts which

[Page 191]

he had submitted which were not
included among the exhibits at the trial.

3. He thought that some of the
expense accounts which were exhibits, apart from the two which he had
specifically identified, included both real and false expenses mingled
together.

To say that, on this evidence, a
reasonable doubt exists as to Lemire's guilt on each and every charge is, in my
view, wrong in law.

In the first place, Lemire does
not appear to go any further in relation to the expense accounts, other than
the two which he identified, than to say that some of them may have contained a
mixture of real and false expenditures. Even accepting this evidence, it would
be wrong in law to hold that he was entitled to an acquittal in respect of an
expense account which contained some real expenditures as well as false
expenditures merely because the amount charged in the count would then be
larger, by the amount of the real expenditures, than the amount which he
actually obtained by fraud. To hold that, in such a case, Lemire was entitled
to an acquittal is an error in law.

In the second place, the
conclusion of the learned Chief Justice as to the existence of a reasonable
doubt on all counts has no basis on the evidence. Lemire admitted that the
express purpose of filing the expense accounts was. in order to obtain payments
to him equivalent to $50 per month, and later $100 per month. An examination of
the total of the accounts rendered for each month and also for each year
establishes, beyond peradventure, that in practically every month, from 1952 to
1960, inclusive, a part, if not the whole, of each account rendered represented
expenses not actually incurred. An example will illustrate the point which I am
seeking to make. In October, 1954, after Lemire had increased his expense
account payments from $50 to $100 per month, he rendered two expense accounts,
one on October 8 for $48.90, another on October 22 for $53.25, making a total
for the month of $102.15. This total exceeds the $100 which he was seeking to
obtain in lieu of salary increase by only $2.15. Each of the two expense
accounts was for more than that amount. Similarly, in the following month of
November three accounts were 

[Page 192]

rendered, one on November 8 for
$35.90, one on November 20 for $41.90, one on November 25 for $29.10, making a
total of $106.90. In December the monthly total was $76.50, made up of two
accounts, one on December 4 for $33.85, the second on December 16 for $42.65.
In view of Lemire's own admission as to the basic purpose for which the
accounts were rendered, it seems to me to be impossible to conclude that any
one of these seven accounts mentioned related only to expenditures genuinely
incurred. This illustration could be repeated many times.

With the exception of those
counts on which Lemire was acquitted, in my opinion, there was no evidence on
the basis of which, as to each and every expense account submitted by him, any
doubt, let alone a reasonable doubt, could arise as to Lemire's having
incorporated, to effectuate the agreed scheme, items of expense which were
fictitious and false.

In my opinion, on an appeal from
a conviction, if an appellate court allows the appeal on the ground that
certain specified evidence creates a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the
accused, when, on a proper view of the law, that evidence is not capable of
creating any doubt as to his guilt, there is an error in law.

I turn now to the reasons given
by Casey J., who said:

Despite what is said in the
judgment and in respondent's factum, the facts of this case are crystal clear
and surprisingly simple. Appellant wanted an increase and the one who
controlled every aspect of the Government's business and certainly that of
appellant's department, the Attorney General and Prime Minister, felt that his
request was a legitimate one and that it should be granted. But there was a fly
in the ointment. An enquiry into the government's salary structure was under
way and it would have been embarrassing to grant an increase at that moment. In
fact ""that moment"" dragged on and on and the results of the enquiry
were given effect only in November of 1959. So the means above described were
devised.

Without commenting on the
propriety or prevalence of this method of granting disguised salary increases,
and without asking why appellant's situation was not regularized post factum, I
give it as my view that in the circumstances obtaining throughout this whole
period appellant was entitled to believe that for reasons of higher policy he
was given an increase in this fashion and that the procedure, irregular though
it may have been on its face, could and would in the fullness of time be
ratified and validated. After all he was dealing with the person who gave the
orders, and who had—""l'autorité pour augmenter ou diminuer les
salaires"".

Since the instructions given
by the Attorney General necessarily implied the making of fictitious expense
accounts I am unable to find in appellant the intention to defraud contemplated
by the Criminal Code , nor since we are dealing with a salary increase
that his superiors considered 

[Page 193]

warranted, am I able to see
in what respect the public or the Province was defrauded.

The effect of the second
paragraph, above quoted, may be rather bluntly summarized in this way. Because
the augmentation of Lemire's income by the filing of false expense accounts was
suggested and approved by the Attorney-General and Prime Minister of the
Province, Lemire, who deliberately filed false documents and thereby obtained
payments from the provincial public funds, could not be held guilty of fraud,
because he could reasonably anticipate that the fraudulent system would later
be somehow validated. In other words, there is no intent to defraud within the
requirement of s. 323(1)  if the accused person, while deliberately committing
an act which is clearly fraudulent, expects that that which he is doing may, at
a later date, be validated. To me the very statement of this proposition
establishes its error in law.

Incidentally, it may be noted
that when, in 1960, Lemire's salary was increased, no attempt was made to
validate his receipt of the moneys paid to him on the basis of the false
expense accounts in the preceding years.

The implication of the third
paragraph is that, because the suggestion for the proposed fraudulent method
emanated from the Attorney-General of the Province, Lemire, who was the one who
deliberately certified the fraudulent expense accounts, could not be found to
have intended to defraud and, further, that because his superiors thought
Lemire was entitled to a salary increase (which they would not grant), a
fraudulent scheme for the obtaining of payment of fictitious expense accounts
did not constitute a fraud on the public.

To me the idea that it is an
answer to a charge of fraud to say that the fraud was suggested by the superior
of the accused is completely erroneous in law, as is also the proposition that
the Province of Quebec and the public of Quebec were not defrauded by paying,
out of public funds, false expense accounts, merely because Lemire's salary was
less than what he and his superiors thought it ought to be.

In conclusion, with respect to
the reasons given by the learned judges to which I have referred, it appears to
me that, while each of them contains findings which, viewed in isolation,
might, at first glance, be regarded as findings of 

[Page 194]

fact, or of mixed fact and law,
each judgment is palpably based on a misconception of the effect of s. 323(1) 
of the Criminal Code . We have, in this case, an accused person who
admits to having obtained, out of the public funds of the Province of Quebec, between $8,000 and $8,600 and, for that purpose, to have rendered
certified expense accounts which were fictitious. These facts are not in
dispute. In the reasons given in the Court below, which I have reviewed,
certain inferences have been drawn from the facts in evidence, but the
fundamental error which exists in each, and which is an error in law, is in
holding that, on the basis of those inferences, some element in the offence was
lacking.

In Belyea and Weinraub v. The
King[9],
this Court considered a case in which the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court of Ontario had allowed an appeal by the Crown from an acquittal by the
trial court in proceedings by indictment. The right of appeal to the Appellate
Division was limited, as is the appellant's right to appeal to this Court in
the present case, to questions of law. It was contended by the appellants in
that case that the issues before the Appellate Division did not involve a
question of law alone. Chief Justice Anglin, who delivered the judgment of the
Court, said at p. 296:

The right of appeal by the
Attorney-General, conferred by s. 1013(4), Cr. C., as enacted by c. 11,
s. 28, of the Statutes of Canada, 1930, is, no doubt, confined to
""questions of law"". That implies, if it means anything at all, that
there can be no attack by him in the Appellate
 Divisional Court on the correctness of
any of the findings of fact. But we cannot regard that provision as excluding
the right of the Appellate Divisional Court, where a conclusion of mixed law
and fact, such as is the guilt or innocence of the accused, depends, as it does
here, upon the legal effect of certain findings of fact made by the judge or
the jury, as the case may be, to enquire into the soundness of that conclusion,
since we cannot regard it as anything else but a question of law,—especially
where, as here, it is a clear result of misdirection of himself in law by the
learned trial judge.

In my opinion, the guilt of the
respondent in the present appeal depends upon the legal effect of facts found,
or inferred, in the Court below. This raises questions of law in respect of
which, for the reasons already stated, I think there was error. There is no
ground not involving such questions upon which Lemire's appeal could have been
allowed. There was, therefore, a right of appeal to this Court and the appeal
should succeed. The judgment of the learned trial judge, with respect to the
question of guilt, should be restored.

[Page 195]

Lemire also appealed against
sentence, but, in view of the conclusions there reached, no decision was
rendered on this point by the Court below. The case should therefore, be
returned to the Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, to deal with the appeal
from sentence.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Common betting house and
book-making—Trial judge expressing doubt as to modus operandi—Whether necessary
for Crown to prove precise manner in which offence committed—Criminal Code ,
1953-54 (Can.), c. 61, ss. 21, 168, 169, 176(1), 177(1)(e), 592(4)(1), 597(2).

The accused was charged with keeping a common
betting house and engaging in book‑making. The trial judge found that
there was a prima facie case against him on both charges. However he
acquitted him on the

[Page 156]

ground that the first charge had not been
proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal and
contended that the magistrate erred in holding that the Crown should have
proved affirmatively the precise manner in which the offence was committed. The
Court of Appeal reversed the judgment at trial and substituted verdicts of
guilty in respect of the two charges. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held (Cartwright
and Spence JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Taschereau
C.J. and Fauteux and Ritchie JJ.: In order to sustain a conviction under s.
176(1) of the Code it is not necessary that there should be direct evidence of
the accused having either received or recorded a bet, it being enough, under
the provision s. 168(1)(c), if it be proved that he kept a
disorderly house for the purpose of “enabling any person to receive bets”. Once
it has been established that the accused was the keeper of such a house, it is
not necessary for the Crown to prove affirmatively the manner in which bets
were received or recorded therein. The accused would necessarily have been
found guilty by the magistrate but for this error in law. The Court of Appeal
was justified in entering a verdict of guilty with respect to these offences.

Per Cartwright
and Spence JJ., dissenting: The magistrate did not misdirect himself but
was merely putting to himself the well-known rule in Hodge’s case. The
magistrate was putting to himself the basic proposition of criminal
jurisprudence that the Crown must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], setting aside two
verdicts of acquittal and substituting therefore verdicts of guilty. Appeal
dismissed, Cartwright and Spence JJ. dissenting.

A. Maloney, Q.C., and B. Clive Bynoe, for
the appellant.

F.W. Callaghan, for the respondent.

The judgment of Taschereau C.J., and Fauteux and
Ritchie JJ, was delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—This is an appeal brought pursuant to
597(2) of the Criminal Code  from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of
Ontario1 setting aside two verdicts acquitting the appellant of the
offences of keeping a common betting house and of book-making which were
entered by Magistrate Howitt of the City of Guelph on August 14, 1963, and
substituting therefor verdicts of guilty in respect of the following charges:

1. Samuel Silvestro on the 24th day of
April and one month previous thereto at the City of Guelph A.D. 1963 in the County of Wellington did unlawfully keep a disorderly house to wit: a
common bet-

[Page 157]

ting house at 165
 Ferguson Street in the City of Guelph contrary to the Criminal Code 
Sec. 176(1) .

2. Samuel Silvestro on the 24th of April
and one month prior thereto at the City of Guelph, A.D. 1963 in the said County of Wellington did unlawfully engage in
bookmaking contrary to the Criminal Code  Sec. 177(1) (e).

It appears to me to be desirable to analyze the
nature of these charges before proceeding to a consideration of the question of
law raised by this appeal.

As to the first charge, the relevant
sections of the Criminal Code  read as follows:

176. (1) Every one who keeps a common
gaming house or common betting house is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for two years.

168. (1) In this Part,

(c) “common betting house” means a
place that is opened, kept or used for the purpose of

(ii) enabling any person to receive,
record, register, transmit or pay bets or to announce the results of betting.

(h) “keeper” includes a person
who

(i) is an owner or occupier of a place.

(e) “disorderly house” means
a common bawdy-house, a common betting house or a common gaming house.

169. In proceedings under this Part,

(a) evidence that a peace officer who was
authorized to enter a place was wilfully prevented from entering or was
wilfully obstructed or delayed in entering is prima facie evidence that
the place is a disorderly house.

It will be seen from the above that any keeper
of a disorderly house which is opened, kept or used for the purpose of enabling
any person to receive bets is guilty of keeping a common betting house contrary
to 176(1).

As to the second charge, the relevant provisions
of the Criminal Code  read as follows:

177. (1) Every one commits an offence who

(e) engages… in the business
or occupation of betting, or…

21. (1) Every one is a party to an offence
who

(b) does or omits to do anything for
the purpose of aiding any person to commit it…

It will accordingly be seen that anyone who does
anything for the purpose of aiding another to engage in the occupation of
betting is guilty of an offence under this section.

In the present case the learned Magistrate made
the following findings of fact:

1. As to the premises being a disorderly house:

[Page 158]

I find as a fact that entry was wilfully
delayed by the accused and therefore, there is a prima facie evidence that the
place is a disorderly house.

2. As to the appellant being the keeper of the
premises:

Although counsel for the accused
strenuously argued that there was not sufficient evidence to establish that the
accused Silvestro was the keeper of the premises, I find as a fact that he was.

3. As to certain telephone calls made to the
premises in question while the telephone was being monitored by the police:

I find as a fact that the telephone
conversations were accurately recorded and that such evidence is admissible to
prove the nature, character and atmosphere of the premises but not proof of the
matters asserted… The conversations were about placing bets on horses that were
running at various race tracks that day. Such evidence standing by itself, is
not enough to substantiate a conclusion that the premises were being kept for
betting. It is evidence of some value, however, tending to prove the charge.

In my opinion, the learned Magistrate’s finding
that the telephone conversations were properly recorded carries with it an
acceptance of the record as to the number of betting messages which were
received over the telephone at the premises while the police were listening in,
and this discloses that between 1:35 and 2:34 p.m. there were eleven such
calls, eight of which took place in the first twenty-eight minutes.

None of these findings of fact was disturbed by
the Court of Appeal and I can see no basis for interfering with them in this
Court. When they are read together, I am unable to construe these findings as
amounting to anything other than a prima facie case that the appellant
was the keeper of a disorderly house which was used for the purpose of enabling
persons to receive telephone messages about placing bets on horses, and this,
in my opinion, constitutes an offence under s. 176(1)  of the Criminal Code . In
my view also, a keeper of a common betting house is one who does something for
the purpose of aiding other persons to engage in the occupation of betting, and
I am therefore of opinion that having regard to the provisions of s. 21 , the
findings of fact above referred to also constitute a prima facie case
under s. 177(1) (e). Notwithstanding the above, however, the learned
Magistrate, after considering all the evidence, was left in doubt as to the
guilt of the appellant on both charges, and it is the question of whether or
not his doubts

[Page 159]

were founded solely on an error in law which
forms the subject of this appeal.

No evidence was called for the defence, and the
considerations which gave rise to doubt in the Magistrate’s mind appear to me
to be illustrated by the following excerpts from his reasons for judgment:

1. I feel that in order to register a
conviction not only must I find as fact that the accused received and recorded
bets, but also Î must outline and describe how he did it. This I find a little
difficult to do as I am faced on the one hand with the suggestion that the
accused used a flash board on which to record bets and on the other hand with
the suggestion that he used the arborite table top for this purpose.

2. There is no direct evidence that the
accused received or recorded a bet.

3. In the present case I am left wondering
just what method the accused used to carry out his alleged illegal activity.
There are no betting slips and scratch sheets in evidence. Also, I think it is
obvious that a book maker must have some printed or written record of the day’s
racing contestants immediately at hand, as a reference before receiving a bet.
In the case before me there is no sign of any such information. Admittedly
there were the newspapers in the parked automobile but they were not being used
at the time of the raid.

4. I feel the evidence is not strong enough
and it does not disclose with reasonable certainty his method of operation.

The following question of law was stated in the
notice of appeal of the Attorney-General of Ontario to the Court of Appeal:

The learned Magistrate erred in law in
holding that in order to convict the accused it was necessary for the Crown to
prove affirmatively the precise manner in which the offence was committed.

It is true that the question so stated does not
embody the exact language used in the reasons for judgment delivered at trial,
but it does appear to me that in acquitting the appellant the learned
Magistrate made it clear that he was acting in accordance with his opinion that
in order to convict it was necessary for him to have affirmative proof, not
only that the accused received bets, but also that he recorded them and that
there must in addition be proof, amounting to reasonable certainty, of the
manner in which these things were done.

In my view, one of the questions of law raised
by the opinion so expressed by the Magistrate is fairly reflected in the
question posed by the notice of appeal.

It will be noted that a substantial part of the
difficulty which led the Magistrate to hold that the first charge was

[Page 160]

not proved beyond a reasonable doubt sprang from
his being under the impression that in order to convict he must be satisfied as
to how the bets were recorded. In fact, as Roach J.A. has pointed out in the
course of his reasons for judgment rendered on behalf of the Court of Appeal,
the learned Magistrate, like the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Regina v. Failkaw[2], was
wrong in considering that the recording of bets is an essential
ingredient of the offence under s. 176(1) . Indeed, in order to sustain a
conviction under that section it is not necessary that there should be direct
evidence of the accused having either received or recorded a bet, it being
enough, under the provisions of s. 167(1)(c), if it be proved that he
kept a disorderly house for the purpose of “enabling any person to receive
bets”. Once it has been established that the accused was the keeper of such a
house, it is not necessary for the Crown to prove affirmatively the manner in
which bets were received or recorded therein.

As I consider that the findings of fact above
referred to constitute a prima facie case of guilt as to both charges,
and as there was no evidence for the defence, I am of opinion that the accused
would necessarily have been found guilty by the learned Magistrate but for the
errors in law which I have indicated, and I am of the further opinion that the
Court of Appeal, in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred upon it by s.
592(1) (i) of the Criminal Code , was justified in entering a verdict of
guilty with respect to these offences.

I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Cartwright and Spence JJ. was
delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting):—This is an appeal
by the accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[3] dated January 31, 1964. By that judgment, the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed the appeal of the Attorney
General for Ontario from the
acquittal of the accused by His Worship Magistrate Howitt on August 14, 1963. The accused had been charged
with two offences as follows:

(1) On the 24th day of April and one month
previous A.D. 1963, at the City of Guelph in the said County
of Wellington did unlawfully keep a disorderly house, to wit: a common betting0
house at 165 Ferguson Street,
in the City of Guelph, contrary
to the Criminal Code , Section 176 , subsection (1).

and

[Page 161]

(2) On the 24th day of April and one month
prior thereto at the City of Guelph A.D. 1963, in the said County of Wellington
did unlawfully.engage in bookmaking, contrary to the Criminal Code ,
Section 177 , subsection (1)(e).

The trial took place on June 26, 1963, the learned magistrate reserved
judgment, and on August 14, 1963, gave written reasons for the acquittal of the
accused upon both charges.

The Attorney-General for the Province of Ontario
appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario by notice of appeal dated August 23, 1963. I repeat in full the
grounds of appeal set out therein:

The learned Magistrate erred in law in
holding that in order to convict the accused it was necessary for the Crown to
prove affirmatively the precise manner in which the offence was committed.

The Court of Appeal for Ontario gave effect to this ground of appeal. In the course of his
judgment, Roach J.A. said:

The question of law on which the Attorney
General founds this appeal is stated in his notice of appeal, thus:

The learned Magistrate erred in law in
holding that in order to convict the accused it was necessary for the Crown to
prove affirmatively the precise manner in which the offence was committed.

In my opinion that objection as applied to
these charges is well taken and the learned Magistrate misdirected himself.

The appellant urged many grounds of appeal
before this Court. In my view, the appeal may be decided by reference only to
the first thereof, i.e., that the learned magistrate did not misdirect himself
and that the statement quoted inaccurately in the notice of appeal was not an
attempt by the magistrate to direct himself at all. It is probably unnecessary
to cite at length the reasons for the judgment given by the learned magistrate
and a short summary thereof will be sufficient. Firstly, the magistrate found
upon evidence that the provisions of s. 169(a) of the Code applied
to the circumstances and that there was prima facie evidence that the
premises were a disorderly house. Secondly, the learned magistrate found that the
accused was the keeper of that house. Thirdly, the learned magistrate found
that the telephone messages adduced in evidence as having been received at the
premises by an officer in the hour which followed the officer’s entry upon the
premises were accurately recorded in the tape recording produced

[Page 162]

as a witness. Fourthly, the magistrate recounted
the other evidence as to what was found in the premises and outside the
premises in an automobile, and then continued:

The evidence which I have outlined is
wholly circumstantial There is no direct testimony that the accused received or
recorded a bet. The Crown asks that a conviction be made, suggesting that
evidence indicates that the accused received bets over the telephone and
recorded them in pencil on the arborite table top or on flash paper, which
paper burns instantly on being ignited. It is argued that the burnt match
points to the fact that flash paper was used. Further, it is submitted that the
pencil found on the accused man was used to record the bets on the table and
the smudge mark or marks, barely discernable, on the table, were made after the
face cloth was used in an effort to destroy all evidence of bets having been so
recorded.

I feel that in order to register a
conviction not only must I find as fact that the accused received and recorded
bets, but also I must outline and describe how he did it. This I find a little
difficult to do as I am faced on the one hand with the suggestion the accused
used flash paper on which to record bets and on the other hand, with the
suggestion that he used the arborite table top for this purpose.

Also I feel that in cases of this kind, I
should look for very tangible evidence. The circumstantial evidence, although
any part of it may be capable of innocent interpretation, should be closely
connected so that the cumulative effect should almost impel me to find the
accused guilty. The evidence should be inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion of innocence.

In the present case I am left wondering
just what method the accused used to carry out his alleged illegal activity.
There are no betting slips and scratch sheets in evidence. Also, I think it is
obvious that a book maker must have some printed or written record of the day’s
racing contestants immediately at hand, as a reference before receiving a bet.

In the case before me, there is no sign of
any such printed information. Admittedly there were the newspapers in the
parked automobile but they were not being used at the time of the raid. The
gist of the offence is the keeping of the premises for betting (and I emphasize
“keeping”). No doubt, Samuel Silvestro is a keeper, but there is some evidence,
the admissibility of it being doubtful, that a Frank Silvestro is involved. Did
the accused use the name of Frank Silvestro in answering the telephone or was a
Frank Silvestro actually engaged or about to engage in receiving and recording
bets on the 24th day of April 1963? Do Frank and Samuel Silvestro work together
in such an illegal enterprise? These questions are not answered.

It may be that a man is so enveloped by a
web or network of inculpatory evidence, that it is incumbent upon him to make
an explanation or be convicted. This is not so here. I am left to draw too many
inferences in order to reach the conclusion that the accused is guilty.
Although my suspicions are strong that the accused was carrying on betting
operations at 165 Ferguson Street, I feel the evidence is not strong enough and
it does not disclose with reasonable certainty his method of operation.

It is the sentence from that portion of the
learned magistrate’s reasons reading, “I feel that in order to register
conviction not only must I find it a fact that the accused received and
recorded bets but also I must outline and

[Page 163]

describe how he did it”, that the Crown took the
proposition set out in its notice of appeal. It should first be noted that the
magistrate is not even purporting to say what the Crown must prove, he says
rather what he must do. He has pointed out the circumstantial nature of the
evidence and, of course, there was no other kind of evidence, and by saying,
“the circumstantial evidence although any part of it may be capable of innocent
interpretation, should be closely connected so that the cumulative effect should
almost impel me to find the accused guilty”, he was putting to himself the
well-recognized rule in Hodge’s case[4].
When he says, “I am left to draw too many inferences in order to reach the
conclusion that the accused is guilty. Although my suspicions are strong that
the accused was carrying on betting operations at 165 Ferguson Street, I feel
the evidence is not strong enough and it does not disclose with reasonable
certainty his method of operation”, the learned magistrate is putting to
himself again the basic proposition of criminal jurisprudence that the Crown
must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and when the magistrate used the
words objected to and which I have quoted above, the magistrate was simply
saying what he felt he should be able to determine in order to come to his
conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. It may well be that neither the members of
the Court of Appeal nor I, had we heard the evidence adduced at trial, would
have any reasonable doubt, but it is not a doubt in our minds which is at
issue, it is a reasonable doubt in the mind of the learned magistrate who tried
the charges.

I therefore am of the opinion that the appeal
should be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal reversed, and that of
the magistrate restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
QUEEN'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Common gaming
house—Slot machine—Conviction quashed by Court of Appeal—Whether player has
control over operation—Whether dissent in Court of Appeal on question of law—Criminal
Code , 1953-54 (Can) c. 51, ss. 170(2) (b)(i), 176.

The respondent's premises contained an automatic machine
whereby a person, on the insertion of a coin in the machine, obtained five
small balls which the person could by activating a device, propel one at a time
on an inclined table. These balls would strike obstructions of all kinds which
would direct them in various directions. When the balls struck these
obstructions, lights would flash on, points would be registered and a player
who reached one thousand points with the five balls would get to play an
additional game free. The respondent was convicted of keeping a common betting
house by having in her premises a slot machine called ""Spot-A-Card"",
contrary to s. 176  of the Criminal Code . Her conviction was set aside by
a majority judgment in the Court of Appeal on the ground that the prosecution
had not discharged the burden of proof that ""the result of one of any
number of operations of the machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the
operator"". The Crown appealed to this Court.

Held (Cartwright J. dissenting): The appeal should be
allowed and the conviction restored.

Per Taschereau C.J. and Abbott J.: The machine in
question served for vending services and the result of one of any number of
operations was a question of chance and uncertainty for the player. Even if the
balls could be controlled to an appreciable extent, as found by the Court of
Appeal, there would be an element of mixed skill and chance rendering the
machine illegal. It was not a question of knowing whether the operation of the
machine depended on the skill of the player, it must be determined whether the
operation depended on chance and was therefore a question of uncertainty.

Per Fauteux and Hall JJ.: The machine was ""a slot
machine"" within the meaning of s. 170(2) (b)(i) of the Code. The finding
by the majority that ""the ball could be controlled to an appreciable
extent"" was a finding of fact and was consistent with the finding of fact
made by the dissenting judge that the results were a matter of chance or
uncertainty. The dissent was on the question of law as to whether the
prosecution had discharged its burden of proof. This burden is met even when
the proof establishes some measures of control, but there remain elements of ""chance
or uncertainty"". Once it is accepted that the player has only partial
control over the ball, then all elements of the offence have been met.

[Page 276]

Per Cartwright J., dissenting: The Crown had no
right of appeal in this case under s. 598(1)  (a) of the Criminal Code ,
because the dissent in the Court below was not on a question of pure law. The
majority judgment reached the conclusion on the evidence that a player could
control the operation to an appreciable extent. Whereby the dissenting judge
would have sustained the conviction on the finding of fact that the evidence
showed that any effective control by the player of the operation of the machine
was impossible. This was a dissent as to the facts.

(Can.), c. 51, arts. 170(2)(b)(i), 176.

Un local occupé par l'intimée était muni d'un
appareil automatique qui permettait à une personne, moyennant une somme de cinq
sous que la personne plaçait à l'intérieur de la machine, d'obtenir cinq
boules, qu'au moyen d'un éjecteur activé par un ressort elle dirigeait sur une
table ayant un plan incliné. Ces boules frappaient des obstructions de toutes
sortes et étaient projetées dans des directions différentes et variables. Quand
elles frappaient ces obstructions, des lumières s'allumaient, des points s'enregistraient,
et le joueur qui avait compté mille points avec cinq boules avait droit à une
partie additionnelle gratis. L'intimée fut trouvée coupable d'avoir tenu une
maison de jeu en ayant dans son local un appareil à sous appelé « Spot-A-Card »,
contrairement à l'art. 176  du Code criminel . Le verdict de culpabilité
fut cassé par un jugement majoritaire de la Cour d'appel pour le motif que la
Couronne n'avait pas rencontré le fardeau de la preuve que le résultat de l'une
de n'importe quel nombre d'opérations de la machine est une affaire de hasard
ou d'incertitude pour l'opérateur. La Couronne en appela devant cette Cour.

Arrêt (Le juge
Cartwright étant dissident): L'appel doit être maintenu et le verdict de
culpabilité rétabli.

Le juge en chef Taschereau et le juge Abbott:
La machine en question était utilisée pour la vente de services et le résultat
de l'un ou de n'importe lequel nombre d'opérations était une affaire de hasard
et d'incertitude pour l'opérateur. Même si le joueur pouvait avoir un certain
contrôle, comme la Cour d'appel l'a décidé, il y aurait quand même un élément
mixte de science et de hasard qui rendrait la machine illégale. Il ne s'agit
pas de savoir si l'une des opérations de la machine dépend de l'habileté du
joueur, mais bien de déterminer si l'une des opérations dépend du hasard et est
en conséquence une affaire d'incertitude.

Les juges Fauteux et Hall: L'appareil en
question était un « appareil à sous » selon l'expression de l'art.
170(2) (b)(i) du Code. La conclusion de la majorité à l'effet que la boule
pouvait être contrôlée jusqu'à un certain point était une conclusion sur les
faits et était compatible avec la conclusion du juge dissident que le résultat
de l'opération était une affaire de chance ou d'incertitude. La dissidence portait
sur la question de droit de savoir si la Couronne avait rencontré le fardeau de
la preuve. Ce fardeau est rencontré même si la preuve établit une certaine
mesure de contrôle, s'il demeure des éléments de chance ou d'incertitude. Une
fois qu'il est admis que le joueur a seulement un contrôle partiel sur la
boule, tous les éléments de l'offense sont alors présents.

[Page 277]

Le juge Cartwright, dissident: La
Couronne n'avait pas un droit d'appel en vertu de l'art. 598(1)  (a) du Code
criminel , parce que la dissidence enregistrée à la Cour d'appel ne portait
pas sur une question de droit pur. Le jugement de la majorité en vint à la
conclusion sur la preuve qu'un joueur pouvait contrôler l'opération jusqu'à un
certain point. Par contre, le juge dissident aurait maintenu le verdict de
culpabilité en concluant sur les faits que la preuve démontrait qu'un contrôle
effectif par le joueur était impossible. Ceci était une dissidence sur les
faits.

APPEAL from a judgment of the
Court of Queen's Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], setting aside the respondent's conviction of having
kept a common gaming house. Appeal allowed, Cartwright J. dissenting.

Raymond Julien,
Q.C., and C. Goulet, for the appellant.

Lawrence Diner
and Pierre Bernier, for the respondent.

The judgment of the
Chief Justice and of Abbott J. was delivered by

LE JUGE EN CHEF:—L'intimée
a été accusée d'avoir commis l'offense suivante:

Avoir tenu le
quatorzième jour de décembre 1962 une maison de jeu dans un local situé au
numéro civique 503, rue St-Clément, à Montréal, contrairement à l'article 176 ,
paragraphe 1 , du Code Criminel .

M. le Juge René
Hébert, de la Cour municipale de la Cité de Montréal, a déclaré l'intimée
coupable de l'offense reprochée et l'a condamnée au paiement d'une amende de $200
ou, à défaut de paiement de ladite amende, à trente jours de prison.

La cause a été portée
en appel et la Cour[2], a
cassé et annulé le jugement de culpabilité prononcé par la Cour municipale et a
acquitté Rita Toupin, M. le Juge Rivard ayant enregistré sa dissidence.

L'article du Code
criminel  qui nous intéresse pour la détermination de la présente cause est
le suivant:

170. (1) Aux fins
des procédures prévues par la présente Partie, un local que l'on trouve muni
d'un appareil à sous est de façon concluante présumé une maison de jeu.

(2) Au présent
article, l'expression « appareil à sous » signifie toute machine
automatique ou appareil à sous

(a)
employé ou destiné à être employé pour toute fin autre que la vente de
marchandises ou services; ou

[Page 278]

(b)
utilisé ou destiné à être utilisé pour la vente de marchandises ou services

(i) si le
résultat de l'une de n'importe quel nombre d'opérations de la machine est une
affaire de hasard ou d'incertitude pour l'opérateur;

(ii) si, en
conséquence d'un nombre donné d'opérations successives par l'opérateur,
l'appareil produit des résultats différents; ou

(iii) si, lors
d'une opération quelconque de l'appareil, celui-ci émet ou laisse échapper des
piécettes ou jetons.

C'est, dans cet
article 170, le paragraphe 2(b) (i) qui nous intéresse particulièrement.

Le mécanisme de cet
appareil est assez compliqué. Moyennant une somme de cinq sous, que le joueur
place à l'intérieur de la machine, il obtient cinq boules, qu'au moyen d'un
éjecteur activé par un ressort, il dirige sur une table qui est sur un plan
incliné. Ces boules frappent des obstructions de toutes sortes, sont projetées
à gauche ou à droite, dans des directions évidemment différentes et variables.
Quand elles frappent ces obstructions, des lumières s'allument, des points
s'enregistrent, et le joueur qui a compté 1,000 points avec cinq boules a droit
à une partie additionnelle gratis.

Je suis d'opinion que
cette machine est destinée à être utilisée et est en effet utilisée pour la
vente de services et que le résultat de l'un ou de n'importe lequel
nombre d'opérations est une affaire de hasard et d'incertitude pour
l'opérateur. La Reine v. Topechka[3].

Le joueur ne contrôle
pas la partie, et je ne puis m'accorder avec Casey J. qui dit que « the
ball can be controlled to an appreciable extents ». Dans ce cas, il
y aurait un élément mixte de science et de hasard, ce qui rendrait la machine
illégale.

Il y a bien des jeux
où le succès dépend en partie du hasard, comme le hockey, le football, etc.,
mais, quand le résultat, bon ou mauvais, ne dépend pas du joueur, mais du
mécanisme de la machine sur lequel le joueur n'a pas de contrôle, il y a
violation de la loi.

Dans le cas qui nous
occupe, contrairement à ce qui s'est présenté dans d'autres causes déjà
entendues par cette Cour, il ne s'agit pas de savoir si l'une des opérations de
la machine dépend de l'habileté du joueur, mais bien de déter-

[Page 279]

miner si l'une des
opérations dépend du hasard et est en conséquence une affaire d'incertitude.
M. le Juge Owen soutient le premier point de vue, et M. le Juge Badeaux
réaffirme la même chose en référant à la cause de Côté v. La Reine[4]. M. le Juge Rivard est
d'opinion contraire et conformément aux dispositions du Code (art. 170) croit
que la machine est illégale si le résultat d'une seule opération est une
affaire de hasard ou d'incertitude. Je crois devoir accepter les vues de M. le
Juge Rivard et l'appel doit donc être maintenu et le jugement du juge au procès
doit être rétabli.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—The
circumstances out of which this appeal arises, the description of the machine
seized on the premises of the respondent and the course of the proceedings in
the courts below are set out in the reasons of my brother Hall.

I have reached the conclusion
that the Crown has no right of appeal in this case.

Leave to appeal was not sought
and the right of appeal, if it exists, must be found in s. 598(1)  (a) of
the Criminal Code . The Attorney General may appeal to this Court
""on any question of law on which a Judge of the Court of Appeal
dissents"". Authority need not be quoted for the well settled rule that the
question raised in the dissenting judgment must be one of law in the strict
sense and not merely one of mixed fact and law.

In the case at bar Casey J.
reached the conclusion on the evidence that a player of the seized machine
could control its operation to an appreciable extent by the manual operation of
""flippers"" and by tilting the machine. Badeaux J. reached the
conclusion that the evidence showed the machine in question to be the same as
that which was the subject matter of the decision in Côté v. Her Majesty the
Queen[5].
In that case the Court of Appeal found on the unanimous evidence of all the
witnesses that an experienced player could and did control the play. Taking
these views of the facts Casey J. and Badeaux J. decided that the appeal should
be allowed.

Rivard J., who dissented, did not
differ from the view of either of the Judges who formed the majority as to the

[Page 280]

applicable law. He disagreed with
them as to the effect of the evidence. He said in part:

La question qui
se pose est donc de savoir si le résultat de quelqu'une des opérations de cet
appareil sous examen est l'affaire de hasard ou d'incertitude.

***

L'on a tenté de
prouver en défense que pendant que la boule est ainsi en mouvement, en secouant
l'appareil, en le « brassant », suivant l'expression des témoins, on
peut exercer un contrôle sur cette bille en l'empêchant de descendre
directement vers le bas où elle se perd, en la projetant contre d'autres
obstacles et en courant ainsi la chance que dans son trajet, elle accumule des
points additionnels.

Je dois dire que
les témoins tant de la Couronne que de la défense ont complètement failli dans
les expériences qu'ils ont tenté d'établir ce contrôle.

***

Il faut
distinguer cette cause de celle de CÔTÉ v. LA REINE rapportée à 1963 B.R. p.
567, où la preuve a certainement été différente de celle qui nous a été
soumise. Dans ses notes, M. le Juge Hyde écrit:

A new feature,
however, has been introduced into the evidence in this case in that all the
witnesses, both for the prosecution and for the defence, state that an
experienced operator can and does exercise considerable control over the course
of the ball by striking the machine with his hand while in play and that the
ability of the player in this way has a distinct effect upon the score which he
will achieve.

Plus loin, il
ajoute:

All the
witnesses, as I have indicated, are unanimous in agreeing that an experienced
player can and does control the play in this way.

Dans la cause
présente, les témoins ne sont pas unanimes pour dire qu'il est possible de
contrôler cette boule, une fois que l'éjecteur l'a mise en mouvement. Au
contraire, il est prouvé hors de tout doute que tout contrôle efficace est
impossible. C'est une machine spécifique que nous avons à juger, non pas un
genre d'appareil.

From these excerpts and from the
reasons of the learned Justice of Appeal read as a whole it is apparent that he
based his decision on the ground that the evidence showed that any effective
control by the player of the operation of the machine was impossible. It was on
this finding of fact that he based his decision to dismiss the appeal and
sustain the conviction. I am unable to find in the reasons of Rivard J. either
an expression or an implication of the view that had he agreed with the
findings of fact made by either Casey J. or Badeaux J. he would have disagreed
with their 

[Page 281]

conclusion as to how the appeal
should be decided. In my view, he disagreed with the majority only as to the
facts and, certainly, did not differ from them on a question of pure law.

For these reasons I would quash
the appeal.

The judgment of Fauteux and Hall
JJ. was delivered by

HALL JJ.:—The respondent was convicted on a charge which
read:

…le 14ième jour de décembre
1962 en ladite cité, tenait illégalement une maison de jeu, située rue St-Clément,
numéro 503, et ses dépendances. En contravention au statut adopté à cet effet.

The prosecution was under s.
176(1)  of the Criminal Code , keeping a common gaming house. Section
170(2)  (b)(i) was invoked to establish the charge because there was
found on the premises a machine which the Crown alleges was a ""slot
machine"".

The machine and its operation are
described by Rivard J. in his dissenting judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench
as follows:

Il s'agit d'une
machine qui porte le nom de « Spot-A-Card » fabriquée par Gotliet
Manufacturing de Chicago, portant le numéro de série 42,004. C'est de cet
appareil seul dont il peut être question dans cette cause….

L'appareil en
question ne livre pas de marchandise, de jeton, de piécette ou d'argent. Si le
joueur réussit à atteindre un certain nombre de points, à allumer certaines
cartes qui sont disposées dans l'appareil, ou à obtenir un chiffre déterminé,
il a droit à une, deux ou trois parties gratis. La partie consiste à mettre en
mouvement 5 boules. Il s'agit donc d'une machine automatique destinée à être
employée pour l'amusement seulement….

La preuve très
longue versée au dossier nous indique que l'opération de cette machine est
compliquée. Pour la mettre en mouvement, il faut que le joueur y place d'abord
une pièce de $0.05: la machine s'illumine, 5 billes viennent à la surface. En
tirant l'éjecteur, c'est-à-dire une tige mue par un ressort, l'une des boules
vient se placer au bout de la tige et le joueur le met en mouvement en laissant
aller cette tige avec plus ou moins de force, selon qu'il la retient ou la
laisse aller avec toute la puissance du ressort tendu.

Cet appareil qui
est en somme une table à plan incliné vers le joueur, reçoit la bille qui est
lancée vers le sommet de l'appareil. Elle frappe alors des pare-chocs, des
coussinets, des obstacles qui se la renvoient dans des directions inattendues.
C'est en exécutant ces carambolages provoqués par des ressorts ou des
mécanismes électriques cachés derrière les obstacles que la boule frappe, que
des points s'enregistrent. Au bas de l'appareil, de chaque côté du centre,
c'est-à-dire en face du joueur, se trouvent deux 

[Page 282]

ailerons qui sont
également électrifiés et que l'on peut mettre en mouvement en pressant sur un
bouton, de façon à ce que si la bille par hasard vient dans leur direction, on
peut la renvoyer soit au centre, soit au sommet de l'appareil pour qu'elle
recommence ses carambolages et accumule ainsi des points.

Le joueur qui,
avec les 5 billes, a réalisé 1,000 points, a droit à une partie gratis, s'il a
réalisé 1,100 points il a droit à une autre partie, et 1,300 points à une
troisième.

The question to be determined is
whether this machine is a ""slot machine"" within the meaning of s.
170(2)  (b) (i) of the Criminal Code  which reads as follows:

170. (2) In this section
""slot machine"" means any automatic machine or slot machine

***

(b) that is used or
intended to be used for the purpose of vending merchandise or services if

(i) the result of one of any
number of operations of the machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the
operator….

The word ""services"" in
this section includes amusement:

Isseman v. The Queen[6].

Rivard J. held that the results
here were a matter of chance or uncertainty. Casey J. said:

There is evidence that
discloses that the mechanism of the machine seized was electro-magnetically
operated and that the ball could be controlled to an appreciable extent
by the manual operation of baffles or ""flippers"" and by tilting the
machine itself. This satisfies me that the prosecution has not discharged its
burden of proof. (The italics are mine.)

In my view this finding that
""the ball could be controlled to an appreciable extent"" was a finding
of fact and is consistent with Rivard J.'s finding of fact on the same issue.
The dissent, implicit in the opposite conclusions reached by Casey J. and
Rivard J., is that on this finding the prosecution had not discharged the
burden of proof which rested on it to establish that:

(i) the result of one of any
number of operations of the machine is a matter of chance or uncertainty to the
operator, …

The section does not require the
prosecution to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the player cannot
control

[Page 283]

the ball at all. The burden is
met even when the proof establishes some measure of control, but there remain
elements of ""chance or uncertainty"".

Under s. 597(1) (a) of the
Criminal Code  this Court is incompetent to entertain an appeal if the
ground of appeal raises only a question of mixed law and fact. The ground of
appeal must raise a question of law in the strict sense and in respect to which
there is a disagreement, expressed or implied, between the minority and the
majority in the Court of Appeal: Demenoff v. Her Majesty the Queen[7].

The finding that the ball could
be controlled to an appreciable extent by the player was a finding which Casey
J. erroneously held as negativing proof of the commission of the offence and
resulted in his finding that the prosecution had not discharged its burden of
proof. Once it is accepted that the player has only partial control over the
ball, then all elements of the offence have been met.

I agree with Rivard J. and would allow
the appeal and sustain the conviction.

Appeal allowed and
conviction restored, CARTWRIGHT J. dissenting.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Trial—Injuries received in fall on
escalator—Action for damages—Questions submitted to jury—Supplementary charges,
questions and suggestions—Jurymen confused—New trial directed.

The plaintiff, while shopping in the
defendant’s department store, stepped on an old‑fashioned type of
escalator. The heel of her shoe stuck in the tread and while trying to extract
it as the escalator was descending, she twisted her body to get her foot from
the shoe. She finally succeeded in pulling her foot free but immediately fell
backwards to the bottom of the escalator and was injured.

An action was brought and during the trial
seven questions as agreed upon were submitted to the jury. The first question,
answered in the affirmative, was: “Were the injuries to the plaintiff caused by
an unusual danger on the defendant’s escalator of which the defendant knew or
ought to have known?” In the second question the jury was asked, if the answer
to question 1 was “yes”, to state fully in what such danger consisted. The
answer, based on an exhibit of a sample cleat, stated that it was possible for
the cleats to work loose. The trial judge, having asked the jury to retire,
said to counsel that the answer to the questions seemed to be inconclusive. The
jury was recalled and instructed to return to the jury-room and “if you can,
say what the danger was”. If they could not, they were to change the answer to
the first question to “no”, which in the event was done. Subsequently, the jury
was reinstructed several times with regard to question 3: “Did the defendant
take reasonable care by notice or otherwise to prevent such injury?” It was
finally agreed that an answer was not required.

The judgment of the trial judge dismissing
the action was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. An appeal in forma pauperis was
brought to this Court. No question arose as to the amount of damages; the only
question raised was one of liability.

Held: (Judson
J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed limited
to the question of liability.

Per Kerwin
C.J. and Taschereau, Cartwright and Fauteux JJ.: The jurymen were confused by
the various supplementary charges, questions and suggestions put to them by the
trial judge. The trial and its result were so unsatisfactory that the verdict
could not stand. Dozois v. Pure Spring Co. Ltd. and Ottawa Gas Co., [1935]
S.C.R. 319, followed; Herd v. Terkuc, [1960] S.C.R. 602, referred to.

Per Judson J.,
dissenting: When the jury answered the first question affirmatively,
they supported their finding with a reason which could not be founded on any
evidence that they had heard. Their finding

[Page 181]

was not one of fault. In the circumstances,
the trial judge, who had already instructed the jury on fact and law, had the
power and the. duty to instruct the jury to reconsider the answer to question
2. On reconsideration, they found that there was no unusual danger. This was
the correct finding on the evidence. Having answered question 1 in the
negative, there was no answer required for questions 2 and 3. There was no
impropriety in the subsequent discussion of these points in the presence of the
jury.

APPEAL in forma pauperis from a
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming a judgment of McLennan J. Appeal allowed, Judson J.
dissenting.

P.B.C. Pepper, Q.C., for the plaintiff,
appellant.

B.J. Thomson, Q.C., for the defendant,
respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau,
Cartwright and Fauteux JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE:—This is an appeal in forma
pauperis by the plaintiff in the action, Emily Jane McCormack, from a
decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which without recorded reasons affirmed the judgment at the trial
of the Honourable Mr. Justice McLennan dismissing the action.

The appellant was shopping in the department
store of the respondent on August 22, 1956. She stepped on an old-fashioned
type of escalator no longer in service to descend to the basement. The heel of
her shoe stuck in the tread and while trying to extract it as the escalator was
descending, she twisted her body to get her foot from the shoe which had a
strap across it. The heel was an ordinary one. She finally succeeded in pulling
her foot from the shoe but immediately fell backwards to the bottom of the
escalator and was injured. No question arises as to the amount of damages, but,
as we are of opinion that a new trial should be had on the question of
liability, all reference is omitted to the proceedings at the trial except such
as is necessary to indicate the reasons for our conclusion.

The action was tried with a jury and the
questions to be submitted had been agreed upon. These questions and the
answers, which the jury first brought in, are as follows:

1. Were the injuries to the Plaintiff
caused by an unusual danger on the Defendant’s escalator of which the Defendant
knew or ought to have known?

Answer: “Yes”

[Page 182]

2. If your answer to question No. 1 is
“Yes”, then state fully in what such danger consisted.

Answer: “On Exhibit 16, the sample of the
cleat shown, we find non-slip material on sides and bottom of the cleat which
is mortised into the bottom plate, proving in our opinion that it is possible
for these cleats to work loose.”

3. Did the Defendant take reasonable care
by notice or otherwise to prevent such injury?

Answer: “No”

4. Did the Plaintiff use reasonable care
for her own safety?

Answer: “Yes”

5. If your answer to question No. 4 is “No”
wherein did she fail to use reasonable care?

(No Answer)

6. If your answers to questions 3 and 4 are
“No” state in percentages the degree of fault attributable to each.

(No Answer)

7. Irrespective of how you answer the other
questions, at what amount do you assess the Plaintiff’s damages?

Answer: $10,500.00.

Counsel for neither party desired to have the
jury retained but the trial judge nevertheless asked them to retire and he then
considered with counsel the answer to Question 2. When the jury had again
retired, the trial judge stated to counsel that the answer to the questions
seemed to be inconclusive. After some considerable further discussion the jury
was recalled and instructed by His Lordship to return to the jury-room and “if
you can, say what the danger was”. He added:

I am going to return these answers to you
and I have put at the bottom of the sheet ‘No. 2(a)’. I want you, if you can,
to answer that question as to what the danger was and not your reasons for it.
If you cannot, then don’t answer it and change the answer to the first question
to ‘No’.

Is that clear?

FOREMAN: Yes, my lord.

Court adjourned for twenty minutes when the jury
returned and the following occurred:

REGISTRAR: Gentlemen of the jury, have you
agreed upon your verdict?

FOREMAN: We have.

His LORDSHIP: Gentlemen, you have changed
your answer to Question 1 from ‘Yes’ to ‘No’. So that means that presumably
Question 3 remains as ‘No’. I should have put that to you before. That is, did
the defendant take reasonable care by notice or otherwise to prevent such
injury.

[Page 183]

FOREMAN: My lord, we decided if you wanted
that question changed we agreed that it should be changed to ‘Yes’.

A JUROR: No.

FOREMAN: Pardon me. Somebody disagrees with
me.

His LORDSHIP: I think perhaps then,
gentlemen, I must send you back again. I think that is the only right thing to
do. On the basis of these questions, if your answer to Question No. 1 is ‘Yes’,
then the next (sic) question: ‘Did the defendant take reasonable care by notice
or otherwise to prevent such injury?’ Your answer to that was ‘No.’. But you
have changed the answer to Question No. 1 to ‘No’, so Question No. 3 does not
arise, presumably. However, that is the way it is. So I invite you now to
retire to your jury room. It must follow logically, gentlemen, that that is the
way.

The jury retired and the following discussion
occurred between His Lordship and counsel:

His LORDSHIP: I think we might wait for a
few moments, gentlemen. I wouldn’t expect the jury to be long. Did I make it
sufficiently clear to them that their answer to No. 1 being ‘Yes’, their—

MR. THOMSON: If the answer to Question
is is ‘No’—I beg your pardon. Were the injuries caused by an unusual danger?
They have changed that to ‘No’.

His LORDSHIP: Then 3 does not arise at all.

MR. THOMSON: That’s right. I didn’t
understand that your lordship was telling them that they should perhaps strike
out their answer to 3, if that is what your lordship—

His LORDSHIP: That is what I intended to
say. Perhaps I didn’t say it aptly.

MR. THOMSON: I think you said that the
answers should be consistent.

His LORDSHIP: Perhaps I should call them
back once more.

Whereupon the jury was again recalled and the
following occurred:

His LORDSHIP: Gentlemen, I come back to
Question No. 3: ‘If your answer to Question 1 is “Yes”, then did the
defendant take reasonable care by notice or otherwise to prevent such injury?’
Now, if your answer to Question No. 1 is now ‘No’, you need not answer Question
3. So my suggestion would be that you strike out the word ‘No’ in answer to
Question 3. But I think you will have to do it by agreement. Is it all agreed
between you?

SOME JURORS: Yes.

His LORDSHIP: It is?

A JUROR: It seems logical.

His LORDSHIP: YOU see, you really don’t
need to answer that question. I wanted the verdict clear. That is your verdict,
is it, gentlemen?

SOME JURORS: Yes.

The trial judge thereupon granted the motion of
counsel for the respondent that the action be dismissed with costs.

[Page 184]

In Dozois v. The Pure Spring Company Limited
and The: Ottawa Gas Company[1], a
new trial was directed by this Court because it was found that the trial and
its result were so unsatisfactory that the verdict should not stand and there
should be a new trial. In the present case we are of opinion that the jurymen
were confused by the various supplementary charges, questions and suggestions put
to them by the trial judge and that there was that kind of error referred to in
Dozois. While in Herd v. Terkuc[2]
it was held that the course there followed by the trial judge was a proper
one, it was pointed out at p. 606 that the power to tell the jury to reconsider
their verdict is not one to be used lightly.

The appeal is therefore allowed, the judgment of
the Court of Appeal and the judgment at the trial set aside and a new trial
directed limited to the question of liability. The appellant is entitled to her
costs in the Court of Appeal and also in this Court, but, as to the latter, by
our Rule 142(4), she will have only her out-of-pocket expenses and
three-eighths of the usual professional charges under the other items of the
tariff including the application upon which leave to appeal in forma
pauperis was granted. The costs of the first trial will be disposed of by
the Justice presiding at the new trial.

JUDSON J. (dissenting):—In my respectful
opinion, which is contrary to that of the majority of the Court, I would not
send this case back for a new trial but would dismiss the appeal.

When the jury said that there was an unusual
danger of which the defendant knew or ought to have known, they supported their
finding with a reason which could not be founded on any evidence that they had
heard. They said that it was possible for a cleat to work loose because a
particular exhibit had non-slip material at the bottom and on its sides. This
exhibit was produced as a specimen cleat and there was no evidence whatever
from which they could infer that it had ever been attached to the elevator or
any elevator. Their finding was not one of fault.

It is apparent from what took place when the
jury returned with these two answers that counsel for the defendant was not
going to urge that they be sent back.

[Page 185]

He was satisfied that their answers did not
constitute a finding against his client. Counsel for the plaintiff did not ask
to have the jury sent back. He may well have thought that he had the maximum
finding in his client’s favour. In these circumstances, the trial judge, who
had already adequately instructed the jury on fact and law, had the power and
the duty to instruct the jury to reconsider the answer to question 2. He was
merely telling them to face the issues. He asked them to find whether there was
a worn cleat or a loose cleat. It was in this way that the case had been
originally put to them. When they were told that they must do one thing or the
other, they came back with a clear answer which denied liability. They found
that there was no unusual danger which, in my opinion, was the correct finding
on the evidence. Having answered the first question in the negative, there was
no answer required for questions 2 and 3. There was no impropriety in the subsequent
discussion of these points in the presence of the jury. There should not be a
new trial on this ground.

Following Herd v. Terkuc[3], the power of the learned trial
judge is unquestionable. If he had waited for a motion for judgment he might
well have dismissed the action on the questions as first answered. I think,
with respect, that he followed the better course in sending the jury back.

Appeal allowed with costs and a new
trial directed limited to the question of liability, JUDSON J. dissenting.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Hall leased for bingo
games—Owner’s president on premises when games played—No participation in games
by president—Refreshment stand and commissionaire provided by company—Whether
president was “one who keeps a common gaming house”—Criminal Code , 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, s. 176.

A company, of which the respondent was
president, owned an hotel and was licensed to carry on the business of a public
hall. The company leased its hall on four successive nights of each week to
four different charitable. organizations, which conducted bingo games, the
proceeds of which were used for charitable purposes. These organizations, in
each case, made their own arrangements for the conduct of the games, supplying
their own equipment and personnel for that purpose. They paid to the company a
standard rental per night for the use of the hall, which was not in any way
dependent upon the number of persons who played in the games. The respondent
was on the premises each evening, but did not participate in any way in the
games. The company employed a commissionaire and operated a refreshment stand.
The respondent was convicted on a charge of keeping a common gaming house
contrary to s. 176(1)  of the Criminal Code , but this conviction was
quashed by a majority decision of the Court of Appeal. The Crown appealed to
this Court.

Held (Kerwin
C.J. and Taschereau J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Cartwright,
Martland and Ritchie JJ.: In order to constitute the offence of keeping a
common gaming house, there must be something more than the keeping of a place
whose use, by someone other than the accused, makes it a common gaming house.
The position of a “keeper” who does not in any way participate in the operation
of the games played, but who knows that the place in question is being used for
that purpose, and who permits such use, is that which was contemplated when the
lesser offence defined in s. 176(2) (b) was created. That offence
must have been created because it was not contemplated that such a person was,
himself, keeping the common gaming house within the meaning of s. 176(1) .

The offence defined in s. 176(1)  involves
some act of participation in the wrongful use of the place and the evidence in
the instant case did not establish any such participation on the part of the
respondent.

Per Kerwin
C.J. and Taschereau J., dissenting: By subs. (1)(h)(ii) of
s. 168 of the Code, wherein “keeper” is defined, the respondent was a person
who “assists or acts on behalf of an owner or occupier of a place” or at least
“appears” to do so. The fact that by subs. (2) (b) of s. 176
everyone who, as agent, knowingly permits a place to be let or used for the
purposes of a common gaming house or common betting

[Page 125]

house is guilty of an offence punishable
on summary conviction could not by itself restrict the broad meaning given
by Parliament to the word “keeper” in s. 168. A person who falls within the
definition of a “keeper”, “keeps” a “common gaming house” within s. 176(1) .

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal
from a conviction for keeping a common gaming house. Appeal dismissed, Kerwin
C.J. and Taschereau J. dissenting.

J.W. Austin, for the appellant.

P.B.C. Pepper, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Kerwin C.J. and of Taschereau J.
was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):—This
appeal is concerned with the proper interpretation of portions of s. 168  and s.
176  of the Criminal Code :

168. (1) In this Part,

* * *

(d) “common gaming house”
means a place that is

(i) kept for gain to which persons resort
for the purpose of playing games; or

(ii) kept or used for the purpose of
playing games

* *
*

(C) in which, directly or indirectly, a fee
is charged to or paid by the players for the privilege of playing or
participating in a game or using gaming equipment, or

* *
*

(h) “keeper” includes a
person who

(i) is an owner or occupier of a place,

(ii) assists or acts on behalf of an owner
or occupier of a place,

(iii) appears to be, or to assist or act on
behalf of an owner or occupier of a place,

(iv) has the care or management of a place,
or

(v) uses a place permanently or
temporarily, with or without the consent of the owner or occupier; and

(i) “place” includes any
place, whether or not

(i) it is covered or enclosed,

(ii) it is used permanently or temporarily,
or

(iii) any person has an exclusive right of
user with respect to it.

(2) A place is not a common gaming house
within the meaning of subparagraph (i) or clause (B) or (C) of subparagraph
(ii) of paragraph (d) of subsection (1)

* *
*

[Page 126]

(b) while occasionally it is used by
charitable or religious organizations for the purpose of playing games for
which a direct fee is charged to persons for the right or privilege of playing,
if the proceeds from the games are to be used for a charitable or religious
object.

(3) The onus of proving that, by virtue of
subsection (2), a place is not a common gaming house is on the accused.

* *
*

176. (1) Every one who keeps a common
gaming house or common betting house is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for two years.

(2) Every one who

(a) is found, without lawful excuse,
in a common gaming house, or common betting house, or

(b) as owner, landlord, lessor,
tenant, occupier or agent, knowingly permits a place to be let or used for the
purposes of a common gaming house or common betting house,

is guilty of an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

The respondent was convicted by a magistrate, in
the Province of Ontario, on a
charge that in 1959 and 1960 he, in the Municipality of
 Metropolitan Toronto, in the County of York, unlawfully did keep a
common gaming house situate and known as the Club Kingsway, contrary to the Criminal
Code . On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2]
the conviction was set aside, MacKay J.A. dissenting.

Kerim Brothers Limited was the registered owner
of a lot and of a building thereon in which it carried on business as
proprietor of an hotel known as the Kingsway Hotel. That company was licensed
by the Metropolitan Licensing Commission. The company operated on the premises
a club, known as The Kingsway, and the building was used for a number of
purposes including dancing, banquets, receptions and displays. During the period
in question the company leased its hall on four successive nights of each week
to four different religious and charitable organizations which conducted bingo
games, the proceeds of which were used for charitable purposes. These various
organizations supplied their own equipment and personnel for the bingo games
and paid to the company a standard rental for the use of the hall irrespective
of the number of persons who played the games. The respondent was the president
of the company and while he did not participate in the bingo games, the

[Page 127]

fees were paid either in cash or by cheque to
him or to one Buckingham. The cheques were not made payable to either of these
men.

Undoubtedly the charge was laid under subs. (1)
of s. 176  of the Criminal Code , which is in Part V of the Code and by
subs. (1)(d) of s. 168 , which is in the same Part and which might
be repeated:

168. (1) In this Part,

* *
*

(d) “common gaming house”
means a place that is

(i) kept for gain to which persons resort
for the purpose of playing games; or

(ii) kept or used for the purpose of
playing games

* *
*

(C) in which, directly or indirectly, a fee
is charged to or paid by the players for the privilege of playing or
participating in a game or using gaming equipment, or

Subsection (2), which might also be
repeated, reads as follows:

(2) A place is not a common gaming house
within the meaning of subparagraph (i) or clause (B) or (C) of subparagraph
(ii) of paragraph (d) of subsection (1)

* *
*

(b) while occasionally it is
used by charitable or religious organizations for the purpose of playing games
for which a direct fee is charged to persons for the right or privilege of
playing, if the proceeds from the games are to be used for a charitable or
religious object.

There can be no question that the premises were
used as a common gaming house as defined, and no point is made that the
organizations which conducted the games of bingo fell within subs. 2(b).
By subs. (1)(h)(ii) of s. 168 , the respondent is a person who “assists
or acts on behalf of an owner or occupier of a place” or at least “appears” to
do so. The fact that by subs. 2(b) of s. 176  everyone who, as agent,
knowingly permits a place to be let or used for the purposes of a common gaming
house or common betting house is guilty of an offence punishable on summary
conviction cannot by itself restrict the broad meaning given by Parliament
to the word “keeper” in s. 168 . There are many examples where the Crown may
proceed summarily or by indictment.

I can come to no conclusion other than that when
Parliament widened the definition of a “keeper”, a person who falls within that
definition “keeps” a “common gaming

[Page 128]

house” within s. 176(1) . If a tenant of a house
operates it as a common gaming house, without the knowledge of the owner, the
latter cannot be said to “knowingly” permit a place to be let or used for the
purposes of a common gaming house or a common betting house.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of
the Court of Appeal and restore the conviction.

The judgment of Cartwright, Martland and Ritchie
JJ. was delivered by

MARTLAND J.:—The respondent was charged with
keeping a common gaming house, contrary to the provisions of subs. (1) of s.
176  of the Criminal Code . The facts, which are not in dispute, are as
follows:

Kerim Brothers Limited (hereinafter referred to
as “the company”) for some years has been the registered owner of the Kingsway
Hotel, in Metropolitan Toronto. The company was licensed to carry on the
business of a public hall and to sell refreshments and cigarettes. The premises
have, on occasion, been used for dances, banquets, receptions, business
displays and other purposes. From about February of 1959 to June of 1961 the
company leased its hall, on four successive nights of each week, to four
different religious and charitable organizations, which conducted bingo games,
the proceeds of which were used for charitable purposes.

These organizations, in each case, made their
own arrangements for the conduct of the games, supplying their own equipment
and personnel for that purpose. They paid to the company a standard rental per
night for the use of the hall, which was not in any way dependent upon the
number of persons who played in the games.

The respondent was the president of the company
and was on the premises each evening, but he did not, himself, participate in
any way in the bingo games. The company did employ a commissionaire and it
operated a soft drinks refreshment stand.

The respondent was convicted of the offence
charged, but the conviction was quashed by a majority decision of the Court of
Appeal of Ontario[3]. From that decision
the Crown has now appealed.

[Page 129]

The relevant sections of the Criminal
Code  are the following:

168. (1) In this Part,

* *
*

(d) “common gaming house”
means a place that is

(i) kept for gain to which persons resort
for the purpose of playing games; or

(ii) kept or used for the purpose of
playing games

* *
*

(C) in which, directly or indirectly, a fee
is charged to or paid by the players for the privilege of playing or participating
in a game or using gaming equipment, or

* *
*

(h) “keeper” includes a
person who

(i) is an owner or occupier of a place,

(ii) assists or acts on behalf of an owner
or occupier of a place,

(iii) appears to be, or to assist or act on
behalf of an owner or occupier of a place,

(iv) has the care or management of a place,
or

(v) uses a place permanently or
temporarily, with or without the consent of the owner or occupier; and

(i) “place” includes any
place, whether or not

(i) it is covered or enclosed,

(ii) it is used permanently or temporarily,
or

(iii) any person has an exclusive right of
user with respect to it.

* *
*

176. (1) Every one who keeps a common
gaming house or common betting house is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for two years.

(2) Every one who

(a) is found, without lawful excuse,
in a common gaming house or common betting house, or

(b) as owner, landlord, lessor,
tenant, occupier or agent, knowingly permits a place to be let or used for the
purposes of a common gaming house or common betting house,

is guilty of an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

As previously mentioned, the charge was laid
under subs. (1) of s. 176  and the question in issue is whether, upon these
facts, the respondent was “one who keeps a common gaming house”.

The submission of the Crown is that the
respondent, on these facts, was a “keeper”, within the definition of that word,
that the hall was a “common gaming house”, within the definition of that term,
and that, therefore, the respondent was “one who keeps a common gaming house”,
within s. 176(1) .

[Page 130]

The position of the respondent is that a person
who is a keeper, within the definition, is not necessarily one who keeps a
common gaming house, within the meaning of s. 176(1) , and this contention is
supported on the ground that the word “keeper” is not used in that
subsection and that specific provision was made in subs. (2)(b) for
a lesser offence, punishable on summary conviction, in respect of classes of
persons a member of which would fall within the definition of a keeper, who
“knowingly permits a place to be let or used for the purposes of a common
gaming house”. It is argued that if a keeper, within the definition, is
automatically guilty of an offence under subs. (1), because the place of which
he is a keeper is used by others as a common gaming house, then there was no
need to create the lesser offence, defined in subs. (2)(b).

On the facts, it would appear that the
respondent fell within the definition of a keeper. It also appears that persons
resorted to the premises in question for the purpose of playing games and that
the premises were used for that purpose, so as to constitute them a common
gaming house within the definition.

The definition of a keeper in s. 168(1) (h)
is a very broad one and it relates to the keeper of a “place”, which is
also broadly defined. Every householder and, indeed, every landowner is a
keeper within that definition. But this, of course, in itself, constitutes no
offence. The offence defined in s. 176(1)  is the keeping of a common gaming
house. The question is, if the “place” is used in a manner which constitutes it
a common gaming house, does everyone who falls within the definition of a
keeper of that place automatically keep the common gaming house? In my opinion
that conclusion does not follow. The offence is the keeping of the common
gaming house, and, in my opinion, in order to constitute that offence, there
must be something more than the keeping of a place whose use, by someone other
than the accused, makes it a common gaming house. I do not, for example, see
how the owner of a house leased to a tenant, who; without his knowledge,
operates it as a common gaming house, could possibly be found guilty of the
offence. What then is the position of a “keeper” who does not in any way
participate in the operation of the games played, but who knows that the place
in question is being used for

[Page 131]

that purpose, and who permits such use? This, it
appears to me, is the sort of situation which was contemplated when the offence
defined in s. 176(2) (b) was created and, in my opinion, that offence
must have been created because it was not contemplated that such a person was,
himself, keeping the common gaming house within the meaning of s. 176(1) .

I agree with the conclusion reached by Laidlaw
J.A., in the Court below, that the offence defined in s. 176(1)  involves some
act of participation in the wrongful use of the place and that the evidence in
this case does not establish any such participation on the part of the
respondent.

For these reasons, in my opinion, the appeal
should be dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Constitutional law—Sunday
closing—Bowling alley—Whether infringement of religious freedom—Whether
conflict with Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44—Lord’s Day Act,
R.S.C. 1952, c. 171.

[Page 652]

The appellants were convicted on a charge
that they unlawfully carried on their ordinary calling, to wit, the operation
of a bowling alley on a Sunday, contrary to the Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C.
1952, c. 171. Their appeals were dismissed and they were granted leave to
appeal to this Court. Their main attack was that the Canadian Bill of
Rights, 1960 (Can.), c. 44, had in effect repealed s. 4 of the Lord’s
Day Act, or, in any event, rendered it ineffective.

Held (Cartwright
J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Taschereau,
Fauteux, Abbott and Ritchie JJ.: The Canadian Bill of Rights was not
concerned with “human rights and fundamental freedoms” in any abstract sense,
but rather with such “rights and freedoms” as they existed in Canada immediately before the statute was
enacted. Legislation for the preservation of the sanctity of Sunday has existed
in Canada from the earliest
times and has, at least since 1903, been regarded as part of the criminal law
in its widest sense. Historically such legislation has never been considered as
an interference with the kind of “freedom of religion” guaranteed by the Canadian
Bill of Rights. The effect rather than the purpose of the Lord’s Day Act
should be looked to in order to determine whether its application involved
the abrogation, abridgment or infringement of religious freedom. There was
nothing in that statute which in any way affected the liberty of religious
thought and practice. The practical result of this law on those whose religion
required them to observe a day of rest other than Sunday was purely secular and
financial. In some cases this was no doubt a business inconvenience, but it was
neither an abrogation nor an infringement of religious freedom. The fact that
it had been brought about by reason of the existence of a statute enacted for
the purpose of preserving the sanctity of Sunday could not be construed as
attaching some religious significance to an effect which was purely secular
insofar as non-Christians were concerned.

Per Cartwright
J., dissenting: The purpose and effect of the Lord’s Day Act are
to compel the observance of Sunday as a religious holy day by all the
inhabitants of Canada; this is
an infringement of religious freedom. Construed by the ordinary rules of
construction s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act is clear and unambiguous
and infringes the freedom of religion contemplated by the Canadian Bill of
Rights. Parliament could not be taken to have been of the view that the Lord’s
Day Act did not infringe freedom of religion merely because that Act had
been in force for more than half a century when the Canadian Bill of Rights was
enacted. To so hold would be to disregard the plain words of s. 5(2) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights. Where there is irreconcilable conflict between another Act
of Parliament and the Canadian Bill of Rights the latter must prevail.
Section 4 of the Lord’s Day Act infringes the freedom of religion declared
and preserved in the Canadian Bill of Rights and must, therefore, be
treated as inoperative.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal

Sunday. Appeal dismissed, Cartwright J. dissenting.

The judgment of Taschereau, Fauteux, Abbott and
Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.:—This is an appeal brought with leave
of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario rendered
without formal reasons, which dismissed an appeal from a judgment of Schatz J.
dismissing an appeal by the appellants, by way of stated case for the opinion
of the Court, against their conviction by a provincial magistrate in and for
the County of Hamilton of a charge that they did unlawfully carry on their
ordinary calling, to wit, the operation of a bowling alley, contrary to The
Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171.

By the stated case the learned Magistrate raised
the following questions:

Was I right:—

(a) In holding that the appellants were in
contravention of The Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C, 1952, Ch. 171, and not solely in
breach of By-Law No. 9252 of the Corporation of the City of Hamilton;

(b) In assuming that in proper construction and
application the Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, Ch. 171, is not in conflict with
the Canadian Bill of Rights, S.C. 1960, C. 44  and more particularly with
Section 2  thereof.

Mr. Justice Schatz having answered both
these questions in the affirmative without giving any formal reasons, the sole
ground of appeal argued before the Court of Appeal for Ontario was that:

...in proper construction and application
the Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C., 1952 Ch. 171 is in conflict with the Canadian Bill
of Rights, S.C. 1960, C. 44  and more particularly with Section 2  thereof…

[Page 654]

This Court however granted the appellants leave to
appeal “at large” and on their behalf argument was directed to the following
issues:

(a) That by the legislative
imposition of Sunday observance as a religious value upon the whole Canadian
Community, including those whose religious values and precepts permit them to
engage in activities thus prohibited, the Lord’s Day Act is in conflict with
that human right and fundamental freedom set out in the Bill of Rights as
“freedom of religion”.

(b) That the effect of
Section 2 of the Bill of Rights is, subject to the single qualification
set out in that section, to repeal any federal enactments which are in direct
conflict with the enumerated “...human rights and fundamental freedoms...”
declared and enshrined in the Act.

(c) That statute law necessary for
the regulation of the mode and method in which premises on which bowling is
carried on are to be enjoyed, including the conditions as to time and otherwise
during which the game and recreation might properly be carried on, is properly
the subject of Provincial legislation.

By Section 1 of the Canadian Bill of
Rights it is “recognized and declared that in Canada there have existed and
shall continue to exist without discrimination by reason of race, national
origin, colour, religion or sex the following human rights and fundamental
freedoms, namely,

(a) The right of the individual to
life, liberty, security of the person and enjoyment of property; and the right
not to be deprived thereof except by due process of law;

(b) the right of the
individual to equality before the law and the protection of the law;

(c) freedom of religion;

(d) freedom of speech;

(e) freedom of assembly and
association; and

(f) freedom of the press.”

It is to be noted at the outset that the Canadian
Bill of Rights is not concerned with “human rights and fundamental
freedoms” in any abstract sense, but rather with such “rights and freedoms” as
they existed in Canada
immediately before the statute was enacted. (See also s. 5(1)). It is therefore
the “religious freedom” then existing in this country that is safe-guarded by
the provisions of s. 2 which read, in part, as follows:

Every law of Canada shall, unless it is
expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate
notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied
as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation,
abridgment or in-

[Page 655]

fringement of any of the rights or freedoms
herein recognized and declared,...

It is accordingly of first importance to
understand the concept of religious freedom which was recognized in this
country before the enactment of the Canadian Bill of Rights and after
the enactment of the Lord’s Day Act in its present form, and in this
regard the following observations of Taschereau J., as he then was, speaking
for himself and Kerwin C.J. and Estey J., in Chaput v. Romain[1], appear to me to be significant:

All religions are on an equal footing, and
Catholics as well as Protestants, Jews, and other adherents to various
religious denominations, enjoy the most complete liberty of thought. The
conscience of each is a personal matter and the concern of nobody else.

The position of “religious freedom” in the
Canadian legal system was summarized by Rand J. in Saumur v. The City of Quebec[2], where he said:

From 1760, therefore, to the present moment
religious freedom has, in our legal system, been recognized as a principle of
fundamental character; and although we have nothing in the nature of an
established church, that the untrammelled affirmations of ‘religious belief’
and its propagation, personal or institutional, remain as of the greatest
constitutional significance throughout the Dominion is unquestionable.

It is apparent from these judgments that
“complete liberty of religious thought” and “the untrammelled affirmation of
‘religious belief’ and its propagation, personal or institutional” were
recognized by this Court as existing in Canada before the Canadian Bill of Rights and notwithstanding the
provisions of the Lord’s Day Act.

It is to be remembered that the human rights and
fundamental freedoms recognized by the Courts of Canada before the enactment of
the Canadian Bill of Rights and guaranteed by that statute were the
rights and freedoms of men living together in an organized society subject to a
rational, developed and civilized system of law which imposed limitations on
the absolute liberty of the individual. In referring to the “right of public
discussion” in Re Alberta Statutes[3],

[Page 656]

Sir Lyman Duff acknowledged this aspect of the
matter when he said:

The right of public discussion is, of
course, subject to legal restrictions; those based upon considerations of
decency and public order and others conceived for the protection of various
private and public interests with which, for example, the laws of defamation
and sedition are concerned. In a word, freedom of discussion means, to quote
the words of Lord Wright in James vs. Commonwealth, (1936) A.C. 578, at 627,
‘freedom governed by law’.

Although there are many differences between the
constitution of this country and that of the United States of America, I would
adopt the following sentences from the dissenting judgment of Frankfurter J. in
Board of Education v. Barnette[4], as
directly applicable to the “freedom of religion” existing in this country both
before and after the enactment of the Canadian Bill of Rights:

The constitutional protection of religious
freedom terminated disabilities, it did not create new privileges. It gave
religious equality, not civil immunity. Its essence is freedom from conformity
to religious dogma, not freedom from conformity to law because of religious
dogma.

It is against this background that the effect of
the provisions of the Lord’s Day Act on “religious freedom” as
guaranteed by the Canadian Bill of Rights is to be considered.
Section 4 of the Lord’s Day Act reads as follows:

It shall not be lawful for any person on
the Lord’s Day, except as provided herein, or in any provincial Act or law now
or hereafter in force, to sell or offer for sale or purchase any goods,
chattels, or other personal property, or any real estate, or to carry on or
transact any business of his ordinary calling, or in connection with such
calling, or for gain to do, or employ any other person to do, on that day, any
work, business, or labour.

The italics are my own and indicate the offence
with which the appellants were charged.

There have been statutes in this country since
long before Confederation passed for the express purpose of safeguarding the
sanctity of the Sabbath (Sunday), and since the decision in Attorney General
for Ontario vs. Hamilton Street Railway[5],
it has been accepted that such legislation and the penalties imposed for
its breach, constitutes a part of the criminal law in its widest sense and is
thus reserved to the Parliament of Canada by s. 91(27) of the British

[Page 657]

North America Act. Different considerations, of course, apply to the power to legislate
for the purely secular purpose of regulating hours of labour which, except as
to the regulation of the hours of labour of Dominion servants, is primarily
vested in the provincial legislatures. See the reference re Hours of Labour[6] and Attorney General for Canada
v. Attorney General for Ontario Reference re Weekly Rest in Industrial
Undertakings Act, Minimum Wages Act and Limitation of Hours Act[7].

The immediate question raised in this appeal,
however, is whether the prohibition against any person carrying on or
transacting any business of his ordinary calling on Sunday as contained in the Lord’s
Day Act, supra, is such as to “abrogate, abridge or infringe or to
authorize the abrogation, abridgment or infringement of…” the right of the
appellants to freedom of religion.

It is said on behalf of the appellants that
freedom of religion means “freedom to enjoy the freedom which my own religion
allows without being confined by restrictions imposed by Parliament for the
purpose of enforcing the tenets of a faith to which I do not subscribe.” It is
further pointed out that Orthodox Jews observe Saturday as the Sabbath and as a
day of rest from their labours, whereas Friday is the day so observed by the
members of the Mohammedan faith, and it is said that the Lord’s Day Act imposes
an aspect of the Christian faith, namely, the observance of Sunday on some
citizens who do not subscribe to that faith.

My own view is that the effect of the Lord’s
Day Act rather than its purpose must be looked to in order to
determine whether its application involves the abrogation, abridgment or
infringement of religious freedom, and I can see nothing in that statute which
in any way affects the liberty of religious thought and practice of any citizen
of this country. Nor is the “untrammelled affirmations of religious belief and
its propagation” in any way curtailed.

The practical result of this law on those whose
religion requires them to observe a day of rest other than Sunday, is a purely
secular and financial one in that they are required

[Page 658]

to refrain from carrying on or conducting their
business on Sunday as well as on their own day of rest. In some cases this is
no doubt a business inconvenience, but it is neither an abrogation nor an
abridgment nor an infringement of religious freedom, and the fact that it has
been brought about by reason of the existence of a statute enacted for the purpose
of preserving the sanctity of Sunday, cannot, in my view, be construed as
attaching some religious significance to an effect which is purely secular in
so far as non-Christians are concerned.

As has been indicated, legislation for the
preservation of the sanctity of Sunday has existed in this country from the
earliest times and has at least since 1903 been regarded as a part of the
criminal law in its widest sense. Historically, such legislation has never been
considered as an interference with the kind of “freedom of religion” guaranteed
by the Canadian Bill of Rights.

I do not consider that any of the judges in the
courts below have so construed and applied the Lord’s Day Act as to
abrogate, abridge, or infringe or authorize the abrogation, abridgment or
infringement of “freedom of religion” as guaranteed by the Canadian Bill of
Rights, nor do I think that the Lord’s Day Act lends itself to such
a construction.

I dismiss this appeal with costs.

CARTWRIGHT J. (dissenting):—The
appellants were convicted on February 21, 1962, on the charge that they did, at
the city of Hamilton, unlawfully carry on their ordinary calling, to wit, the
operation of a bowling alley on January 14, 1962 (which was a Sunday) contrary
to the Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171.

It is not questioned (i) that the appellants did
in fact carry on their business as charged or (ii) that their so doing was
forbidden by s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act or (iii) that that Act is intra
vires of the Parliament of Canada.

The conviction is attacked on the ground that
the Canadian Bill of Rights, 1960, 8-9 Eliz. II, c. 44, has in
effect repealed s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act or, in any event, rendered it
ineffective.

The relevant words of the Canadian Bill of
Rights are set out in the reasons of my brother Ritchie, which I have

[Page 659]

had the advantage of reading. As applicable to
the circumstances of this case the provisions of s. 2 may be put as follows:

Every law of Canada shall, unless it is
expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate
notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied
as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation,
abridgement or infringement of… freedom of religion.

That the Lord’s Day Act is a law of Canada within the intendment of this
section is made clear by s. 5(2) of the Canadian Bill of Rights which
reads:

(2) The expression ‘law of Canada’ in Part
I means an Act of the Parliament of Canada enacted before or after the coming
into force of this Act, any order, rule or regulation thereunder, and any law
in force in Canada or in any part of Canada at the commencement of this Act
that is subject to be repealed, abolished or altered by the Parliament of
Canada.

The first question to be decided is whether s. 4
of the Lord’s Day Act does infringe freedom of religion, within the
meaning of those words as used in the Canadian Bill of Rights. In
approaching this question it must be borne in mind that it has been decided
repeatedly that the constitutional power of Parliament to pass the Lord’s
Day Act is found in the fact that it is enacted in relation to religion and
prescribes what are in essence religious obligations. It is for this reason
that it has been held to fall within head 27 of s. 91 of the British North
America Act, the Criminal Law. Conversely it has been decided that
legislation affecting the conduct of people on Sunday but enacted solely with a
view to promoting some object having no relation to the religious character of
that day is within the powers of the Provincial Legislatures.

It cannot be doubted that in 1867 and for many
years prior thereto laws forbidding or compelling specified conduct on Sunday
were regarded as forming part of the criminal law.

In Blackstone’s Commentaries, vol. IV, p. 63,
the learned author says:

Profanation of the Lord’s day, or sabbath-breaking,
is a ninth offence against God and religion, punished by the municipal laws
of England.

[Page 660]

In Fennell et al. v. Ridler[8], Bayley J. delivering the judgment
of the Court of King’s Bench and referring to An Act for the better
observation of the Lord’s Day, commonly called Sunday (1676) 29 Charles II,
c. 7, said:

The spirit of the act is to advance the
interests of religion, to turn a man’s thoughts from his wordly concerns, and
to direct them to the duties of piety and religion.

In Henry Birks & Sons (Montreal) Ltd. v.
Montreal and Attorney General for Quebec[9],
the Court was considering the question whether provincial legislation could
authorize the enactment of a by-law requiring shops to be closed on certain
religious feast-days. Kellock J., with whom Locke J. agreed, said at page 823:

Even if it could be said that legislation
of the character here in question is not properly ‘criminal law’ within the
meaning of s. 91(27), it would, in my opinion, still be beyond the jurisdiction
of a provincial legislature as being legislation with respect to freedom of
religion dealt with by the statute of 1852, 14-15 Vict., c. 175, Can.

I can find no answer to the argument of counsel
for the appellant, that the purpose and the effect of the Lord’s Day Act are
to compel, under the penal sanctions of the Criminal law, the observance of
Sunday as a religious holy day by all the inhabitants of Canada; that this is
an infringement of religious freedom I do not doubt.

I agree with my brother Ritchie that the
following words which he quotes from the judgment of Frankfurter J. in Board
of Education v. Barnette, supra, are appropriate to describe the freedom of
religion referred to in the Canadian Bill of Rights:

Its essence is freedom from conformity to
religious dogma, not freedom from conformity to law because of religious
dogma.

But this passage presupposes that the word “law”
which I have italicized means a law which has a constitutionally valid purpose
and effect other than the forbidding or commanding of conduct in a solely
religious aspect.

In my opinion a law which compels a course of
conduct, whether positive or negative, for a purely religious purpose infringes
the freedom of religion.

[Page 661]

A law which, on solely religious grounds,
forbids the pursuit on Sunday of an otherwise lawful activity differs in
degree, perhaps, but not in kind from a law which commands a purely religious
course of conduct on that day, such as for example, the attendance at least
once at divine service in a specified church.

It was argued that, in any event, in the case at
bar the appeal must fail because there is no evidence that the appellants do
not hold the religious belief that they are under no obligation to observe
Sunday. In my view such evidence would be irrelevant. The task of the Court is
to determine whether s. 4 of the Act infringes freedom of religion. This does
not depend on the religious persuasion, if any, of the individual prosecuted
but on the nature of the law. To give an extreme example, a law providing that
every person in Canada should, on pain of fine or imprisonment, attend divine
service in an Anglican church on at least one Sunday in every month would, in
my opinion, infringe the religious freedom of every Anglican as well as that of
every other citizen.

I have reached the conclusion that construed by
the ordinary rules of construction s. 4 of the Lord’s Day Act is clear
and unambiguous and does infringe the freedom of religion contemplated by the Canadian
Bill of Rights.

I cannot accept the argument that because the Lord’s
Day Act had been in force for more than half a century when the Canadian
Bill of Rights was enacted, Parliament must be taken to have been of the
view that the provisions of the Lord’s Day Act do not infringe freedom
of religion. To so hold would be to disregard the plain words of s. 5(2) quoted
above.

It remains to consider the reasons for judgment
of Davey J.A. in Regina v. Gonzales[10]. At page 239 of the C.C.C. Reports the
learned Justice of Appeal says:

In so far as existing legislation does not
offend against any of the matters specifically mentioned in clauses (a)
to (g) of s. 2, but is said to otherwise infringe upon some of
the human rights and fundamental freedoms declared in s. 1, in my opinion the
section does not repeal such legislation either expressly or by
implication. On the contrary, it expressly recognizes the continued existence
of such legislation, but provides that it shall be construed and applied so as
not to derogate from those

[Page 662]

rights and freedoms. By that it seems
merely to provide a canon or rule of interpretation for such legislation. The
very language of s. 2, ‘be so construed and applied as not to abrogate’ assumes
that the prior Act may be sensibly construed and applied in a way that will
avoid derogating from the rights and freedoms declared in s. 1. If the prior
legislation cannot be so construed and applied sensibly, then the effect of s.
2 is exhausted, and the prior legislation must prevail according to its plain
meaning.

With the greatest respect I find myself unable
to agree with this view. The imperative words of s. 2 of the Canadian Bill
of Rights, quoted above, appear to me to require the courts to refuse to
apply any law, coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, which
infringes freedom of religion unless it is expressly declared by an Act of
Parliament that the law which does so infringe shall operate notwithstanding
the Canadian Bill of Rights. As already pointed out s. 5(2), quoted
above, makes it plain that the Canadian Bill of Rights is to apply to
all laws of Canada already in
existence at the time it came into force as well as to those thereafter
enacted. In my opinion where there is irreconcilable conflict between another
Act of Parliament and the Canadian Bill of Rights the latter must
prevail.

Whether the imposition, under penal sanctions,
of a certain standard of religious conduct on the whole population is desirable
is, of course, a question for Parliament to decide. But in enacting the Canadian
Bill of Rights Parliament has thrown upon the courts the responsibility of
deciding, in each case in which the question arises, whether such an imposition
infringes the freedom of religion in Canada. In the case at bar I have reached the conclusion that s. 4 of the Lord’s
Day Act does infringe the freedom of religion declared and preserved in the
Canadian Bill of Rights and must therefore be treated as inoperative.

It follows that I would allow the appeal and quash
the conviction. Since I have the misfortune to differ from the other members of
the Court as to the result of the appeal it is unnecessary to consider what
order I would otherwise have suggested as to costs.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK, APPEAL
DIVISION.

Criminal law—Constitutional law—Sunday closing—Licensing
by-law—Validity of by-law—Whether encroachment on field of criminal law—Whether
in conflict with Lord's Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171— Whether in conflict with
Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 160, 176—B.N.A. Act, 1867, c. 3.

The accused was charged under a by-law passed by the City of
Saint John in 1908 with operating a bowling alley on Sunday. Section 3 of this
licensing by-law prohibited the operation of a bowling alley between 12
midnight and 6 a.m. on weekdays, ""or on Sunday"". Section 4 prohibited
disorderly conduct and gambling on any licensed premises. Penalties were
provided for contraventions in the final section.

The accused contended that s. 3 of the by-law was invalid as
being an encroachment on the field of criminal law. The charge was dismissed by
a Police Magistrate on the ground that there was a conflict between s. 3 and
the Lord's Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171. On appeal to the County Court,
the accused was convicted. This judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of
New Brunswick, Appeal Division. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

The accused did not question the power of the City of Saint
John to make by-laws for the licensing of bowling alleys within its boundaries.
The matter of closing hours was also within its jurisdiction. Legislation
intended to prevent the profanation of the Sabbath is part of the criminal law
reserved to the Parliament by s. 91(27) of the B.N.A Act. However, the
impugned by-law was not primarily concerned with preserving the sanctity of the
Sabbath, but was directed to the merely local matter of regulating the hours
when certain licensed businesses were to close in the city of Saint John. The
mere addition of the words ""or on Sunday"" at the end of s. 3 did not
afford sufficient evidence to justify the inference that the by-law was
directed towards the prevention of the profanation of the Sabbath and that it
was thus beyond the ambit of provincial authority. Nor could it be said that s.
3 was inoperative as being in conflict with the Lord's Day Act. If the
licensing power vested in the provinces by s. 92(9) of the B.N A. Act was
exercised in respect of a local

[Page 644]

matter and in a manner not repugnant to federal or provincial
law, the provincial authority was entitled to attach such conditions and impose
such penalties as it might see fit. The fact that these conditions were in
conformity with federal legislation in no way invalidated the by-law. For the
same reasons, it could not be said that s. 4 of the by-law was in conflict with
ss. 160  and 176  of the Criminal Code .

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New
Brunswick, Appeal Division1, affirming the conviction of the
accused on a charge of operating a bowling alley on Sunday. Appeal dismissed.

John P. Palmer, for the appellant.

G. T. Clark, Q.C., and E. J. Lahey, for
the respondent.

W. C. Bowman, Q.C., and F. W. Callaghan, for
the Attorney-General of Ontario.

J. W. Anderson, Q.C., for the Attorney
General of Alberta.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Ritchie J.:—This
is an appeal brought with leave of this Court from a judgment of the Appeal
Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick2 which affirmed the
conviction of the appellant for keeping a bowling alley open on Sunday contrary
to the provisions of a by-law duly passed by ""the City of Saint John in
common council convened"" on the 13th of July 1908 under the authority of
the Charter of that city and entitled ""A law to regulate and license
public billiard rooms and pool rooms and bowling alleys in the City of Saint
John"".

The first section of the by-law in question provides that
""no person shall carry on business as a keeper of a public billiard or
pool room or bowling alley without first having obtained a licence
therefor"", and the second section empowers the mayor of the city to grant
such licences at specified fees.

The third and fourth sections read as follows:

3. No person shall keep open any public billiard or pool
room or bowling alley on any week day between the hour of twelve o'clock at
night and the hour of six o'clock in the forenoon, or on Sunday.

[Page 645]

4. No person licensed under the provisions of this law to
keep any such public billiard or pool room or bowling alley shall permit any
drunken or disorderly person, or any keeper of a house of ill fame, to resort
to or frequent the premises kept by him, in respect to which such license has
been granted, or keep, suffer or permit to be kept in such premises any faro
bank, rouge et noir, roulette table or any other device for gambling of any
kind to be carried on therein, or suffer or permit any noise, disorderly
conduct, disturbance or breach of the peace to take place therein.

The final section of the by-law provides, inter alia, that
""any person … who fails to comply with any of the provisions of this law
shall forfeit and pay for each and every time such person shall so act in
contravention of this law a penalty of twenty dollars to be sued for,
prosecuted and recovered in the name of the Chamberlain of the said city for
the time being before the police magistrate or sitting magistrate at the police
office as provided by law …"".

It is admitted that the appellant and one Mortimer L.
Bernstein who were licensed keepers of a bowling alley on Union Street in the
city of Saint John, kept the said bowling alley open on Sunday, the 23rd day of
October 1960, as alleged in the Information but it has been contended
throughout on behalf of the appellant that s. 3 of the by-law in question was
invalid as constituting an encroachment on the field of criminal law.

This charge was dismissed by the police magistrate before
whom the Information was laid on the ground that there was a conflict between
s. 3 of the by-law and the Lord's Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171. In the
course of his reasons for judgment, the learned magistrate said:

In other words, the by-law—if it were allowed to remain
operative— would conflict with the federal statute, the Lord's Day Act, in the
penalty to be imposed; and the penalty is always considered as part of the
statute. On that basis, I would rule that section 3 of the by-law before this
Court … is invalid or inoperative with regard to the matter of Sunday.

Keirstead C.C.J. before whom an appeal was taken pursuant to
the provisions of the Summary Conviction Act, R.S.N.B. 1952, c. 220,
convicted the appellant, he being of opinion

that the relevant provisions of the Lord's Day Act and the
by-law differ in legislative purposes, legal effect and practical effect. The
by-law imposes a duty, provides a regulation and control for purposes or
objects whose nature and character bona fide fall within the field of
provincial competence or authority.

[Page 646]

In the reasons for judgment dismissing the appellant's
appeal delivered by McNair C.J. on behalf of the Appeal Division of the Supreme
Court of New Brunswick, the matter was put thus:

The restrictions in the by-law relating to Sunday
operations, viewed in their context, appear intended for other purposes than to
compel the observance or prevent the profanation of the Sabbath Day. Like their
companion restrictions against night operations they seem in their true nature
and character designed to promote purely secular purposes involving protection
of the right of people in the community to rest and quiet during the prohibited
periods. As such they are, we feel, within the legislative jurisdiction of the
province and fit subject matter for municipal legislation.

The City of Saint John was incorporated by letters patent
issued by the Governor of the Province of New Brunswick in 1785, and the
Charter of that city has since been amended by over 500 acts of the New
Brunswick Legislature. Under the provisions of that Charter, the common council
of the city is given power to make by-laws for, inter alia,

the good rule and government of the … inhabitants and
residents of the said city and for the further public good, common profit,
trade and better government of the said city … provided that such laws be not …
repugnant to the laws of … England or of our said Province.

Since Confederation the powers so conferred are to be
confined to the sphere of authority allotted to the provinces under the British
North America Act. As was observed by Lord Watson in Attorney General
for Ontario v. Attorney General for Canada3:

Since that date, a provincial legislature cannot delegate
any power which it does not possess and the extent and nature of the functions
created must depend upon the legislative authority which it derives from the
provisions of s. 92 other than no. 8.

It is true that s. 15 of the Lord's Day Act, supra, which
was first enacted in 1906, provides that

nothing herein shall be construed to repeal or in any way
affect any provisions of any act or law relating in any way to the observance
of the Lord's Day Act in force in any province of Canada when this Act comes
into force; and where any person violates any of the provisions of this Act and
such offence is also a violation of any other act or law the offender may be
proceeded against either under the provisions of this Act or under the
provisions of any other act or law applicable to the offence charged.

[Page 647]

In this regard, it is to be noted that although the
""Charter of the City of Saint John"" was enacted before Confederation,
the impugned by-law was passed in 1908 and is therefore not a law which was in
force at the time when the Lord's Day Act came into force. The power of
the City of Saint John to make by-laws for the licensing of public billiard
rooms, pool rooms and bowling alleys within its boundaries is not, however,
questioned by the appellant.

The matter of hours at which shops of a specified class
shall close in particular localities in a province is prima facie within
the jurisdiction of such province under head 16 of s. 92 of the British
North America Act. As was said by Duff J. in City of Montreal v.
Beauvais4, it

is a matter which is substantially of local interest in the
province and which in itself is not of any direct or substantial interest to
the dominion as a whole.

It has, however, been accepted since the decision of the
Privy Council in Attorney General of Canada v. Hamilton Street Railway5,
that legislation intended for the purpose of preventing the profanation of
the Sabbath is a part of the criminal law in its widest sense and is thus
reserved to the Parliament of Canada by s. 91(27) of the British North America
Act and the immediate question raised by this appeal is whether it can be
said that the impugned by-law has for its true object, purpose, nature and
character the preservation of the sanctity of the Sabbath or whether it is
directed to the merely local matter of regulating the hours when certain
licensed businesses are to close in the City of Saint John.

In this regard, the submission for the appellant is
succinctly stated in the first paragraph of the argument outlined in the factum
filed on his behalf as follows:

It is submitted that the by-law in question is invalid on
the ground that it purports by the simple words ""or on Sunday"" to
deal with matters of morals or religious observance which fall within the
exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.

The prohibition against keeping public billiard rooms, pool
rooms and bowling alleys open during the hours specified in s. 3 is not to be
read in isolation from the rest of the

[Page 648]

by-law and when the enactment is read as a whole it will be
seen that the impugned section is but one of a number of regulations which the
common council has imposed upon the operators of such businesses in the city of
Saint John. The nature of the restrictions so imposed by the common council
appears to me to reflect nothing more than the opinion of that body as to the
manner in which such businesses are to be carried on for the better government
of the city.

It is not to be lightly assumed that any part of the by-law
is directed to a purpose beyond the legislative competence of the enacting
authority and I do not think that the inclusion of Sunday in the hours of
closing of these businesses necessarily carries with it any moral or religious
significance.

Counsel for the appellant has called to our attention a
number of cases in this Court deciding that provincial statutes designed to
enforce the observance of days of religious obligation are ultra vires, but
in each of these cases the legislation in question carried within itself clear
evidence that it was directed to this end.

It appears to me to be convenient to indicate the
legislation which was before the Court in each of these cases:

(i) Re Sunday Observance6,
in this case the Court was unable to distinguish the draft bill before them
from the statute entitled ""An Act to prevent the profanation of the Lord's
Day"" which was the subject matter of the decision in Attorney General
for Ontario v. Hamilton Street Railway, supra.

(ii) In Ouimet v. Bazin7,
the very title of the Act ""A Law concerning the observance of
Sunday"" bespoke its purpose.

(iii) In St. Prosper v.
Rodrique8, the legislation in question was
a municipal by-law which forbade the opening of restaurants and the sale of
merchandise therein on Sundays, and which contained the following preamble:

Vu qu'il importe dans l'intérêt de la paix et
des bonnes moeurs de prohiber l'ouverture des restaurants le dimanche, et
le commerce des restaurants;.

[Page 649]

(iv) In Henry Birks &
Sons v. City of Montreal and A.G. Quebec9, the impugned
legislation was directed towards the closing of businesses on certain feasts of
obligation of the Roman Catholic Church other than Sunday, and Kellock J.
observed at page 822:

If Sunday observance legislation was designed to enforce
under penalty the observance of a day by reason of its religious significance,
there is no basis for distinction, in my opinion, historically or otherwise,
with respect to legislation directed to the enforcement of the observance of
other days from the standpoint of their significance in any religious faith.

It seems to me that these decisions, dealing as they do with
statutes the very language of which invites the conclusion that they were
intended for the purpose of enforcing the observance of the religious
significance attaching to the Sabbath and to other religious feasts, can have
no application to the by-law now under consideration, the attack upon which is
limited to the fact that the words ""or on Sunday"" have been added to
a list of other times when certain businesses are to be closed.

The language employed by Fitzpatrick C.J. in Ouimet v.
Bazin, supra, at page 507, appears to me to be significant. He there said
of the statute before him:

It is impossible for me to believe that the legislature
intended, by the enactment in question, to regulate civil rights. On the
contrary, the evident object was to conserve public morality and to provide for
the peace and order of the public on the Lord's Day. I am confirmed in this
belief by the title of the Act which is described as ""A Law concerning the
observance of Sunday""; and, as Sedgewick J., speaking for the majority of
this court, said in O'Connor v. Nova Scotia Telephone Co., 22 S.C.R. 276
at page 293: ""We cannot with propriety shut our eyes to the words of the
title"".

As I have indicated, I have reached the conclusion that the
by-law here in question, entitled as it is ""A Law to regulate and license
public billiard and pool rooms and bowling alleys in the city of Saint
John"" and primarily concerned as it undoubtedly is with secular matters,
has for its true object, purpose, nature or character, the regulation of the
hours at which businesses of special classes shall close in a particular
locality in the Province of New Brunswick which is a matter of a merely private
nature in that province. As I have also indicated, I am of opinion that the
mere

[Page 650]

addition of the words ""or on Sunday"" at the end of
s. 3 does not afford sufficient evidence to justify the inference that this by-law
is directed towards the prevention of the profanation of the Sabbath and that
it is thus beyond the ambit of provincial authority.

Nor do I think that it can be said that s. 3 of the by-law
is inoperative as being in conflict with the Lord's Day Act. The
licensing power vested in the provinces by s. 92(9) is not limited to the shop,
saloon, tavern and auctioneer licenses specified in that section, and if that
power is exercised in respect of a merely local matter and in a manner which is
not repugnant to federal or provincial law the provincial authority is, in my opinion,
entitled to attach such conditions and impose such penalties as it may see fit
in respect to the manner in which the persons so licensed shall conduct the
businesses which are the subject of such licenses. The fact that one or more of
the conditions so imposed is in conformity with legislation validly passed by
the federal government in no way invalidates the by-law.

What was said by Judson J. in O'Grady v. Sparling10,
concerning the alleged conflict between s. 55(1) of the Highway Traffic
Act of Manitoba and s. 221  of the Criminal Code  appears to me to
have direct application to the conflict here alleged between the by-law and the
Lord's Day Act. He there said at page 811:

There is no conflict between these provisions in the sense
that they are repugnant. The provisions deal with different subject matters and
are for different purposes.

And later in the same paragraph:

Even though the circumstances of a particular case may be
within the scope of both provisions (and in that sense there may be an overlapping)
that does not mean that there is conflict so that the Court must conclude that
the provincial enactment is suspended or inoperative.

It was argued before the appeal division that the entire by-law
was ultra vires because the provisions of s. 4 were in conflict with ss.
160  and 176  of the Criminal Code . As to this argument, the learned Chief
Justice expressed himself as follows:

Sections 3 and 4 of the by-law seem to us separate and
distinct as to subject matter, being in no way integrated in object or purpose,
and

[Page 651]

we feel the doctrine of severability aptly applies.
Assuming, therefore, without deciding, that section 4 is constitutionally
invalid its illegality does not affect the validity of section 3.

With the greatest respect, I do not share the doubts
expressed by McNair C.J., as I take the view that s. 4 and the penalty which
accompanies its breach constitute nothing more than another condition imposed
by the city in the exercise of its right to control the manner in which these
businesses shall be operated within its boundaries, and the above quoted
reasoning of Judson J. in O'Grady v. Sparling, supra, applies with equal
force to this section.

In all other respects, I am in agreement with the reasons
for judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick and I
would dismiss this appeal but without costs.

By order of this Court, the Attorney General of Canada and
the attorneys general of the provinces were served with notice of this appeal
together with a copy of the factum of the appellant and the respondent and it
was directed that any attorney general who desired to be heard should file a
factum in this Court and serve a copy on each of the parties. The Attorney
General for the Province of Alberta was, however, the only intervenant.

Appeal dismissed without costs.

APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF
HABEAS CORPUS 

Criminal law—Habeas corpus—Theft
from mail and possession—Conviction and sentence—Whether writ available.

The applicant was tried in the Supreme Court of British
Columbia before a judge and a jury on two counts of theft from the mail and two
counts of possession. He was convicted on the four counts and was sentenced to
the penitentiary. He applied to this Court for a writ of habeas corpus.

Held: The application should be dismissed.

The applicant was confined pursuant to convictions made and
sentences imposed by a Court of competent criminal jurisdiction. The
certificate of conviction was valid on its face. In these circumstances no
relief could be afforded by way of habeas corpus. Goldhar v. The
Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 431, applied.

Application for a writ of habeas
corpus referred to the Court by Spence J. Application refused.

No one appearing for the
applicant.

W. G. Burke-Robertson,
Q.C., contra.

[Page 65]

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

CARTWRIGHT J.:—This is an
application for a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, originally made
before Spence J. and referred by him to the Court pursuant to Rule 72. The
application is made in writing and the applicant did not appear and was not
represented by counsel.

It appears from the certificate
of sentence that the applicant was tried in the Supreme Court of British
Columbia before Hutcheson J. and a jury on the following counts:

(1) Theft of money from
mail.

(2) Theft of watch from
mail.

(3) Possession of money
stolen from mail.

(4) Possession of watch
stolen from mail.

that he was convicted on all four
counts and, on February 1, 1963, was sentenced on each of counts (1) and (2) to
four years imprisonment in the penitentiary and on each of counts (3) and (4)
to two years imprisonment in the penitentiary, the four sentences to run
concurrently.

It appears therefore that the
applicant is confined pursuant to convictions made and sentences imposed by a
Court of competent criminal jurisdiction. The certificate of conviction is
valid on its face. The reasons for judgment delivered in this Court in Goldhar
v. The Queen[1]
and the authorities therein discussed, make it clear that in these
circumstances no relief can be afforded to the applicant by way of habeas
corpus.

It follows that the application
for a writ of habeas corpus should be dismissed and I would so order.

Application dismissed.

MOTION FOR A REHEARING.

Criminal law—Conspiracy to effect unlawful
purpose—Obtaining from constable information which it was his duty not to
divulge—Whether indictment disclosed an offence under Criminal Code —Criminal
Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 103, 408(2)—The Ontario Provincial Police Act,
R.S.C. 1960, c. 298—Rule 61 of the Supreme Court of Canada.

Following the dismissal of their appeal to this Court in June
1963, two of the appellants, M and F, applied for a
rehearing of the appeal in December 1963. They argued that the indictment that
they conspired to effect the unlawful purpose of obtaining from a constable of
the Ontario Provincial Police information which it was his duty not to divulge,
did not disclose an offence under the Criminal Code  of Canada.

Held: Assuming that this Court had jurisdiction to
entertain the application, it should be dismissed.

The purpose alleged in the charge was an unlawful purpose. The
fact that the purpose or the breach of trust contemplated by the conspirators,
whether as their ultimate aim or only as a means to it, could be, if carried
into effect, punishable either under s. 103  of the Criminal Code  or
under s. 60 of the Ontario Provincial Police Act, manifested the
unlawfulness of the purpose within the meaning of the law attending Common Law
conspiracies.

APPLICATION by two of the appellants for a rehearing of
this appeal following the judgment rendered by this Court1. Appeal dismissed.

C. Thomson, for the applicants.

C. Powell, contra.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Fauteux J.:—On
June 24, 1963, this Court dismissed an appeal2
entered by Robert J. Wright, Joseph P. McDermott and Vincent B. Feeley against
their conviction on the following charge:

2. And further that the said Robert J. Wright, Joseph P.
McDermott and Vincent Bernard Feeley between the 1st day of January, 1960 and
the

[Page 193]

1st day of July, 1960 in the Province of Ontario did unlawfully
agree and conspire together to effect an unlawful purpose, to wit:

To obtain from George Scott, a constable of the Ontario
Provincial Police, information which it was his duty not to divulge, contrary
to the Criminal Code  of Canada, Section 408(2).

Some six months later, in December 1963, both McDermott and
Feeley, purporting to be so entitled under rule 61 of the Rules of this Court,
applied to this Court for an order granting a rehearing of the appeal on the
ground that the above indictment did not disclose an offence under the Criminal
Code  of Canada. Having heard and considered the submissions of counsel for
the applicants, the Court, indicating that reasons would later be delivered,
declared that, assuming it had jurisdiction to entertain the application, the
ground upon which it was made was ill-founded. The application was dismissed.

The charge is laid under s. 408(2)  of the Criminal Code  providing
that:

408.(2) Every one who conspires with any one

(a) to effect an unlawful
purpose or,

(b) to effect a lawful
purpose by unlawful means,

is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to
imprisonment for two years.

The argument made in support of the application is centred
upon the meaning to be ascribed to the term ""unlawful purpose"". It
was contended that the unlawful purpose contemplated in the section must be one
which, if carried into effect, would constitute an act declared to be criminal
by the Criminal Code  of Canada and that, as the purpose alleged in the
charge was made unlawful under s. 60 of The Police Act, R.S.O. 1960, c.
298, the charge did not disclose an offence under the Criminal Code . The
case of Regina v. Sommervill and Kaylich3 was particularly
relied on.

While marginal notes in the body of an Act form no part of
the Act, the marginal note appended to s. 408(2)  accurately designates as
""Common Law conspiracy"" the offence described in this section which,
as defined by Lord Denman in Rex v. Jones4,
consists in a combination ""either to do an unlawful act, or a lawful
act by unlawful means"". Common Law conspiracy is one of the few Common Law
offences which, upon the 1954 revision of the Criminal

[Page 194]

Code, Parliament thought advisable to perpetuate by
codification. Martin's Criminal Code  1955 ed., p. 35.
Hence the law pertaining to this offence, its elements and the wide embracing
import of the term ""unlawful purpose"", remains unchanged. While the
term, as shown in Harrison The Law of Conspiracy, encompasses more than
criminal offences, sufficient it is to say, for the purpose of this case, that
the purpose alleged in the charge, to wit, the obtention from
a constable of information which it is his duty not to divulge, is an unlawful
purpose. In the language of Lord Mansfield, in Rex v. Bembridge5:

A man accepting an office of trust concerning the public,
especially if attended by profit, is answerable criminally to the King for
misbehaviour in his office.

The fact that the purpose or the breach of trust
contemplated by the conspirators, whether as their ultimate aim or only as a
means to it, be, if carried into effect, punishable either under s. 103  of the Criminal
Code  (vide Rex v. McMorran6)
or under s. 60 of the Ontario Provincial Police Act, adequately
manifests the unlawfulness of the purpose within the meaning of the law
attending Common Law conspiracies.

With deference, I am unable to agree with the decision
rendered in Regina v. Sommervill and Kaylich, supra, and to accept as well founded the ground
alleged in support of this application which, as indicated above, has been
dismissed at the issue of the hearing.

Application dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.

Criminal law—Indians—Game laws—Hunting with night light
contrary to s. 31(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 94—Whether
prohibition applies to Treaty Indians—Whether word ""hunt"" in s. 73(1)
of the Act subject to limitations in s. 81(1)—The Manitoba Natural Resources
Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 180, s. 13.

The appellants were charged with unlawfully hunting big game
by means of night lights, contrary to s. 31(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act,
R.S.M. 1954, c. 94. The appellants were Treaty Indians and were hunting deer
for food for their own use and on lands to which they had the right of access.
They were acquitted by the magistrate, but their acquittal was set aside by the
Court of Appeal. They were granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The appeal should be allowed and an acquittal
directed.

In regard to Indians, the word ""hunt"" as used in s.
72(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act was not ambiguous nor subject to any
of the limitations which are imposed by s. 31(1) upon non-Indians.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba1, setting aside the appellants'
acquittal by a magistrate on a charge under s. 31(1) of The Game and Fisheries
Act of Manitoba. Appeal allowed.

Duncan J. Jessiman, Q.C., for the appellants.

Benjamin Hewak, for the respondent.

[Page 82]

Gerald LeDain, Q.C., for the Attorney-General
of Quebec, intervenant.

S. Freedman, for the Attorney General of
Alberta, intervenant.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

Hall J.:—The
appellants, both of them Treaty Indians, were charged before Magistrate Bruce
McDonald of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba:

That they did on or about the 27th day of October, A.D.
1961, at or near the Rural Municipality of South Cypress, in the Province of
Manitoba, unlawfully hunt big game by means of night lights, contrary to the
Provisions of the Game and Fisheries Act and Regulations, Section 31(1).

Section 31(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act, R.S.M.
1954, c. 94, provides as follows:

31(1) No person shall hunt, trap or take any big game
protected by this Part and the regulations by means of night lights of any
description, traps, nets, snares, baited line, or other similar contrivances,
or set such traps, nets, snares, baited line, or contrivance for such big game
at any time, and, if so set, they may be destroyed by any person without
incurring any liability for so doing.

The learned Magistrate acquitted the appellants because the
term ""night lights""

… as used in the above subsection was not capable of
definition, that the land upon which the hunting was being done was land to
which the Indians had access in that there were no prohibition signs posted,
and that the Indians were entitled, in any event, to hunt in any manner they
saw fit on land to which they had access.

The Crown took an appeal by way of stated case to the Court
of Appeal for Manitoba2. The questions propounded were as
follows:

(a) having found that Rufus
Prince, George Prince, and Robert Myron were hunting big game by means of a
spotlight was I right in holding that such spotlight was not a night light
within the meaning of Section 31(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act, R.S.M. 1954,
Cap. 94;

(b) was I right in interpreting
the term ""night lights"" as contained in Section 31(1) of The Game and
Fisheries Act, R.S.M. 1954, Cap. 94, as a classification or description of an
object rather than a method or means of hunting;

(c) having found that the land
upon which Rufus Prince, George Prince and Robert Myron were hunting was land
that was occupied

[Page 83]

and under cultivation and
privately owned land, was I right in holding that such land was land to which
the said Rufus Prince, George Prince, and, Robert Myron had a ""right of
access"";

(d) having found that the land
upon which Rufus Prince, George Prince and Robert Myron were hunting was land
to which the said Rufus Prince, George Prince and Robert Myron had ""a
right of access"", was I right in dismissing the charge under Section 31(1)
of The Game and Fisheries Act on this ground.

The Court of Appeal answered questions (a) and (b) in the
negative; question (c) in the affirmative and question (d) in the negative,
Schultz and Freedman JJ.A. dissenting as to (d). The Court accordingly directed
that the case be referred back to the learned Magistrate with a direction that
conviction should be entered against the three accused and that appropriate
penalties should be imposed.

Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on January 22,
1963.

It was admitted in this Court that at the time in question
in the charge the appellants were Indians; that they were hunting deer for food
for their own use and that they were hunting on lands to which they had the
right of access. These admissions are fundamental to the determination of this
appeal.

Section 72(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act, R.S.M.
1954, c. 94, reads as follows:

72(1) Notwithstanding this Act, and in so far only as is
necessary to implement The Manitoba Natural Resources Act, any Indian may hunt
and take game for food for his own use at all seasons of the year on all
unoccupied Crown lands and on any other lands to which the Indian may have the
right of access.

The above section refers to The Manitoba Natural
Resources Act, R.S.M. 1954, c. 180, of which s. 13 thereof reads as
follows:

13. In order to secure to the Indians of the Province the
continuance of the supply of game and fish for their support and subsistence,
Canada agrees that the law respecting game in force in the Province from time
to time shall apply to the Indians within the boundaries thereof, provided,
however, that the said Indians shall have the right, with which the Province
hereby assures to them, of hunting, trapping and fishing game and fish for food
at all seasons of the year on all unoccupied Crown lands and on any other lands
to which the said Indians may have a right of access.

There was a suggestion that the appeal involved a
constitutional issue as to the validity of The Game and Fisheries Act,
R.S.M. 1954, c. 94, in respect to Indians. The

[Page 84]

Attorney-General for Ontario gave Notice of Intervention and
the Provinces of Quebec and Alberta did likewise. Prior to the appeal being
heard, the Province of Ontario filed a Notice of Withdrawal. The Provinces of
Quebec and Alberta filed factums and were represented by counsel at the
hearing. They were not heard as the Court held that no constitutional issue
arose in the appeal. The agreement dated December 14, 1929, between the
Government of Canada and the Government of the Province of Manitoba containing,
inter alia, said s. 13, pursuant to which The Manitoba Natural Resources Act
was passed acquired the force of law by virtue of The British North
America Act, (1930), 21 George V, c. 26.

The sole question for determination is whether the word
""hunt"" as used in s. 72(1) of The Game and Fisheries Act,
R.S.M. 1954, c. 94, in regard to Indians is ambiguous in any way or subject to
the limitations contained in s. 31(1) of the said Act.

With respect, I agree with the reasons of Freedman J.A. in
his dissenting judgment and also with the statement by McGillivray J.A. in Rex
v. Wesley3, when he said:

If the effect of the proviso is merely to give to the
Indians the extra privilege of shooting for food ""out of season"" and
they are otherwise subject to the game laws of the province, it follows that in
any year they may be limited in the number of animals of a given kind that they
may kill even though that number is not sufficient for their support and
subsistence and even though no other kind of game is available to them. I
cannot think that the language of the section supports the view that this was
the intention of the law makers. I think the intention was that in hunting for
sport or for commerce the Indian like the white man should be subject to laws
which make for the preservation of game but, in hunting wild animals for the
food necessary to his life, the Indian should be placed in a very different
position from the white man who, generally speaking, does not hunt for food and
was by the proviso to sec. 12 reassured of the continued enjoyment of a right
which he has enjoyed from time immemorial.

The word ""hunt"" as used in the section under
review must be given its plain meaning. ""Hunt"" is defined in the
Oxford English Dictionary as:

The act of chasing wild animals for the purpose of catching
or killing them; to chase for food or sport; to scour a district in pursuit of
game.

Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines
""hunt"" as: ""To follow or search for game for the purpose

[Page 85]

and with the means of capturing or killing."" It is
not ambiguous nor subject to any of the limitations which s. 31(1) imposes upon
the non-Indian.

I would allow the appeal with costs throughout and direct
that the acquittal of the appellants be confirmed. There should be no order as
to costs for or against the Attorneys-General of Quebec and Alberta.

Appeal allowed and acquittal directed, with
costs.

Gardner & Johnston, Winnipeg.
