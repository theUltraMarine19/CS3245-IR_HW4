GROUNDS OF DECISION
The accused, Mohd Nasrul Esyam bin Shamsudin, was tried on the charge that on 30 September 1993 at about 10.10am at the Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore, did import into Singapore three blocks containing not less than 5,031g of cannabis, a controlled drug, and had thereby committed an offence under s 7 punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (the Act).
Prosecution Case
The evidence for the prosecution by way of statements was virtually unchallenged.
On 30 September at about 10.10am the accused driving a maroon-coloured Proton Saga, TL 2648 (the car), entered Singapore at Woodlands Checkpoint. After he had obtained the Vehicle Entry Permit for the car and had cleared immigration, he drove into Lane 7 for customs clearance. Special Constable Chan Wai Mun (SC Chan) of the Police Dog Unit who was on duty at this lane directed him to park his car at the customs inspection pit for a dog check on his car. On SC Chan's request, the accused handed his passport to him. SC Chan also asked in English if the car belonged to him and he nodded in reply.
After the accused had parked the car at the inspection pit, he was taken to the Dog Handlers' Office, next to the inspection pit, where his particulars were recorded in the Vehicle Record Book by Special Constable Tan Chwee Seng (SC Tan). He was told to get in a chair by the side of SC Tan, with the car within his sight.
SC Chan then led his narcotic detector dog ""Ben 1"" to search the car. When ""Ben 1"" was taken into the car, the dog reacted positively to something in the interior of the car by scratching the back of the driver's seat. Immediately, SC Chan stooped down to check. He found a L-shaped package wrapped with brown masking tape under the driver's seat. He took the package out and held it up and looked at the accused. On seeing the package, the accused jumped up and bolted from his chair. He dashed round the corner, jumped over the fence behind the Dog Handlers' Office, and ran towards Yaohan Best ""The Best Connection"", a departmental store, at Woodlands Centre Road.
Police Constable Chew Hang Khin and a Travel Control Corporal, Tan Hock Guan, immediately gave chase. The two officers saw the accused slide under the roller shutter door of the main entrance of the departmental store. They followed him through that entrance and saw him run into a store room. When they reached the door, they found it locked. With the aid of the shop manager and the storekeeper the door to the store room was unlocked. The two officers caught the accused in the back of the store room. At that time, he was heard to say, ""It is not my thing"". He was handcuffed and brought back to Woodlands Checkpoint where he was detained.
At about 11.30am Inspector Chong Wee Kee, the Investigating Officer (IO), from CNB arrived at the scene. In the course of her investigations, she directed a further search of the car in the presence of the accused. At about 1.40pm SC Chan who carried out the search found two more packages, also wrapped in brown masking tape, hidden behind the side panel of the driver's door. Afterwards the three packages were weighed, again in the presence of the accused, and found to be of a gross weight of 5.6kg. Later, the accused and the three packages were taken to CNB Headquarters.
That afternoon, under the direction of the IO, Sergeant Mohd Fahmi, examined the packages for fingerprints. Only on the L-shaped package were latent fingerprints found but they did not belong to the accused. Also, that day, samples of urine were taken from the accused, and subsequently they were sent to the Department of Scientific Services for analysis. They were found to contain morphine.
On 1 October the IO handed the three packages to Dr Lee Tong Kooi of the Department of Scientific Services for analysis. Dr Lee found each of them to contain compressed vegetable material which he analysed and found to be cannabis. On 18 February Dr Lee issued three certificates in respect of the three packages which collectively contained a net weight of not less than 5,031g of cannabis, a Class A controlled drug listed in the First Schedule of the Act.
The IO also made other inquiries, in the course of her investigations. In her evidence she said she had ascertained that the owner of the car TL 2648 was not the accused, but one Kamarul Zaman in Kelantan. The accused had rented the car from him for three days. In cross-examination she confirmed that the accused had in his s 121 statement said that he had come from Kelantan not in the car, TL 2648, but in another car, DW 3554 or DW 3556. In re-examination, she said she had traced DW 3554 as the registration number of a Yamaha vehicle (which in the trial was accepted to be a motorcycle) and DW 3556 was a Mitsubishi wagon, similar to a landrover.
Clearly the presumptions in ss 21 and 18(2) of the Act applied to the facts in this case. At the close of the prosecution case I found that a prima facie case had been made out against the accused on the charge of importation of the cannabis which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. When called upon him to enter his defence, the accused elected to give evidence.
The Defence
The accused, a Malaysian, aged 20 years at the time of the offence, lived in Pasir Puteh, Kelantan, and was working as a landscape artist. He was a drug addict. He started with ganja or cannabis and progressed to heroin which he called ""obat"".
He first came to Singapore in January 1992. Between then and his arrest on 30 September 1993, he had visited Singapore four to five times. On the previous occasions, he was paid to come to Singapore to fetch a friend back to Kelantan. This time he came to collect batik and dress materials for his friend, Zulkifli.
The accused's evidence was that a few days before his arrest, in Kelantan, he had approached Zulkifli for a loan of RM$500. Zulkifli, however, told him that he could earn the money by driving to Singapore to bring back dress materials to Kelantan for sale. He agreed.
On Zulkifli's instructions he hired the car, TL 2648 for three days at RM$80 per day. Zulkifli gave him RM$100 for the deposit which he paid to the owner. However, the accused did not drive the car as Zulkifli wanted to get the car checked and serviced for the journey to Johor Baru. Instead, Zulkifli asked him to drive another car, a white Proton Iswara, DW 3554. Much later in his evidence the accused sought to retract the number of the car, as regards which he said he might have been mistaken - this was when he was reminded of what the IO had found out from her investigations.
The accused left his home town, Pasir Puteh, in Kelantan at 3.00pm on 27 September. He drove alone. He arrived in Kuantan at about 8.30pm. There, he met Zulkifli who had arrived in car TL 2648, with three passengers, Ismail, Hafiz and Rosdi. After their dinner, they left Kuantan in the same manner - the accused alone and Zulkifli driving TL 2648 with the other three. Together they arrived in Johor Baru at about 3.00am on 28 September. The five of them checked into one room in Hotel Sentosa.
The accused then gave a lengthy account of how he spent the next three days in Johor Baru. Briefly, except for one short outing at 8.00pm on 29 September, he remained throughout in the hotel room consuming drugs by ""chasing the dragon"". The drugs were supplied by Zulkifli.
On 30 September at about 8am, the accused was awakened by Zulkifli and told to drive car TL 2648 to Singapore to collect the dress materials. Zulkifli handed him the keys to the car. Zulkifli also told him that he would leave for Singapore later and that they were to meet at a coffeeshop at the Woodlands Bus Interchange. Before he left, he had a packet of milk and smoked some heroin.
When the accused came out of the hotel, he could not find the car and had to look for it. He found it parked on a road by the side of the hotel. He did not examine the car when he got into it as he had no reason to suspect anything about the car. He drove the car to the Johor Baru Bus Terminal where he had a petition writer enter his particulars in the Disembarkation Form for a fee of Malaysian fifty cents.
Upon reaching Woodlands Checkpoint, he went to a booth to get the Vehicle Entry Permit and to another for his passport to be processed. He then drove the car to Lane 7 for customs inspection. He opened the boot of the car and he was cleared. As he was about to drive off, SC Chan raised his hand to stop him and asked for his passport. He was directed to park the car at the inspection pit for a dog check. At the pit, though he was only asked to open the boot of the car, he voluntarily opened the doors of the car for the dog search. He confirmed that he was asked in English whether the car belonged to him and had nodded that it did.
The rest of the accused's evidence was broadly along the lines of the prosecution case. The accused said that he was shocked to see SC Chan hold up the package, and it was that without thinking, in a moment of panic, he had run away. He was asked why he was shocked. He replied: ""I did not expect `something' to be found in my car."" Later, when he was apprehended, he had repeatedly said: ""That is not mine"".
From the departmental store where he was arrested, he was led to Woodlands Checkpoint by a group of police officers. He said that on the way he saw Zulkifli driving the white Proton Iswara through the Immigration Checkpoint with Hafiz in the car. At that time he was about 25 feet away from the stationary car. He saw the car number, DW 3554. And, he added, he even saw Hafiz get out of the car whilst Zulkifli remained in the driver's seat. In cross-examination, he said he was in a state of confusion, he said more than once ""I felt like a fool at that time"". He did not alert the police officers of the presence of Zulkifli and Hafiz at the Checkpoint. Later, he ventured another reason: as he did not know who the owner of the package was, or the person who had placed it in the car, it did not occur to him to point out the two men to the police officers.
In the course of the lengthy cross-examination of the accused the learned DPP, Ms Christine Lee, sought to impeach the credit of the accused. She wanted to refer to the long statement the accused had given to the IO. This was strenuously objected to by the defence, inter alia, that it was not voluntarily made. Their followed a trial within the trial, at the end of which I allowed certain extracts from the long statement to be admitted as an exhibit (P48A), as I was satisfied that no threat, promise, or inducement had been made in the recording of the long statement.
It is now sufficient for me to state that as I did not, when I found the accused guilty on the charge, rely on any of the extracts of the long statement to determine the creditability of the accused on the facts in issue, there is no need for me to make any further reference in these Grounds of Decision to this aspect of the case.
SUBMISSION
Mr Muzammil for the accused conceded that by virtue of ss 21 and 18(2) of the Act, the presumptions of possession and knowledge operated against the accused. The burden was on the accused to rebut these presumptions on a balance of probabilities. His defence was that he was an innocent courier who had no knowledge that (a) there were three packages hidden in the car, and (b) the packages contained cannabis.
The defence relied on the following items of evidence:
(1) The accused, a drug addict, had consumed heroin on 28 and 29 of September and on the morning of 30 September that he was in a confused state when he drove the car from Johor Baru to Singapore.
(2) The accused only had possession of the car on the morning of 30 September when Zulkifli gave him the key to drive the car; at that time, he had no reason to suspect that there were drugs hidden in the car; he did not search the car.
(3) The car was used by Zulkifli and was accessible to others, including Hafiz, whose shoes were found in the boot of the car.
(4) At Woodlands Checkpoint the accused would have driven away when he had the opportunity but had allowed the car for the dog check; he had even opened the car doors for SC Chan to check the inside of the car. (5) Upon arrest, the accused had repeatedly said that the package was not his.
(6) As the three packages were hidden in the car, the accused could not have known of them.
(7) The accused had maintained his innocence in his cautioned statement by stating that he was not guilty.
The learned DPP, in her written submission, argued that when one considers the totality of the evidence, it was clear that the prosecution had proved the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.
FINDINGS
The issue of fact in this case is whether the accused knew or, at least, had rebutted the presumption of knowledge placed upon him that there were three packages of cannabis in the car when he drove it into Singapore that morning.
On a careful review of the evidence I found that the accused gave an incredible account of how he came to drive the car into Singapore; more crucial and damaging was his conduct at Woodlands Checkpoint, when the package was found in the car. Taking the totality of the evidence I found as a fact that he was not an innocent carrier of the offending packages he had brought into Singapore. The following are the principal findings on the evidence.
(1) That morning the accused was not in a confused state due to drug consumption as he was in full control of himself when he drove the car. He looked for and found the car TL 2648 parked in the vicinity of the hotel; he had his Disembarkation Card properly entered by a petition writer at the bus terminal; and at Woodlands Checkpoint he obtained the Vehicle Entry Permit and got immigration clearance. He appeared normal to the police officers who saw him that morning. And, most importantly, there was no evidence that he suffered from any withdrawal symptoms after his arrest.
(2) The fact that the accused bolted when he saw SC Chan hold up the package, besides proof that he was most alert at that time, proved beyond reasonable doubt, that he knew SC Chan had found the drugs and he had to escape to avoid arrest. To my mind, an innocent carrier would not instinctively run away; he would stay put to find out what was in the package and would want to give his explanation.
(3) The claim of the accused that after his arrest he saw Zulkifli and Hafiz at the Woodlands Checkpoint was a blatant lie. If, indeed, he had seen them, as an innocent carrier the natural survival instinct in him would have surely prompted him to identify them to the police officers as the owner or owners of the package found under the driver's seat.
(4) The evidence of the accused that Zulkifli had arranged to meet him at a coffeeshop at Woodlands Bus Terminal later that morning was another untruth, for if there was such an appointment the accused, as an innocent carrier of the package would have told the police officers of this fact and they would have arranged to set a trap to arrest Zulkifli when he turned up for the appointment.
(5) There was no mention of any of the facts raised in his defence in the cautioned statement; in this statement, he merely stated: ""I am not guilty. That is all"". It seemed to me that if it were the truth that he had no knowledge of the three packages of drugs found in the car, this would have been the easiest thing for him to say in his cautioned statement; and to state that he had seen Zulkifli and Hafiz at the Checkpoint and identify them, or one of them as the owners of the packages. After all, he was accused of a charge which carried the death penalty.
I found that the accused had failed, on a balance of probabilities, to rebut the presumptions. On the evidence as a whole, I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty on the charge. He was convicted and sentence of death was passed on him.",1994-06-06 00:00:00,SG High Court
