SUPPLEMENTAL GROUNDS OF JUDGMENT
As the Plaintiffs have filed a Respondents' Notice appealing against my decision on the quantum of damages which I awarded to the First Plaintiff pursuant to the Defendant's Notice of Appeal, I now give my reasons for the amount of damages which I awarded to the First Plaintiff, in particular for loss of future earnings, in addition to my grounds ofjudgement touching on liability dated 11 October 1991.
The Plaintiffs are dissatisfied with the sum of $72,000 awarded to the First Plaintiff based on a multiplicand of $400 per month.
At the material time the First Plaintiff was in the Secondary 4 class in the Methodist Girls' School and about to take her 'O' level finals. According to her principal Mrs Anna Tham (PW6) the First Plaintiff was very active in sports; she was a school squash player and a member of the netball as well as track and field teams. Academically however she was an average student. Her school report book (exh D1) showed that whilst the First Plaintiff did pass her examinations every year and she was promoted, her results were very average. Although under cross examination DW6 disagreed that she was somewhat biased in the First Plaintiff's favour in her appraisal of the latter's future, I found on the evidence that I could not share her confidence that the First Plaintiff would in all probability have gained entry into a junior college and thereafter gone onto either the Institute of Education or the university and qualified as a teacher.
Based on the First Plaintiff's academic record, I could not accept PW6's evidence that with the ceasing of all training before the preliminary examinations and with a last minute spurt, the First Plaintiff would have done better at the preliminary examinations than in her previous examinations and, but for the accident, she would have eventually entered the teaching profession. At best the First Plaintiff in my view would have completed her 'A' levels education, qualified as a secretary or assumed such other similar post. Granted that she was in the express stream of her school and that she had moved from a lower rank class to a middle rank class at one time. That however did not mean that she would proceed to tertiary education for a certainty, given the intense competition to gain entry into the local universities.
Consequently, I rejected the figure of $1,600 put forward by the Plaintiffs' Counsel as the First Plaintiff's monthly loss of future earnings and the multiplier of 18+ years. In place thereof I substituted a multiplicand of $400 and a multiplier of 15 years with a consequential reduction from $355,200 to $72,000 as the First Plaintiff's total loss of future earnings. Counsel for the Defendant had proposed the range $350-$500 as the multiplicand due to the lack of evidence in particular from her father the Second Plaintiff (PW4) as to his future plans for the First Plaintiff or as to her own plans.
I was of the view that the sum of $1,600 put forward by her Counsel was excessive as it was based on the estimated salary of a young professional or executive on which there was no evidence before the court. As Lord Goddard said in the case of < Bonham-Carter v Hyde Park Hotel Ltd > (1948) 64 T.L.R. 177:-
Plaintiffs must understand that if they bring actions for damages it is for them to prove their damage; it is not enough to write down the particulars, and, so to speak, throw them at the head of the Court, saying: ""This is what I have lost; I ask you to give me these damages."" They have to prove it.
I had already expressed my doubts that the First Plaintiff would have joined the teaching let alone other professions. Even if she did qualify as a teacher, I was of the view that $400 would be the appropriate multiplicand for a teacher qualified to teach physical education and or who held a general degree. The same multiplicand was also appropriate in the event the First Plaintiff became a secretary at say a starting salary of between $800-$900 after obtaining shorthand and other secretarial qualifications or joined a bank or took on some other office position. Taking into account her background, living and other expenses, tax considerations, discounting for the fact that the award would be a lump sum payment and for other contingencies, I felt that $400 would be the First Plaintiff's average net loss of income regardless of whether she ended up teaching or working in an office. Taking a multiplier of 15 years (on which the Plaintiffs are not appealing), I arrived at the figure of $72,000 as the First Plaintiff's total loss of earnings.
As part of her claim for general damages, the First Plaintiff claimed the sum of $62,160 for loss of future employer's Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions calculated at 17+%. I rejected this item of claim as I agreed with Counsel for the Defendant that the CPF element cannot be calculated separately. In the First Plaintiff's case, it must be remembered that she had yet to join the labour force and it would be too speculative to compute her loss of CPF contributions when evidence of her future career is itself inconclusive. The authorities cited by Counsel for the First Plaintiff in support of this head of claim concerned plaintiffs who were actually working and whose loss of earnings as well as employer's CPF contributions could be calculated with certainty. Accordingly I did not think they were relevant.",1992-01-09 00:00:00,SG High Court
