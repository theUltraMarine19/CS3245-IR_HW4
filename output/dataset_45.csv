on appeal from the court of appeal for alberta

                    Criminal law — Infanticide — Elements of offence
— Accused found
guilty of infanticide in relation to her deceased newborns — Offence provision providing that
female person commits infanticide when by wilful act or omission she causes
death of her newly‑born child, if at time of act or omission she is not
fully recovered from effects of giving birth to child and by reason thereof or
of effect of lactation consequent on birth of child her mind is then disturbed — Legal
meaning of expression “her mind is then disturbed” — Whether trial judge failed
to apply legal standard set out by statutory language and failed to appreciate
evidence of accused’s mental state — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, s. 233 . 

                    In
October 2010, a newborn child was found crying in a dumpster. B admitted that
she had given birth to the child. She later admitted to having delivered two
other babies in 2008 and 2009 and leaving each of them in a dumpster. B was
charged with two counts of second degree murder in relation to the deceased
newborns. The trial judge acquitted B of murder and found her guilty of two
counts of infanticide. The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the
Crown’s appeal. 

                    Held:
The appeal should be dismissed. 

                    Infanticide
is a form of culpable homicide and applies in the narrow set of circumstances
where (1) a mother, by a wilful act or omission, kills her newborn child
and, (2) at the time of the act or omission, the mother’s mind is
“disturbed” either because she is not fully recovered from the effects of
giving birth or by reason of the effect of lactation.

                    The
question of the meaning of the phrase “her mind is then disturbed” is one of
statutory interpretation. The grammatical and ordinary sense of the words,
their place within the Criminal Code , the provision’s legislative
history and evolution, and the jurisprudence interpreting the phrase “her mind
is then disturbed” do not support the conclusion that Parliament intended to
restrict the concept of a disturbed mind to those who have “a substantial
psychological problem”. Rather, the phrase “mind is then disturbed” should be
applied as follows: (a) the word “disturbed” is not a legal or medical
term of art, but should be applied in its grammatical and ordinary sense;
(b) in the context of whether a mind is disturbed, the term can mean
“mentally agitated”, “mentally unstable” or “mental discomposure”; (c) the
disturbance need not constitute a defined mental or psychological condition or
a mental illness. It need not constitute a mental disorder under s. 16  of
the Criminal Code  or amount to a significant impairment of the accused’s
reasoning faculties; (d) the disturbance must be present at the time of
the act or omission causing the “newly‑born” child’s death and the act or
omission must occur at a time when the accused is not fully recovered from the
effects of giving birth or of lactation; (e) there is no requirement to
prove that the act or omission was caused by the disturbance. The disturbance
is part of the actus reus of infanticide, not the mens rea;
(f) the disturbance must be “by reason of” the fact that the accused was
not fully recovered from the effects of giving birth or from the effect of
lactation consequent on the birth of the child.

                    The
trial judge, relying on the defence expert’s opinion and the evidence as a whole,
concluded that B’s mind was “disturbed” as a result of not yet having fully
recovered from the effects of giving birth. There was no error in the trial
judge’s summary of the law of infanticide. Based on his assessment of the
evidence, the trial judge was entitled to conclude or have a reasonable doubt
that B’s mind was “disturbed” at the time of the offences despite any
indication of rational behaviour and wilful blindness.

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
This case requires us to explore a particularly
dark corner of the criminal law, the law of infanticide. Section 233  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , provides that “[a] female person commits
infanticide when by a wilful act or omission she causes the death of her
newly-born child, if at the time of the act or omission she is not fully
recovered from the effects of giving birth to the child and by reason thereof
or of the effect of lactation consequent on the birth of the child her mind is
then disturbed”. The focus of the appeal is the legal meaning of the phrase
“her mind is then disturbed”, a phrase which is not defined in the Code
and for which the case law has provided little explanation. 

[2]                             
In my opinion, Parliament intended the concept
of a “disturbed” mind in this offence to have its ordinary meaning, so as to
provide a broad and flexible legal standard which will serve the ends of
justice in the particular circumstances of these difficult cases. While we can
provide some limited guidance for trial judges and juries, the rest is left, by
Parliament’s design, to their good judgment.

II.          
Overview of Facts, Issues and Judicial History

[3]                             
In October 2010, a newborn child was found
crying in a dumpster. The respondent, who was sitting nearby, admitted that she
had given birth to the child. She later admitted to having delivered two other
babies in 2008 and 2009 and leaving each of them in a dumpster. 

[4]                             
The respondent was charged with two counts of
second degree murder in relation to the deceased newborns. Two expert witnesses
were called at trial, each with opposing views on whether the respondent’s mind
was disturbed at the time of the offences. 

[5]                             
Dr. Kenneth Hashman, called by the Crown, was of
the opinion that the respondent’s “balance of the mind”, as that expression is
used in s. 672.11 (c) of the Criminal Code , was not disturbed at the time
of the commission of the alleged offences in 2008 and 2009. Dr. Jeannette
Smith, called by the defence, concluded that the respondent’s actions were
explained by her mind being disturbed as a result of her not yet having fully
recovered from the effects of giving birth. 

[6]                             
The main issue at trial and on appeal was
whether the evidence gave rise to a reasonable doubt as to whether the
respondent’s mind, at the time of the acts which resulted in the children’s
deaths, was disturbed by reason of not having fully recovered from the effects
of giving birth or lactation.

[7]                             
The trial judge accepted Dr. Smith’s opinion. In
rejecting Dr. Hashman’s opinion, the trial judge noted that the expert failed
to refer to an “important symptom” in his final report (namely that the
respondent suffered “significant depersonalization” evidenced by statements
that she felt like she had “zero control” of her actions and was “observing
from outside” her own body); erroneously applied the “balance of the mind”
language found under s. 672.11 (c) of the Criminal Code ; and that he
seemed to require that the respondent have a mental disorder in order to have a
disturbed mind. 

[8]                             
In addition to Dr. Smith’s opinion, the trial
judge considered the case as a whole, including that the respondent had no
criminal record and no psychopathic or sociopathic tendencies. The trial judge
concluded, as a result of the respondent’s “bizarre actions” and Dr. Smith’s
opinion, that the respondent’s mind was disturbed as a result of the births.
Consequently, the trial judge found that the Crown failed to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the respondent’s mind was not disturbed.  The trial judge
acquitted the respondent of murder and found her guilty of two counts of
infanticide. 

[9]                             
On the Crown’s appeal of the acquittal at trial,
the Court of Appeal divided. The majority upheld the acquittals on the counts
of second degree murder. Côté and McDonald JJ.A., writing for the majority,
held that Parliament was deliberately vague in defining infanticide and that
Parliament intended to set “a very low threshold” in using the term
“disturbed”: 2015 ABCA 232, 21 Alta. L.R. (6th) 301, at para. 45, citing R. v. Coombs,
2003 ABQB 818, 343 A.R. 212, at paras. 32 and 37. The majority also concluded
that, while s. 233  does not refer to “balance of the mind”, it was unlikely
that Parliament intended any significant difference between that language and
the “mind is disturbed” as found in s. 233 : para. 50. While the trial
judge was wrong on this point, the majority ultimately found no error in the
trial judge’s analysis of the law on infanticide and dismissed the appeal.

[10]                         
The dissenting justice, Wakeling J.A., found
that a woman had a “disturbed” mind only if her psychological health was
substantially compromised because she recently gave birth and she had a newborn
to care for and, as a result, her ability to make rational decisions promoting
the best interests of her child was substantially impaired. Wakeling J.A. found
that the trial judge and the experts failed to apply this standard (or any
other standard) and would have allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.  

[11]                         
The main issue on the further appeal to this
Court concerns the legal meaning of the phrase “her mind is then disturbed”. I
will first put this issue in the context of the law of infanticide and then
turn to the definitional issue.

III.       
Analysis

A.          
Overview of the Law of Infanticide

[12]                         
The law of infanticide has been comprehensively
reviewed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. L.B., 2011 ONCA 153,
274 O.A.C. 365, leave to appeal refused, [2011] 4 S.C.R. x. I need do little
more than summarize its key conclusions.

[13]                         
Infanticide, which is defined in s. 233  of the Criminal
Code , is a form of culpable homicide and applies in the narrow set of
circumstances where (1) a mother, by a wilful act or omission, kills her
newborn child (under one year of age, as defined by the Criminal Code,
s. 2 ) and, (2) at the time of the act or omission, the mother’s mind is
“disturbed” either because she is not fully recovered from the effects of
giving birth or by reason of the effect of lactation: L.B., at para. 58.


[14]                         
This definition “requires a mother-child
relationship between the perpetrator and the victim”: L.B., at para. 59.
Further, “the mental state of the perpetrator/mother must be disturbed and that
disturbance must be connected to the effects of giving birth or lactation”: ibid.
The offence of “infanticide does not require any causal connection between the
disturbance of the mother’s mind and the decision to do the thing that caused
her child’s death”: ibid.; R. v. Guimont (1999), 141 C.C.C. (3d)
314 (Que. C.A.), at p. 317. The disturbance is part of the actus reus of
the offence, and not the mens rea: L.B., at para. 59.

[15]                         
Infanticide operates both as a stand-alone
offence and as a partial defence, as in this case, to a charge of murder: L.B.,
at paras. 99 and 104; Guimont, at p. 320. Where the evidence establishes
an air of reality to an infanticide defence, the Crown must negate the defence
beyond a reasonable doubt: L.B., at para. 137.

[16]                         
The mens rea of infanticide is the same
as that required for manslaughter: L.B., at para. 114. Thus, “to prove
infanticide, the Crown must establish the mens rea associated with the
unlawful act that caused the child’s death and [the] objective foreseeability
of the risk of bodily harm to the child from that assault”: ibid., at
para. 121. As the Court of Appeal notes, it is the “unique actus reus of
infanticide that distinguishes it from murder and manslaughter”: ibid.

[17]                         
When infanticide is raised as a partial defence
to a charge of murder or manslaughter, the jury should be instructed as set out
in L.B., at para. 139. Where the Crown proves that the accused committed
a culpable homicide, the jury must consider the nature of the culpable homicide
and whether it is infanticide. If the Crown fails to negate at least one of the
elements of infanticide beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury must be instructed
to return a verdict of not guilty of murder, but guilty of infanticide: ibid.

B.           
Disturbed Mind

[18]                         
The question of the meaning of the phrase “her
mind is then disturbed” is one of statutory interpretation. To answer it, we
apply the often reiterated “modern” approach which requires that we read the
words in their “entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense
harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the
intention of Parliament”: E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd
ed. 1983), at p. 87. I will look at the grammatical and ordinary sense of the
words, their place within the Criminal Code , the provision’s legislative
history and evolution, and, finally, at the jurisprudence interpreting this
phrase.

(1)          
Grammatical and Ordinary Sense

[19]                         
  The adjective “disturbed” means “[d]isquieted;
agitated; having the settled state, order, or position interfered with” and
“emotionally or mentally unstable or abnormal”: The Oxford English
Dictionary (2nd ed. 1989), at p. 872.

[20]                         
The French version of the legislation provides
that a woman commits infanticide “si au moment de
l’acte ou de l’omission elle n’est pas complètement remise d’avoir donné
naissance à l’enfant et si, de ce fait ou par suite de la lactation consécutive
à la naissance de l’enfant, son esprit est alors déséquilibré”. Le Grand Robert de la langue française (2nd ed. 2001) defines
“déséquilibré” as “[q]ui n’a pas ou n’a plus son équilibre mental,
psychique”: p. 1344.

[21]                         
The grammatical and ordinary sense of the words
used in s. 233  supports the conclusion that the legislator did not intend to
restrict the availability of infanticide to situations where the psychological
health of the woman was substantially compromised or where a mental disorder
was established. 

[22]                         
The statutory language also shows that there is
no requirement for a causal connection between the disturbance of the accused’s
mind and the act or omission causing the child’s death. There is, however, a
required link between the disturbance and having not fully recovered from the
effects of giving birth to the child or of the effect of lactation consequent
on the child’s birth; in either case the disturbance must be “by reason
thereof”.

(2)          
Statutory Context

[23]                         
The concept of a “disturbed” mind is unique to
infanticide and does not appear elsewhere in the Criminal Code . Conceptually,
a “disturbed” mind must be different from a “mental disorder”, a term used in
s. 16  of the Criminal Code , and, when proved on a balance of probabilities,
can lead to a verdict of not criminally responsible. It must also be different
from non-insane automatism, which makes the act committed by the accused
involuntary: R. v. Parks, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 871, at p. 896. 

[24]                         
From this we may infer that the disturbance
addressed in the infanticide provisions need not reach the level required to
provide a defence under s. 16  of the Criminal Code , that is, to be the
result of a mental disorder (which is defined as a “disease of the mind” under
s. 2  of the Criminal Code ) that renders the accused incapable of
appreciating the nature and quality of the act or omission or of knowing that
it was wrong. We can also infer that the disturbance aspect of infanticide need
not render the accused’s acts or omissions involuntary as is required for
automatism. 

(3)          
Legislative History and Evolution

[25]                         
Section 233  of the Criminal Code 
originated in the English Infanticide Act, 1922 (U.K.), 12 &
13 Geo. 5, c. 18. In 1938, that legislation was replaced with the Infanticide
Act, 1938 (U.K.), 1 & 2 Geo. 6, c. 36, and, in 2010, was amended by the
Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (U.K.), c. 25, s. 57. 

[26]                         
The Infanticide Act, 1922 introduced the
requirement that “at the time of the act or omission [the mother] had not fully
recovered from the effect of giving birth to such child, and by reason thereof
the balance of her mind was then disturbed”: s. 1(1). The Infanticide
Act, 1938 introduced amendments that remain in force today, in particular
that the “balance of [the mother’s] mind” could be “disturbed by reason of her
not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or by
reason of the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child”: s.
1(1).

[27]                         
The adoption of the Infanticide Act, 1922
was intended to remedy the fact that judges and juries were reticent to convict
a mother who killed her newborn of murder since she necessarily faced the death
penalty: House of Lords, Hansard, series 5, vol. 50, May 25, 1922
(online) (the “Child Murder (Trial) Bill”), at pp. 758-59; see also D.
Seaborne Davies, “Child-Killing in English Law” (1937), 1 Mod. L. Rev. 203,
at pp. 211 and 217-19; and L.B., at paras. 67-68. The conditions in
which infanticide arose drew much public sympathy. It was thought to be a crime
mostly committed by “illegitimate mothers” trying to hide their shame, a motive
which the general opinion thought lessened the heinousness of the crime.
Further, it was acknowledged that women who committed infanticide often faced
difficult economic circumstances, which led to the commission of the crime:
Davies, at pp. 221-22.     

[28]                         
The drafters of the Infanticide Act, 1922 deliberately
adopted broad language. In the House of Lords, the Lord Chancellor noted that
the words expressing the requirement that the balance of the mother’s mind be
disturbed were “not terms of art”. Rather, the use of these “new words” was
intended to distinguish it from the language “appropriated by prescriptive
usage to insanity proper and to mental derangement produced by drunkenness” and
that it was better to provide a formula “which might be the subject of
reasonable judicial decision” and which would give effect to the intention
behind the proposed legislation: Child Murder (Trial) Bill, at pp.
761-62. 

[29]                         
However, the language used did introduce some
limitations. Lord Carson recommended that the legislation should not provide
relief to just any woman who has gone through childbirth. Rather, it should
apply in situations where there was evidence that “the crime when committed was
the result of the balance of [the mother’s] mind having been disturbed”: Child
Murder (Trial) Bill, at p. 765. The Lord Chancellor agreed that one had to
establish “some exceptional derangement and disturbance”: p. 768.

[30]                         
In Canada, infanticide first appeared in the Criminal
Code  in 1948: Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, s. 262, as amended
by An Act to amend the Criminal Code, S.C. 1948, c. 39, s. 7. In the
English version of the law, Parliament adopted the same “balance of the mind”
language as in the Infanticide Act, 1922. Amendments were made to the
infanticide provisions in 1954: Criminal Code, S.C. 1953-54, c. 51.
Among other changes, Parliament replaced the “balance of the mind” language
with the requirement that the mother’s mind must be “then disturbed” and added
lactation, in addition to giving birth, as a potential cause of that
disturbance: s. 204. While the “balance of the mind” language was retained in
other provisions pertaining to infanticide, namely ss. 663 (b) and 672.11 (c) of
the Criminal Code , there is no meaningful difference between this
language and the requirement that the mother’s “mind is then disturbed” under
s. 233  of the Criminal Code . In the French versions of the successive
statutory provisions at issue, the following language was used: “son esprit était
alors déséquilibré” (in the 1927 version of the infanticide provision and
in s. 663 (b)); “son esprit est alors déséquilibré” (in the 1954 version
of the infanticide provision); and “mentalement déséquilibrée” (in s.
672.11 (c)). There is no meaningful difference, either, in the language used in
French to describe the mother’s required state of mind.  

[31]                         
The same concerns that led to the Infanticide
Act, 1922 in the U.K. were also motivating factors in Canada. Namely,
sympathetic juries repeatedly refused to convict mothers who killed their
newborn children. The infanticide provision was intended to make it easier to
get a conviction for the offence of homicide short of murder or manslaughter: House
of Commons Debates, vol. V, 4th Sess., 20th Parl., June 14, 1948, at
pp. 5184-87. 

[32]                         
It was also expressed in debates that, as the
U.K. statute, the provision was intended to apply to cases “where there is not
the degree of mental derangement amounting to insanity” and that “[i]t does not
go as far as the rule in Macnaughton’s case [which sets out a legal test for
insanity]”: House of Commons Debates, at p. 5185 (Hon. J. L. Ilsley, then
Minister of Justice). It was also noted that the provision would capture “a
slightly deranged, distressed mother” who would otherwise be guilty of murder:
p. 5187.

[33]                         
The debates in the U.K. and Canada surrounding
the enactment of the infanticide provisions demonstrate that the purpose of the
provision was to provide for a less serious offence than murder in cases of
infanticide and to provide a broad and flexible standard that would be applied
on a case-by-case basis.

(4)          
The Jurisprudence

[34]                         
Infanticide, and, in particular, the meaning of
having a “disturbed” mind at the time of committing the act or omission leading
to the child’s death, has received limited treatment in English and Canadian
jurisprudence. The Canadian jurisprudence establishes that there is a “very
low” or “fairly low” threshold for a finding of mental disturbance and that it
does not require evidence that the accused has a mental disorder: Coombs,

that the standard should not be so minimal as to cheapen or disrespect the
memory of the innocent victim). In Leung, the jury was also told to give
the word “disturbed” under s. 233  its ordinary, common meaning: see A.F., at
para. 80 (fn. 119).

C.           
Conclusion on Meaning of “Mind Is Then
Disturbed”

[35]                         
From this review, I cannot accept the conclusion
of the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal that Parliament intended to
restrict the concept of a disturbed mind to those who have “a substantial
psychological problem”: para. 140. Rather, I conclude that the phrase “mind is
then disturbed” should be applied as follows:

(a)               
The word “disturbed” is not a legal or medical
term of art, but should be applied in its grammatical and ordinary sense.

(b)              
In the context of whether a mind is disturbed,
the term can mean “mentally agitated”, “mentally unstable” or “mental
discomposure”.

(c)               
The disturbance need not constitute a defined
mental or psychological condition or a mental illness. It need not constitute a
mental disorder under s. 16  of the Criminal Code  or amount to a
significant impairment of the accused’s reasoning faculties.

(d)              
The disturbance must be present at the time of
the act or omission causing the “newly-born” child’s death and the act or
omission must occur at a time when the accused is not fully recovered from the
effects of giving birth or of lactation.

(e)               
There is no requirement to prove that the act or
omission was caused by the disturbance. The disturbance is part of the actus
reus of infanticide, not the mens rea.

(f)               
The disturbance must be “by reason of” the fact
that the accused was not fully recovered from the effects of giving birth or
from the effect of lactation consequent on the birth of the child.

D.          
Application

(1)          
The Trial Judge’s Reasons

[36]                         
The trial judge reviewed the limited body of
jurisprudence on infanticide and the definition of a “disturbed” mind, which,
among other points, established that “disturbed” mind did not require an actual
diagnosis of a mental disorder and sets a very low threshold. 

[37]                         
The trial judge rejected Dr. Hashman’s evidence,
finding that the Crown expert erroneously referred to the “balance of the mind”
test, required proof of a mental disorder and failed to refer in his final
report to an important symptom described by the respondent which supported a
theory of depersonalization and dissociation despite having referred to it in
prior correspondence. 

[38]                         
Dr. Smith, on the other hand, referred in her
report to the respondent’s descriptions of how she felt at the time of the
deliveries and the similar information she gave to the police about her
emotional state. For example, she noted that the respondent said she felt
“detached and not thinking”, like she was “dreaming but not there” and
described the deliveries as an “out of body experience”: A.R., vol. VI, at p. 93.
This, Dr. Smith found, was “highly consistent with dissociation and
depersonalization”: pp. 93-94. At trial, Dr. Smith also referred to these
descriptions by the respondent and found them to be consistent with
“significant depersonalization”. 

[39]                         
The trial judge, relying on Dr. Smith’s opinion
and the case as a whole, concluded that the respondent’s mind was “disturbed”
as a result of not yet having fully recovered from the effects of giving
birth.  

(2)          
The Trial Judge’s Alleged Legal Errors

(a)          
Did the Trial Judge Fail to Apply Any Legal
Test?

[40]                         
The Crown argues that the trial judge failed to
apply any legal test in determining whether the respondent’s mind was
“disturbed” at the time of the deliveries. The Crown submits that the trial
judge erroneously found that “balance of the mind” was something different from
the “mind is disturbed” and failed to suggest what the test was or what level
of disturbance would be sufficient. 

[41]                         
I disagree that the trial judge failed to apply
a legal test or standard. As concluded by the majority of the Court of Appeal,
there was no error in the trial judge’s summary of the law of infanticide. The
trial judge applied the correct standard, which is set out by the statutory
language in s. 233  of the Criminal Code . Although the trial judge,
erroneously, thought there was significant difference between the “balance of
the mind” language found in related provisions and the wording of s. 233  that
the mother’s mind be “disturbed”, this error did not affect his analysis of the
evidence or his application of the appropriate legal standard to it. The trial
judge rejected Dr. Hashman’s evidence for several reasons, including that he
failed to refer to a symptom the trial judge thought was important in his final
report and seemed to require evidence of a mental disorder.

[42]                         
The Crown seeks to impose a higher threshold
than what is provided for by s. 233  of the Criminal Code  in arguing that
a mother has a “disturbed” mind only if her psychological health is
“substantially compromised” because she recently gave birth. As noted earlier,
this is not the legal standard intended by Parliament in s. 233  of the Criminal
Code . 

(b)          
Did the Trial Judge Infer the Respondent’s
Mental State Solely From Her Conduct?

[43]                         
The Crown submits that the trial judge used the
respondent’s conduct to determine the respondent’s mental state. In other
words, the Crown argues that the trial judge adopted circular reasoning in
finding that the respondent’s mind must have been disturbed because her actions
were “bizarre” and “absolutely contrary to the nurturing that humankind depends
on for its propagation”: A.F., at para. 99.

[44]                         
This argument must also be rejected. The trial
judge’s reasons make it clear that he did not find that the respondent’s
conduct met the requirements of the definition of infanticide simply because
she had killed two of her children. The trial judge relied not only on the
respondent’s personal history and the circumstances of the offences (which
includes the nature of the acts themselves), but also on Dr. Smith’s expert opinion.
In doing so, the trial judge had an evidentiary basis for concluding that the
Crown failed to prove that the respondent’s mind was not disturbed at the time
of the offences and did not rely on the circular reasoning alleged by the
Crown. 

(c)          
Did the Trial Judge Fail to Appreciate the
Evidence of Mental State?

[45]                         
Finally, the Crown submits that the trial judge
failed to consider the respondent’s “detailed account of each birth, her
goal-oriented behaviour, her personal circumstances beyond not having a criminal
record or psychopathic tendencies, and her pattern of rational behaviour and
wilful blindness” in considering whether the level of depersonalization met the
requirement of infanticide: A.F., at para. 103 (emphasis in original). In
short, the Crown argues that the respondent’s behaviour demonstrated rational
thought and an uncompromised mind. 

[46]                         
Even assuming that this point raises a question
of law, I cannot accept it. The trial judge took into consideration Dr. Smith’s
report, which relied on the respondent’s statements about her behaviour to Dr.
Smith and to the police, the respondent’s personal history, as well as the
circumstances of the offences. 

[47]                         
Dr. Smith was of the opinion that the “extreme
panic associated with the delivery triggered significant dissociative symptoms,
in particular depersonalization, which in turn impaired her ability to think
clearly, to accurately perceive and judge her situation, to make reasonable
decisions and to control her behaviour” and concluded that the respondent’s
mind was disturbed as a result of not having fully recovered from the effects
of giving birth: A.R., vol. VI, at p. 94. 

[48]                         
The trial judge also considered the case as a
whole, including the facts of the offences and that the respondent had no
criminal record or psychopathic or sociopathic tendencies. Based on his
assessment of the evidence, the trial judge was entitled to conclude or have a
reasonable doubt that the respondent’s mind was “disturbed” at the time of the
offences despite any indication of rational behaviour and wilful blindness.

                    The
judgment of the Court was delivered orally by

 

[1]               The Chief Justice — The only issue on
this appeal is what correctional facility Mr. Khadr should be placed in. This
is a question of statutory interpretation. Simply put, if Mr. Khadr’s
eight-year sentence is treated as a single global sentence for all the offences
to which he pleaded guilty, the sentence is under the minimum for an adult
sentence, with the result that s. 20 (a)(ii) of the International
Transfer of Offenders Act, S.C. 2004, c. 21  (“ITOA ”), applies and
his sentence is to be served in a provincial facility. 

 

[2]               On the
submissions before us, we are of the view that a proper interpretation of the
relevant legislation does not permit Mr. Khadr’s eight-year sentence to be
treated as five distinct eight-year sentences to be served concurrently.  For
the purposes of placement, whatever interpretation is taken of the provisions,
s. 20 (a) of the ITOA  applies in this case, with the result that
placement should be in a provincial correctional facility.

 

[3]               Accordingly,
we would dismiss the appeal with costs and confirm the order of the Alberta
Court of Appeal that Mr. Khadr’s sentence is a youth sentence to be served in a
provincial correctional facility for adults.

on appeal from the superior court of quebec

                    Criminal
law — Interim release — Grounds justifying detention — Justice of peace
ordering detention of accused awaiting trial on ground set out in s. 515(10)(c)
of Criminal Code, that is, that his detention “is necessary to maintain
confidence in the administration of justice” — Reviewing judge ordering release
of accused — Proper interpretation of s. 515(10)(c) of Criminal Code — Restrictive
interpretation rejected — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , s. 515(10) (c).

                    Criminal
law — Interim release — Review of decision of justice of peace — Decision by
justice of peace to order detention of accused reversed by reviewing judge — Cases
in which review provided for in ss. 520 and 521 of Criminal Code is available
in interim release context — Whether reviewing judge erred in exercising his
role by simply substituting his assessment of evidence for that of justice of
peace — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , ss. 520 , 521 .

                    S
was charged with one count of aggravated assault under s. 268  of the Criminal
Code  for having assaulted a bus driver together with two other individuals.
The Crown opposed the interim release of S. The justice of the peace who heard
the initial application for release found that detention was necessary on the
basis of s. 515(10) (b) and (c) Cr. C., that is, because
the interim detention of S was necessary for the protection or safety of the
public, and to maintain confidence in the administration of justice. The
justice who heard the second application for release on completion of the
preliminary inquiry found that the detention of S was still justified under s. 515(10) (c).
S then applied under s. 520  Cr. C. for a review by a Superior Court
judge, who determined that the detention of S was not necessary under s. 515(10) (c)
and ordered his release. 

                    Held:
The appeal should be allowed and the detention order restored.

                    The
ground set out in s. 515(10) (c) of the Criminal Code , that is,
that the detention of the accused “is necessary to maintain confidence in the
administration of justice”, is a distinct ground that itself provides a basis
for ordering the pre-trial detention of an accused. It is not a residual ground
for detention that applies only where the first two grounds for detention
provided for in s. 515(10) (a) and (b) are not satisfied. The
scope of s. 515(10) (c) has been unduly restricted by the courts in some
cases; this provision must not
be interpreted narrowly or applied sparingly. The
application of this ground for detention is not limited to exceptional circumstances,
to unexplainable crimes, to the most heinous of crimes or to certain classes of
crimes. The fact that detention may be justified only in rare cases is but a
consequence of the application of s. 515(10) (c), and not a precondition
to its application, a criterion a court must consider in its analysis or the
purpose of the provision. Section 515(10) (c) is worded clearly, and it
does not require exceptional or rare circumstances. Nor is the question whether
a crime is unexplainable or unexplained a criterion that should guide justices
in their analysis under s. 515(10) (c). This concept is ambiguous and
confusing. Because many crimes
may be explainable in one way or another, the unexplainable crime criterion is
of little assistance. The application of a criterion
based on the notion of an unexplainable crime could also lead to undesirable
conclusions, since crimes that are heinous and horrific might not satisfy it.
Such a criterion could give the public the impression that justices are
justifying certain crimes, that is, crimes that are explainable.

                    In determining whether the detention of an
accused is necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of justice, the justice must first consider the four circumstances that are
expressly referred to in s. 515(10) (c). First of all, the justice must
determine the apparent strength of the prosecution’s case. The prosecutor is
not required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the
offence, and the justice must be careful not to play the role of trial judge or
jury: matters such as the credibility of witnesses and the reliability of
scientific evidence must be analyzed at trial, not at the release hearing. The
justice must nevertheless consider the quality of the evidence tendered by the
prosecutor in order to determine the weight to be given to this circumstance in
his or her balancing exercise. The justice must also consider any defence
raised by the accused. If there appears to be some basis for the defence, the
justice must take this into account in analyzing the apparent strength of the
prosecution’s case.

                    Next,
the justice must determine the objective gravity of the offence in comparison
with the other offences in the Criminal Code . This is assessed on the
basis of the maximum sentence — and the minimum sentence, if any — provided for
in the Criminal Code  for the offence.

                    The
justice must then consider the circumstances surrounding the commission of the
offence, including whether a firearm was used. Those that might be relevant
under s. 515(10) (c) include the following: the fact that the offence is
a violent, heinous or hateful one, that it was committed in a context involving
domestic violence, a criminal gang or a terrorist organization, or that the
victim was a vulnerable person. If the offence was committed by several people,
the extent to which the accused participated in it may be relevant. The
aggravating or mitigating factors that are considered by courts for sentencing
purposes can also be taken into account.

                    Finally,
the fourth circumstance to consider is the fact that the accused is liable for
a potentially lengthy term of imprisonment. Although it is not desirable to
establish a strict rule regarding the number of years that constitutes a
lengthy term of imprisonment, some guidance is required. Because no crime is
exempt from the possible application of s. 515(10) (c), the words
“lengthy term of imprisonment” do not refer only to a life sentence. Moreover,
to determine whether the accused is actually liable for a potentially lengthy
term of imprisonment, the justice must consider all the circumstances of the
case known at the time of the hearing, as well as the principles for tailoring
the applicable sentence. This fourth circumstance is assessed subjectively.

                    The
circumstances listed in s. 515(10) (c) are not exhaustive. The court must
consider all the circumstances of each case, paying particular attention to the
four listed circumstances. No
single circumstance is determinative: the justice must consider the combined
effect of all the circumstances of each case to determine whether detention is
justified. This involves balancing all the relevant
circumstances. At the end of this balancing exercise, the ultimate question to
be asked by the court is whether detention is necessary to maintain confidence
in the administration of justice. Thus, the court must not order detention
automatically even where the four listed circumstances support such a result.
Some other circumstances that might be relevant are the personal circumstances
of the accused (age, criminal record, physical or mental condition, and
membership in a criminal organization), the status of the victim and the impact
on society of a crime committed against that person, and the fact that the
trial of the accused will be held at a much later date.

                    The justice’s balancing of all the
circumstances under s. 515(10) (c) must always be guided by the
perspective of the “public”, that is, of a reasonable
person who is properly informed about the philosophy of the legislative
provisions, the values of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ,
and the actual circumstances of the case. The person in question is a
thoughtful person, not one who is prone to emotional reactions, whose knowledge
of the circumstances of the case is inaccurate or who disagrees with our
society’s fundamental values. However, this person is not a legal expert, and,
although he or she is aware of the importance of the presumption of innocence
and the right to liberty in our society, expects that someone charged with a
crime will be tried within a reasonable period of time, and knows that a
criminal offence requires proof of culpable intent and that the purpose of
certain defences is to show the absence of such intent, the person is not able
to appreciate the subtleties of the various defences that are available to the
accused. This reasonable person’s confidence in the administration of justice
may be undermined not only if a court declines to order detention where
detention is justified having regard to the circumstances of the case, but also
if it orders detention where detention is not justified.

                    Sections
520  and 521  of the Criminal Code  do not confer an open-ended discretion
on the reviewing judge to vary the initial decision concerning the detention or
release of the accused. They establish not a de novo proceeding, but a
hybrid remedy. The judge must determine whether it is appropriate to exercise
his or her power of review. Exercising this power will be appropriate in only
three situations: (1) where there is admissible new evidence if that evidence
shows a material and relevant change in the circumstances of the case; (2) where
the impugned decision contains an error of law; or (3) where the decision is
clearly inappropriate. 

                    The four criteria from Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R.
759, are relevant to the determination of what constitutes new evidence for the
purposes of the review provided for in ss. 520  and 521 . Given the generally
expeditious nature of the interim release process and the risks of violating
the rights of the accused, and since the release hearing takes place at the
very start of criminal proceedings and not at the end like the sentence appeal,
a reviewing judge must be flexible in applying these four criteria. Regarding
the first criterion, due diligence, the reviewing judge may consider evidence
that is truly new or evidence that existed at the time of the initial release
hearing but was not tendered for some reason that is legitimate and reasonable.
Such new evidence is not limited to evidence that was unavailable to the accused
before the initial hearing. In
each case, the reviewing judge will have to determine whether the reason why
the accused did not tender such pre-existing evidence earlier was legitimate
and reasonable. As to the second criterion, it will
suffice that the evidence be relevant for the purposes of s. 515(10) . This
criterion will therefore rarely be decisive in the context of an application
for review under ss. 520  and 521 , since the range of relevant evidence will
generally be quite broad. The third criterion — that the evidence must be
credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief — must be
interpreted in light of the relaxation of the rules of evidence at the bail
stage and in particular of s. 518(1) (e) of the Criminal Code ,
which provides that “the justice may receive and base his decision on evidence
considered credible or trustworthy by him in the circumstances of each case”.
Finally, the fourth Palmer criterion should be modified as follows: the
new evidence must be such that it is reasonable to think, having regard to all
the relevant circumstances, that it could have affected the balancing exercise
engaged in by the justice under s. 515(10) (c). The new evidence must
therefore be significant. If the new evidence meets the four criteria for
admissibility, the reviewing judge is authorized to repeat the analysis under
s. 515(10) (c) as if he or she were the initial decision-maker.

                    It
will also be appropriate to intervene if the justice has erred in law or if the
impugned decision was clearly inappropriate, that is, if the justice who
rendered it gave excessive weight to one relevant factor or insufficient weight
to another. The reviewing judge therefore does not have the power to interfere
with the initial decision simply because he or she would have weighed the
relevant factors differently.

                    In
this case, the Superior Court judge intervened even though there was no basis
for a review, given that there was no change in circumstances and no error of
law, and that the initial decision was not clearly inappropriate. When all the
relevant circumstances are weighed as required by s. 515(10) (c), the
detention of S was necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of
justice.

I.         
Introduction

[1]                             
The repute of our
criminal justice system rests on the deeply held belief of Canadians that the
right to liberty and the presumption of innocence are fundamental values of our
society that require protection. However, that repute also depends on the
confidence citizens have that persons charged with serious crimes will not be
able to evade justice, harm others or interfere with the administration of
justice while awaiting trial. The risk that one of these events might tarnish
the repute of the justice system was recognized by Parliament in enacting s. 515(10) (a)
and (b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46  (“Cr.
C.”), under which the interim detention of an accused may be ordered where
that is necessary to ensure the attendance of the accused in court or to
guarantee the protection or safety of the public. 

[2]                             
Moreover, Parliament
judged that there are circumstances in which releasing an accused person could
undermine the repute of the justice system, and this led it to provide, in s. 515(10) (c)
Cr. C., for a third ground for interim detention, maintaining confidence
in the administration of justice. Thus, Parliament recognized that there are
circumstances in which allowing a person charged with a serious crime to be
released into the community pending trial in the face of overwhelming evidence
might suggest to the public that justice has not been done: see R. v. Hall,
2002 SCC 64, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 309, at para. 26. 

[3]                             
This appeal affords the
Court an opportunity to consider the circumstances in which pre-trial detention
of an accused is necessary in order to maintain the confidence of the Canadian
public in the administration of justice in accordance with s. 515(10) (c)
Cr. C. This provision has already been considered by the Court in Hall,
but the central issue in that case was the constitutionality of this ground for
detention as it was worded at that time. In cases decided by lower courts since
Hall, the provision has been given widely varying interpretations,
making it necessary for the Court to provide further guidance on its application.

[4]                             
The ground for
detention in s. 515(10) (c) Cr. C. requires that an effort be made
to strike an “appropriate balance between the rights of the accused and the
need to maintain justice in the community”: Hall, at para. 41. In addition, judges must
adopt the perspective of the public in determining whether detention is
necessary. What the word “public” means is not always easy to understand. These
difficulties no doubt explain why s. 515(10) (c) Cr. C. has
generated so much discussion among legal experts and led to inconsistent
results across the country. 

[5]                             
In my opinion, the scope of s. 515(10) (c)
Cr. C. has been unduly restricted by the courts in some cases. This
ground for detention is not necessarily limited to exceptional circumstances,
to the most heinous of crimes involving circumstances similar to those in Hall,
or to certain classes of crimes. The interpretation of s. 515(10) (c) Cr.
C. has also been truncated by a misunderstanding of the meaning of the word
“public” used in the provision’s French version (and implied in the word
“confidence” used in the English version), which I will discuss below. For now,
I will simply note that the “public” are reasonable, well-informed members of
the community, but not legal experts with in-depth knowledge of our criminal
justice system. 

[6]                             
This appeal is the
first time this Court has been called upon to determine the extent of the power
provided for in ss. 520  and 521  Cr. C. to review decisions with respect
to detention or to interim release. Since a decision whether to order the pre-trial
release of an accused involves a delicate balancing of all the relevant
circumstances, the power of a judge hearing an application under s. 520  or 521  Cr.
C. to review such a decision is not open-ended. I conclude that exercising
this power will be appropriate in only three situations: (1) where there is
admissible new evidence; (2) where the impugned decision contains an error of
law; or (3) where the decision is clearly inappropriate. In the last of these
situations, a reviewing judge cannot simply substitute his or her assessment of
the evidence for that of the justice who rendered the impugned decision. It is
only if the justice gave excessive weight to one relevant factor or
insufficient weight to another that the reviewing judge can intervene.

[7]                             
In the case at bar, the
respondent, Jeffrey St-Cloud, was charged with aggravated assault under s. 268  Cr.
C. The justice of the peace who heard the initial application for release
found that detention was necessary on the basis of s. 515(10) (b) and (c)
Cr. C. The justice who heard the respondent’s second application for
release on completion of the preliminary inquiry found that his detention was
still justified under s. 515(10) (c). The respondent then applied under
s. 520  Cr. C. for a review by a Superior Court judge, who determined
that detention was not necessary under s. 515(10) (c) and ordered the
respondent’s release. The Crown is appealing that decision to this Court. 

[8]                             
For the reasons that
follow, I would allow the appeal. The detention of the respondent is necessary
to maintain confidence in the administration of justice. I will explain why. 

II.      
Background and Judicial History

[9]                             
On the night of April 24,
2013, the respondent and two other individuals committed an extremely violent
assault against a bus driver working for the Société de transport de Montréal. The
incident was recorded by the video system on the bus, and the recording showed
that the respondent had been an active participant in the assault. The three individuals
struck the driver in the head many times, leaving him with serious long-term
injuries. Even the intervention of passengers was not enough to stop the attack
right away. The respondent was charged with aggravated assault under s. 268  Cr.
C. 

A.      
Court of Québec
(Judge Lavergne), No. 500-01-088824-138, April 29, 2013[1]  

[10]                         
The first release
hearing took place on April 26, 2013 before Judge Lavergne. The appellant
opposed the respondent’s release. At the time of the hearing, the victim was
still in the hospital and the medical prognosis was uncertain. However, it was
known that he had, at the very least, a hairline fracture to a facial bone and
a concussion.

[11]                         
Judge Lavergne stated
at the outset that the onus was on the prosecutor to show that the respondent’s
detention was necessary. After balancing the relevant factors, he found on the
basis of s. 515(10) (b) Cr. C. that the interim detention of the
respondent was necessary for the protection or safety of the public. 

[12]                         
Judge Lavergne
nevertheless continued his analysis and considered the circumstances set out in
s. 515(10) (c) Cr. C. The first three — (1) the apparent strength
of the prosecution’s case, (2) the gravity of the offence and (3) the
circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence — had already been
discussed in the context of the ground set out in s. 515(10) (b). He also
considered the fourth circumstance, namely the fact that the respondent was
liable, on conviction, for a potentially lengthy term of imprisonment (maximum
sentence of 14 years). As well, he was of the opinion that aggravating factors
were evident from the circumstances of the case. 

[13]                         
Judge Lavergne then
explained that s. 515(10) (c) [translation]
“calls for an analysis of whether, at the end of the day, after all the circumstances
are considered . . . there is a reasonable collective expectation
that interim release must be denied to maintain public confidence in the
administration of justice”: pp. 18-19. He made the following comments in this
regard: 

                    [translation] 
But who then is the public? The public means persons who are reasonable,
dispassionate and properly informed about the values expressed in legislation,
including the presumption of innocence, which applies throughout the criminal
process, as I have said, but who are also informed about all the circumstances
associated with the commission of a crime.

                    In
light of the videotape and all the circumstances, the defendant’s
participation, the likelihood of a conviction and the chances of a significant
term of imprisonment, the Court is satisfied that such a reasonable person
would conclude that interim release must be denied. [p. 19]

[14]                         
Finding that the Crown
had discharged its burden under s. 515(10) (c) Cr. C., Judge
Lavergne accordingly ordered the detention of the respondent until further
order. 

B.      
Court of Québec
(Judge Legault), No. 500-01-088824-138, June 21, 2013

[15]                         
On completion of his
preliminary inquiry, the respondent applied again to be released, this time on
the basis of s. 523(2) (b) Cr. C. Judge Legault began by
explaining that the onus was on the respondent to show some new cause for
ordering his release and that the court had a [translation]
“limited power that requires [it] to show restraint”: para. 2. 

[16]                         
Noting that the
evidence concerning the circumstances of the offence seemed to be the same that
had been presented at the time of the initial application, however, Judge
Legault expressed the opinion that there were also some new facts, including a
substantial increase in the financial security provided by the respondent’s
family and the possibility of his obtaining regular employment at a garage.

[17]                         
Judge Legault found on
the basis of the new facts that the risk of reoffending was [translation] “reduced”. He also
considered it “credible” that the respondent was seriously committed to working
or studying: paras. 20-21. However, he noted that the victim’s medical
condition had worsened. 

[18]                         
Judge Legault therefore
accepted Judge Lavergne’s conclusion that the detention of the respondent was
necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of justice, the ground
provided for in s. 515(10) (c) Cr. C. He agreed with Judge
Lavergne that there was [translation]
“a reasonable collective expectation that interim release must be denied to
maintain public confidence in the administration of justice”: para. 25. 

C.       Quebec Superior Court (Martin J.), 2013 QCCS 5021

[19]                         
On July 2, 2013, the
respondent applied to the Superior Court under s. 520  Cr. C. for a
review of the detention order. 

[20]                         
Martin J. began by
stating that he understood from Judge Legault’s decision that the latter had
concluded that the detention of the respondent was not necessary for the
protection or safety of the public within the meaning of s. 515(10) (b) Cr.
C. In Martin J.’s opinion, Judge Legault would therefore have granted the
respondent bail had it not been for the ground set out in s. 515(10) (c) Cr.
C., namely the need for detention in order to maintain confidence in the
administration of justice. 

[21]                         
Martin J. then noted that
it was up to the respondent to show a reviewable error by the justices who had
ordered his detention. Referring to Hall, he concluded that s. 515(10) (c)
Cr. C. must be [translation]
“used sparingly”: para. 22 (CanLII).

[22]                         
Martin J. stated the
test he had to apply as follows:

                        [translation]  . . . Could a
reasonable person who has no interest in the situation, but who is well versed
in the content of the Charter of Rights , the provisions of the Criminal Code 
and the principles laid down by the Supreme Court, conclude that confidence in
the administration of justice would be undermined if the person in question
were released? It is in fact the justice who must assess this on the basis of
the facts in evidence. [para. 23]

[23]                         
Martin J. concluded
that, in the instant case, the incident was [translation]
“repugnant . . . heinous and unjustifiable”, but not unexplainable:
para. 27. In his opinion, the two justices had therefore erred in denying
release on the basis of the ground set out in s. 515(10) (c) Cr. C. He
accordingly granted the respondent’s application and ordered his release.

III.    Issues

[24]                         
This appeal raises the
following questions: 

1.                 What
is the proper interpretation of s. 515(10) (c) Cr. C.?

2.                 What
are the cases in which the review provided for in ss. 520  and 521  Cr. C. is
available in the interim release context?

3.                 In
this case, did the Superior Court judge err in his interpretation of s. 515(10) (c)
Cr. C.?

4.                 In
this case, did the Superior Court judge err in exercising his role as a
reviewing judge under s. 520  Cr. C. by simply substituting his
assessment of the evidence for that of the justices?

IV.    Analysis

A.       Proper Interpretation of Section 515(10) (c) Cr. C.

(1)      Legislative and Judicial Context

[25]                         
Although the
legislative history of s. 515(10)  Cr. C. was explained clearly by this
Court in Hall, I believe that it will be helpful to summarize it here. 

[26]                         
I should begin by
mentioning that the pre-trial release provisions are of relatively ancient
origin:

                    In 1869, the Federal Government enacted
legislation making bail discretionary for all offences: see An Act
respecting the duties of Justices of the Peace, out of Sessions, in relation to
persons charged with Indictable Offences, S.C. 1869, c. 30. Bail was therefore
left to the discretion of the judge. Although the primary determinant for
denying bail was the need to compel the accused’s attendance, courts also
considered other factors such as the nature of the offence, the severity of the
penalty, the evidence against the accused, and the character of the accused:
see, for example, R. v. Gottfriedson (1906), 10 C.C.C. 239 (B.C. Co.
Ct.); Re N. (1945), 87 C.C.C. 377 (P.E.I.S.C.).

                        In
1972 the law of bail was recodified: Bail Reform Act, S.C. 1970-71-72,
c. 37. The Act iden­tified two branches for refusing bail: (1) where the
accused’s detention was necessary to ensure his attendance in Court; or (2) where
detention was “necessary in the public interest or for the protec­tion or
safety of the public” against the accused re-offending or interfering with the
administration of justice. The use of “or” in the second branch led to the view
that there were in effect three grounds for denying bail: (1) ensuring
appearance at trial; (2) protection against criminal offences pending trial;
and (3) the “public interest”. These grounds were originally enacted as s. 457(7) (a)
and (b) of the Criminal Code , and later became s. 515(10) (a)
and (b). 

(Hall,
at paras. 14-15)

[27]                         
Since the enactment of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  (“Charter ”) in 1982,
any person charged with an offence has the right “not to be denied reasonable
bail without just cause”: s. 11 (e).
This Court has stated that s. 11 (e) creates “a basic entitlement to be
granted reasonable bail unless there is just cause to do otherwise”: R. v.
Pearson, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 665, at p. 691. Section 11 (e) has two distinct
components: (1) the right to “reasonable bail” in terms of quantum of any
monetary component and any other conditions that might be imposed; and (2) the
right not to be denied bail without “just cause”. 

[28]                         
In R. v. Morales,
[1992] 3 S.C.R. 711, this Court struck down the component of s. 515(10) (b)
Cr. C. that authorized pre-trial detention on the ground that detaining
the accused was necessary in the “public interest”. The Court held that this
wording was vague and imprecise and that it authorized a “standardless sweep”
allowing a “court [to] order imprisonment whenever it [saw] fit”: p. 732.

[29]                         
In 1997, Parliament
therefore changed the wording of s. 515(10)  and also added para. (c) to
it: Criminal Law Improvement Act, 1996, S.C. 1997, c. 18, s. 59(2). The
detention of an accused could then be justified “on any other just cause
being shown and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, where the
detention is necessary in order to maintain confidence in the administration of
justice”. At the time, Parliament had not drawn up a list of circumstances the
justice was required to consider in this analysis. 

[30]                         
The validity of that
provision was the issue before the Court in Hall. The Court held that
the first part of s. 515(10) (c) Cr. C., which authorized the
denial of bail for “any other just cause”, was unconstitutional because it was
inconsistent with the presumption of innocence and with s. 11 (e) of the Charter .
The Court found that this wording conferred a broad discretion on justices to
grant or deny bail in that it did not specify any particular basis upon which
bail could be denied: Hall, at para. 22. However, the balance of s. 515(10) (c)
Cr. C. was found to be constitutional. 

[31]                         
In 2008, Parliament
amended s. 515(10) (c) Cr. C. so as to make it consistent with the
Court’s decision in Hall: Tackling Violent Crime Act, S.C. 2008,
c. 6, s. 37(5). That version of s. 515(10) (c) Cr. C., which is
still in force today, is the one at issue in this appeal: 

                    (c)    if the detention is necessary to maintain confidence in the
administration of justice, having regard to all the circumstances, including

                   (i)     the
apparent strength of the prosecution’s case,

                   (ii)    the
gravity of the offence,

                   (iii)   the
circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence, including whether a
firearm was used, and

                   (iv)   the fact that the accused is liable, on
conviction, for a potentially lengthy term of imprisonment or, in the case of
an offence that involves, or whose subject-matter is, a firearm, a minimum
punishment of imprisonment for a term of three years or more.

The remainder of s. 515(10) 
Cr. C. is reproduced, together with other relevant statutory provisions,
in the Appendix at the end of these reasons.

(2)      Principles From Hall 

[32]                         
The central issue in Hall
was the constitutionality of s. 515(10) (c) Cr. C. However, the
Court provided some guidance on how to interpret this provision.

(a)     
Basis for Section 515(10) (c) Cr. C.

[33]                         
McLachlin C.J., writing
for the majority of the Court, explained that in some circumstances it may be
necessary to deny an accused bail, even where there is no risk he or she will
not attend trial or may reoffend or interfere with the administration of
justice: Hall, at para. 25. According to the Chief Justice, “[w]here
justice is not seen to be done by the public, confidence in the bail system
and, more generally, the entire justice system may falter”: para. 26. Yet, she
wrote, “[p]ublic confidence is essential to the proper functioning of the bail
system and the justice system as a whole”: para. 27, citing Valente v. The
Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 673, at p. 689.

(b)     
Distinctiveness of the Ground Set Out in Section
515(10) (c) Cr. C.

[34]                         
McLachlin C.J. also
explained that s. 515(10) (c) Cr. C. creates not a ground for
detention that might be characterized as “residual” in the sense that it
applies only as a last resort, but one that is separate and distinct:

                        Bail
denial to maintain confidence in the administration of justice is not a mere
“catch-all” for cases where the first two grounds have failed. It represents a separate
and distinct basis for bail denial not covered by the other two categories.
The same facts may be relevant to all three heads. . . .
But that does not negate the distinctiveness of the three grounds. [Emphasis
added.]

(Hall,
at para. 30)

(c)     
Test Under Section 515(10)(c) Cr. C.

[35]                         
The Chief Justice did
not elaborate at length on the analysis to be conducted by a justice who must
determine whether s. 515(10)(c) Cr. C. applies. However, I
will reproduce the following remarks:

                        Section 515(10)(c) sets out
specific factors which delineate a narrow set of circumstances under which
bail can be denied on the basis of maintaining confidence in the administration
of justice. As discussed earlier, situations may arise where, despite the fact
the accused is not likely to abscond or commit further crimes while awaiting
trial, his presence in the community will call into question the public’s
confidence in the administration of justice. Whether such a situation has
arisen is judged by all the circumstances, but in particular the four factors
that Parliament has set out in s. 515(10)(c) — the apparent
strength of the prosecution’s case, the gravity of the nature of the offence,
the circumstances surrounding its commission and the potential for lengthy
imprisonment. . . .

                        This,
then, is Parliament’s purpose: to maintain public confidence in the bail
system and the justice system as a whole. . . . Most
importantly, the judge makes this appraisal objectively through the lens
of the four factors Parliament has specified. The judge cannot conjure up his
own reasons for denying bail; while the judge must look at all the
circumstances, he must focus particularly on the factors Parliament has
specified. At the end of the day, the judge can only deny bail if satisfied
that in view of these factors and related circumstances, a reasonable member of
the community would be satisfied that denial is necessary to maintain
confidence in the administration of justice. . . . [T]he
provision does not authorize a “standardless sweep” nor confer open-ended
judicial discretion. Rather, it strikes an appropriate balance between the
rights of the accused and the need to maintain justice in the community. In
sum, it is not overbroad. [Emphasis added.]

(Hall,
at paras. 40-41)

[36]                         
I will come back to Hall
below and consider certain passages I have not discussed here. 

(3)      Principles That Must Guide the Analysis

(a)     
Rejecting a Narrow Application of Section 515(10)(c)
Cr. C.

[37]                         
The appellant submits
that, despite the very clear principles enunciated in Hall, the courts
have artificially added factors to s. 515(10)(c) Cr. C. for the
avowed purpose of restricting its scope and limiting the cases in which its
application is justified. The appellant asserts that such an approach must be
rejected.

[38]                         
The respondent counters
that it follows from the principles established in Hall that the cases
in which s. 515(10)(c) applies will be few and far between. The
respondent submits that the four factors must be assigned a relative weight and
that the justice must not lose sight of the key question, namely whether
confidence in the administration of justice would be maintained if the accused
were released.

[39]                         
It is true that some
decisions reflect a strict application of s. 515(10)(c): see, e.g., R.
v. Thomson (2004), 21 C.R. (6th) 209 (Ont. S.C.J.); R. v. B. (A.)
(2006), 204 C.C.C. (3d) 490 (Ont. S.C.J.); R. v. Pichler, 2009 ABPC 24; R.
v. Teemotee, 2011 NUCJ 17. This approach has also been adopted by some
appellate courts. For example, the British Columbia Court of Appeal and the
Ontario Court of Appeal have stated that the use of s. 515(10)(c) is
justified only in rare or exceptional circumstances: R. v. Bhullar, 2005
BCCA 409, at paras. 62 and 65; R. v. Brotherston, 2009 BCCA 431, 71 C.R.
(6th) 81, at paras. 30 and 35; R. v. LaFramboise (2005), 203 C.C.C. (3d)
492 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 30. A variant of this prerequisite is that s. 515(10)(c)
must be used “sparingly”: LaFramboise, at para. 30; R.
v. D. (R.), 2010 ONCA 899, 273 C.C.C. (3d) 7, at paras. 51-53.
The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has also held that s. 515(10)(c)
requires that there be “something more”, something in addition to the four factors
set out in it: R. v. Blind (1999), 139 C.C.C. (3d) 87, at para. 16.
Although the latter case predated this Court’s decision in Hall, this statement
has been reiterated since Hall, including by the Ontario Court of
Appeal: LaFramboise, at para. 38. In a judgment subsequent to LaFramboise,
the Ontario Court of Appeal found instead that the words “something more” were
simply a way to convey the need to use s. 515(10)(c) sparingly: D. (R.), at para. 53.
However, it expressed the view that the third ground for detention is not
limited to the most heinous of offences and can be invoked even if the
community has not experienced the same horror and fear as was the case in Hall.

[40]                         
I see two reasons — one
based on legislation and the other on the case law — why Canadian appellate
courts may have adopted such interpretations.

[41]                         
First, the former
wording of s. 515(10) Cr. C. — the one in effect, inter alia, at
the time of Morales — specified two grounds for pre-trial detention, a primary
ground and a secondary ground. The primary ground, set out in s. 515(10)(a),
was that detention of the accused was necessary “to ensure his or her
attendance in court in order to be dealt with according to law”. The secondary
ground, under s. 515(10)(b), was that detention of the accused was
necessary “in the public interest or for the protection or safety of the
public, having regard to all the circumstances including any substantial
likelihood that the accused will, if he is released from custody, commit a
criminal offence or interfere with the administration of justice”. An accused
could be detained on the secondary ground only if detention was not justified
on the primary ground set out in s. 515(10)(a). It was the secondary ground for detention that was at issue in Morales
and, as I mentioned above, its “public interest” component was struck down by
this Court. However, since the change made to the wording in 1997, s. 515(10)
has no longer provided for a hierarchy of grounds for detention. 

[42]                         
Second, it seems to me
that the position taken by certain courts originates in a misinterpretation of Hall.
As Justice Trotter points out,
there are cases in which courts, although acknowledging the authority of the
Chief Justice’s reasons in Hall, have actually seemed to prefer the
minority’s reasons: The Law of Bail in Canada (3rd ed. (loose-leaf)), at
p. 3-45. The dissenting judges would have struck down s. 515(10)(c) Cr.
C. in its entirety, since they did not think it lent itself to a piecemeal
analysis: Hall, at para. 88. In their view, the factors listed in that
provision served as a “facade of precision”, and it was difficult to see how
they could promote the proper administration of justice in cases in which the
grounds set out in s. 515(10)(a) and (b) were not already
applicable: paras. 98-99. They were also of the opinion that the phrase
“maintain confidence in the administration of justice” essentially revived the
old “public interest” ground that the Court had struck down in Morales
and invoked “similarly vague notions of the public image of the criminal
justice system”: para. 104. Since Hall, some courts have therefore
found, using the minority’s reasons to bolster this view, that the majority’s
reasons advocated a restrictive interpretation of s. 515(10)(c):
Trotter, at p. 3-45. 

[43]                         
The crime at issue in Hall
was a particularly heinous one: the murder of a woman who had 37 slash wounds
on her body. Her assailant had
intended to cut her head off. The murder had caused significant public concern.
The accused had applied for bail, which the justice had denied on the basis of
s. 515(10)(c) Cr. C.

[44]                         
This Court described
the crime as “heinous and unexplained”: Hall, at para. 25. It also
quoted a comment from R. v. Rondeau (1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 474 (C.A.),
at p. 480, that [translation]
“[t]he more a crime like the present one is unexplained and unexplainable, the
more worrisome bail becomes for society”: Hall, at para. 25. I note that
the decision in Rondeau concerned what was at that time the secondary
ground for detention, that is, the need to detain the accused for the
protection or safety of the public. Section 515(10)(c) Cr. C. was
not yet in force when that case was decided.

[45]                         
The following passage
from Hall is also worth reproducing:

                    Where,
as here, the crime is horrific, inexplicable, and strongly linked to the
accused, a justice system that cannot detain the accused risks losing the
public confidence upon which the bail system and the justice system as a whole
repose. [para. 40]

[46]                         
I am of the opinion
that some courts have misinterpreted this Court’s decision in Hall.
First of all, the Court’s comments must be viewed in the context of that case
and analyzed in light of the case’s very specific circumstances: the crime was
an extremely horrific one. It was therefore natural for the Court to take this
into account when applying s. 515(10)(c) Cr. C. The Court’s
description of the crime as horrific, heinous and unexplained was simply an
observation, a description of the facts considered by the Court in its analysis
of s. 515(10)(c) Cr. C. It cannot be read as imposing conditions
or prerequisites. 

[47]                         
In my view, the
question whether a crime is “unexplainable” or “unexplained” is not a criterion
that should guide justices in their analysis under s. 515(10)(c). Apart
from the fact that the provision itself does not even refer to such a
criterion, I consider the concept ambiguous and confusing. What is meant by an
“unexplainable” crime? Is it a crime against a random victim? A crime that
could be committed only by a person who is not rational? An especially horrific
crime? 

[48]                         
Moreover, many crimes
may be “explainable” in one way or another; for example, it may be that the
assailant was provoked by the victim or that he or she had a mental illness or
was intoxicated. From this perspective, the “unexplainable” crime criterion is
of little assistance. 

[49]                         
The application of a
criterion based on the notion of an “unexplainable” crime could also lead to
undesirable conclusions. Crimes that are truly heinous and horrific might not
satisfy it. Such a criterion could therefore give the public the impression
that justices are “justifying” certain crimes, that is, crimes that are
“explainable”. Although this Court used the words “unexplained and
unexplainable” in Hall in referring to the murder at issue in that case,
its decision was based, first and foremost, on the brutal and heinous nature of
the crime, the strong evidence tying the accused to the crime and the fact that
people in the community were afraid: para. 25. In any event, the drift in the
case law since Hall and the reasons I have stated demonstrate the need
to limit recourse to such a criterion. As much as possible, it would also be
wise for justices hearing applications for release to avoid attaching such a
label to the circumstances of the alleged crimes that come before them so as
not to give the public the impression that they are “justifying” them.

[50]                         
Furthermore, I agree
with the appellant that detention may be justified only in rare cases, but that
this is simply a consequence of the application of s. 515(10)(c) and not
a precondition to its application, a criterion a court must consider in its
analysis or the purpose of the provision. 

[51]                         
This interpretation is
consistent with the following comment made by this Court in Hall:

                    While
the circumstances in which recourse to this ground for bail denial may
not arise frequently, when they do it is essential that a means of denying
bail be available. [Emphasis added; para. 31.]

[52]                         
I am of the view that a
“rareness” of circumstances criterion would be vague and unmanageable in
practice. How would such a criterion be assessed? Should justices consider how
many cases have been heard (in their jurisdictions, in Canada, in the last
year, etc.) and, at the same time, ensure that cases of detention based on s. 515(10)(c)
will remain “rare” if they order detention in the cases before them? Should a
justice review the cases in which detention has been ordered and determine
whether the facts of the case before him or her are the same (or nearly the
same) as the facts of those cases? In any event, it seems to me that a
“rareness” of circumstances criterion would prompt justices to engage in a
comparative exercise and thus to move away from the careful examination of the
circumstances of individual cases that the situation requires. In my opinion, a
comparative approach such as this could potentially undermine the public’s
confidence in the administration of justice. 

[53]                         
Moreover, the appellant
correctly points out that s. 515(10)(c) Cr. C. is worded clearly
and that it does not require exceptional or rare circumstances. This
interpretation is consistent with this Court’s recent decision in R. v.
Summers, 2014 SCC 26, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 575, which concerned the sentencing
provisions of s. 719(3)  and (3.1)  Cr. C. Section 719(3) provides that in
determining the sentence to be imposed on a person convicted of an offence, a
court may take into account any time spent in custody by the person as a result
of the offence and may credit a maximum of one day for each day spent in
custody. However, s. 719(3.1) specifies that, “if the circumstances justify
it”, the maximum can be increased to one and one-half days for each day spent
in custody. The Court interpreted this provision as follows:

                        . . . this provision is free of
any language limiting the scope of what may constitute “circumstances”. The
legislature could easily have provided that only “exceptional circumstances”
or “circumstances other than the loss of eligibility for early release and
parole” justify enhanced credit. 

                        As Cronk J.A. observed, language limiting
the scope of the word “circumstances” is used elsewhere in the Criminal Code .
For example, reference is made to “exceptional circumstances” or “compelling
circumstances” in s. 672.14(3)  (fitness assessments last no longer than 30 days,
except they may last for 60 if “compelling circumstances” so warrant), s. 672.47(2) 
(when an accused is found unfit to stand trial, a disposition must be made
within 45 days but, in “exceptional circumstances”, may be made within 90 days)
and s. 742.6(16)  (when an offender breaches a conditional sentence order, in
“exceptional cases” some of the suspended sentence may be deemed to be time
served). 

                        The
absence of qualifications on “circumstances” in s. 719(3.1) is telling
since Parliament did restrict enhanced credit, withholding it from
offenders who have been denied bail primarily as a result of a previous
conviction (s. 515(9.1)), those who contravened their bail conditions (ss. 524(4)(a)
and 524(8)(a)), and those who committed an indictable offence while on
bail (ss. 524(4)(b) and 524(8)(b)). Parliament clearly turned its
attention to the circumstances under which s. 719(3.1) should not apply,
but did not include any limitations on the scope of “circumstances” justifying
its application. [Underlining added.] 

(Summers,
at paras. 37-39)

[54]                         
In conclusion, the
application of s. 515(10)(c) is not limited to exceptional circumstances,
to “unexplainable” crimes or to certain types of crimes such as murder. The
Crown can rely on s. 515(10)(c) for any type of crime, but it must prove
— except in the cases provided for in s. 515(6)  — that the detention of the
accused is justified to maintain confidence in the administration of justice. 

(b)     
Circumstances Set Out in Section 515(10)(c) Cr.
C.

[55]                         
Section 515(10)(c)
expressly refers to four circumstances that must be considered by a justice in
determining whether the detention of an accused is necessary to maintain
confidence in the administration of justice. The justice must assess each of
these circumstances — or factors — and consider their combined effect. This is
a balancing exercise that will enable the justice to decide whether detention
is justified. 

[56]                         
It must be kept in mind
that, at this stage of criminal proceedings, the accused is still presumed
innocent regardless of the gravity of the offence, the strength of the
prosecution’s case or the possibility of a lengthy term of imprisonment. 

(i)          
Apparent Strength of the Prosecution’s Case

[57]                         
An interim release
hearing is a summary proceeding in which more flexible rules of evidence apply.
As a result, some of the evidence admitted at this hearing may later be
excluded at trial. As Justice Trotter
notes, it may be difficult to assess the strength of the prosecution’s case at
such a hearing: “The expeditious and sometimes informal nature of a bail
hearing may reflect an unrealistically strong case for the Crown” (p. 3-7).

[58]                         
Despite these
difficulties inherent in the release process, the justice must determine the
apparent strength of the prosecution’s case. On the one hand, the prosecutor is
not required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the
offence, and the justice must be careful not to play the role of trial judge or
jury: matters such as the credibility of witnesses and the reliability of
scientific evidence must be analyzed at trial, not at the release hearing.
However, the justice who presides at that hearing must consider the quality of
the evidence tendered by the prosecutor in order to determine the weight to be
given to this factor in his or her balancing exercise. For example, physical
evidence may be more reliable than a mere statement made by a witness, and
circumstantial evidence may be less reliable than direct evidence. The
existence of ample evidence may also reinforce the apparent strength of the
case. 

[59]                         
On the other hand, the
justice must also consider any defence raised by the accused. Rather than
raising a defence at the initial hearing, the latter will most likely not do so
before the release hearing held upon completion of the preliminary inquiry, and
may not even raise one before trial. If the accused does raise a defence,
however, this becomes one of the factors the justice must assess, and if there
appears to be some basis for the defence, the justice must take this into
account in analyzing the apparent strength of the prosecution’s case. As the
Quebec Court of Appeal noted in a relatively recent decision, [translation] “it would be unfair to
allow the prosecution to state its case if the justice is not in a position to
consider not only the weaknesses of that case, but also the defences it
suggests”: R. v. Coates, 2010 QCCA 919, at para. 19 (CanLII).

(ii)        
Gravity of the Offence

[60]                         
For the purposes of s. 515(10)(c),
what the justice must determine is the “objective” gravity of the offence in
comparison with the other offences in the Criminal Code . This is
assessed on the basis of the maximum sentence — and the minimum sentence, if
any — provided for in the Criminal Code  for the offence.

(iii)      
Circumstances Surrounding the Commission of the
Offence, Including Whether a Firearm Was Used

[61]                         
Without drawing up an
exhaustive list of possible circumstances surrounding the commission of the
offence that might be relevant under s. 515(10)(c), I will mention the
following: the fact that the offence is a violent, heinous or hateful one, that
it was committed in a context involving domestic violence, a criminal gang or a
terrorist organization, or that the victim was a vulnerable person (for
example, a child, an elderly person or a person with a disability). If the
offence was committed by several people, the extent to which the accused
participated in it may be relevant. The aggravating or mitigating factors that
are considered by courts for sentencing purposes can also be taken into
account. 

(iv)      
Fact That the Accused Is Liable for a
Potentially Lengthy Term of Imprisonment

[62]                         
The fourth circumstance
set out in s. 515(10)(c) is “the fact that the accused is liable, on
conviction, for a potentially lengthy term of imprisonment or, in the case of
an offence that involves, or whose subject-matter is, a firearm, a minimum
punishment of imprisonment for a term of three years or more”.

[63]                         
Although it is not
desirable, for the purposes of s. 515(10)(c) Cr. C., to establish
a strict rule regarding the number of years that constitutes a “lengthy term of
imprisonment”, some guidance is nonetheless required for the exercise to be
undertaken by justices in this regard. 

[64]                         
First of all, since I
have found that no crime is exempt from the possible application of s. 515(10)(c)
Cr. C., it is self-evident that the words “lengthy term of imprisonment”
do not refer only to a life sentence. 

[65]                         
Moreover, to determine,
on a case-by-case basis, whether the accused is actually liable for a
potentially “lengthy term of imprisonment”, the justice must consider all the
circumstances of the case known at the time of the hearing, as well as the
principles for tailoring the applicable sentence. But this does not mean that
the justice would be justified in embarking on a complex exercise to calculate
the sentence the accused might receive: it must be borne in mind that interim
release occurs at the beginning of the criminal process and that the justice
must avoid acting as a substitute for the trial judge. That being said, there
will be cases in which a claim of mitigating or aggravating circumstances
appears to have sufficient merit for it to be open to the justice to consider
it in determining whether the accused is liable for a potentially “lengthy term
of imprisonment”. As far as possible, therefore, this fourth circumstance is
assessed subjectively, unlike the second circumstance — the gravity of
the offence — which is assessed objectively.

(c)     
The Listed Circumstances Are Not Exhaustive

[66]                         
The appellant, relying on R. v. Mordue
(2006), 223 C.C.C. (3d) 407 (Ont. C.A.), submits that a detention order must be
made when the four circumstances set out in s. 515(10)(c) weigh in
favour of that result, unless there are other “circumstances” that might
justify a release order. 

[67]                         
In my opinion, the
appellant is mistaken. 

[68]                         
Section 515(10)(c)
could not be worded more clearly: it refers to “all the circumstances, including
. . .”.  In my opinion, Parliament would have worded this provision
differently (although I will not comment on the validity of such a wording) if
it had intended a detention order to be automatic where the four listed
circumstances weigh in favour of such an order. In fact, Parliament intended
the opposite. As the Chief Justice stated in Hall, a justice dealing
with an application for detention based on s. 515(10)(c) must consider
all the relevant circumstances, but must focus particularly on the factors
Parliament has specified: para. 41. The automatic detention argument also
seems to be inconsistent with the following statement by the Chief Justice, at
para. 41: 

                    At
the end of the day, the judge can only deny bail if satisfied that in
view of these factors and related circumstances, a reasonable member of the
community would be satisfied that denial is necessary to maintain confidence in
the administration of justice. [Emphasis added.]

[69]                         
Moreover, the automatic
detention argument disregards the fact that the test to be met under s. 515(10)(c)
is whether the detention of the accused is necessary to maintain confidence in
the administration of justice. The four listed circumstances are simply the
main factors to be balanced by the justice, together with any other relevant
factors, in determining whether, in the case before him or her, detention is
necessary in order to achieve the purpose of maintaining confidence in the
administration of justice in the country. This is the provision’s purpose.
Although the justice must consider all the circumstances of the case and engage
in a balancing exercise, this is the ultimate question the justice must answer,
and it must therefore guide him or her in making a determination. The argument
that detention must automatically be ordered if the review of the four
circumstances favours that result is incompatible with the balancing exercise
required by s. 515(10)(c) and with the purpose of that exercise.

[70]                         
Finally, it is
important not to overlook the fact that, in Canadian law, the release of
accused persons is the cardinal rule and detention, the exception: Morales, at p. 728. To automatically
order detention would be contrary to the “basic entitlement to be
granted reasonable bail unless there is just cause to do otherwise” that is
guaranteed in s. 11 (e) of the Charter : Pearson, at p. 691.
This entitlement rests in turn on the cornerstone of Canadian criminal law,
namely the presumption of innocence that is guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of
the Charter : Hall, at para. 13. These fundamental rights require
the justice to ensure that interim detention is truly justified having regard
to all the relevant circumstances of the case.

[71]                         
Although I will not set
out an exhaustive list of the circumstances relevant to the analysis required
by s. 515(10)(c) Cr. C., I think it will be helpful to give a few
examples. Section 515(10)(c)(iii) refers to the “circumstances
surrounding the commission of the offence”. I would add that the personal
circumstances of the accused (age, criminal record, physical or mental
condition, membership in a criminal organization, etc.) may also be relevant.
The justice might also consider the status of the victim and the impact on
society of a crime committed against that person. In some cases, he or she
might also take account of the fact that the trial of the accused will be held
at a much later date. 

(d)    
Meaning of “Public”

[72]                         
I should point out that
although the French version of s. 515(10)(c) refers to “la confiance
du public” (public confidence) — “sa détention est nécessaire pour ne
pas miner la confiance du public envers l’administration de la justice, compte
tenu de toutes les circonstances, notamment les suivantes . . .”
— the word “public” does not actually appear in the provision’s English
version. However, this Court has confirmed that detention under this provision
is based on the need to maintain public confidence in the administration
of justice: Hall, at para. 41. This means that the justice’s balancing
of all the circumstances under s. 515(10)(c) must always be guided by
the perspective of the “public”. 

[73]                         
In Mordue, the
Ontario Court of Appeal provided an interesting analysis of the relationship
between “public confidence” for the purposes of s. 515(10)(c) and the
“safety of the public” factor set out in s. 515(10)(b):

                        Public fear and concern about safety,
while relevant, are not the exclusive considerations in assessing the public’s
confidence in the administration of justice. The effect of the accused’s
release on confidence in the administration of justice must be considered more
broadly. 

                        Limiting the analysis of confidence in
the administration of justice to the public’s safety concerns results in the
tertiary ground amounting to little more than a recapitulation of the secondary
ground. . . .

                        Here,
the bail judge placed decisive weight on the quality of the respondent’s bail
arrangements. By doing so, he erred by not considering whether the tertiary
ground established a separate and distinct basis for denying bail. Having quite
appropriately considered the level of public concern about safety in this case,
the bail judge erred by not going on to consider the effect the release of the
respondent would have more broadly on the public confidence in the
administration of justice. [Emphasis added; paras. 23-25.]

[74]                         
In Hall, this
Court explained that the “public” in question consists of reasonable members of
the community who are properly informed about “the philosophy of the
legislative provisions, Charter  values and the actual circumstances of
the case”: para. 41, quoting R. v. Nguyen (1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 269
(B.C.C.A.), at para. 18. 

[75]                         
In a pre-Hall
decision concerning the “public interest” ground formerly provided for in s. 515(10)(b)
Cr. C., the Quebec Court of Appeal stated the following: 

                        [translation] 
With respect to the perception of the public, as we know, a large part of
the Canadian public often adopts a negative and even emotional attitude
towards criminals or [potential] criminals. The public wants to see itself
protected, see criminals in prison and see them punished severely. To get rid
of a criminal is to get rid of crime. It [unjustifiably] perceives the
judicial system . . . and the administration of justice in general as
too indulgent, too soft, too good to the criminal. This perception,
almost visceral in respect of crime, is surely not the perception which a judge
must have in deciding the issue of interim release. If this were the case,
persons charged with certain types of offences would never be released because
the perception of the public is negative with respect to the type of crime
committed, while others, on the contrary, would almost automatically be
released where the public’s perception is neutral or more indulgent. . . .
Therefore, the perception of the public must be situated at another level,
that of a public reasonably informed about our system of criminal law and
capable of judging and perceiving without emotion that the application of the
presumption of innocence, even with respect to interim release, has the effect
that people, who may later be found guilty of even serious crimes, will be
released for the period between the time of their arrest and the time of their
trial. In other words, the criterion of the public perception must not be that
of the lowest common denominator. [Emphasis added.]

(R. v.
Lamothe (1990), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 530, at p. 541)

[76]                         
In my opinion, these
comments are still relevant.

[77]                         
Although the “public interest”
ground was subsequently held to be unconstitutional, these passages remain
helpful in underscoring the fact that the word “public” used in the context of
the new s. 515(10)(c) does not mean Canadians who tend to react
impulsively. This being said, although it is true that the public in question
consists of reasonable, well-informed persons, and not overly emotional members
of the community, it seems to me that some of the decisions have rendered the
word “public” meaningless in this context. Parliament made an express choice by
using the word “public” in the French version of s. 515(10)(c) in
requiring that the courts take confidence in the administration of justice into
account in deciding whether an accused should be detained pending trial. It referred
not to legal experts or judges, but to the “public”. Meaning must therefore be
given to this legislative choice. Public confidence cannot be equated with the
confidence of legal experts in the administration of justice. The Canadian
public — even its most knowledgeable members — cannot be expected to have the
same level of legal knowledge as judges or lawyers. That would distort the
meaning of the word “public”. It would also disregard the purpose of this
provision, which is to maintain public confidence in the administration of
justice. 

[78]                         
I note that this
position is similar to the one taken by this Court concerning s. 24(2)  of the Charter ,
which provides for the exclusion of evidence obtained in violation of the Charter 
if “the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration
of justice into disrepute”. In R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R.
265, Lamer J., writing for the majority, put the relevant question in
figurative terms: “Would the admission of the evidence bring the administration
of justice into disrepute in the eyes of the reasonable man, dispassionate and
fully apprised of the circumstances of the case?” (p. 282, quoting Y.-M. Morissette,
“The Exclusion of Evidence under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms :
What To Do and What Not To Do” (1984), 29 McGill L.J. 521, at p. 538).
Lamer J. stated that “[t]he reasonable person is usually the average person in
the community, but only when that community’s current mood is reasonable”: Collins,
at p. 282. He explained that the reasonable person test “serves as a
reminder to each individual judge that his discretion is grounded in community
values, and, in particular, long term community values. He should not render a
decision that would be unacceptable to the community when that community is not
being wrought with passion or otherwise under passing stress due to current
events”: ibid., at pp. 282-83; see also R. v. Burlingham, [1995]
2 S.C.R. 206, at para. 142. 

[79]                         
Thus, a reasonable
member of the public is familiar with the basics of the rule of law in our
country and with the fundamental values of our criminal law, including those
that are protected by the Charter . Such a person is undoubtedly
aware of the importance of the presumption of innocence and the right to
liberty in our society and knows that these are fundamental rights guaranteed
by our Constitution. He or she also expects that someone charged with a crime
will be tried within a reasonable period of time, and is aware of the adage
that “justice delayed is justice denied”: R. v. Trout, 2006 MBCA 96, 205
Man. R. (2d) 277, at para. 15. Finally, a reasonable member of the public knows
that a criminal offence requires proof of culpable intent (mens rea) and
that the purpose of certain defences is to show the absence of such intent. A
well-known example of this type of defence is the mental disorder defence. The
person contemplated by s. 515(10) (c) Cr. C. therefore understands
that such a defence, once established, will enable an accused to avoid criminal
responsibility. However, it would be going too far to expect the person in
question to master all the subtleties of complex defences, especially where
there is overwhelming evidence of the crime, the circumstances of the crime are
heinous and the accused admits committing it.

[80]                         
In short, the person in
question in s. 515(10)(c) Cr. C. is a thoughtful person, not one
who is prone to emotional reactions, whose knowledge of the circumstances of a
case is inaccurate or who disagrees with our society’s fundamental values. But
he or she is not a legal expert familiar with all the basic principles of the
criminal justice system, the elements of criminal offences or the subtleties of
criminal intent and of the defences that are available to accused persons. 

[81]                         
It is of course not
easy for judges to strike an appropriate balance between the unrealistic
expectations they might have for the public on the one hand, and the need to
refuse to yield to public reactions driven solely by emotion on the other. This
exercise may be particularly difficult in this era characterized by the
multiplication and diversification of information sources, access to 24-hour
news reports and the advent of social media. 

[82]                         
Canadians may in fact
think they are very well informed, but that is unfortunately not always the
case. Moreover, people can also make their reactions known much more quickly,
more effectively and on a wider scale than in the past, in particular through
the social media mentioned above, which are conducive to chain reactions. The
courts must therefore be careful not to yield to purely emotional public
reactions or reactions that may be based on inadequate knowledge of the real
circumstances of a case. 

[83]                         
However, the courts
must also be sensitive to the perceptions of people who are reasonable and well
informed. This enables the courts to act both as watchdogs against mob justice
and as guardians of public confidence in our justice system. It would therefore
be dangerous, inappropriate and wrong for judges to base their decisions on
media reports that are in no way representative of a well-informed public.
Indeed, the Quebec Court of Appeal recognized this risk in its recent decision
in R. v. Turcotte, 2014 QCCA 2190:

                        [translation]  The press clippings show
how risky it is to rely on this mode of proof. They contain several different
opinions that vary in the degree to which they are balanced, objective,
moderate or superficial. Many of them contain inaccurate facts or do not
mention the essential facts. Most of them say nothing about the legal
principles that must be applied in making release decisions. Certain opinions
stir up anger and distort the debate. Few accurately report the facts and
correctly state the applicable principles. On the whole, it must be
acknowledged that they do not satisfy the reasonable person test defined in the
case law. [para. 68 (CanLII)]

[84]                         
Having said this, I
wish to point out that this does not mean the courts must automatically
disregard evidence that comes from the news media. It must be recognized that
the media are part of life in society and that they reflect the opinions of
certain segments of the Canadian public. In Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 459, at p.
475, this Court noted: “The media have a vitally important role to play in a
democratic society. It is the media that, by gathering and disseminating news,
enable members of our society to make an informed assessment of the issues
which may significantly affect their lives and well-being.” Such opinion
evidence can therefore be considered by the courts when it is admissible and
relevant. This will be the case where it corresponds to the opinion of the
reasonable person I described above. 

[85]                         
I should mention,
however, that since Turcotte has not been brought before this Court, it
would be inappropriate for me to speak to the correctness of the Court of
Appeal’s conclusion with respect to release in that case. I will simply observe
that the soundness of that conclusion must be assessed in light of the
principles I have already outlined.

[86]                         
In short, there is not
just one way to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.
It may be undermined not only if a justice declines to order the interim
detention of an accused in circumstances that justify detention, but also if a
justice orders detention where such a result is not justified. 

(4)      Conclusion on the Application of Section 515(10)(c) Cr. C.

[87]                         
I would summarize the
essential principles that must guide justices in applying s. 515(10)(c) Cr.
C. as follows:

•                                   
Section 515(10)(c)
Cr. C. does not create a residual ground for detention that applies only
where the first two grounds for detention ((a) and (b)) are not
satisfied. It is a distinct ground that itself provides a basis for ordering
the pre-trial detention of an accused.

•                                   
Section 515(10)(c)
Cr. C. must not be interpreted narrowly (or applied sparingly) and
should not be applied only in rare cases or exceptional circumstances or only
to certain types of crimes. 

•                                   
The four circumstances listed
in s. 515(10)(c) Cr. C. are not exhaustive. 

•                                   
A court must not order
detention automatically even where the four listed circumstances support such a
result. 

•                                   
The court must instead
consider all the circumstances of each case, paying particular attention to the
four listed circumstances.

•                                   
The question whether a
crime is “unexplainable” or “unexplained” is not a criterion that should guide
the analysis.

•                                   
No single circumstance
is determinative. The justice must consider the combined effect of all the
circumstances of each case to determine whether detention is justified. 

•                                   
This involves balancing
all the relevant circumstances. At the end of this balancing exercise, the
ultimate question to be asked by the court is whether detention is necessary to
maintain confidence in the administration of justice. This is the test to be
met under s. 515(10)(c). 

•                                   
To answer this
question, the court must adopt the perspective of the “public”, that is, the
perspective of a reasonable person who is properly informed about the
philosophy of the legislative provisions, Charter  values and the actual
circumstances of the case. However, this person is not a legal expert and is
not able to appreciate the subtleties of the various defences that are
available to the accused.

•                                   
This reasonable person’s
confidence in the administration of justice may be undermined not only if a
court declines to order detention where detention is justified having regard to
the circumstances of the case, but also if it orders detention where detention
is not justified.

[88]                         
In conclusion, if the
crime is serious or very violent, if there is overwhelming evidence against the
accused and if the victim or victims were vulnerable, pre-trial detention will
usually be ordered.

[89]                         
Having completed the
interpretation of s. 515(10)(c) Cr. C., I will now consider the
power of review of superior court judges, which enables them to vary release or
detention orders made under s. 515(10)(a), (b) or (c) Cr.
C.

B.       Availability of a Review Under Sections 520 and 521 Cr. C.

[90]                         
Section 520 Cr. C.
gives an accused the right to apply to a judge for a review of an
interim detention order made against him or her by a justice. Similarly, s. 521
Cr. C. enables the prosecutor to apply to a judge for a review of
a release order made in relation to an accused. Sections 520 and 521 are worded
similarly. In both cases, the application may be made “at any time before the
trial”: ss. 520(1) and 521(1) Cr. C. It should be noted that these
sections are limited to the review of orders made in connection with offences
other than the ones referred to in s. 469  Cr. C.

[91]                         
This is the first time
this Court has considered the scope of ss. 520 and 521 Cr. C. Not all
lower courts in Canada are agreed on the nature of this review process. Some
consider it an appeal, which means that only an error of law or principle will
provide a basis for a “review”. Others take the view that they have full
discretion to vary the initial order even in the absence of an error. This
approach is sometimes described as a “de novo” hearing, although, as
Justice Trotter points out, a true de novo hearing is conducted as if
there were no previous proceedings: p. 8-13. Finally, other courts treat the
review under ss. 520 and 521 Cr. C. as a hybrid remedy. In their view,
the section authorizes the accused and the prosecutor to present new evidence
to show a change in circumstances, and to raise an error of law or principle by
the justice to justify a review of the initial order. 

[92]                         
For the reasons that
follow, I am of the opinion that ss. 520 and 521 Cr. C. do not confer an
open-ended discretion on the reviewing judge to vary the initial decision
concerning the detention or release of the accused. Nonetheless, they establish
a hybrid remedy and therefore provide greater scope than an appeal for varying
the initial order.

(1)      Wording of Sections 520 and 521 Cr. C.

[93]                         
The provisions — ss. 520(1)
and (7) and 521(1) and (8) — that establish the power of review read as
follows: 

                         520. (1) If a justice, or a judge of
the Nunavut Court of Justice, makes an order under subsection 515(2) , (5) , (6) ,
(7) , (8)  or (12)  or makes or vacates any order under paragraph 523(2) (b),
the accused may, at any time before the trial of the charge, apply to a judge
for a review of the order.

. . .

(7) . . .

and [the judge] shall either

(d) dismiss the application, or

(e) if the accused shows cause,
allow the application, vacate the order previously made by the justice and make
any other order provided for in section 515 that he considers is warranted.

. . .

521. (1) If a justice, or a judge of the Nunavut Court of Justice, makes an
order under subsection 515(1) , (2) , (7) , (8)  or (12)  or makes or vacates any
order under paragraph 523(2) (b), the prosecutor may, at any time before
the trial of the charge, apply to a judge for a review of the order.

. . .

                        (8) . . .


                    and
[the justice] shall either

                           (d)
dismiss the application, or

                           (e)
if the prosecutor shows cause, allow the application, vacate the order
previously made by the justice and make any other order provided for in section
515 that he considers to be warranted.

. . .

[94]                         
It should be mentioned that
ss. 520 and 521 do not provide for a de novo hearing, whereas Parliament
expressly provided for such a hearing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act,
S.C. 2002, c. 1 , s. 33(1) , where an application for release is made to a youth
justice court and that court has not ruled on the initial application. If
Parliament had intended for reviewing judges to conduct a true de novo
hearing, it would have specified this in the legislation. As well, ss. 520(7) 
and 521(8)  provide that the review is conducted on the basis of the transcript
and exhibits from the initial proceedings, although some new evidence is
admissible. I will return to this point below. For the moment, it is enough to
say that these factors confirm my conclusion that ss. 520  and 521  Cr. C.
do not establish a de novo proceeding.

[95]                         
Moreover, even though
the power of review may seem broad at first glance, ss. 520 and 521 Cr. C.
expressly limit its exercise in favour of the accused or the prosecutor, as the
case may be, to cases in which cause is shown. It should be borne in mind that,
in the old Young Offenders Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. Y-1 , Parliament used the
word “discretion” in referring to the reviewing court’s power over the transfer
of young accused persons to ordinary court: s. 16(9)  and (10) . This Court found
that the use of that word conferred a broad power of review on the reviewing
court and authorized that court to make an independent evaluation and to arrive
at an independent conclusion on the same facts: R. v. M. (S.H.), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 446. But Parliament did not
choose to use the same wording in ss. 520  and 521  Cr. C.

[96]                         
The wording of ss. 520
and 521 Cr. C. therefore seems to preclude an interpretation to the
effect that the reviewing judge has an open-ended discretion. It remains to be seen
whether this conclusion can be confirmed through a comparison with other
similar provisions, having regard to the nature of the initial release
decision.

(2)      Difference Between the Wording of Sections 520 and 521 Cr. C.
and That of Other Review Provisions

[97]                         
The appellant argues
that the difference between the wording of ss. 520(7)(e) and 521(8)(e)
Cr. C., which provide that a reviewing judge may vary the initial
decision “if the accused [or the prosecutor, as the case may be,] shows cause”,
and that of s. 680(1) Cr. C. and s. 18(2) of the Extradition Act,
S.C. 1999, c. 18 , which contain no such words, favours a standard of review
requiring greater deference to the initial release decision. 

[98]                         
Section 680  Cr. C.
deals, inter alia, with the review of release decisions in the context
of the offences listed in s. 469 Cr. C. Section 680(1) Cr. C.
reads as follows:

                          680. (1) A decision made by a judge
under section 522 or subsection 524(4) or (5) or a decision made by a judge of
the court of appeal under section 261 or 679 may, on the direction of the chief
justice or acting chief justice of the court of appeal, be reviewed by that
court and that court may, if it does not confirm the decision,

                          (a)  vary the decision; or

                          (b)  substitute such other decision as, in its opinion, should have
been made.

[99]                         
The appellant concedes
that the case law on the nature and availability of a review under s. 680  Cr.
C. is not consistent. This has even been recognized by certain provincial
courts of appeal: R. v. Oliver, 2008 NLCA 27, 287 Nfld. & P.E.I.R.
123; R. v. Massan, 2012 MBCA 26, 289 C.C.C. (3d) 285; R. v. White,
2005 ABCA 403, 202 C.C.C. (3d) 295; see also Trotter, at p. 8-23; T. Quigley, Procedure
in Canadian Criminal Law (2nd ed. (loose-leaf)), at p. 11-17. 

[100]                     
Section 18(2)  of the Extradition
Act  concerns the review of an order made with regard to a person arrested
under that statute. It reads as follows:

                          (2) A decision respecting judicial interim
release may be reviewed by a judge of the court of appeal and that judge may

                          (a)  confirm the decision;

                          (b)  vary
the decision; or 

                          (c)  substitute any other decision
that, in the judge’s opinion, should have been made.

[101]                     
It can be seen
immediately that the various decisions open to the reviewing judge are set out
in a similar way to those provided for in s. 520 Cr. C. However,
like s. 680(1) Cr. C., s. 18(2)  of the Extradition Act  does not
limit the variation of the initial decision to cases in which “cause” is shown.


[102]                     
The case law of
Canadian appellate courts is nearly unanimous. Section 18(2)  of the Extradition
Act  provides that a reviewing judge may vary the initial decision only on
the basis of an error in principle: United States of America v. Chan
(2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 93 (Ont. C.A.);
United States of
America v. Pannell (2005),
193 C.C.C. (3d) 414 (Ont. C.A.); United States of America v. Yuen, 2004
ABCA 368, 363 A.R. 28; Tenenbaum v. United States of America, 2008 ABCA
396, 446 A.R. 155; Delagarde v. United States of America (2005), 293 N.B.R. (2d) 80 (C.A.); United States of America v. Palmucci,
2001 CanLII 38680 (Que.
C.A.); Boily v.
États-Unis Mexicains, 2005 QCCA 599; Ivanov v. United States of
America, 2003 NLCA 11, 223 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 44. 

[103]                     
Only the British
Columbia Court of Appeal has taken the position that, although this is not a de
novo hearing or a proceeding in which it can render a decision as if it
were the first judge, it must determine whether the initial decision is
“correct” while at the same time according the usual deference to the first
judge’s findings of fact: Seifert v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002
BCCA 385, 171 B.C.A.C. 203, at para. 6; United
States of America v. Graham,
2004 BCCA 162, 195 B.C.A.C. 245, at paras. 8-10. Paradoxically, the British
Columbia Court of Appeal and the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal
arrived at different outcomes even though they both based their decisions on an
analogy with the review procedure provided for in s. 680  Cr. C. This is
hardly surprising given that the courts do not agree on the nature of the latter
procedure.

[104]                     
For the purposes of
this appeal, I do not have to determine the validity of the positions taken by
appellate courts with respect to s. 680(1) Cr. C. and s. 18(2) of the Extradition
Act . The comparison between those provisions and ss. 520  and 521  Cr. C.
is nonetheless not without relevance. The fact that s. 680(1)  Cr. C. and
s. 18(2) of the Extradition Act  — unlike ss. 520  and 521  Cr. C. —
do not require cause to be shown for the court of appeal to exercise its power
of review suggests that Parliament intended, in ss. 520  and 521  Cr. C.,
to limit the reviewing judge’s discretion. 

(3)      Comparison Between the Appeal From a Sentence and the Review
Procedure Provided for in Sections 520 and 521 Cr. C.

[105]                     
The appellant points to
similarities between the interim release decision and the sentencing decision.
In the appellant’s view, these similarities mean that a release decision should
be reviewed on the basis of the same principles that guide a sentence appeal
under s. 687  Cr. C. Relying on R. v. Shropshire, [1995] 4
S.C.R. 227, R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, R. v. McDonnell,
[1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, R. v. L.M., 2008 SCC 31, [2008] 2 S.C.R.
163, and R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, the
appellant asserts that a superior court conducting a review under ss. 520 and 521
should reverse the initial decision and substitute another one for it only if
the initial decision contains an error in principle that affects the result, or
if it is clearly inappropriate or clearly unreasonable.

[106]                     
In the respondent’s
view, the distinctions between the sentencing decision and the interim release
decision are so great that no similarity would justify equating the rules for
one with the rules for the other. According to the respondent, the right to
interim release is a constitutional right, whereas the sentencing principle
requiring consideration of whether “less restrictive sanctions may be
appropriate in the circumstances” (s. 718.2 (d) Cr. C.) is not
important enough to justify this analogy.

[107]                     
It is true that there
are similarities between the interim release decision and the sentencing
decision. Although both these decisions are discretionary, specific statutory
rules apply to each of them. In both cases, the rules on the admissibility of
evidence are relaxed: ss. 518  and 723  Cr. C. As well, the release of an
accused must be ordered unless the prosecution shows cause why detention is
justified: s. 515(2)  and (10)  Cr. C. Similarly, the sentencing judge
must opt for the least restrictive sanction having regard to the circumstances:
s. 718.2 (d) Cr. C. Finally, the various possibilities available
to the judge are similar. In the case of interim release, the justice may
release the accused without conditions, impose statutory conditions for interim
release of the accused (with or without sureties), require the payment of a
deposit or order the detention of the accused: s. 515(1) , (2) (a) to (d),
(4)  to (4.3) , (5)  and (8)  Cr. C. In the case of sentencing, the judge
may discharge the accused, impose statutory conditions of probation, fine the
accused or sentence the accused to a term of imprisonment: ss. 730 , 731 , 734 
and 732.1(3)  Cr. C. 

[108]                     
However, there are also
some significant differences between the interim release decision and the
sentencing decision. In Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada,
2010 SCC 21, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 721, this Court discussed the expeditious nature
of our interim release system and the implications of that nature:

                    . . . s. 503(1)(a) Cr. C.
requires that a person who is arrested and detained be taken before a justice
“without unreasonable delay” and in any event within 24 hours after the arrest.
Section 515 Cr. C. provides that the justice shall release the
person unless the prosecution shows cause why the detention should be
continued. The grounds that can be relied on to deny the person’s release are
limited. In the short time it has before it must show cause why the
detention of the accused is justified, the prosecution has to gather the
evidence it intends to use at the bail hearing, which means it may have
insufficient time to meet with witnesses and further investigate the matters
relevant to bail. Section 516(1) Cr. C. provides that the adjournment of
a bail hearing cannot exceed three days except with the consent of the accused;
and orders can be reviewed at the request of the accused provided that the
accused has given the prosecution two days’ notice (s. 520(1) and (2) Cr. C.).

                        To
avoid any delay prejudicial to an accused who ought to be released, while at
the same time ensuring that those who do not meet the criteria for release are
kept in custody, compromises had to be made regarding the nature of the
evidence to be adduced at the bail hearing. There are practically no
prohibitions as regards the evidence the prosecution can lead to show cause why
the detention of the accused in custody is justified. According to s. 518(1) (e)
Cr. C., the prosecutor may lead any evidence that is “credible or
trustworthy”, which might include evidence of a confession that has not been
tested for voluntariness or consistency with the Charter , bad character,
information obtained by wiretap, hearsay statements, ambiguous post-offence
conduct, untested similar facts, prior convictions, untried charges, or
personal information on living and social habits. The justice has a broad
discretion to “make such inquiries, on oath or otherwise, of and concerning the
accused as he considers desirable” (s. 518(1) (a)). The process is
informal; the bail hearing can even take place over the phone (s. 515(2.2)).
[Underlining added; paras. 27-28.]

[109]                     
This conscious choice
to expedite the release hearing is grounded in the importance our society
attaches to the presumption of innocence and the right of individuals to
liberty even when charged with a serious criminal offence. However, this
expeditious process is not without consequences for the accused, who generally
has very little time to choose counsel and may even have no legal representation
at the release hearing. The accused, or his or her counsel, also has very
little time to, inter alia, review and analyze the prosecutor’s
evidence, devise a defence strategy and make the best possible decisions on how
to proceed. 

[110]                     
On the other hand, the
sentencing judge is often the judge who presided over the trial of the accused.
Thus, even though the appellant argues that the rules on the admissibility of
evidence are relaxed, a sentencing decision is made at the end of a long process
during which the judge has generally analyzed an abundance of evidence and is
more familiar with the situation of the accused. The sentencing judge is
therefore not in the same position as the justice who must decide whether to
grant the accused interim release. 

[111]                     
Finally, it is
important to note that, at the time of sentencing, the accused has already been
convicted and is therefore no longer presumed innocent. However, the sentence
could have a longer-term impact on the life of the accused than would interim
detention. 

[112]                     
Thus, although a
comparison between the interim release decision and the sentencing decision is
interesting, it cannot in itself be determinative, given the differences
between these two types of decisions. 

(4)      Nature of the Decision Reviewed Under Sections 520 and 521 Cr. C.

[113]                     
The decision concerning
the interim release of an accused is often characterized as “discretionary”.
This word must be used carefully in the context of this provision of the Criminal
Code , since release of the accused remains the rule, the exception being
where his or her detention is justified on one of the grounds set out in s. 515(10) 
Cr. C. 

[114]                     
Nevertheless, s. 515(10)(c)
requires the justice to balance several factors, including the ones listed in
that provision. In this balancing exercise, the justice must for the most part
make findings of fact and assess the weight of those findings to determine
whether detention is justified. Thus, the provision requires the justice to
assess the appropriateness of a decision, which, from this perspective, can be
characterized as “discretionary”. 

[115]                     
I have already dealt
with the argument concerning the similarity between the release decision and
the sentencing decision. It will be helpful to return here to the discretionary
nature of the sentencing decision. In Shropshire, this Court reproduced comments that had been
made by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, quoting R. v. Muise (1994), 94
C.C.C. (3d) 119, at pp. 123-24: 

                        In considering the fitness of a sentence
imposed by a trial judge, this court has consistently held that it will not
interfere unless the sentence imposed is clearly excessive or inadequate. . . .

. . .

                        The law on sentence appeals is not complex.
If a sentence imposed is not clearly excessive or inadequate it is a fit
sentence assuming the trial judge applied the correct principles and considered
all relevant facts. . . . My view is premised on the reality
that sentencing is not an exact science; it is anything but. It is
the exercise of judgment taking into consideration relevant legal
principles, the circumstances of the offence and the offender. The most that
can be expected of a sentencing judge is to arrive at a sentence that is within
an acceptable range. In my opinion, that is the true basis upon which Courts of
Appeal review sentences when the only issue is whether the sentence is
inadequate or excessive. [para. 48]

. . .

It then
added:

                        Unreasonableness
in the sentencing process involves the sentencing order falling outside the
“acceptable range” of orders; this clearly does not arise in the present
appeal. [Emphasis added; para. 50.]

[116]                     
In Nasogaluak,
the Court noted that an appellate court cannot interfere with a sentence simply
because it would have weighed the relevant factors differently (para. 46,
quoting R. v. McKnight (1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 41 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 35):

                    . . .
The weighing of relevant factors, the balancing process is what the exercise of
discretion is all about. . . . Only if by emphasizing one
factor or by not giving enough weight to another, the trial judge exercises his
or her discretion unreasonably should an appellate court interfere with the
sentence on the ground the trial judge erred in principle. [Emphasis added.]

[117]                     
Allow me to repeat that
the accused has a right to be presumed innocent at the time of the release
hearing, which is no longer the case at the time of sentencing. However, the
passages reproduced above aptly convey the implications of a discretionary decision
that involves the balancing of a number of factors. As I explained above, a
decision with respect to release made on the basis of s. 515(10)(c) Cr.
C. calls for the consideration of several factors that may be difficult to
balance. This is a delicate exercise whose essence would be distorted if an
open-ended discretion to review the initial release decision were to be
conferred on the judge. 

[118]                     
As I mentioned above, I
am of the opinion that ss. 520 and 521 Cr. C. do not provide for a de
novo hearing. Thus, unless there is new evidence — a subject I will address
below — the reviewing judge is not in a better position than the justice to
evaluate whether the detention of the accused is necessary. In addition, the
reviewing judge has, in relation to the justice, no special expertise with
respect to release. 

[119]                     
I therefore have
difficulty seeing any possible justification for allowing a reviewing judge, at
all times, to substitute his or her assessment of the various circumstances for
that of the justice.

(5)      Conclusion: The Review Provided for in Sections 520 and 521 Cr.
C. Is a Hybrid Remedy

[120]                     
On the basis of the
wording of ss. 520 and 521 Cr. C., a comparison with other review
provisions and with sentence appeals, and the nature of the decision being
reviewed, I conclude that these sections do not confer on the reviewing judge
an open-ended power to review the initial order respecting the detention or
release of the accused. The reviewing judge must therefore determine whether it
is appropriate to exercise this power of review. 

[121]                     
It will be appropriate
to intervene if the justice has erred in law. It will also be appropriate for
the reviewing judge to exercise this power if the impugned decision was clearly
inappropriate, that is, if the justice who rendered it gave excessive weight to
one relevant factor or insufficient weight to another. The reviewing judge
therefore does not have the power to interfere with the initial decision simply
because he or she would have weighed the relevant factors differently. I reiterate
that the relevant factors are not limited to the ones expressly specified in s.
515(10)(c) Cr. C. Finally, where new evidence is submitted by the
accused or the prosecutor as permitted by ss. 520 and 521 Cr. C., the
reviewing judge may vary the initial decision if that evidence shows a material
and relevant change in the circumstances of the case.

(6)      Material Change in Circumstances

[122]                     
Sections 520(7) and
521(8) Cr. C. provide for the tendering of new “evidence or exhibits”.
Section 520(7) reads as follows:

                        520.
(7) On the hearing of an application under this section, the judge may consider

                        (a) the transcript, if any, of the proceedings heard by the justice
and by any judge who previously reviewed the order made by the justice,

                        (b) the exhibits, if any, filed in the proceedings before the justice,
and

                        (c) such additional evidence or exhibits as may be tendered by the
accused or the prosecutor, 

Section 521(8) is
essentially identical to s. 520(7).

[123]                     
The question is what is
admissible as new evidence. 

[124]                     
The appellant submits
that this evidence is limited to facts that are truly new in the sense that
they have come to light since the initial decision. It therefore does not
include facts that could have been alleged at the initial hearing or during a
previous review. Otherwise, the system could encourage “judge shopping”.

[125]                     
It is true that the
principle of finality of judgments and that of the need to avoid a multiplicity
of unwarranted court proceedings are important, and the courts must not
facilitate “judge shopping”. However, it is going too far to say, as the
appellant does, that it might be in an arrested person’s interest to tender a
minimum of evidence at the initial release hearing and then, should that prove
to be insufficient, to adduce evidence on review that had existed at the time
of that hearing but had not been used then. Detained persons generally do
everything in their power to be released as quickly as possible. The appellant’s
argument reflects a misunderstanding of the impact of detention on an individual,
particularly when it may be unjustified: see, e.g., Toronto Star Newspapers
Ltd., at para. 51, quoting Hall, at para. 47; Ell v. Alberta,
2003 SCC 35, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 857, at para. 24. 

[126]                     
That the fear expressed
by the appellant goes too far seems even clearer to me given the fact that,
following a first application for review under ss. 520 and 521 Cr. C., a
further application may not be made, except with leave of a judge, prior to the
expiration of 30 days: ss. 520(8) and 521(9) Cr. C. 

[127]                     
I am instead of the
opinion that the reason why detained persons may not always tender all possible
evidence at their first hearing lies in the generally expeditious nature of the
release process and in the consequences of that nature, namely the short time between
arrest and hearing, a lack of representation for accused persons, and
incomplete evidence at this stage. The interests of justice would therefore be
undermined if courts acting under ss. 520 and 521 Cr. C. were to adopt a
narrow view regarding the “new evidence” that can be admitted under those
sections. 

[128]                     
In Palmer v. The
Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, at p. 775, this Court established the following
criteria that must be met for evidence to be considered “new evidence” on
appeal:

(1)      The
evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have
been adduced at trial . . . .

 

(2)      The
evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a decisive or
potentially decisive issue in the trial.

(3)      The
evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief,
and

(4)      It
must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other
evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result.

(Reproduced in R. v. Warsing, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 579, at para. 50.)

[129]                     
In my opinion, the four
criteria from Palmer are relevant, with any necessary modifications, to
the determination of what constitutes new evidence for the purposes of the
review provided for in ss. 520 and 521 Cr. C. Given the generally
expeditious nature of the interim release process and the risks of violating
the rights of the accused, and since the release hearing takes place at the
very start of criminal proceedings and not at the end like the sentence appeal,
a reviewing judge must be flexible in applying these four criteria. I reiterate
at the outset that the rules of evidence are relaxed in the context of the
release hearing: s. 518  Cr. C.

[130]                     
The first criterion —
due diligence — exists to ensure finality and order, which are values that are
essential to the integrity of the criminal process: R. v. G.D.B.,
2000 SCC 22, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at para. 19, quoting R. v. M. (P.S.) (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 411. The appellant relies on these
same values to limit what constitutes new evidence in this case. However, the
pre-trial detention of accused persons — like their release — is, by its
nature, very often “interim” and not final.

[131]                     
Moreover, despite the
importance of these values, this Court has also stated that the due diligence
criterion should not be applied as strictly in criminal matters as in civil
cases: Palmer, at p. 775, quoting McMartin v. The Queen, [1964]
S.C.R. 484, at p. 493. The weight to be given to this criterion depends on the
strength of the other criteria or, in other words, on the totality of the
circumstances: R. v. Price, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 633, at p. 634; see also Warsing, at para. 51. In G.D.B.,
this Court stated that “an appellate court should determine the reason why the
evidence was not available at the trial”: para. 20. A generous and liberal
interpretation of the meaning of “new evidence” in the context of ss. 520 and
521 Cr. C. is thus quite consistent with the principles developed by
this Court. 

[132]                     
I am therefore of the
opinion that a reviewing judge may consider evidence that is truly new or
evidence that existed at the time of the initial release hearing but was not
tendered for some reason that is legitimate and reasonable. This is how the
“due diligence” criterion from Palmer must be understood in the context
of the review provided for in ss. 520 and 521 Cr. C. The nature of the
release system and the risks associated with it demand no less. 

[133]                     
I wish to be clear that
such new evidence is not limited to evidence that was unavailable to the
accused before the initial hearing because, for example, the prosecutor did not
disclose it to the accused. It is possible that the prosecutor will give the
evidence to the accused only at the very last minute before, or very shortly
before, the initial hearing. Depending on the circumstances of a given case, it
could be unreasonable and unfair to say that if the accused does not use such
evidence at the initial hearing, he or she will be precluded from adducing it on
a subsequent application for review, that is, after his or her counsel has had
the necessary time to analyze it and weigh the advantages and disadvantages of
using it. In each case, the reviewing judge will have to determine whether the
reason why the accused did not tender such pre-existing evidence earlier was
legitimate and reasonable. 

[134]                     
This requirement to
show a reason that was legitimate and reasonable means that it will be open to
the reviewing judge to refuse to admit new evidence where it is alleged to have
actually been in the interest of the accused to drag out the application for
release or where the accused is alleged to have tried to use the review to
engage in judge shopping. In this way, the conception of new evidence in the
context of ss. 520 and 521 Cr. C. reflects both the need to ensure the
integrity of our criminal justice system and the need to protect the rights of
accused persons in proceedings that are generally expeditious. 

[135]                     
As to the second Palmer
criterion, the evidence obviously does not have to “bea[r] upon a decisive
or potentially decisive issue in the trial”: p. 775. It will suffice if the
evidence is relevant for the purposes of s. 515(10) Cr. C. Where, more
specifically, the third ground for detention under s. 515(10)(c) — the
one at issue here — is concerned, I note that the justice must consider “all
the circumstances”. The second Palmer criterion will therefore rarely be
decisive in the context of an application for review under ss. 520 and 521 Cr.
C., since the range of “relevant” evidence will generally be quite broad. 

[136]                     
The third criterion —
that the evidence “must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable
of belief” (Palmer, at p. 775) — must be interpreted in light of the
relaxation of the rules of evidence at the bail stage and in particular of s. 518(1) (e)
Cr. C., which provides that “the justice may receive and base his
decision on evidence considered credible or trustworthy by him in the
circumstances of each case”.

[137]                     
Finally, the fourth Palmer
criterion should be modified as follows: the new evidence must be such that it
is reasonable to think, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, that
it could have affected the balancing exercise engaged in by the justice under
s. 515(10)(c) Cr. C. The new evidence must therefore be
significant.

[138]                     
If the new evidence
meets the four criteria for admissibility, the reviewing judge is authorized to
repeat the analysis under s. 515(10)(c) Cr. C. as if he or she
were the initial decision-maker. The reviewing judge must therefore consider
all the circumstances of the case, focusing in particular on the circumstances
specified in that provision. The judge must then undertake a balancing exercise
and determine, from the perspective of the public, whether the detention of the
accused is still justified. The Palmer criteria, modified as I have just
done, must not be applied in a manner that delays or needlessly complicates the
release process. As I explained above, that process, by its very nature,
generally requires an expeditious and flexible procedure. The criteria
therefore serve as guidelines for the reviewing judge, but they must not have
the effect of creating a procedural straightjacket that would interfere with
the administration of justice.

[139]                     
In conclusion, a
reviewing judge can intervene where relevant new evidence is tendered, where an
error of law has been made or, finally, where the decision was clearly
inappropriate. 

C.       Application to the Facts of This Case

(1)      No New Facts

[140]                     
In making the initial
decision on whether the respondent should be released, Judge Lavergne
considered the fact that, according to the witnesses, the respondent and his co-accused
had shouted abuse and insults at the driver during the entire ride, had tried
to provoke him and had threatened to beat him up. Judge Lavergne also noted
that the video showed that the young men had spat at the driver while getting
off the bus. This appeared to provoke a reaction by the driver, who stood up
and went to the door of the bus. Judge Lavergne wrote that the driver had in
all likelihood said something to the young men, who had then rushed back onto
the bus. That was when the assault began. 

[141]                     
On review, Martin J. of
the Superior Court found that not all elements of the incident had been in
evidence before Judge Lavergne. According to Martin J., the starting point for
the events taken into account by Judge Lavergne seemed to be the moment when
the three young men had stood up at the back of the bus to go to the front.
However, in Martin J.’s view, the events had instead started when the driver
had refused to open the bus doors to let the young men on at a previous stop. Martin
J. also pointed out that, once the three young men had gotten off the bus, the
driver had jumped up from his seat and headed for the door. Following a verbal
exchange, the driver went back to sit down, followed by the young men, who got
back on the bus. At that moment, the driver turned toward them and took [translation] “a certain physical action
against one of the individuals”: para. 11. It was from that point on, according
to Martin J., that the situation degenerated. 

[142]                     
It is true that Judge
Lavergne did not state in his decision that the driver had refused to let the
three young men board at a previous stop. The transcript from the initial
hearing seems to indicate that this was not discussed by counsel of record.
Judge Lavergne also did not refer to the physical action the driver had taken
against the young men before they assaulted him. These details came from a
statement made by a passenger, which was not given to counsel for the
respondent until the morning of the hearing before Judge Lavergne. The
investigating officer, who testified for the prosecution, referred to the
passenger’s statement, but this specific point was not mentioned. When cross-examining
the investigating officer, counsel for the respondent did not bring up the
passenger’s statement. In light of my conclusions with respect to “new
evidence” and of the fact that counsel did not receive the statement until the
morning of the initial hearing, this fact could have constituted a reason that
was legitimate and reasonable for not using it at that hearing but then doing
so at a subsequent hearing. 

[143]                     
However, it can be seen
from the transcript of the second release hearing, held on completion of the
preliminary inquiry, that counsel for the respondent submitted at that hearing
that the bus driver had not stopped at a previous stop. Counsel also observed
that, after being spat at, the driver had spoken aggressively to the three
young men and had allegedly pushed the first of the young men who had gotten
back on the bus. Counsel for the respondent then filed the passenger’s
statement in evidence. 

[144]                     
In the decision he
rendered following the preliminary inquiry, Judge Legault noted that the young
men had complained to the driver for not waiting for them at a previous stop. He
also observed that, when the young men had gotten off the bus throwing what
remained of their pizza at him and spitting at him, the driver had gone to the
door of the bus to object to their behaviour.

[145]                     
Judge Legault
nevertheless found that the detention of the respondent was still justified
under s. 515(10)(c) Cr. C.: 

                        [translation] 
The Court sees no reason to interfere with Judge Lavergne’s observations
on the third ground, which concerns confidence in the administration of
justice, having regard to all the factors, namely the likelihood of conviction,
the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence, the gravity of the
offence, which is even greater because of the serious consequences for the
personal life and work of the accused, the lack of prospects for independence
in the future and, finally, the fact that the accused is liable for a
potentially lengthy term of imprisonment.

. . .

                        The
Court is not of the opinion that it has evidence that would allow it to qualify
or temper the judge’s findings concerning the aggravating factors involved in
the significant participation of the accused in the offence that was committed.
[paras. 26 and 30] 

[146]                     
Thus, no new facts were
presented to Martin J. in the context of the application for review. Judge
Lavergne may not have had all the elements of the incident before him at the
initial hearing, but Judge Legault did have them on completion of the
preliminary inquiry. He found that the new details in the sequence of events
did not alter Judge Lavergne’s initial conclusion.

[147]                     
It is true that, in his
decision, Judge Legault did not mention the [translation]
“physical action” taken by the driver to which the Superior Court judge
referred. However, it can be seen from the evidence that Judge Legault was
aware of that fact. It must be assumed that he considered it in making his
decision. “The judge is not required to demonstrate that he or she knows the
law [or] has considered all aspects of the evidence”: R. v. Burns, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656, at p. 664. I do not
think this is a case in which the judge failed to appreciate, or completely
disregarded, relevant evidence: Harper v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 2,
at p. 14. In light of all the relevant circumstances, the driver’s action could
not in itself have tipped the balance in the respondent’s favour. 

[148]                     
It was therefore not
open to Martin J. to review the initial detention order on the basis of new
facts. 

(2)      Question Whether the Alleged Crime Is “Unexplainable”

[149]                     
Judge Lavergne began by
properly identifying the test set out in s. 515(10)(c) Cr. C., as
can be seen from the following comment: 

                    [translation]  But above all, this
provision, s. 515(10) (c) of the Criminal Code , essentially calls for an
analysis of whether, at the end of the day, after all the circumstances are
considered, including the four (4) factors I have already mentioned, there
is a reasonable collective expectation that interim release must be
denied to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice.
[Emphasis added; pp. 18-19.] 

[150]                     
Judge Lavergne also
stated that [translation] “[t]he
public means persons who are reasonable, dispassionate and properly informed
about the values expressed in legislation, including the presumption of
innocence . . . but who are also informed about all the circumstances
associated with the commission of a crime”: p. 19. This statement is perfectly
consistent with this Court’s decision in Hall. Judge Lavergne added that
the onus was on the prosecutor to show that the detention of the accused was
justified. 

[151]                     
It is true that Judge
Lavergne did not elaborate on his finding that the prosecution had discharged
its burden of proof under s. 515(10) (c) in this case. However, when
considered as a whole, his decision was detailed enough for a reviewing judge
to be able to understand the grounds on which he had based his detention order.
He referred to the first three factors, which he had already discussed in the context
of s. 515(10) (b). On the fourth factor, he stated that the accused was
liable for a potentially [translation] “significant”
term. In his analysis under s. 515(10) (b), Judge Lavergne considered the
following circumstances surrounding the offence: (1) the three young men had
allegedly shouted abuse and insults at the driver during the bus ride; (2) they
had spat at him when getting off the bus; (3) the driver had then stood up and
gone to the door and had, in all likelihood, said something to the young men;
and (4) the young men had gotten back on the bus, rushed at the driver and beat
him severely. Judge Lavergne also noted that the respondent had been an active
participant and that the existence of the videotape meant that a conviction was
highly likely.

[152]                     
Judge Lavergne
repeatedly stressed the brutality and gratuitousness of the assault as well as
the fact that it was unexplainable and unexplained: 

                    [translation] 
[The video footage] illustrates the brutality of the assault, which is
matched only by its gratuitousness.

. . .

                    The Court will refrain [from describing such
conduct] except to again emphasize the unexplainable and unexplained brutality
of such behaviour. 

. . .

                    The defendant and the driver do not know each
other, which makes this even more incomprehensible. There was nothing to
predispose the defendant to attack the driver so violently, which makes the
assault that much more senseless and heinous. 

. . .

                    Conduct
as unpredictable and disturbing as this does not weigh in favour of release.
[pp. 2, 9-10 and 14-15] 

[153]                     
Judge Lavergne’s
reasons may suggest that the fact that the assault was gratuitous or
unexplainable played a key part in his conclusion that the detention of the
respondent was necessary under s. 515(10) (c) Cr. C., and not only
under s. 515(10)(b). As I mentioned above, however, the question whether
an offence is unexplainable or unexplained is not a criterion that should guide
justices in their analysis under s. 515(10) (c) Cr. C.

[154]                     
In any event, there is
no doubt that Martin J. made the crime being “explainable” a criterion in his
analysis, in addition to unduly restricting the scope of s. 515(10) (c) Cr.
C. After finding that Judge Lavergne had not had all the circumstances
before him at the initial hearing, Martin J. wrote that this was not a totally
gratuitous and unexplained or unexplainable incident. He then reviewed the
history of s. 515(10)  Cr. C. and the case law on s. 515(10) (c),
finding that the latter provision had to be used [translation] “sparingly”: para. 22. 

[155]                     
Martin J. disagreed
with the view that the incident was unexplainable. He added: 

                    [translation]  Do not misunderstand me.
Such behaviour is heinous and cannot be justified. However, it is not
unexplainable. [para. 27]

[156]                     
I note as well that
Martin J. quoted, with approval, Trout, in which the Manitoba Court of
Appeal had found that the facts of the case before it, though brutal, “pale[d]
in comparison to the vicious butchering of the victim in Hall”: para. 26,
quoting Trout, at para. 12. 

[157]                     
With all due respect
for the reviewing judge, I believe he erred in stating that s. 515(10) (c)
Cr. C. must be interpreted narrowly and applied only in rare cases. In
addition, the offence being “explainable” proved to be a determinative factor
in his decision, although he did properly recognize the seriousness of the
offence and its [translation] “heinous”
and “repugnant” nature. Moreover, he reversed the decisions of Judge Lavergne
and Judge Legault without even considering the four factors set out in s. 515(10) (c)
Cr. C. Martin J. therefore made several errors that justify reviewing
his entire decision. 

[158]                     
Finally, Martin J.
intervened even though there was no basis for a review, given that there was no
material change in circumstances and no error of law, and that the initial
decision was not clearly inappropriate. Indeed, in my opinion, the detention of
the respondent was justified under s. 515(10) (c)
Cr. C. 

(3)      Necessity of the Respondent’s Detention

[159]                     
All the relevant
factors in this case must be analyzed to determine whether, when they are
balanced as they should have been had it not been for the errors, the detention
of the respondent is necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of
justice. 

[160]                     
First of all, the
prosecution’s case appears to be strong, since the incident was videotaped and
there is eyewitness testimony. Real evidence such as a videotape is more
reliable than circumstantial or testimonial evidence. In addition, the
respondent does not seem, prima facie, to have a valid defence to put
forward, even if the driver’s [translation]
“physical action” against the respondent and his co-accused were to be
taken into account. Indeed, the respondent did not argue in this Court that he
had a valid defence that could limit the apparent strength of the prosecution’s
case. Although it is not my role — nor is it the role of a bail judge — to
analyze in detail the possible outcomes of a future trial, it is difficult to
imagine, at first glance, how self-defence could be available to the
respondent. At this stage of the proceedings, the evidence does not logically
support an argument by the respondent that he used reasonable force to defend
or protect himself or to protect another person, or that the act he committed
was reasonable in the circumstances: s. 34  Cr. C. It should also be
noted that the defence of provocation is not available, given that it applies
only to reduce a murder charge: s. 232  Cr. C.

[161]                     
The offence is
objectively very serious, since it is aggravated assault and since the maximum
sentence of 14 years for that offence is among the most severe in the Criminal
Code  after imprisonment for life: para. 268(2) . 

[162]                     
As for the
circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence, I am considering the
fact that the respondent was an active participant in the assault and that the
assault was extremely brutal: even the intervention of passengers could not put
a quick stop to it. The fact that an offence is violent, brutal or heinous is
clearly an important factor that a justice can consider. The fact that the
driver had refused to wait for the young men at a previous stop is of no
relevance in this analysis. Moreover, I have difficulty seeing why the physical
action the driver allegedly took — pushing a friend of the respondent’s —
should even be considered to favour the respondent in light of the insults and
threats directed at him during the ride. 

[163]                     
Finally, the maximum
sentence for aggravated assault is 14 years. If the respondent were instead
convicted of assault causing bodily harm, the maximum sentence would be 10 years:
s. 267 (b) Cr. C. Neither offence carries a minimum sentence.
Courts have held that [translation] “this
type of crime, aggravated assault, generally demands an unconditional term of
imprisonment to properly express society’s denunciation of crimes of violence
against the person and to send a clear message of deterrence”: R. v.
Dagenais, 2012 QCCA 244, at para. 18 (CanLII); R. v. Riendeau, 2012
QCCA 1155, at para. 32; see also C. C. Ruby, G. J. Chan and N. R. Hasan, Sentencing
(8th ed. 2012), at § 23.230. Even though the respondent had no criminal record
and was only 20 years old at the time of the events, he will, if convicted,
likely be sentenced to a significant term of imprisonment in light of the
circumstances of the offence, and in particular of his active participation in
and the violent nature of the assault. Therefore, there is no doubt that he is
liable for a potentially “lengthy term of imprisonment” within the meaning of
s. 515(10) (c) Cr. C. if he is convicted of either aggravated
assault or assault causing bodily harm.

[164]                     
Accordingly, the four
circumstances set out in s. 515(10) (c) Cr. C. strongly support
the detention of the respondent. 

[165]                     
In my view, the fact
that the assault was committed against a bus driver, a civil servant who works
in the community to ensure the well-being of the public, makes the offence even
more heinous. Also relevant are the nature and severity of the injuries
sustained by the driver, and in particular the long-term effects and the impact
on his career and his personal life. 

[166]                     
In short, I find that,
when all the relevant circumstances are weighed as required by s. 515(10) (c)
Cr. C., the detention of the respondent was necessary to maintain
confidence in the administration of justice. 

[167]                     
I believe that a
reasonable member of the public who, although not a legal expert, is
nonetheless properly informed about the philosophy underlying the legislative
provisions, Charter  values and the actual circumstances of the case
would not understand why the respondent should not remain in custody pending
his trial. Such members of the public are not people who would allow themselves
to be guided by their emotions and to be swayed by the mob or by incomplete or
distorted information. In the face of such a brutal attack that was committed
by several people in the middle of the night against a bus driver, a person who
was serving the community, and that had serious consequences for the victim’s
health and integrity and was captured on a videotape that left no doubt as to
the respondent’s active participation in the assault, I believe that the
confidence in our justice system of a reasonable member of our society would be
undermined if the interim detention of the respondent were not ordered. 

V.      
Disposition

[168]                     
I would allow the
appeal. It was not open to the Superior Court judge to interfere with the
initial release decision, and he unduly restricted the scope of s. 515(10) (c)
Cr. C. and erred in basing his decision on the question whether that the
offence was “unexplainable”. The detention of the respondent is justified on
the basis of s. 515(10) (c) Cr. C. The detention order is
accordingly restored.

APPENDIX

Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 

515. . . .

on appeal from the court of appeal for alberta

                    Criminal
law — Child pornography — Defences — Private use exception — Accused charged
with child pornography offences — Accused arguing in defence
that sexual activity lawful and consensual and that recordings held for private
use — Crown challenging lawfulness of sexual activity on basis of girls’
exploitation — Whether private use exception
requires separate and additional exploitation inquiry or whether exploitation
included under lawfulness inquiry — In acquitting accused, whether trial judge
properly interpreted exception — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , s.
163.1 . 

                    Two
girls, age 14, were runaways from a treatment centre. They stayed with the
accused B, age 60, whereas the other accused, R, age 41, was a regular visitor.
The girls were involved in sexual activity, which was depicted on video and in
photographs, with each other and with R. At the time the videos and photographs
were made, 14-year-olds could legally consent to sexual acts with adults. Both
B and R were charged with making child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1(2)  of
the Criminal Code . B was also charged with one count of possessing child
pornography, contrary to s. 163.1(4) . B and R were tried together. The trial
judge found that all of the elements of the offences were established; however,
the accused raised in defence the private use exception outlined in R. v. Sharpe, 2001 SCC 2, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45. The judge concluded that the Crown
had failed to disprove the exception beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of
Appeal allowed the appeals, substituted guilty verdicts and remitted the case
for sentencing. 

                    Held: The appeals should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

                    The
private use exception outlined in Sharpe serves as a defence to the
offence of making or possessing child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1  of the Criminal
Code . This private use exception requires a determination that the sexual
activity depicted in recordings is lawful, that the recording of the sexual
activity is also consensual and that the recordings are held exclusively for
private use. In Sharpe, the Court did not mandate a separate and
additional exploitation inquiry. Adding such a step would be unnecessary, as
exploitation is already captured under the lawfulness inquiry. Section 153  of
the Criminal Code  makes sexual exploitation of a young person a
crime. Thus, where the Crown seeks to rely on s. 153  to negate the legality of
the sexual activity depicted, the judge must consider whether it occurred in
the context of an exploitative relationship. If so, the sexual activity is not
lawful, and the private use exception does not apply.

                    Where
s. 153 is engaged, the consent of the young person to the sexual activity
cannot render it lawful. Thus, where an accused raises the private use
exception and the Crown seeks to challenge the lawfulness of the sexual
activity on the basis of exploitation, a trial judge must look beyond whether
or not consent was given and holistically examine the nature and circumstances
of the relationship between the young person and the accused. Section 153(1.2)
provides a non-exhaustive list of indicia from which a trial judge may infer
that the relationship between the accused and a young person is exploitative: “(a)
the age of the young person; (b) the age difference between the person
and the young person; (c) the evolution of the relationship; and (d)
the degree of control or influence by the person over the young person”. It is
not necessary that the person accused of making or possessing child pornography
be charged separately under s. 153(1) in order for a judge to undertake this
inquiry. The lawfulness of the sexual activity is independently assessed as
part of the defence. 

                    In
this case, the trial judge did not consider whether the relationship between
the girls and the accused was exploitative within the meaning of s. 153,
despite the fact that, at the time, s. 153 applied to young persons between the
ages of 14 and 17. Where the trial judge did consider evidence that would be
relevant to exploitation, he did so in isolation, looking at the factors one at
a time. For example, he identified the girls’ age and the substantial
difference in age between them and the accused, but found this was an
insufficient basis for concluding that this difference was exploitative.
However, he did not assess this age difference in light of other aspects of the
relationship, such as the impact of the girls’ addictions, their need for
shelter, or their past and ongoing experiences with homelessness and
prostitution. In short, he did not consider the specific factors in light of
the broader context or whether they cumulatively resulted in an exploitative
relationship.

                    In
other words, the trial judge’s analysis focused primarily on the voluntariness
of the sexual activities, instead of on the nature of the relationship between
the parties. While the voluntariness of sexual activities is an important
aspect of lawfulness, it does not end the inquiry. The trial judge was also
required to holistically assess the nature and circumstances of the
relationship to determine whether the sexual activity was rendered unlawful
under s. 153. By failing to consider whether the underlying relationship
between the girls and the accused was exploitative, the trial judge erred in
law. This error had a material bearing on the accused’s acquittals and requires
a new trial.

                    The judgment of the Court was delivered by

[1]                             
Karakatsanis J. — These appeals concern what happens
when teenagers participate in sexual recordings as part of relationships that
may involve exploitation.  They examine the “private use exception” outlined in
this Court’s decision of R. v. Sharpe, 2001 SCC 2, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45. 
The private use exception acts as a defence to the offences of making and
possessing child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .  The exception covers visual recordings that do not
depict unlawful sexual activity, were created with the consent of the persons
depicted, and are held exclusively for private use (Sharpe, at
para. 128).

[2]                             
In this case, the Court is asked to clarify the
elements of the exception, and in particular where the concept of exploitation
fits in the analysis.

I conclude that the test articulated in Sharpe
requires a determination that the sexual activity depicted is lawful ―
and thus did not arise in the context of an exploitative relationship.  As the
trial judge did not consider this specific question, I would allow the appeals
and order a new trial.

I.             
Facts

[4]                             
In early 2008, two 14-year-old females, K and D,
ran away from an adolescent treatment centre in High Prairie, Alberta.  The two
teenagers had difficult pasts, with experiences of drug addiction, criminal history,
family issues, and, in K’s case, a history of prostitution.  K described
herself as a “street child” with ongoing troubles with drug abuse.

[5]                             
After leaving the treatment centre, K and D
travelled to Edmonton, where they went to stay at the appellant Donald
Barabash’s residence.  D had known Mr. Barabash for about a year, as a drug
dealer and a friend of her father’s.  The other appellant, Shane Rollison, was
a friend of Mr. Barabash’s who was regularly at the residence and was also
involved in drugs.  At trial, K described the place as a stereotypic “crack
house” with a wide variety of people visiting to sell, buy, and use various
illegal drugs.

[6]                             
During the time K and D stayed at the Barabash
residence (K two to three weeks, D one week), they were involved in the
creation of video recordings and still images with the appellants, using a
computer webcam in the basement.  In the recordings and images, K and D appear
nude and engage in explicit sexual activity.

[7]                             
The police began investigating the appellants
after receiving complaints about a still photograph posted to Nexopia, a social
networking site.  The photograph depicted two young women, one of them
topless.  The police identified K and D as the two women depicted in the image
and searched the Barabash residence.  There they located a number of video
recordings and still photographs that they identified as child pornography. 
The videos and photographs depicted K and D engaged in various explicit sexual
activities, both with each other and with Mr. Rollison.  Mr. Barabash generally
operated the camera, although K and D did so at times.  At the time the videos
and photographs were made, 14-year-olds were able to consent to sexual acts
with adults.  (This has since been raised to 16.)  K and D were both 14 at the
time, while Mr. Barabash was 60, and Mr. Rollison was 41.

[8]                             
The appellants were both charged with making
child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(2)  of the Criminal Code .  Mr.
Barabash was also charged with one count of possessing child pornography
contrary to s. 163.1(4) .

II.          
Decisions Below

A.          
Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench, 2012 ABQB 99,
532 A.R. 364

[9]                             
The appellants were tried together before Thomas
J., sitting alone.  The trial judge found the Crown had proven beyond a
reasonable doubt that both appellants made child pornography contrary to s.
163.1(2)  of the Criminal Code .  He also found the Crown had proven
beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Barabash was in possession of child
pornography contrary to s. 163.1(4) .  The core issue, however, was the
availability of the private use exception from Sharpe as a defence to
the charges.

[10]                         
The trial judge reviewed the private use
exception and concluded that, according to Sharpe, three requirements
must be met for the exception to be made out: (1) the sexual activity must be
legal; (2) the recording must be made with the consent of the persons depicted;
and (3) the recording must be held for private use.  He rejected the Crown’s submission
that, in addition to these three requirements, private use material must
possess aspects of “self-fulfilment and self-actualization” and must not result
in the “exploitation or abuse of children” (para. 163, citing Sharpe, at
paras. 120 and 116).  The trial judge found that all three requirements set out
in Sharpe were met on the facts of this case and entered acquittals.

B.           
Alberta Court of Appeal, 2014 ABCA 126, 572 A.R.
289

[11]                         
The Crown appealed the acquittals on the ground
that the trial judge erred in his interpretation of the private use exception. 
The majority of the Court of Appeal agreed and allowed the appeals, relying on
that court’s decision in R. v. Cockell, 2013 ABCA 112, 553 A.R.
91, leave to appeal refused, [2013] 3 S.C.R. x.  Cockell held that the
private use exception also contained a standalone requirement that there be no
exploitation or abuse involved in the creation of the recording, and a
requirement that the parties intended the pornographic material to be for the
private use of all those involved in its creation.

[12]                         
Applying Cockell to the present case, the
majority found that, for the purposes of the exception, the sexual activity
must not involve “child exploitation or abuse as cognizable in law generally,
not just crimes under the Code”, and that “it was not outside the scope
of judicial notice to find that considerably more than a ‘nominal risk of harm’
was inflicted on these two damaged kids” (para. 36).  The majority therefore found
that, with the correct law applied to the trial judge’s findings of fact,
convictions of the appellants were inevitable.  It accordingly substituted
guilty verdicts and remitted the case for sentencing.

[13]                         
Berger J.A., writing in dissent, would have
dismissed the appeals.  While he agreed with the majority that the trial judge
erred, he disagreed with the majority’s view of the private use exception test
and found that exploitation is properly subsumed within the lawfulness
analysis.  That is, he did not believe that Sharpe created a separate
and distinct requirement related to factual exploitation.  He found that the
private use exception was made out on the facts as found by the trial judge.

III.       
Analysis

A.          
R. v. Sharpe and the Criminal Prohibition on
Child Pornography

[14]                         
Section 163.1  of the Criminal Code  establishes
a number of prohibitions related to the making, possession, distribution and
accessing of child pornography.  The child pornography in this case is defined
in s. 163.1(1) (a):

        163.1 (1) In this section, “child pornography” means

 

(a)
a photographic, film, video or other visual representation, whether or not it
was made by electronic or mechanical means,

 

(i)
that shows a person who is or is depicted as being under the age of eighteen
years and is engaged in or is depicted as engaged in explicit sexual activity,
or

 

(ii)
the dominant characteristic of which is the depiction, for a sexual purpose, of
a sexual organ or the anal region of a person under the age of eighteen years;

[15]                         
In Sharpe, McLachlin C.J., writing for
the majority of this Court, concluded that while s. 163.1  infringed the
constitutional right to freedom of expression protected by s. 2 (b) of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , this infringement was, for
the most part, justified under s. 1  of the Charter  because of the
important government objective of protecting children from harm.  However, the
majority found that two categories of privately held material captured by the
criminal prohibition did not strike the proper balance between preventing harm
to children and protecting freedom of expression.  The two categories are (1)
self-created expressive material, and (2) private recordings of lawful sexual
activity.  These types of private material engage values related to the
development of thought, belief, opinion and expression, while posing “no
reasoned risk of harm to children” (para. 100).

[16]                         
To remedy this constitutional defect, the Court read
in two exceptions to the prohibition.  Each of these exceptions operates as a
defence to prosecution under s. 163.1(2) , which prohibits making child
pornography, and s. 163.1(4), which prohibits its possession.  The first
exception addresses expressive material created and held by a single person and
protects “deeply private expression, such as personal journals and drawings,
intended solely for the eyes of their creator” (Sharpe, at para. 128). 
The second exception, termed the “private use exception”, protects a narrow
category of recordings:

The second
exception protects a person’s possession of visual recordings created by or
depicting that person, but only where these recordings do not depict
unlawful sexual activity, are held only for private use, and were created with
the consent of those persons depicted.  [Emphasis in original; ibid.]

Only this latter
exception is relevant for the purposes of the present appeals.

[17]                         
The majority in Sharpe reasoned that
private recordings may be of significance to adolescent self-fulfilment,
self-actualization and sexual exploration and identity.  It noted that “two
adolescents might arguably deepen a loving and respectful relationship through
erotic pictures of themselves engaged in sexual activity”, thus concluding that
the cost of criminalizing such materials on the right of free expression
outweighs any tenuous benefit it might confer in preventing harm to children
(para. 109).

B.           
Elements of the Private Use Exception

[18]                         
As this Court explained in Sharpe, there
are three elements to the private use exception, all of which must have a basis
in the evidence for the exception to apply:  (1) the recording must depict
lawful sexual activity; (2) the persons depicted must consent to the recording;
and (3) the recording must be held for private use.

[19]                         
In order for this defence to go to a jury, the
accused must raise an air of reality with respect to all three elements of the
defence (Sharpe, at para. 116).  Once this evidential burden is met, the
Crown then bears the persuasive burden to disprove the defence beyond a reasonable
doubt.  Since all three elements are necessary for the defence to succeed, the
Crown need only disprove one element beyond a reasonable doubt.

(1)          
Lawfulness

[20]                         
First, the recorded sexual activity must be
lawful.  That is, the sexual activity cannot itself be a crime.  Consent is a
prerequisite to the lawfulness of the sexual activity.  Children under the age
of 12 cannot validly consent to sexual activity.  At the time the offences are
alleged to have been committed in this case, the circumstances under which
young persons under the age of 14 could validly consent to sexual activity were
restricted, depending upon the age of the other participants (Criminal Code ,
s. 150.1(1)  and (2) ).  A young person under the age of 14 could not consent
to sexual activity with another person unless that person was less than two
years older.  In addition, consent of young persons under 14 to sexual activity
would not apply where the other participant was in a position of trust or
authority towards them, where the relationship was one of dependency or where
the relationship was exploitative (s. 150.1(2) (c) and (3) ).  These
limits on consent had, and still have, broad application, including sexual
touching and invitation, incitement or counselling to sexual touching, as well
as other sexual offences.[1]

[21]                         
Young persons aged 14 to 17, inclusively, could
at that time validly consent to sexual activity with partners of any age. 
However, as with younger children, the sexual activity would be unlawful where
the relationship is based on exploitation, dependency, trust or authority (s. 153(1)). 
At any age, consent remains invalid if obtained by means of fraud, duress, or
abuse of authority, among other things (Criminal Code , ss. 265(3)  and
273.1 ).

[22]                         
In 2008, Parliament amended the Criminal Code 
to effectively raise the age of consent from 14 to 16 years (S.C. 2008, c. 6). 
Young persons aged 14 and 15 may now only consent to sexual activity with
another person where they are either close in age to that person or married to
that person (s. 150.1(2.1)).

[23]                         
In the context of a child pornography
prosecution, these legislative limits on minors’ consent restrict the
circumstances in which the underlying sexual activity will be lawful.  In so
doing, they restrict the circumstances in which a person charged under s. 163.1 
can rely on the private use exception as a defence.  Thus, subject to those
exceptions explicitly permitted in the Code, the consent of a person
under the age of 14 (now 16) would not be valid and the defence would not be
available.  Nor will the private use exception apply where the Crown proves
beyond a reasonable doubt that the relationship between those involved is
tainted by exploitation, dependency, or abuse of authority or of a position of
trust, as those offences are described in s. 153(1).  Of course, the exception
does not apply to any activities that are themselves offences, regardless of
consent, such as incest (s. 155 ).

[24]                         
In summary, the private use exception can never
be available as a defence to child pornography involving children under the age
of 12.  For young persons aged 12 or 13, the circumstances where the exception
may be available are defined narrowly by the Criminal Code .  Otherwise,
at the time of the alleged offences in this case, the private use exception was
only available where the young person involved in the sexual activity was
between 14 and 17 years of age, inclusively; today, this is restricted to those
aged 16 or 17 years.

(2)          
Consent to Recording

[25]                         
Second, all participants must consent to the recording
of the lawful sexual activity.  Particularly in the digital age, the recording
itself can create a risk of harm, quite separate from the underlying sexual
activity.  The consent requirement protects an individual’s privacy by
ensuring only consensual sexual expression falls within the exception to the
prohibition on making or possessing child pornography.

(3)          
Privacy

[26]                         
Third, as this Court held in Sharpe,
“[t]he recording must be kept in strict privacy by the person in possession,
and intended exclusively for private use by the creator and the persons
depicted therein” (para. 116; see also para. 118).  The moment such privacy is
breached, the recording falls outside the ambit of the private use exception. 
This ensures that cases such as R. v. L.W. (2006), 208 O.A.C. 42, where
the accused distributed consensually made images of himself and his 15-year-old
girlfriend after their relationship ended, would not fall under the private use
exception.

[27]                         
Although it does not
arise on the facts of this case, the trial judge and two interveners addressed
the question of what happens when a participant in a recording under the
private use exception demands that the recording be returned or destroyed.  The
trial judge concluded that once a recording is created, a participant retains
the ability to demand its return or destruction, on the basis that effective
control by each participant is a necessary element that must be established for
a recording to be privately held.  In his view, effective control is lost
“where the owners of private use materials are unable to demand the return of
the private use materials or their destruction” (para. 186; see also paras. 187
and 271-74).

[28]                         
The intervener the Attorney General of Ontario
argued that Sharpe implicitly requires that a child must have either
ongoing access or de facto control over the material, so as to destroy
or direct the destruction of the material in circumstances where the child
comes to regret his or her participation in its creation (factum, at paras.
20-25).  The intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association submitted that
the privacy branch “implicitly enables an owner to unilaterally demand that a
recording be destroyed” (factum, at para. 18).

[29]                         
Sharpe did not
include any reference to ongoing control, or to the right to the return or
destruction of the recording, in the exception that the Court “read in” so that
the legislation would strike an acceptable constitutional balance.  This Court
recognized an exception only for recordings of lawful sexual activity that are
“privately created” and “kept in strict privacy . . . and intended . . . for private
use by the creator and the persons depicted therein” (paras. 76 and 116). 
However, the exception relates not only to consent to the creation of the
recording, but also to the ongoing nature of the possession.  This imports
notions of privacy and control in the creation, use, and ongoing possession of
the recording.

[30]                         
It may well be that the right of a young person
who participates in the recording to demand the return or destruction of the
recording is also implicit in Sharpe’s weighing of the harm of child
pornography against the values of self-expression and self-actualization
(paras. 102-10).  In my view, the balance struck between the right of
free expression and preventing harm to children in Sharpe suggests that
young persons who participate in a sexual recording caught by the private use
exception retain the ability to ensure its return or destruction.  This understanding of the exception would provide protection for
young persons who may suffer anxiety or distress from the knowledge that
another person possesses such material and could unlawfully share it.  It would
serve to address circumstances in which the risk of harm outweighs the
expressive value of the recording, contrary to the principles articulated in Sharpe. 
However, since the question of a right to access or destruction is not relevant
on the facts of these appeals, I would not make any final pronouncement about
it.

C.           
What Is the Role of Exploitation in the Private
Use Exception?

[31]                         
In the present case, the Court of Appeal found
that Sharpe mandates an additional element to the private use exception:
the absence of factual exploitation.  With respect, this interpretation of Sharpe
is incorrect.  While alleged exploitation plays an important role in
determining whether the private use exception is an available defence to child
pornography charges, this consideration is already captured as a part of the Sharpe
analysis.  As I explain below, there is no need to add another layer of
exploitation inquiry to the existing test.

[32]                         
The Crown advanced a modified version of this
argument in oral submissions before this Court.  In its view, exploitation must
be considered directly when assessing whether there was consent to the
recording.  As I will explain, this issue may arise in another case; however,
it does not arise in this case, and the common law of consent was not fully
argued in the courts below or in written submissions to this Court.

(1)          
Exploitation Would Render the Consensual Sexual
Activity Unlawful

[33]                         
As noted above, sexual activity is unlawful in
the absence of consent.  Where an accused faces prosecution for making or
possessing child pornography, the absence of consent precludes the availability
of the private use exception as a defence.  However, even if the young person
consents to the sexual activity, it may nonetheless be unlawful in certain
circumstances.  As noted above, a child under 12 can never validly consent, and
the validity of the consent of a young person between the ages of 12 and 15,
inclusively, is now limited to those close in age or to spouses.

[34]                         
Section 153 of the Code addresses sexual
exploitation of a young person 16 or 17 years of age.  (Today, 14- and 15-year-olds
are similarly protected under s. 150.1(2.1)(a).)  At the time of the
alleged offences in this case, s. 153  covered persons between the ages of 14
and 17, inclusively.  Section 153  would thus have applied to K and D.  This section
criminalizes a broad range of sexual activities and communications arising from
certain types of relationships with young persons:

153.
(1) Every person commits an offence who is in a
position of trust or authority towards a young person, who is a person with
whom the young person is in a relationship of dependency or who is in a
relationship with a young person that is exploitative of the young person, and
who

 

(a)
for a sexual purpose, touches, directly or indirectly, with a part of the body
or with an object, any part of the body of the young person; or

 

(b)
for a sexual purpose, invites, counsels or incites a young person to touch,
directly or indirectly, with a part of the body or with an object, the body of
any person, including the body of the person who so invites, counsels or
incites and the body of the young person.

[35]                         
Thus, the private use exception will not be
available where the Crown can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual
conduct depicted (even if consensual) occurred in the course of one of the
relationships described in this provision.  Where this section is engaged, the
consent of the young person to the sexual activity cannot render it lawful.

[36]                         
Where an accused raises the private use
exception and the Crown seeks to challenge the lawfulness of the sexual
activity on the basis of exploitation, a trial judge must look beyond whether
or not consent was given and holistically examine the nature and circumstances
of the relationship between the young person and the accused.  Section 153(1.2)
provides a non-exhaustive list of indicia from which a trial judge may infer
that the relationship between the accused and a young person is exploitative:

(a)
the age of the young person;

 

(b)
the age difference between the person and the young person;

 

(c)
the evolution of the relationship; and

 

(d) the degree of control or influence by the person over the
young person.

It is not necessary that
the person accused of making or possessing child pornography be charged
separately under s. 153(1) in order for a judge to undertake this inquiry.  The
lawfulness of the sexual activity is independently assessed as part of the
defence.

(2)          
Is There a Separate and Additional Requirement That
the Judge Find the Absence of Exploitation?

[37]                         
The parties agree that exploitation must be
considered in order to determine whether or not the recorded sexual activity is
lawful.  However, throughout these proceedings the Crown argued that, in
addition to the three elements identified above, Sharpe requires a
further inquiry into whether factual exploitation occurred as a prerequisite to
the availability of the private use exception.  The trial judge rejected this
argument, finding that this Court did not mandate an additional exploitation
analysis in Sharpe.

[38]                         
At the Court of Appeal, the majority and dissent
diverged on whether or not an additional exploitation analysis is required,
with the majority concluding that the private use exception was only available
where the absence of factual exploitation or abuse is established, separately
from the inquiries into lawfulness and consent to recording.  The Court of
Appeal had based this conclusion on this Court’s statement, at para. 116 of Sharpe,
that the sexual activity “must not be unlawful, thus ensuring the consent of
all parties, and precluding the exploitation or abuse of children”.

[39]                         
To the extent they relied upon para. 116 of Sharpe
to suggest that factual exploitation is an additional requirement of the
private use exception, the Court of Appeal majority misreads Sharpe. 
The Supreme Court’s summary of the exception, at para. 128 of Sharpe, contains
no such separate requirement.  The relevant part of para. 116 reads as follows:

The second
category would protect auto-depictions, such as photographs taken by a child or
adolescent of him- or herself alone, kept in strict privacy and intended for
personal use only.  It would also extend to protect the recording of lawful
sexual activity, provided certain conditions were met.  The person possessing
the recording must have personally recorded or participated in the sexual
activity in question.  That activity must not be unlawful, thus ensuring the
consent of all parties, and precluding the exploitation or abuse of children. 
All parties must also have consented to the creation of the record.  The
recording must be kept in strict privacy by the person in possession, and
intended exclusively for private use by the creator and the persons depicted
therein.  [Emphasis added.]

[40]                         
Paragraph 116 situates exploitation firmly
within the lawfulness analysis, which is one of the three elements required for
the defence to succeed.

[41]                         
This does not mean that exploitation is not an
important part of the inquiry.  Indeed, where there are indicia of
exploitation, the Crown will likely raise these facts in order to prove, on the
basis of s. 153 , that the activity was unlawful beyond a reasonable doubt.

[42]                         
Faced with such evidence, a trial judge must be
alive to Parliament’s direction in s. 153  that consent not be taken merely at
face value where a young person is concerned.  Properly interpreted and
applied, exploitation must be determined by looking at the relationship between
the complainant and the accused, and the entire context of their interactions.

[43]                         
This does not mean that “factual exploitation”,
divorced from any of the three prongs set out in Sharpe, is a separate
part of the private use exception.  I agree with the appellants that this
proposed additional step is redundant.  It is not required by this Court’s
decision in Sharpe, nor is it required to ensure that those who exploit
young people do not benefit from the private use exception.  The inquiry into
lawfulness of the underlying sexual activity already permits a robust analysis
of exploitation.

(3)          
Is There a Requirement to Assess Exploitation in
Relation to Consent to Recording?

[44]                         
In oral submissions before this Court, the Crown
modified the position it took before the courts below.  The Crown argued that
exploitation must also be considered when determining whether or not the
complainant consented to the recording.  In other words, the court should
examine how exploitation may influence a young person’s consent to being
recorded, separately and apart from the question of consent to the underlying
sexual activity.  Although the Criminal Code  restricts consent to sexual
activity in circumstances such as incapacity, coercion and abuse of authority,
no such protections apply to the consent to record.

[45]                         
The Crown anchored this view in what it sees as
the limited scope of s. 153 , which it argues may not cover situations where no
sexual touching occurs or where the touching is not invited, counselled or
incited.  The only example the Crown could suggest was that of nude posing by a
young person aged 16 or 17, which could occur in the context of an exploitative
relationship but nonetheless fall outside the ambit of s. 153 .[2]  In the Crown’s view,
only an additional exploitation analysis with respect to consent to the recording
itself could properly capture recordings that are beyond the scope of s. 153 .

[46]                         
The concerns raised by the Crown’s example can
only arise where the subject of the recording does not involve any touching or
invitation to touching that would be caught by s. 153 .  As the Attorney General
of Ontario submitted in these proceedings, it is quite possible that s. 153 
could apply to the example of the still photos of nude posing.  The language in
s. 153  is broad and captures any invitation to sexual touching of others or oneself. 
It is not clear that there would be many instances where a still photograph is
taken by the dominant person in the context of an exploitative relationship
that did not involve any invitation to sexual touching.  In such circumstances,
consent to the sexual activity and to the act of recording will often be
intertwined, and thus captured by s. 153 .

[47]                         
This is not to say that where the recording is
concerned the young person’s consent is necessarily a simple question of yes or
no.  Should a case arise in which no underlying sexual activity exists that
could be caught by the Criminal Code ’s provisions related to sexual
exploitation, it may be that an exploitative relationship would be relevant to
the common law rules of consent in the context of consent to recording.

[48]                         
However, this is not the case to decide whether
an exploitative relationship can vitiate consent to the recording. 
Circumstances where the exploitation is not captured in the lawfulness analysis
are not likely to arise frequently ― and they do not arise in this case. 
The extent to which an exploitative relationship may vitiate consent generally
under the common law was not clearly developed in the courts below or in the
factum of the Crown.  I think it best to leave this question about the common
law principles of consent to a case with a proper record and argument.  The
implications may be far reaching.

[49]                         
In short, any exploitation in the relationship
between K and D and the appellants in this case is properly considered in the
lawfulness analysis with respect to s. 153  of the Criminal Code .

(4)          
Is Mutuality of Benefit a Prerequisite to
Availability of the Private Use Exception?

[50]                         
The Crown argues that Sharpe also
requires that there be a “mutuality of benefit” among all individuals captured
by the recording (transcript, at p. 53).  In support of this argument, the
Crown cites this Court’s discussion in Sharpe of the significance that
recordings of sexual activity may have for “adolescent self-fulfilment,
self-actualization and sexual exploration and identity” (para. 109).  In the
Crown’s view, such expressive values can only be achieved where all individuals
depicted, including any minors, actually derive a proven benefit from the
recording.  Such a requirement is characterized as a necessary bulwark against
exploitation.

[51]                         
The Alberta Court of Appeal agreed, concluding
that a “[p]rerequisite to the availability of the private use defence is
evidence that the parties intended the pornographic material for the private
use of [the complainant] as well as that of the appellant, sometimes called a
mutuality of benefit” (para. 13, citing Cockell, at para. 36).

[52]                         
I cannot accede to this interpretation of this
Court’s decision in Sharpe.  Sharpe does not refer to mutuality
of benefit as a standalone requirement for the private use exception.  Rather, Sharpe
says that the material must be “intended exclusively for private use by the
creator and the persons depicted” (para. 116).  I do not read this as
establishing “mutuality of benefit” as a requirement for the private use
exception.  It simply establishes that private use is limited to use by the
creator and the persons depicted, and nobody else.  This requirement leaves the
determination regarding possible benefits to the consenting individuals. 
Adding a “mutuality of benefit” requirement to the analysis would unnecessarily
complicate the private use exception test while providing little benefit.

[53]                         
To conclude, the private use exception
established in Sharpe is available only where (1) the sexual activity is
lawful, (2) all participants consented to the recording, and (3) the recording is
created and retained strictly for the private use of those involved.  In
determining the lawfulness of the sexual activity, the sexual activity recorded
cannot be considered in isolation.  Where the Crown seeks to rely on s. 153  to
negate the legality of the sexual activity depicted, the judge must also
determine whether it occurred in the context of an exploitative relationship. 
If so, the sexual activity is not lawful, and the private use exception does
not apply.

IV.       
Application to This Case

[54]                         
The trial judge found that the sexual activity
in this case was lawful.  In so doing, he relied on an apparent concession by
the Crown regarding lawfulness.  This concession arose in the context of the
Crown advancing an erroneous legal framework for analyzing the private use
exception, both at trial and on appeal.  Of course, a trial judge is not bound
by concessions of law if those concessions are erroneous (R. v. Pickton,
2010 SCC 32, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 198, at para. 27; R. v. Sappier, 2006 SCC
54, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 686, at paras. 62-64; M. v. H., [1999] 2 S.C.R. 3,
at para. 45).  However, while
the Crown’s position was wrong in law, the fact that exploitation was advanced
for consideration at trial (albeit as a separate
element in the Sharpe test) overcomes any prejudice to the appellants resulting from the erroneous
legal position taken by the Crown.  That is, despite
how the Crown framed the legal test in this case, it is clear the Crown took
the position that the private use exception was not available because of an
exploitative relationship between the two appellants and K and D.  In
determining whether the private use exception was available as a defence, the
trial judge was required, in these circumstances, to consider whether that
relationship was exploitative within the meaning of s. 153 .

[55]                         
Reviewing the trial judge’s findings, it is
apparent that he did not turn his mind to whether or not the broader
relationship was one of exploitation within the meaning of s. 153 .  Where the
trial judge did consider evidence that would be relevant to exploitation, he
did so in isolation, looking at the factors one at a time.  For example, he
identified the age of the complainants and the substantial difference in age
between them and the appellants, but found this was an insufficient basis for
concluding that this difference was “intrinsically exploitive or abusive”
(para. 226).  However, he did not assess this age difference in light of other
aspects of the relationship, such as the impact of the complainants’
addictions, their need for shelter, or their past and ongoing experiences with
homelessness and prostitution.  In short, he did not consider the specific
factors in light of the broader context or whether they cumulatively resulted
in an exploitative relationship.

[56]                         
The trial judge’s analysis focused primarily on
the voluntariness of particular activities, instead of on the nature of
the relationship between the parties.  While the voluntariness of sexual
activities is an important aspect of lawfulness, it does not end the inquiry. 
The trial judge was also required to holistically assess the nature and
circumstances of the relationship to determine whether the sexual activity was
rendered unlawful under s. 153 .  By failing to consider whether the underlying
relationship between the complainants and the appellants was exploitative, the
trial judge erred in law.

[57]                         
Thus, while the Court of Appeal erred in law in
its approach to the case, I am nonetheless of the view that the trial judge
erred by failing to consider whether the sexual activity was unlawful by virtue
of s. 153 of the Code. Given the trial judge’s findings of fact,
however, I am not persuaded that Mr. Barabash and Mr. Rollison would have been
found guilty but for the trial judge’s error in law (Criminal Code , s.
686(4) (b)(ii)).  I therefore would not uphold the Court of Appeal’s
decision to enter convictions.  This is especially true since the trial judge’s
legal error was induced in part by an erroneous Crown concession at trial.

[58]                         
The acquittals should be restored unless the
Crown shows that the trial judge’s legal error has a material bearing on the
acquittals (R. v. Graveline, 2006 SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, at para.
14; R. v. Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, at p. 374).  The appellants
submit that regardless of this legal error the trial judge’s factual findings
would inevitably have led him to find no exploitation in this case and that
therefore the acquittals should be restored.  With respect, I cannot agree.

[59]                         
For example, the trial
judge found that both K and D may have been under the influence of drugs and
alcohol at the time the recorded sexual activities occurred, but that they were
nevertheless aware of and consented to their nudity, the sexual activities in
which they engaged, and the recording of those activities.  He found that the
complainants were not coerced and that they did not exchange sex or nude posing
for drugs.  On the contrary, he found that they “initiate[d] and direct[ed] many
of the activities” and “willingly consented to and participated in the making
of the recordings” (para. 100).

[60]                         
The judge also accepted
that K believed she would have a better prospect of sharing drugs if she
engaged in sexual activities with Mr. Barabash and Mr. Rollison.  Indeed, he
referred to K’s testimony that while “no formal exchange arrangement existed”,
drugs would be provided and used “[w]hen she engaged in sex with Barabash and
Rollison” (para. 37).  K further indicated she may have engaged in sexual
activities with the intention of obtaining drugs.  However, the judge did not
consider the implications of this conclusion on the question of whether the
relationships between the complainants and the appellants were exploitative. 
He also did not consider whether the complainants’ willingness to participate
in sexual activities was influenced by any dependence on Mr. Barabash for shelter
or drugs.  Fundamentally, the trial judge failed to consider the extent to
which the appellants ― two older men ― may have exercised control
over two vulnerable, deeply troubled and runaway girls.

[61]                         
Thus, the trial judge’s factual findings do not
adequately establish whether the appellants were in positions of trust or
authority towards the complainants, whether the complainants were dependent
upon them, or whether the relationships were exploitative of K and D, as
required by s. 153 .

[62]                         
As a result, I am satisfied that the trial
judge’s error had a material bearing on the acquittals.  The trial judge’s
failure to properly address whether the sexual activity was lawful within the
meaning of s. 153  as part of the private use exception analysis requires a new
trial.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

                    Criminal
law — Arson
— Defences — Intoxication — Accused
relying on self-induced intoxication as excuse for
committing arson —
Self-induced intoxication short of automatism cannot be relied upon as
excuse for general intent offence — Whether arson is general or
specific intent offence —
If arson is general intent offence, whether trial judge’s classification of
arson as specific intent offence had material bearing on verdict of acquittal — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , s. 434 .

                    T
caused a fire that destroyed the contents of his ex-girlfriend’s
home. In a highly intoxicated state, he placed a pan with oil on a stove, set
the burner to high, and left the house to get a coffee. When he returned
approximately 20 minutes later, the house was on fire. T was charged with arson
contrary to s. 434  of the Criminal Code . At trial, T claimed that the
fire was an accident. The trial judge determined that s. 434  was a specific
intent offence, meaning that T could rely on self-induced intoxication as a
defence. T was acquitted. A majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the
acquittal.

                    Held: The appeal should be allowed, the acquittal set aside and a new trial ordered.

                    The
classification of an offence as one involving general
or specific intent has important consequences for the accused because the law
does not allow offenders to rely on self-induced intoxication falling short of
automatism as an excuse for general intent offences. The analysis of whether an
offence is one of general intent or specific intent must start with a
determination of the mental element of the offence. This is an exercise in
statutory interpretation and should not be turned into a factual assessment. The
next question is whether the crime is one of general or specific intent. Where
the jurisprudence has already determined the appropriate classification of the
offence in a satisfactory manner, the task is straightforward. Otherwise, there
are two main considerations — the importance of the mental element and
the social policy underlying the offence. 

                    The
importance of the mental element refers to the complexity of the thought and
reasoning processes that are required for any given offence. For general intent offences, the mental element simply
relates to the performance of the illegal act. Such crimes do
not require an intent to bring about certain consequences that are external to
the actus reus. Nor do they require actual knowledge of certain
circumstances or consequences, to the extent that such knowledge is the product
of complex thought and reasoning processes. General intent crimes involve such minimal mental acuity that it is difficult to see how
intoxication short of automatism could deprive the accused of the low level of
intent required. In contrast, specific intent
offences involve a heightened mental element. That element may take the form of an ulterior purpose
or it may entail actual knowledge of certain circumstances or consequences,
where the knowledge is the product of more complex thought and reasoning
processes. Alternatively, it may involve intent to bring about certain
consequences, if the formation of that intent involves more complex
thought and reasoning processes. Because of the more complicated thought and
reasoning processes required for specific intent crimes, one can more readily
understand how intoxication short of automatism may negate the required mental
element.

                    When
this analysis fails to yield a clear answer, one should
turn to policy considerations. In the main, the policy assessment will focus on
whether alcohol consumption is habitually associated with the crime in
question. If it is, then allowing an accused to rely on intoxication as a
defence would seem counterintuitive. But, where self-induced intoxication
rarely, if ever, plays a role in the commission of a particular crime,
preventing an accused from relying on it makes less sense from a policy
perspective. Without setting out a general rule, alcohol habitually plays a
role in crimes involving violent or unruly conduct and in crimes involving
damage to property. Although there are exceptions to this general proposition,
the prevalence of alcohol in these crimes means that there are likely to be
strong policy reasons militating against an intoxication-based defence. Other
residual policy considerations may also come into play. The presence of a
lesser included general intent offence in the main offence may be relevant. The
presence of judicial sentencing discretion may also be a factor to consider.

                    The
offence of arson in s. 434  of the Criminal Code  is
a general intent offence for which intoxication falling short of automatism is
not available as a defence. The actus reus is the damaging of property
by fire. The mental element is the intentional or reckless performance
of the illegal act. No additional knowledge or purpose is needed. No complex
thought or reasoning processes are required. It is difficult to see how intoxication short of
automatism would prevent an accused from foreseeing the risk of causing damage
to someone else’s property by fire. There is no need to
resort to policy considerations to determine the appropriate classification of
the offence. Had it been necessary to do so, the same conclusion would have
been reached. Damage to property is often associated with alcohol consumption
and it would erode the policy underlying the offence of causing damage to
property by fire if an accused could rely on self-induced intoxication as a
defence.

                    The
criminal act in s. 434  of the Criminal Code  is
the causing of damage to property. The fire is simply the mechanism by which
the damage must be caused. In assessing the issue of intent, the trier of fact
must consider all of the surrounding circumstances. The manner in which the
fire started is likely to be an important consideration. Specifically, was the
fire set accidentally, negligently, recklessly, or intentionally? However, the
determinative question is not how the fire was started. Rather, the end game
involves looking at all of the surrounding circumstances to determine whether
it can be inferred that the accused intended to damage someone else’s property
or was reckless whether damage ensued or not. 

                    In
this case, it is apparent that T’s intoxication played
a material role in the acquittal. In his reasons, the trial judge concentrated
on the cause of the fire and he stated that to resolve this issue, he must
determine whether T’s intoxication could be considered. His decision to acquit
was influenced by his erroneous belief that he could take into account T’s
state of intoxication. A new trial is required because the trial judge’s
critical findings of fact were tainted by his belief that self-induced
intoxication was relevant to the issue of intent.

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
This case requires the Court to determine
whether self-induced intoxication is a defence to a charge of arson under s.
434  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 . The charge
against the respondent, Mr. Tatton, arose out of a fire that destroyed the contents
of his ex-girlfriend’s home. The fire began after Mr. Tatton, in a highly
intoxicated state, placed a pan with oil on the stove, set the burner to
“high”, and left the house to get a coffee at a nearby Tim Hortons. When he
returned approximately 20 minutes later, the house was on fire. 

[2]                             
At trial, Mr. Tatton sought to rely on the
defence of accident based on his drunkenness to rebut the intent required for
the offence of arson. The trial judge found that he could do so, and a majority
of the Court of Appeal agreed. For reasons that follow, I am respectfully of
the view that the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal erred.
Intoxication short of automatism is not a defence to a charge of arson under s.
434  of the Criminal Code .

II.          
Background

[3]                             
In September 2010, Mr. Tatton was living in a
guest room at a home owned by his ex-girlfriend, Ms. Spencer. He and Ms.
Spencer had broken off their relationship, but Mr. Tatton remained hopeful that
they would reconcile. 

[4]                             
Mr. Tatton was an alcoholic. He had a tendency
to binge drink. There was evidence that in the past he had come home drunk,
started to cook food, and then passed out, only to awake to a house filled with
smoke. His history with alcoholism included periods of blackouts. He would
sometimes have no recollection of events that had transpired while he was under
the influence of alcohol.

[5]                             
On September 24, 2010, Ms. Spencer went to
Kingston to visit friends. Mr. Tatton was not happy about this and became
jealous and upset. He drank heavily throughout the day and evening, consuming
approximately 52 ounces of alcohol. Over the course of the evening, he left Ms.
Spencer a series of agitated voice messages on her cell phone, two of which
referred to her home being on fire. Eventually, Mr. Tatton passed out.

[6]                             
When Mr. Tatton awoke, he decided to cook some
bacon. He put some vegetable oil in a pan on the stove and set the temperature
to “high”. He then drove to a nearby Tim Hortons to get a coffee. When he
returned 15-20 minutes later, the house was on fire. Mr. Tatton called 911 from
a neighbouring house. The firefighters were able to save the home, but not its
contents. The next day, Mr. Tatton left Ms. Spencer a message apologizing for
the incident and stating that it was an accident.

[7]                             
The fire investigator determined that the source
of the fire was the vegetable oil on the stove. Mr. Tatton was arrested and
charged with arson contrary to s. 434  of the Criminal Code . That section
reads:

434. Every person who intentionally or
recklessly causes damage by fire or explosion to property that is not wholly
owned by that person is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years.

[8]                             
At trial, Mr. Tatton claimed that the fire was
an accident. When he put the oil on the stove, he thought he had set the
temperature at “low”. He did not intend or foresee the consequences that
resulted from his turning the stove on and leaving it unattended. A central
question at trial was whether Mr. Tatton had the requisite intent to commit the
offence of arson under s. 434 , and more particularly whether the court could
take his state of intoxication into account in making its assessment.  

[9]                             
The trial judge determined that s. 434  was a
specific intent offence, meaning that Mr. Tatton could rely on self-induced
intoxication as a defence. In the end, he acquitted Mr. Tatton because he was
not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Tatton intentionally or
recklessly left the stove on “high”. Given this conclusion, he could not be
satisfied that Mr. Tatton intentionally or recklessly damaged the property. A
majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario upheld Mr. Tatton’s acquittal. The
third member of the panel would have allowed the appeal and ordered a new
trial.

[10]                         
The Crown appeals to this Court as of right. It
argues that arson contrary to s. 434  is a general intent offence, meaning that
intoxication falling short of automatism cannot be considered. I agree. I
further agree that a new trial is required because the trial judge’s critical
findings of fact were tainted by his belief that self-induced intoxication was
relevant to the issue of intent. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set
aside the verdict of acquittal, and order a new trial.

III.       
Judicial History

A.          
Ontario Superior Court of Justice, No. 10-2091,
July 29, 2013 (unreported)

[11]                         
The only live issue before the trial judge was
whether Mr. Tatton had caused the fire intentionally or recklessly. If so, it
could be inferred, in the circumstances, that in setting the fire he either
intended to cause damage to the contents of the home or was reckless whether
damage ensued or not. On the other hand, if the fire started by reason of
accident or negligence, then it could not be inferred that Mr. Tatton had one
of the intents required to support a conviction under s. 434 . 

[12]                         
The trial judge found that Mr. Tatton was
heavily under the influence of alcohol at the time of the fire. Consequently,
he held that it was necessary to determine whether arson was a crime of
specific or general intent. The answer to that question would dictate whether
Mr. Tatton’s intoxication could be considered. 

[13]                         
The trial judge concluded that the
characterization of s. 434  as either an offence of general or specific intent
was fact-driven. In his view, the proper characterization depended on how the
fire started. If an accused started a fire with a match and combustible
material, the charge of arson would likely be one of general intent. However,
if the way in which the fire started was more nuanced, it could be a specific
intent offence. On the facts before him, the trial judge found that the offence
was one of specific intent, such that Mr. Tatton’s state of intoxication could
be considered. In the end, he was not “satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
[Mr. Tatton] left the setting [on the stove] on ‘high’ either intentionally or
recklessly”: A.R., vol. I, at p. 81. Accordingly, he acquitted Mr. Tatton on
the charge of arson.

B.           
Court of Appeal for Ontario, 2014 ONCA 273, 319
O.A.C. 10

[14]                         
The Court of Appeal unanimously rejected the
trial judge’s conclusion that the characterization of s. 434  as an offence of
general or specific intent was fact-driven and dependent on how the fire
started. Rather, the court determined — correctly in my view — that the
characterization of s. 434  amounted to a question of law. On that question, the
court divided.

[15]                         
Writing for the majority, Pardu J.A.
characterized arson under s. 434  as a specific intent offence. In her view, s.
434  required a voluntary act, coupled with an awareness of the more distant
consequences of that act, and a decision to proceed in the face of those
consequences. Justice Pardu noted that many ordinary household activities cause
fires; however, they do not lead inevitably to the conclusion that the person
intentionally or recklessly damaged property. Furthermore, there was no basis
to conclude that intoxication played a significant role in causing household
fires.

[16]                         
Justice Pardu also maintained that if arson were
to be characterized as a general intent offence, the mens rea for the
offence would be objective, not subjective. In her view, the words
“intentionally or recklessly” require consideration of an accused’s subjective
state of mind, to which intoxication is relevant. Consequently, she found that
s. 434  was a specific intent offence, and upheld Mr. Tatton’s acquittal.

[17]                         
In dissent, Goudge J.A. concluded that s. 434 
was a general intent offence and that intoxication short of automatism could
therefore not be considered. He held that the mens rea for s. 434  did
not extend beyond the actus reus, and that no ulterior purpose was
required. He was also of the view that arson is the type of offence that people
are apt to commit when intoxicated; therefore, there were good policy reasons
for refusing to allow an accused to raise the defence of self-induced
intoxication. 

[18]                         
Justice Goudge disagreed with the majority that
precluding reliance on intoxication transformed the mens rea inquiry
into an objective one. In his view, the inquiry does not ask if a reasonable
person would have foreseen the risk of damage to property; rather, one asks if
the particular accused, while sober, would have foreseen the risk. This
approach retained the necessary subjective component of the mens rea. It
followed that arson under s. 434  was not a specific intent offence and that the
trial judge erred in concluding otherwise. Justice Goudge held that the error
had a material bearing on the outcome. Hence, he would have ordered a new
trial.

IV.       
Issues

[19]                         
There are two issues on appeal:

Is Arson Contrary to Section 434  a General or
Specific Intent Offence?

(1)          
The Classification of General and Specific
Intent Offences

[20]                         
The classification of an offence as one
involving general or specific intent has important consequences for the
accused. The law does not allow offenders to rely on self-induced intoxication
falling short of automatism as an excuse for general intent offences: R. v.
Daviault, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 63, at p. 123; R. v. Bernard, [1988] 2
S.C.R. 833, at pp. 865 and 878-80. 

[21]                         
Although the labels “general intent” and
“specific intent” are entrenched in Canadian law, they are not particularly
helpful in describing the actual mental element required for a crime: Daviault,
at p. 123; Bernard, at p. 854 (per Dickson C.J., dissenting). The mental
element of specific intent crimes is no more “specific”, in the everyday sense
of the word, than the mental element of general intent crimes. Rather, as we
shall see, the distinction lies in the complexity of the thought and
reasoning processes that make up the mental element of a particular offence,
and the social policy underlying the offence. 

[22]                         
This Court’s decision in Daviault is the leading case on the
distinction between general and specific intent crimes. Unfortunately, it has
not resolved the confusion surrounding this issue. The general/specific intent
dichotomy continues to perplex counsel and trial courts alike. It has been
criticized as illogical and as leading to “arbitrary and inconsistent results
from court to court, offence to offence and jurisdiction to jurisdiction”: G.
Ferguson, “The Intoxication Defence: Constitutionally Impaired and in Need of
Rehabilitation” (2012), 57 S.C.L.R. (2d) 111, at p. 123. See also T.
Quigley, “Specific and General Nonsense?” (1987), 11 Dal. L.J. 75; D.
Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law: A Treatise (5th ed. 2007), at pp. 437-39;
M. Manning, Q.C., and P. Sankoff, Manning, Mewett & Sankoff: Criminal
Law (4th ed. 2009), at p. 389; S. H. Berner, “The Defense of Drunkenness —
A Reconsideration” (1971), 6 U.B.C. L. Rev. 309, at pp. 333-34.

[23]                         
The confusion surrounding the general/specific intent distinction is
part of a larger problem that has plagued the Canadian criminal law for
decades. Regrettably, the Criminal Code  often provides no clear
direction about the required mental element for a given offence. It is
therefore left to judges to attempt to divine the required mental element (also
referred to as the degree of fault). As Professor Don Stuart states in Canadian
Criminal Law, at p. vii:

Our adversary system, which requires cases to be fairly
put to impartial judges or juries, and the presumption of innocence, cannot
work with legitimacy where there is confusion as to the applicable tests on
even basic matters such as the fault requirement . . . .

[24]                         
Professor Stuart is not alone in this. He and other academics and law
reform bodies have urged that the Criminal Code  be amended to specify
the mental element and fault requirement for each crime: see, e.g., Law Reform
Commission of Canada, Report on Recodifying Criminal Law (1987), at pp.
17 and 21-25; Canadian Bar Association’s Criminal Recodification Task Force, Principles
of Criminal Liability: Proposals for a New General Part of the Criminal Code
of Canada (1992), at pp. 41-49; D. Stuart, “A Case for a General Part”,
in D. Stuart, R. J. Delisle and A. Manson, eds., Towards a Clear and Just
Criminal Law: A Criminal Reports Forum (1999), 95, at pp. 110-13. 

[25]                         
The shortcoming identified by Professor Stuart and other scholars is the
source of the difficulty in determining whether an offence is one of general or
specific intent. Legislative intervention is sorely needed to spell out the
mental element of offences and to specify when intoxication short of automatism
can be considered. However, until that day comes we are left with the existing
regime. Therefore, before turning to the proper classification of the offence
in s. 434  of the Criminal Code , I propose to review the analysis in Daviault
in the hope of shedding a bit more light on the general/specific intent
distinction.

(a)          
The Decision in R. v. Daviault

[26]                         
In Daviault, this Court examined whether an accused who is in a
state of extreme intoxication, akin to automatism, may rely on drunkenness as a
defence to a general intent crime. In analysing this issue, the distinction
between general and specific intent offences was discussed at some length by
Sopinka J. (dissenting, but not on this point). He held that two factors help
distinguish crimes of general intent from those of specific intent: first,
“[t]he nature of the mental element and its relative importance” and second,
“the social policy sought to be attained by criminalizing the particular
conduct”: p. 122. 

[27]                         
Justice Sopinka specified that general intent crimes involve “the
minimal intent to do the act which constitutes the actus reus”: Daviault,
at p. 123. Because such crimes involve minimal thought and reasoning processes,
even a high degree of intoxication short of automatism is unlikely to deprive
the accused of the slight degree of mental acuity required to commit them (ibid.).
In his view, this feature alone provided a sound policy basis for precluding
reliance on the defence of intoxication (ibid.). Bearing in mind the
common sense inference that a person intends the natural consequences of his or
her actions, one can typically infer intent from the performance of the act. It
is therefore logical that for crimes involving a minimal mental element, intoxication
short of automatism will have no role to play. Moreover, as Sopinka J.
observed, general intent crimes tend to be “offences that persons who are drunk
are apt to commit” (ibid.). It followed, in his view, that allowing
intoxication to operate as a defence would contradict the social policy
underlying these crimes.

[28]                         
In contrast, Sopinka J. held that specific intent crimes require a
heightened mental element. For example, they often require “the formation of
further ulterior motives and purposes”: Daviault, at p. 123, citing Bernard,
at p. 880, per McIntyre J. Because such crimes require more complicated thought
and reasoning processes, one can readily understand how intoxication short of
automatism may negate the required mental element. As such, specific intent
offences are less likely to be the type of offences that intoxicated people are
apt to commit. For that reason, policy considerations that might otherwise
militate against a defence of intoxication are less pressing. 

[29]                         
Justice Sopinka noted another policy reason for permitting the defence
of intoxication in respect of specific intent offences, namely, specific intent
offences often include lesser offences that only require general intent. In
such cases, an intoxicated offender will not escape punishment altogether: Daviault,
at p. 124. 

(b)          
The Appropriate Approach to Classifying Specific and General
Intent Offences

[30]                         
The analysis of whether an offence is one of specific or general
intent must start with a determination of the mental element of the offence in
question. This is an exercise in statutory interpretation.  Care should be
taken not to turn it into a factual assessment based on the circumstances of
the particular case. 

[31]                         
After the mental element of the provision has
been determined, the next question is whether the crime is one of general or
specific intent. The distinction between general and specific intent offences
is not a precise science. Logic, intuition, and policy all play a part. The
task has proved formidable to those who have been schooled in criminal law, and
daunting to those who have not.

[32]                         
Be that as it may, the place to begin in
determining the appropriate classification of the offence is to look to
existing jurisprudence. Where the jurisprudence has already determined the
appropriate classification of the offence in a satisfactory manner, the task is
straightforward. For example, this Court has established that sexual assault is
a general intent offence, whereas robbery and murder are specific intent
offences: see Leary v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 29, and R.
v. Chase, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 293 (sexual assault); R. v. George, [1960]
S.C.R. 871 (robbery); and R. v. Cooper, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 146 (murder).
For these offences and for others that have been
satisfactorily addressed by existing jurisprudence, there is no need to examine
the question again. The framework that follows is meant to clarify, not change
the law as set out in Daviault. However, if the jurisprudence is
unclear, courts must examine the factors outlined in Daviault, as
clarified below, to resolve the question. 

[33]                         
While Daviault made clear that there are
two main considerations when determining if intoxication short of automatism
can be considered — the “importance” of the mental element, and the
social policy underlying the offence — it left certain
questions unanswered. First, it provided no clear explanation of what is meant
by the “importance” of the mental element. Second, it did not specify whether
policy considerations should always play a role in the analysis or whether they
should only come into play if an examination of the mental element left unclear
how the offence should be characterized. I turn to these questions in the hope
of bringing some added clarity to an area of the law that continues to perplex
and confound.

(i)           
The “Importance” of the Mental Element

[34]                         
Daviault specified that the nature of the mental element and its
“relative importance” form the basis for the analysis. Although Sopinka J. did
not explain what he meant by the “importance” of the mental element, it is clear
that he was referring to the complexity of the thought and reasoning processes
that make up the mental element of a particular offence. The thought and
reasoning processes for general intent crimes are relatively straightforward.
In contrast, specific intent crimes — those crimes with a more “important”
mental element — require a more sophisticated reasoning process. 

[35]                         
For general intent crimes, the mental element simply relates to the
performance of an illegal act. Such crimes do not require an intent to bring
about certain consequences that are external to the actus reus: Bernard,
at p. 863; George, at p. 877 (per Fauteux J.). Assault is a
classic example. The accused must intentionally apply force; however, there is
no requirement that he intend to cause injury. Likewise, crimes of general
intent do not require actual knowledge of certain circumstances or
consequences, to the extent that such knowledge is the product of complex
thought and reasoning processes. In each instance, the mental element is straightforward
and requires little mental acuity. 

[36]                         
To be clear, when I refer to a mental element that is “straightforward”
and involving “little mental acuity”, I am not creating a new legal standard
for general intent offences. Rather, I am using these phrases synonymously with
the descriptors used in Daviault: “minimal intent” and “minimal degree
of consciousness”: p. 123.

[37]                         
In contrast, specific intent offences involve a heightened mental
element. In Daviault, Sopinka J. limited his discussion of specific
intent offences to crimes involving an ulterior purpose. For such crimes, the
accused must not only intend to do the act that constitutes the actus reus,
he must also act with an ulterior purpose in mind: Manning and Sankoff, at p.
386. For example, assault with intent to resist arrest is an offence containing
an ulterior purpose. The accused must not only commit the assault, he must also
act with the ulterior purpose of resisting arrest. It is irrelevant whether he
actually succeeds in resisting arrest; the offence simply requires that he act
with that purpose in mind.

[38]                         
Although Sopinka J. restricted his discussion of specific intent
offences to crimes involving an ulterior purpose, it would be a mistake to assume
that an ulterior purpose is always required. To the contrary, a heightened
mental element could take the form of a requirement that the accused intend and
bring about certain consequences, if the formation of that intent involves more
complex thought and reasoning processes. Murder provides a classic example.
Equally, a heightened mental element could take the form of a requirement that
the accused have actual knowledge of certain circumstances or consequences,
where the knowledge is the product of more complex thought and reasoning
processes: see, e.g., M. T. Thornton, “Making Sense of Majewski” (1981),
23 Crim. L.Q. 464, at p. 482. Possession of stolen property is one such
crime. The accused must actually know or be willfully blind to the fact that
the goods he or she possesses are stolen. Although this offence contains no
ulterior purpose, the knowledge component renders the mental element more
acute. Intoxication is therefore available as a defence for such crimes.

[39]                         
To summarize, specific intent
offences contain a heightened mental element. That element may take the form of
an ulterior purpose or it may entail actual knowledge of certain circumstances
or consequences, where the knowledge is the product of more complex thought and
reasoning processes. Alternatively, it may involve intent to bring about
certain consequences, if the formation of that intent involves more
complex thought and reasoning processes. General intent offences, on the other hand, require very little mental
acuity. 

(ii)         
The Role of Policy

[40]                         
The second question that Daviault left
unanswered is the stage at which policy ought to be considered. Confusion
remains about whether policy should be considered in every case or whether it
should only come into play if an examination of the mental element leaves it
unclear how the offence should be characterized. 

[41]                         
In my view, the most logical approach is to
first examine the nature of the mental element. Only when this analysis fails
to yield a clear answer should one turn to policy considerations. As Daviault
explains, policy considerations are closely tied to the nature of the
mental element. General intent crimes involve such minimal mental acuity that
it is difficult to see how intoxication short of automatism could deprive the
accused of the low level of intent required. This provides a strong policy
reason for precluding reliance on intoxication for these offences: Daviault,
at p. 123. It also explains why it is constitutionally permissible to render
the intoxication defence unavailable for general intent offences: ibid.,
at pp. 99-100. In contrast, one can more readily understand how the more
complex thought and reasoning processes required for specific intent crimes may
be negated by an accused’s intoxication. For that reason, policy suggests that
intoxication can be considered for specific intent crimes. The nature of the
mental element is already intertwined with policy considerations. Thus, if an
examination of the mental element clearly indicates how the offence should be
characterized, there is little reason to resort to policy considerations.  

[42]                         
However, if an examination of the mental element
does not provide a clear answer, policy considerations may help resolve the
question. In the main, the policy assessment will focus on whether alcohol
consumption is habitually associated with the crime in question. If it is, then
allowing an accused to rely on intoxication as a defence would seem
counterintuitive. For example, intoxication is often associated with the crime
of sexual assault. Allowing self-induced intoxication to provide an accused
with a defence would be to endorse, if not promote, the very behaviour that has
historically proved to be a root cause of the problem.[1] And while the law and
common sense may not always coincide, we should not be looking for ways to send
them scurrying in opposite directions. By the same token, where self-induced
intoxication rarely, if ever, plays a role in the commission of a particular
crime, preventing an accused from relying on it makes less sense from a policy
perspective.

[43]                         
As a general observation, and without setting
out a general rule, alcohol habitually plays a role in crimes involving violent
or unruly conduct: Bernard, at p. 880. It also tends to be prevalent in
crimes involving damage to property. As such, it makes little sense from a
policy perspective that it should provide a defence for crimes in which people
or property are harmed or endangered: Daviault, at p. 123. Of course,
there are well-established exceptions to this general proposition. Murder, for
example, has long been considered a crime of specific intent for which the
defence of intoxication is available. As Daviault explains, at p. 124,
this is a function of the heightened thought and reasoning processes required,
the gravity of the offence, the serious fixed punishment upon conviction, and
the availability of the lesser included offence of manslaughter. It is
therefore incorrect to state that intoxication may never be considered in
crimes involving violence against people or damage to property. However, given
the prevalence of alcohol in these crimes, there are likely to be strong policy
reasons militating against an intoxication-based defence.

[44]                         
Although the main focus of the policy
inquiry will be on whether alcohol is habitually associated with the crime in
question, there are other residual policy considerations that may also come
into play. As noted in Daviault, the presence of a lesser included
general intent offence in the main offence may be relevant. In such cases, an
accused who successfully relies on intoxication to negate the heightened mental
element of the main offence can still be convicted of the lesser included
offence. Drunkenness will provide no defence to the lesser offence. For
example, an accused who successfully raises intoxication as a defence to a
charge of assault with intent to resist arrest may still be convicted of the
lesser included offence of assault. In these situations, the intoxicated
offender will not escape punishment altogether. Consequently, there is less
impetus to preclude the accused from advancing intoxication as a defence to the
main offence.

[45]                         
In addition, the presence of judicial sentencing discretion may
be a factor to consider. If the crime is one for which the accused will receive
a heavy minimum sentence upon conviction, it may be unduly harsh to preclude
consideration of intoxication. However, if the judge has discretion to tailor
the sentence to the facts of the case and to consider the accused’s
intoxication as part of that assessment, precluding the accused from advancing
a defence of intoxication is less worrisome: Daviault, at p. 124.

(2)          
The Application of the Legal Framework to the
Section 434  Offence

[46]                         
The crime of arson has existed for many years,
and the Criminal Code  provisions have gone through many iterations. Over
the years, courts have been divided on whether the offence of arson in s. 434 
(and its predecessors) is a crime of general or specific intent: see, e.g., R.
v. Swanson (1989), 48 C.C.C. (3d) 316 (Y.T.C.A.) (specific intent); R. v.
Hudson (1993), 88 Man. R. (2d) 150 (C.A.) (specific intent); and R. v.
Muma (1989), 51 C.C.C. (3d) 85 (Ont. C.A.) (general intent), relying on R.
v. Schmidtke (1985), 19 C.C.C. (3d) 390 (Ont. C.A.).

[47]                         
Applying the framework outlined above to the
offence of arson in s. 434 , I am satisfied that s. 434  is a general intent
offence for which intoxication falling short of automatism is not available as
a defence. For convenience, I repeat the provision:

434. Every person who intentionally or recklessly causes damage by fire
or explosion to property that is not wholly owned by that person is guilty of
an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding
fourteen years.

[48]                         
The actus reus is the damaging of
property by fire. The mental element is the intentional or reckless
performance of the illegal act — the causing of damage to property. No
additional knowledge or purpose is needed. No complex thought or reasoning
processes are required. On its face, the level of intent required for the offence
would appear to be minimal. 

[49]                         
A majority of the Court of Appeal was concerned
that if s. 434  were found to be a general intent offence, so as to preclude
consideration of intoxication short of automatism, that would improperly
transform the examination of recklessness into an objective inquiry. With
respect, I cannot agree. Recklessness describes the act of one who sees
the risk and acts without regard for the consequences: Sansregret v. The
Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 570, at p. 582. It always involves a subjective
inquiry — and this case is no exception. However, the
offence of arson under s. 434  does not involve sophisticated reasoning. The risk of damage by fire is typically obvious, even when it
involves a chain of events and not the simple application of a match to the
property in question.

[50]                         
I have difficulty
seeing how intoxication short of automatism would prevent an accused from
foreseeing the risk of causing damage to someone else’s property by fire.
Complex reasoning is not required to recognize the danger. Thus, preventing an
accused from advancing the defence of intoxication does not transform
recklessness into an objective inquiry. Rather, it recognizes the fact that
intoxication short of automatism will not deprive an accused of the minimal
intent required for this crime. 

[51]                         
In view of this conclusion, there is no need to
resort to policy considerations to determine the availability of the defence of
intoxication. However, had I found it necessary to do so, I would have reached
the same conclusion. 

[52]                         
Section 434  involves damage to property. Damage
to property is often associated with alcohol consumption. The present case is
no exception. In my view, it would erode the policy underlying the offence of
causing damage to property by fire if an accused could rely on self-induced
intoxication as a defence.

[53]                         
For these reasons, I am respectfully of the view
that the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in
characterizing s. 434  as a specific intent offence for which the defence of
intoxication could be raised. Properly classified, s. 434  is a general intent
offence, meaning that intoxication short of automatism may not be considered.

(3)          
Analysing Intent Under Section 434 of the Criminal
Code 

[54]                         
Leaving aside the question of intoxication,
ascertaining whether the intent required under s. 434  has been made out in a
particular case can be a tricky exercise. As the trial judge and the majority
of the Court of Appeal noted, there is a wide range of factual scenarios that
may arise under s. 434  of the Criminal Code . Some cases may involve an
accused who has set fire directly to the property in issue. Others, like this
one, may involve an accused who has caused some object to catch fire, which in
turn leads to damage to property. In the former, there is typically a
ready-made inference that the accused intentionally or recklessly caused damage
by fire. In the latter, such an inference may not be so obvious, and the
assessment of intent can be obtuse. Without setting out a legal framework, I
offer some suggestions that triers of fact may find helpful in deciding whether
the requisite intent has been established. 

[55]                         
To begin, it must be remembered that the
criminal act in s. 434  is not the setting of a fire. The conduct that has been
criminalized is the causing of damage to property. The fire is simply the
mechanism by which the damage must be caused. This distinction is crucial to
the analysis.

[56]                         
In assessing the issue of intent, the trier of
fact must of course consider all of the surrounding circumstances. How the fire
started is likely to be an important consideration. Specifically, was the fire
set accidentally, negligently, recklessly, or intentionally? The answer to this
question will not be dispositive since, as I have explained, the act of setting
a fire is not the conduct that has been criminalized under s. 434 . Nonetheless,
it will provide important context for the intent analysis.

[57]                         
Deciding how the fire started is only one of the
factors a trier of fact may wish to consider. The end game involves looking at
all of the surrounding circumstances to determine whether it can be inferred
that the accused intended to cause damage to someone else’s property or was
reckless whether damage ensued or not. The mere fact that the fire was set
intentionally or recklessly may not be enough to establish that the accused
intentionally or recklessly caused damage to the property. Context is important
and will play a key role in determining whether such an inference can be drawn.
Consider, for instance, a homeowner who has started a controlled fire in an
outdoor fire pit. If a gust of wind picks up some burning leaves from the fire
pit and blows them onto a neighbour’s shed 20 metres away, it does not follow
that he intentionally or recklessly damaged the shed. Notwithstanding his intentional
setting of the original fire — namely, the fire in the fire pit — the
surrounding circumstances may show that he did not intentionally or recklessly
cause damage to the shed: see, e.g., R. v. S.D.D., 2002 NFCA 18, 211
Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 157.

[58]                         
In contrast, there are many situations in which
an accused has intentionally or recklessly started a fire and the surrounding
circumstances make it clear that he or she intended to cause damage to property
or was reckless whether damage ensued. Take, for instance, a person who has
deliberately set fire to a towel. If that person were to drop the towel on the
carpet and walk away without making any effort to extinguish the fire, it may
be inferred that he or she intended to cause damage to property or was reckless
whether damage ensued. 

[59]                         
In summary, the determinative question is not
how the fire was started, although the answer to that question may provide
important context. An accused’s guilt under s. 434  hinges on whether he or she
intentionally or recklessly caused damage to the property in question. So long
as the trier of fact keeps this important distinction in mind and examines the
relevant context and surrounding circumstances, the analysis of intent under s.
434  should be relatively straightforward.

B.           
Did the Trial Judge’s Error Have a Material
Bearing on the Acquittal?

[60]                         
Although I have concluded that the trial judge
erred in finding that he could consider Mr. Tatton’s state of intoxication,
this does not fully dispose of the appeal. To obtain a new trial, the Crown
must demonstrate that the error might reasonably have had a material bearing on
the acquittal. The Crown has a heavy onus. As this Court explained in R. v.
Graveline, 2006 SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, at para. 14: 

It has been
long established, however, that an appeal by the Attorney General cannot
succeed on an abstract or purely hypothetical possibility that the accused
would have been convicted but for the error of law. Something more must be
shown. It is the duty of the Crown in order to obtain a new trial to satisfy
the appellate court that the error (or errors) of the trial judge might
reasonably be thought, in the concrete reality of the case at hand, to have had
a material bearing on the acquittal. The Attorney General is not required, however,
to persuade us that the verdict would necessarily have been different.

[61]                         
Mr. Tatton submits that the trial judge based
the acquittal on the defence of accident and that intoxication had no bearing
on the analysis. He therefore argues that the trial judge’s error cannot
reasonably be thought to have affected the verdict. The Crown, on the other
hand, argues that the trial judge’s reasons make it clear that he considered
Mr. Tatton’s intoxication in arriving at the verdict.

[62]                         
I accept the Crown’s submission. In my view,
when the trial judge’s reasons are read in their entirety, it is apparent that
Mr. Tatton’s intoxication played a material role in the outcome. 

[63]                         
In his reasons, the trial judge concentrated on
the cause of the fire. In particular, the question he posed was whether he
could be satisfied that Mr. Tatton intentionally or recklessly started the fire
in the frying pan. At the outset of his analysis, the trial judge stated that
to resolve this issue, he must determine whether Mr. Tatton’s intoxication
could be considered. The trial judge’s reasons focus almost exclusively on this
issue. If, as Mr. Tatton argues, the trial judge concluded that the fire was
accidental — separate and apart from any role alcohol may have played — all of
this analysis was unnecessary. In my view, it defies logic and common sense to
suggest that the trial judge’s decision to acquit was not influenced by his
erroneous belief that he could take into account Mr. Tatton’s state of
intoxication. 

[64]                         
The trial judge’s concluding remarks bear this
out. In finding that he was left in a state of reasonable doubt, the trial
judge stated that one of the questions troubling him was whether Mr. Tatton was
“mentally able to carry out such a plan, in view of his drunken condition”:
A.R., vol. I, at p. 81. Plainly, Mr. Tatton’s inebriation was at the forefront
of the trial judge’s mind. Although the trial judge noted Mr. Tatton’s position
that the fire was accidental, he did not explicitly make a finding of accident.
Rather, he stated that he was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.
Tatton had acted intentionally or recklessly. While it is arguable that the
trial judge based this conclusion on the defence of accident, the clear
implication from his reasons is that it was Mr. Tatton’s state of intoxication
that left him in a state of reasonable doubt as to whether Mr. Tatton acted
with the requisite intent. That being so, I am satisfied that the test in Graveline
has been met.

[1] The Criminal Code  now explicitly states that an

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario 

                    Criminal law — Murder — Charge to jury —
Evidence — Post‑offence conduct — After killing victim, accused concealed
body and cleaned up scene of death — Accused fled from and lied to police —
Trial judge instructed jury on use of accused’s post‑offence conduct in
assessing issue of intent for murder — Whether trial judge erred in
instructions to jury on concealment and clean‑up, and if so, whether that
error was fatal in conjunction with erroneous instructions on accused’s flight
from and lies to police — Detrimental impact of long and complex jury charges
on criminal justice system.

                    R
was charged with first degree murder in connection with the death of Y. At
trial, there was no dispute that R caused Y’s death. R’s primary defence was
self‑defence, but he also relied on lack of intent, provocation, and an
absence of evidence establishing first degree murder. He testified that after
he and Y engaged in consensual sexual activity, a heated exchange occurred and
she attacked him with a knife. A physical struggle ensued, culminating in Y’s
death. R maintained that he did not intend to kill or seriously injure Y.
Rather, he testified that he used only moderate force, and that her death was
accidental. To rebut R’s position on the amount of force used and the
issue of intent, Crown counsel relied on forensic analysis of Y’s injuries and
of bloodstains found at R’s home, as well as on evidence of R’s post‑offence
efforts to conceal Y’s body and to clean up the scene of her death. The Crown
also led evidence that R fled from the police, and initially lied to them about
who was responsible for Y’s death.

                    R
was convicted by a jury of second degree murder. On appeal from his conviction,
R maintained that the trial judge failed to properly instruct the jury on the
various ways in which R’s post‑offence conduct could and could not be
used. A majority of the Court of Appeal agreed and ordered a new trial on a
charge of second degree murder.

                    Held:
The appeal should be dismissed.

                    The
Crown concedes that the trial judge erred by instructing the jury that it could
consider R’s flight from and lies to the police on the issue of intent. This
appeal centres on the instructions related to the remaining post‑offence
conduct: R’s concealment of Y’s body, and his clean‑up of the scene of
her death. 

                    In
order to establish that R was guilty of murder, rather than manslaughter, the
Crown had to prove that he either intended to kill Y or to cause her bodily
harm which he knew was likely to cause death. The cornerstone of its case was
the nature and extent of Y’s injuries and the degree of force required to
inflict them. The Crown asserted that the forensic evidence revealed a more
prolonged and violent physical altercation than the version of events described
by R.

                    It
is relatively straightforward to understand how R’s efforts at concealment and
clean‑up were capable of supporting the inference that he acted
unlawfully. However, these efforts were also capable of supporting the further
inference that R sought to conceal Y’s body and clean up the scene of her death
in order to conceal the nature and extent of her injuries and the degree of
force required to inflict them. This in turn could have been relevant on the
issue of intent for murder: the more severe the injuries, and the more force
required to inflict them, the stronger the inference that he intended to kill,
or to cause bodily harm which he knew was likely to cause death.

                    This chain of
inferential reasoning was narrow, and the relevance of the evidence was
attenuated. The trial judge should have assisted the jury with a specific
instruction on how to use this evidence on the issue of intent. However, the
sections of the jury charge relating to intent failed to link the concealment
and clean‑up evidence to the nature and extent of Y’s injuries and the
force required to inflict them. Rather, the charge merely reiterated the
existence of this evidence, and instructed the jury to consider it along with
all the other evidence. This was a legal error that created a risk that the
jury might convict R for murder based only on the broader inference that the
concealment and clean‑up pointed to a consciousness of guilt and a desire
to prevent discovery of an unlawful killing.

                    After
the jury rejected self‑defence, the issue of R’s intent was the central
issue at trial. Moreover, the Crown’s case was not overwhelming. As a
result, the curative proviso does not apply and R is entitled to a new trial
for second degree murder. 

                    Both
the Crown and the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal expressed concern
that requiring a more specific instruction on the concealment and clean‑up
evidence would further fuel the trend towards lengthier and more complex jury
charges. While these concerns are valid, a few modest alterations would have
saved this jury charge from legal error. At the same time, a great many of the
instructions that were included could and should have been removed. The length,
repetitiveness, and complexity of the charge were unwarranted. 

                    A
trial judge must strike a crucial balance by crafting a jury charge that is
both comprehensive and comprehensible. Over‑charging is just as
incompatible with this duty as is under‑charging. Trial judges have taken
to quoting large extracts from model charge manuals to safeguard their verdicts
from appeal. But model charge manuals do not necessarily translate into
model charges. They are there to guide, not govern. The failure to isolate the
critical issues in a case and tailor the charge to them inevitably makes the
instructions less helpful to the jury. The fundamental purpose of the jury
charge must be to educate, not complicate.

                    The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

                    Moldaver J. — 

I.             
Overview

[1]                             
Jason Rodgerson was charged with first degree
murder in connection with the death of Amber Young. He was tried by a court
composed of judge and jury, and convicted of second degree murder.

[2]                             
At trial, there was no dispute that Mr.
Rodgerson caused Ms. Young’s death. Rather, his primary defence was that he was
acting in lawful self-defence when he killed her. Secondarily, he relied on the
defences of lack of intent and provocation to reduce the charge of murder to
manslaughter. Finally, he maintained that the crime of first degree murder was
not made out on the evidence.

[3]                             
In the context of his self-defence claim, Mr.
Rodgerson conceded that he was applying force to Ms. Young at the time of her
death. He maintained, however, that the force in question was moderate and designed
solely to protect himself from death or grievous bodily harm. In using the
force he did, it was not his intention to kill or seriously injure Ms. Young.
The fact that she died from the force used was purely accidental. 

[4]                             
The Crown sought to rebut Mr. Rodgerson’s
position that the force he used was moderate and not designed to kill or
seriously injure Ms. Young. To that end, Crown counsel relied in part on
certain aspects of Mr. Rodgerson’s post-offence conduct — namely, his efforts
to conceal her body in the backyard of his home and to clean up the scene of
her death.

[5]                             
The Crown also led other post-offence conduct at
trial. Specifically, the Crown adduced evidence that Mr. Rodgerson fled from
the police when they came to search his home, and that he initially lied to the
police about who was responsible for Ms. Young’s death. The parties acknowledge
that this body of evidence had no bearing on the issue of Mr. Rodgerson’s
intent.

[6]                             
At trial, Mr. Rodgerson argued that the evidence
of concealment and clean-up also had no bearing on the issue of his intent. The
trial judge disagreed. However, in his charge to the jury, the trial judge did
not explain the limited and somewhat nuanced basis upon which the evidence of
concealment and clean-up could be used to establish the requisite intent for
murder. Nor did he direct the jury that the other post-offence conduct — Mr.
Rodgerson’s flight from the police and his attempt to mislead them — could not
be used to establish intent. Rather than limiting the use of this evidence, as
he should have, to negating the defence of self-defence and establishing that
Ms. Young died as a result of an unlawful act, the trial judge also left it to
the jury to consider in deciding the issue of intent. By its verdict, the jury
obviously concluded that Mr. Rodgerson had the requisite intent for murder.

[7]                             
On appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal from
his conviction, Mr. Rodgerson raised several grounds of appeal relating to the
jury charge. Among them, he challenged the trial judge’s failure to properly
instruct the jury on the various ways in which Mr. Rodgerson’s post-offence
conduct could be used, and the ways in which it could not be used.

[8]                             
A majority of the Court of Appeal, per Doherty
J.A., concluded that (1) evidence of Mr. Rodgerson’s flight from and lies to
the police was irrelevant to determining whether he had the requisite intent
for murder; (2) the trial judge erred by instructing the jury that it could
consider evidence of his flight from and lies to the police in assessing the issue
of intent; (3) evidence of Mr. Rodgerson’s concealment and clean-up was
relevant to assessing the issue of intent, but the trial judge failed to
instruct the jury on the limited way in which this evidence could be used for
that purpose; and (4) the curative proviso, Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C-46 , s. 686(1) (b)(iii), did not apply (2014 ONCA 366, 319 O.A.C.
254). As a result, the majority ordered a new trial.

[9]                             
Writing in dissent, MacPherson J.A. agreed with
the majority that the trial judge erred in his instructions on the use of Mr.
Rodgerson’s flight from and lies to the police. Standing alone, he considered
this error to be minor. As regards the concealment and clean-up evidence, he
disagreed with the majority that a more specific instruction was necessary. In
his view, the trial judge’s general cautionary instruction about the dangers
associated with evidence of post-offence conduct was sufficient. Finding only
one minor error in the jury charge, he would have applied the curative proviso
and dismissed the appeal.

[10]                         
The sole issue before this Court is whether the
majority was correct in holding that the trial judge erred in his instructions
on the concealment and clean-up, and if so, whether that error — in conjunction
with the erroneous instructions on Mr. Rodgerson’s flight from and lies to the
police — was fatal.  I conclude that the majority was correct on both counts,
and I would affirm the order for a new trial. Before addressing these issues,
however, it is necessary to review the circumstances of Ms. Young’s death and
to summarize the pertinent evidence presented at Mr. Rodgerson’s trial.

II.          
Factual Background

A.          
Ms. Young’s Death

[11]                         
On October 26, 2008, Mr. Rodgerson and Ms. Young
met for the first time in a bar in Oshawa, Ontario. Both had been drinking
earlier in the day, and Ms. Young had also taken various prescription
medications. They talked and drank together at the bar, and Ms. Young gave Mr.
Rodgerson an ecstasy tablet. She told him it was worth five dollars. After
leaving the bar, Ms. Young accompanied Mr. Rodgerson to his home. While in the
living room, Ms. Young repeatedly asked Mr. Rodgerson about the five dollars
she was owed.

[12]                         
Mr. Rodgerson was the sole witness to Ms.
Young’s death. At trial, he testified that he and Ms. Young engaged in consensual
sexual activity, first in the living room and then in his bedroom. According to
Mr. Rodgerson, shortly after moving to the bedroom, he lost interest in Ms.
Young and he suggested that they return to the bar. Ms. Young asked Mr.
Rodgerson again about the money she was owed, to which he replied, “What are
you? Some sort of whore?” Mr. Rodgerson testified that, in response, Ms. Young
attacked him with a knife, and they engaged in a physical struggle. This
struggle culminated in him pressing down on her face with his forearm until she
appeared to pass out. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Rodgerson also passed out. He
claimed that he did not know that Ms. Young was dead until he awoke the next
day.

B.           
Mr. Rodgerson’s Post-Offence Conduct

[13]                         
Mr. Rodgerson made extensive efforts to conceal
Ms. Young’s body and clean up the scene of her death. He purchased bleach,
rubber gloves, and garbage bags, and dug a shallow grave in the backyard of the
house. He then dragged Ms. Young’s body from the bedroom to the backyard. He removed
her clothing and jewellery, placed her body in the grave, poured bleach into
the hole and filled it up with dirt. He then returned to the house and removed
his bloodstained mattress from the bedroom. He cut up the bloodstained carpet
and placed it in garbage bags, along with Ms. Young’s shoes and remnants of
their sexual activity. He also broke Ms. Young’s cellphone and removed the
battery. Finally, he used bleach to clean up the blood, and other remnants of
their sexual activity and physical altercation, located on the living room
carpet, the kitchen floor, and the bedroom walls.

[14]                         
Several days after Ms. Young’s death, on October
29, police officers executed a search warrant at Mr. Rodgerson’s home. When the
police arrived, Mr. Rodgerson attempted to flee, but he was quickly caught and
arrested near the front steps of his home. During his initial police interview,
he made various false statements in which he attempted to deflect blame from
himself by suggesting that someone else had killed Ms. Young. 

C.           
Forensic Evidence

[15]                         
At trial, the Crown relied on the testimony of
two key expert witnesses: Dr. Michael Pollanen, the forensic pathologist who
conducted Ms. Young’s autopsy, and David Sibley, a forensic analyst who
conducted a bloodstain pattern analysis at Mr. Rodgerson’s home. The Crown also
put forward the testimony of Dr. Marie Elliot, a forensic toxicologist who
analysed the drug and alcohol content of Ms. Young’s blood.

[16]                         
Dr. Pollanen described the injuries he found on
Ms. Young’s head and face, including bruising, abrasions, and cuts on the
inside of her lips. While he could not ascertain a conclusive cause of death,
he testified that the types of injuries he observed were consistent with death
by smothering. Mr. Sibley described the results of his bloodstain pattern
analysis, which shed light on the nature of the physical altercation between
Mr. Rodgerson and Ms. Young, as well as on Mr. Rodgerson’s efforts to clean up
the scene after her death. 

III.       
Analysis

A.          
The Relevance of the
Post-Offence Concealment and Clean-Up in Determining Mr. Rodgerson’s Intent

[17]                         
The Crown concedes that the trial judge erred by
instructing the jury that it could consider Mr. Rodgerson’s flight from and
lies to the police on the issue of intent (A.F., at para. 5). It is the
remaining post-offence conduct — Mr. Rodgerson’s concealment of Ms. Young’s
body, and his clean-up of the scene of her death — which is at the heart of
this appeal. 

[18]                         
The Court of Appeal unanimously rejected Mr.
Rodgerson’s assertion that the concealment and clean-up evidence was irrelevant
to establishing the requisite intent for murder. The Court of Appeal was split,
however, on whether the trial judge provided sufficient direction to the jury
on how it could use that evidence in assessing the issue of intent.
Before determining whether the majority was correct to find that the lack of
instruction constituted a legal error, it is first necessary to clarify, as a
preliminary matter, precisely how the post-offence concealment and clean-up
evidence is probative on the issue of Mr. Rodgerson’s intent.

[19]                         
In order to establish that Mr. Rodgerson was
guilty of murder, rather than manslaughter, the Crown had to prove that he
either intended to kill Ms. Young, or he intended to cause her bodily harm
which he knew was likely to cause death. In this regard, the cornerstone of the
Crown’s case was the nature and extent of the injuries suffered by Ms. Young,
and the degree of force required to inflict them. The more severe the injuries
caused by Mr. Rodgerson, and the more force required to inflict them, the
stronger the inference that he intended to kill Ms. Young or cause her serious
injury. To show that the nature and extent of the injuries and the degree of
force used pointed to murder, the Crown introduced Dr. Pollanen’s autopsy evidence
and Mr. Sibley’s bloodstain pattern analysis. 

[20]                         
It is relatively straightforward to understand
how Mr. Rodgerson’s efforts at concealment and clean-up were capable of
supporting the inference that he acted unlawfully. The jury could reasonably
have concluded that he was attempting to conceal evidence of a crime that he
had committed — that is, unlawfully causing Ms. Young’s death. However, these
efforts were also capable of supporting the further inference that he was
acting not merely to hide the fact that a crime had occurred, but to
hide the extent of the crime. In other words, the jury might reasonably
have concluded that he sought to conceal Ms. Young’s body and clean up the
scene of her death in order to conceal the nature and extent of Ms. Young’s
injuries and the degree of force required to inflict them. As indicated, the
more severe the injuries, and the more force required to inflict them, the
stronger the inference that he intended to kill Ms. Young or cause her bodily
harm which he knew was likely to cause death. This is not the only inference
that could be drawn from the concealment and clean-up, but it is one the jury
was entitled to draw.

[21]                         
In this regard, the post-offence concealment and
clean-up is simply some evidence that the jury could look to — in
addition to the evidence of Dr. Pollanen and Mr. Sibley — in deciding the
nature and extent of the injuries and the degree of force required to inflict
them. While the meaning of the forensic evidence was vigorously contested at
trial, the Crown’s interpretation was that it revealed a more prolonged and
violent physical altercation than the version of events described by Mr.
Rodgerson. It was open to the jury to look to the post-offence concealment and
clean-up as evidence that tended to confirm this interpretation.

[22]                         
On this point, I reach the same conclusion as
the Court of Appeal. Doherty J.A. summarized the necessary inferential
reasoning in the following manner:

Before the
post-offence conduct relating to the hiding of the body and the clean-up of the
homicide scene could assist the Crown in proving the appellant’s state of mind,
the jury first had to be satisfied that there was a somewhat prolonged
and bloody struggle during which the appellant struck Ms. Young in the head or
face several times, or at least more than twice.  The jury could come to
that conclusion only after a careful consideration of the competing
interpretations of the forensic evidence placed before it. Second,
the jury had to be satisfied that the appellant had engaged in the post-offence
conduct to destroy evidence that would reveal an extensive struggle and assault
well beyond that admitted by him in his evidence. [Emphasis added; para. 76.]

[23]                         
I do not disagree with this description of the
different inferences required to make use of the concealment and clean-up
evidence on the issue of intent. I am concerned, however, that this paragraph
could be misinterpreted to suggest that, on this issue, it would have been
impermissible for the jury to consider the concealment and clean-up evidence at
all until it had first satisfied itself, based on other evidence,
that the altercation between Mr. Rodgerson and Ms. Young had taken a particular
form. I do not ascribe such an interpretation to Doherty J.A., but I wish to
avoid any possible confusion on the matter. In my view, such an approach would
needlessly complicate the jury’s already complicated analytical task. Moreover,
it would represent an unwarranted requirement that the evidence be placed in
artificial silos before being considered by the jury. The jurisprudence
disfavours this type of evidentiary segregation: see R. v. Morin, [1988]
2 S.C.R. 345. The jury was entitled to consider both the forensic evidence and
the evidence of post-offence concealment and clean-up simultaneously, as a
whole, in determining the nature and extent of Ms. Young’s injuries and the
degree of force required to inflict them. 

B.           
The Trial Judge Failed to Adequately Instruct
the Jury on the Use of the Post-Offence Concealment and Clean-Up Evidence in
Assessing Mr. Rodgerson’s Intent

[24]                         
I agree with the Court of Appeal majority that
the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury by failing to provide
sufficient guidance on how to use the evidence of concealment and clean-up on
the issue of intent. 

(1)          
The Trial Judge’s Instructions on Post-Offence
Conduct

[25]                         
The trial judge referred to Mr. Rodgerson’s
concealment and clean-up on numerous occasions in his lengthy jury charge. He
provided an initial, “general instruction” on post-offence conduct, in which he
gave an overview of its various permissible uses and cautioned the jury about
the dangers commonly associated with this type of evidence. In particular, as
MacPherson J.A. observed in his reasons, the trial judge instructed the jury in
accordance with the cautionary requirements set forth in this Court’s decisions
in R. v. White, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72 (“White 1998”), and R.
v. White, 2011 SCC 13, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 433 (“White 2011”). The trial
judge stated:

3. . . . I wish to caution
you about a potential danger concerning post offence conduct. Post offence
conduct may appear more probative than it really is, and may be, by its very
nature, less reliable than it seems, or may be consistent with other less
obvious explanations than the one advanced by Crown counsel. You must consider
evidence of post offence conduct with care and the caution I have provided to
you. I would also direct you to reserve your final judgment about . . . Jason
Rodgerson’s post offence conduct until all the evidence has been
considered during your deliberations.

 

4. What a person said or did after
an offence was committed may indicate that he acted or spoke in a way
which, according to human experience and logic, is consistent with the conduct
of a person who committed the offence and inconsistent with the conduct of
someone who did not do so. On the other hand, there may be other explanations
for what Jason Rodgerson said or did afterwards, such that the conduct does not
assist in deciding whether he acted unlawfully or whether or not he intended to
kill Amber Young. [Emphasis in original; A.R., vol. IX, at p. 63.]

[26]                         
Throughout the charge, the trial judge
repeatedly referred back to the evidence of concealment and clean-up in his
instructions on the elements of the relevant offences and of Mr. Rodgerson’s
defences. On each occasion, he provided the same type of generic instruction.
He did not draw any distinction between using the concealment and clean-up
evidence to evaluate whether Ms. Young died as a result of an unlawful act, and
using it to evaluate Mr. Rodgerson’s intent. Each time, he simply instructed
the jury that “[o]nce again you also have to consider the post offence conduct
which I have previously outlined to you”, or words to that effect (A.R., vol.
IX, at p. 119). On some occasions, the trial judge provided a brief factual
summary of the relevant evidence, while on others he did not. At no point,
however, did he assist the jury in understanding how it could use the
concealment and clean-up evidence in determining whether Mr. Rodgerson had the
requisite intent for murder. Nor did he explain how the inferential reasoning
was different on this issue than on the question of whether Mr. Rodgerson had
acted unlawfully.

(2)          
A More Specific Instruction Was Required

[27]                         
The jury was entitled to consider the concealment
and clean-up evidence in respect of Mr. Rodgerson’s self-defence claim and
whether he unlawfully killed Ms. Young. It was also entitled to consider
this evidence in evaluating whether he had the requisite intent for murder.
Regarding self-defence and unlawful killing, the relevance of the concealment
and clean-up and the nature of the available inference was a matter of common
sense: concealing the body and cleaning up the scene of Ms. Young’s death could
be viewed as evidence that Mr. Rodgerson knew he had killed Ms. Young
unlawfully and was acting to cover it up. Once the jury moved on to the issue
of intent for murder, however, this simple inferential reasoning was no longer
of any use. Rather, the limited relevance of this post-offence conduct on the
issue of intent rested on the following, narrower inference: the jury might
reasonably conclude that Mr. Rodgerson concealed Ms. Young’s body and cleaned
up the scene of her death in order to conceal the nature and extent of her
injuries and the degree of force required to inflict them.

[28]                         
In the sections of the jury charge relating to
the issue of intent, the trial judge failed to link the evidence of concealment
and clean-up to the nature and extent of Ms. Young’s injuries and the force
required to inflict them. Rather, his charge merely reiterated the existence of
the evidence, and instructed the jury to consider it along with all the other
evidence adduced at trial. This was a legal error. Having first used the
concealment and clean-up evidence in a common sense manner based on clear and
readily accessible inferences, there was a risk that the jury might continue to
rely on the evidence in this same manner on the issue of intent. The failure to
instruct the jury on the narrower basis for using the evidence created a risk
that the jury might convict Mr. Rodgerson for murder based only on the broader
inference that had previously been sufficient: that the concealment and
clean-up pointed to a consciousness of guilt and a desire to prevent discovery
of an unlawful killing. 

[29]                         
A more specific instruction was required. It
need not have been long or complex. After first explaining to the jury the
factual link between Mr. Rodgerson’s concealment and clean-up efforts and the
resulting concealment of the injuries to Ms. Young’s body and the blood at the
scene, the trial judge need only have added a few sentences, along these lines:

The nature and extent of the injuries and the force used to inflict
them are factors you may consider in assessing Mr. Rodgerson’s intent at the
time he caused Ms. Young’s death. In this regard, you may take into account the
evidence of Mr. Rodgerson’s concealment and clean-up in determining whether he
intended to kill Ms. Young, or to cause her serious bodily harm which he knew
was likely to cause death.  On this issue, you will need to consider this
evidence in a different way than I have instructed you previously. You may
conclude that Mr. Rodgerson sought to conceal Ms. Young’s body and clean up the
scene of her death in order to conceal the nature and extent of Ms. Young’s
injuries and the degree of force required to inflict them. You may or may not
reach this conclusion — it is up to you — but if you do reach this conclusion,
you may consider this along with all of the other pertinent evidence in
determining whether Mr. Rodgerson had the requisite intent for murder. 

[30]                         
In crafting the jury charge, a trial judge has a
general duty to inform the jury of the relevant evidence, and to assist the
jury in linking that evidence to the issues that it must consider in reaching a
verdict. The level of detail that is required varies depending on the context.
As the majority of this Court stated in R. v. Daley, 2007 SCC 53, [2007]
3 S.C.R. 523, per Bastarache J.:

The
extent to which the evidence must be reviewed “will depend on each particular
case.  The test is one of fairness.  The accused is entitled to a
fair trial and to make full answer and defence.  So long as the evidence
is put to the jury in a manner that will allow it to fully appreciate the
issues and the defence presented, the charge will be adequate” . . . . [para.
57]

 

(Quoting
C. Granger, The Criminal Jury Trial in Canada (2nd ed. 1996), at p.
249.)

[31]                         
I do not suggest that the evidence of
concealment and clean-up in this case was technical or unusually involved.
However, its relevance to the issue of intent was more than a matter of common
sense, and a more specific instruction was required in order to present the
evidence and the available inferences to the jury in a comprehensible form. As
described in Daley, “the task of the trial judge is to explain the
critical evidence and the law and relate them to the essential issues in plain,
understandable language” (para. 57 (emphasis added), quoting R. v. Jack
(1993), 88 Man. R. (2d) 93 (C.A.), at para. 39, aff’d [1994] 2 S.C.R. 310). The
failure to do so here amounts to a legal error.

(3)          
Requiring a More Specific Instruction Is
Consistent With This Court’s Jurisprudence on Post-Offence Conduct

[32]                         
MacPherson J.A., writing in dissent, found no
error in the trial judge’s instructions related to the post-offence concealment
and clean-up. He concluded that the jury charge conformed to the requirements
for instructions on post-offence conduct established in White 1998 and White
2011.

[33]                         
Those two cases relate to a trial judge’s
obligation to caution the jury about the dangers associated with post-offence
conduct in general. I agree with MacPherson J.A. that the jury charge in this
case provided an adequate caution against those dangers. With respect, however,
I do not share his view that this conclusion disposes of the appeal.

[34]                         
The legal error in the jury charge was the
failure to assist the jury in understanding the limited and somewhat nuanced
relevance of the concealment and clean-up evidence on the issue of intent for
murder. This error is unrelated to the required caution on the dangers
associated with post-offence conduct in general. White 1998 and White
2011 do not serve to insulate jury instructions on post-offence conduct
from challenge on other grounds. They do nothing to circumscribe the need to
provide specific instructions where the relevance of the evidence on a
particular issue is not readily apparent and where the natural inclinations of
the jury might lead it down a wrong path. Correctly cautioning the jury in
accordance with White 1998 and White 2011 is therefore necessary,
but not always sufficient.

(4)          
The “Gaps” in the Jury Charge Were Not Filled by
the Crown’s Closing Argument

[35]                         
The Crown asserts that its closing submissions
at trial “arguably filled precisely the ‘gaps’ in the charge that concerned the
majority at the Court of Appeal” (A.F., at para. 62). As the majority of this
Court stated in Daley, the “charge to the jury takes place not in
isolation, but in the context of the trial as a whole”, and therefore
“[a]ppellate review of the trial judge’s charge will encompass the addresses of
counsel as they may fill gaps left in the charge” (para. 58). On the facts of
this case, however, I am unpersuaded that the Crown’s closing address was
sufficient to remedy the deficiency in the jury charge.

[36]                         
The Crown made several statements during its
closing submissions that were of some value in explaining to the jury how the
evidence of concealment and clean-up related to the issue of intent. However,
they were scattered throughout a lengthy closing argument, and many of them
were vague and oblique. Most important, just like the trial judge, the Crown
never hit the nail on the head. The Crown’s closing argument did not contain a
clear and simple description of the way in which the concealment and clean-up
evidence could be used in evaluating the issue of Mr. Rodgerson’s intent. The
submissions lacked a direct explanation of the permissible inference, as
described by Doherty J.A., that Mr. Rodgerson attempted to conceal Ms. Young’s
body and clean up the scene of her death “because the injuries to the body and
the blood at the scene would reveal an assault consistent only with an
intention to cause bodily harm that would likely cause death” (para. 68). As
such, the closing submissions do not suffice to fill the gap and correct the
legal error in the jury charge.

[37]                         
I should also note, in regard to the
instructions on Mr. Rodgerson’s flight from and lies to the police, that the
legal error amounted to misdirection, not non-direction. The trial judge
instructed the jury that it could use the evidence to infer that Mr. Rodgerson
had the requisite intent for murder, when no such inference was available. The
error was unrelated to a gap in the charge, and as such, the gap-filling
principle contemplated by Daley could have no application.

C.           
The Curative Proviso Does Not Apply

[38]                         
The charge contained two legal errors. First, it
is not disputed that the trial judge erred by instructing the jury to consider
Mr. Rodgerson’s flight from and lies to the police on the issue of intent.
Second, the trial judge erred in his instructions on Mr. Rodgerson’s
concealment and clean-up efforts.

[39]                         
The Crown argues that, notwithstanding any such
errors, the curative proviso should apply. I agree with Doherty J.A.’s analysis
on this point. As he noted, after the jury rejected self-defence, the issue of
Mr. Rodgerson’s intent was “the central issue at trial”, and these two errors
“went directly to the jury’s consideration of that issue” (para. 79).
Furthermore, the Crown’s case was not overwhelming. The curative proviso does
not apply, and Mr. Rodgerson is entitled to a new trial for second degree
murder.

D.          
The Jury Charge as a Whole 

[40]                         
In his dissenting opinion, MacPherson J.A.
expressed concern about requiring a more specific instruction on the
concealment and clean-up evidence, in part because he did not wish to further
fuel the trend towards lengthier and more complex jury charges. In his view,

appellate courts should be very wary of
expanding jury instructions . . . . A common theme of contemporary judicial and
counsel discourse is that jury charges today are not as helpful to juries as in
times past. That is because the modern jury charge is, especially in most
murder cases, exceptionally long and complex, rendering doubtful a jury’s
comprehension and comfort. [para. 103]

In her factum, Ms.
Stephens for the Crown echoes this concern, noting that “[t]his charge was
already incredibly long and complex” (para. 71). Quoting from both Daley,
at para. 56, and R. v. Jacquard, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at para. 13, the
Crown emphasizes that “[b]revity in the jury charge is desired” and “[t]he
judge’s role is to ‘decant and simplify’” (para. 41). 

[41]                         
While I differ on the disposition of this
appeal, I share these concerns about the proliferation of long and
unnecessarily complex jury charges. The jury charge in this case spans over 200
pages and took a full day to present in court. I have concluded that the trial
judge erred by failing to sufficiently aid the jury in understanding how to use
the evidence of post-offence concealment and clean-up on the issue of intent. I
emphatically reject any suggestion, however, that an even longer jury charge
was required in this case. 

[42]                         
I start with the observation that a jury charge
may be “so unnecessarily confusing that it
constitute[s] an error of law” (R. v. Hebert, [1996] 2 S.C.R.
272, at p. 277). It is apparent that taming the unchecked expansion of jury
charges is not merely advisable — it is a legal necessity. Mr. Rodgerson does
not argue that the jury charge in this case was so complex and confusing that
it meets the Hebert standard. However, having reviewed the charge in its
entirety, I feel obliged to comment on the detrimental impact that increasingly
long and complex jury charges are having on our criminal justice system. In
doing so, I intend no disrespect to the trial judge, who obviously put a great
deal of time and effort into preparing the charge.

[43]                         
The basic facts of Ms. Young’s death were not
disputed at trial. Mr. Rodgerson’s testimony asserting self-defence and the
Crown’s contradictory theory were both clear and readily comprehensible. In my
respectful view, the length, repetitiveness, and complexity of the jury charge
were unwarranted. The unwieldy final product resulted from a combination of
decisions taken by the Crown, defence counsel, and the trial judge. Each of
these actors, both in this case and in the justice system at large, bears a
responsibility for ensuring that jury charges are as clear and comprehensible
as possible. Rote, repetitive and generic charges are of little value, and are
often harmful to the jury’s comprehension. Indeed, they can and do lead to
instruction that is all but meaningless. Charges should be thoughtfully
tailored to focus on the key evidence and the key issues that are relevant in
the particular context of the case.

(1)          
The Role of the Crown

[44]                         
A significant contributing factor to the lengthy
and convoluted jury charge in this case was the decision by Crown counsel at
trial (not Ms. Stephens) to pursue a conviction for first degree murder. Ms.
Stephens concedes that the first degree murder count was “entirely based on circumstantial evidence” (transcript, at p. 8). I would go further and suggest that the evidence supporting first
degree murder was paper thin, and more a matter of speculation than of
inferences that could reasonably be drawn from the circumstantial evidence. Put
simply, I have difficulty seeing how it could pass the reasonable prospect of
conviction threshold. The decision to proceed with first degree murder required
the trial judge to include instructions on each of the four separate theories
of constructive first degree murder advanced by the Crown: that Mr. Rodgerson
intentionally killed Ms. Young in the course of (1) a sexual assault; or (2) an
unlawful confinement; or (3) an attempted sexual assault; or (4) an attempted
unlawful confinement. This increased the length of the jury charge by almost 40
pages.

[45]                         
The jury in this case did not convict Mr.
Rodgerson of first degree murder, but rather of the lesser included offence of
second degree murder. As such, in a new trial, only the second degree murder
charge will be before the jury. This will reduce the complexity of the jury
charge. This same concern will arise in future cases, however. Certainly, it is
within the Crown’s discretion to prosecute charges where the evidence would
permit a reasonable jury to convict. However, some semblance of a cost-benefit
analysis would serve the justice system well. Where the additional or
heightened charges are marginal, and pursuing them would necessitate a
substantially more complex trial process and jury charge, the Crown should
carefully consider whether the public interest would be better served by either
declining to prosecute the marginal charges from the outset or deciding not to
pursue them once the evidence at trial is complete.

[46]                         
While trial judges must proceed with caution, I
see no difficulty in questioning Crown counsel about the efficacy of proceeding
with a more serious charge or charges in circumstances where the evidence
surpasses the directed verdict threshold, but only barely. Apart from
increasing the length and complexity of the jury charge and the burden on the
jury in its deliberation process, charging a more serious offence risks
deflecting the jury’s attention away from the crucial issue or issues upon
which the case truly hinges.

(2)          
The Role of Defence Counsel

[47]                         
The defence theory of the case was relatively
straightforward. Mr. Rodgerson, testifying in his own defence, asserted that
Ms. Young attacked him unexpectedly with a knife causing him to fear for his
life, that he used physical force only to protect himself, and that she died
during the course of their struggle — a death which he did not intend to cause.
This simple narrative generated jury instructions on the defence of
“involuntary act” accident, and three different bases of self-defence under ss.
34(1) , 34(2) , and 35  of the Criminal Code , as they then existed (amended
S.C. 2012, c. 9, s. 2). Nearly a quarter of the jury charge was dedicated to
instructions on these four topics, three of which were unnecessary and only
served to complicate the charge.

[48]                         
To begin, there was no basis for providing
instruction on the defence of “involuntary act” accident. While Mr. Rodgerson
did testify that Ms. Young’s death was an accident, this was a case of accident
going to mens rea — i.e., Mr. Rodgerson’s claim that he did not intend
to kill Ms. Young. In oral submissions on behalf of Mr. Rodgerson, Mr. Hicks,
who was not counsel at trial, acknowledged that there was no basis for an
instruction on “involuntary act” accident, and indicated that none would be
sought should the order for a new trial be upheld (transcript, at p. 53).[1] Mr. Hicks also
acknowledged that s. 34(2)  alone would have encompassed the basis of
self-defence asserted by Mr. Rodgerson’s testimony (pp. 53-54). Section 34(2) 
was available if Mr. Rodgerson accidentally killed Ms. Young, or if he did so
intentionally: see R. v. Pintar (1996), 30 O.R. (3d)
483 (C.A.), at p. 497. Mr. Rodgerson received no benefit from having two
additional forms of self-defence put to the jury. Such instruction could only
serve to complicate the charge and confuse the jury (Pintar, p. 497).

[49]                         
Defence counsel, while of course seeking to
advance the client’s defence by all lawful and ethical means, also has an
obligation to assist the trial judge in crafting a jury charge that provides clear
and comprehensible instructions on the defences that are actually implicated by
the defence theory of the case. Had that been done here by defence counsel at
trial, the charge could have been shortened by nearly 50 pages.

(3)          
The Role of the Trial Judge

[50]                         
While the Crown and defence counsel both have
roles to play, the role of the trial judge is the most vital, and the most
difficult, in formulating jury instructions. A trial judge must strike a
crucial balance by crafting a jury charge that is both comprehensive and
comprehensible. Recognizing the difficulty inherent in this task, this Court
has “repeatedly endorsed” the functional approach to reviewing jury charges (R.
v. Mack, 2014 SCC 58, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 49). This functional
approach is designed to “ensure that the yardstick by which we measure the
fitness of a [jury charge] does not become overly onerous”, in order to reduce
“the proliferation of very lengthy charges in which judges often quote large
extracts from appellate decisions simply to safeguard verdicts from appeal” (Jacquard,
at para. 1). Under the functional approach, the trial judge’s duty is to
“decant and simplify” (ibid., at para. 13). Over-charging is just as
incompatible with this duty as is under-charging.

[51]                         
More than 15 years later, the concern expressed
in Jacquard remains. However, rather than quoting large extracts from
appellate decisions, trial judges have taken to quoting large extracts from
model charge manuals to safeguard their verdicts from appeal. This has resulted
in an overreliance on the rote reproduction of excerpts from model jury
instructions. But model charge manuals do not necessarily translate into model
charges. They are a tool, not the final product. They are there to guide, not
govern. In my view, the failure to isolate the critical issues in a case and
tailor the charge to them inevitably makes the instructions less helpful to the
jury and adds unnecessarily to their length and complexity.

[52]                         
Courts have repeatedly
emphasized that the jury charge must “be tailored to the facts of the
specific case” (R. v. McNeil (2006), 84 O.R. (3d) 125
(C.A.), at para. 21). While “[t]he model instructions are intended to
provide a starting point for trial judges”, modification will frequently be
required to provide the jury “with the applicable legal principles in a format
that facilitates the application of those principles to the specific
circumstances of the case” (ibid.). Trial judges must “separate the
wheat from the chaff” when determining which defences may be applicable, and
must engage in a “careful and considered culling . . . to avoid unnecessary,
inappropriate and irrelevant legal instruction of a kind that might well divert
the jury’s attention” from the primary disputed issues in the case (Pintar,
at p. 494). 

[53]                         
This principle was
endorsed in Helping Jurors Understand (2007), at p. 82, by no less
authority than Justice Watt of the Ontario Court of Appeal (then of the
Superior Court of Justice), also the author of the Ontario Specimen Jury
Instructions (Criminal) (2003):

A specimen is a sample.  A specimen instruction is a sample
instruction about its subject-matter.  Specimen instructions do not
and cannot be expected to provide legally accurate directions for every set of
circumstances that fall within their reach.  There are no
one-size-fits-all jury instructions.  At best, specimen instructions
provide the basic building blocks for finals and other instructions.  The
twists and turns of individual cases will dictate the nature and extent of
modification required to ensure legal accuracy. [Emphasis in original.]

[54]                         
In the present case, a few modest alterations
would have saved this jury charge from legal error. At the same time, a great
many of the instructions that were included could and should have been removed.
In the event that Mr. Rodgerson’s new trial adduces substantially similar
evidence, and the positions of the parties on that evidence remain the same, it
is my view that a substantially more streamlined jury charge would suffice. Mr.
Rodgerson would benefit from a jury keenly focused on the evidence and
arguments forming the basis of his defence, and not distracted by hours of
confusing and repetitive generic instruction. The Crown would also benefit from
a simplified charge, with fewer unnecessary contours in which grounds for an
appeal of conviction may lay hidden. I do not wish to appear naïve, and I
recognize that such an everybody-wins approach is easier said than done.
Nevertheless, I remain firmly of the view that “common sense and the law need
not be strangers”, and that the fundamental purpose of the jury charge must be
“to educate, not complicate” (R. v. Zebedee (2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 583
(C.A.), at para. 82).

IV.       
Conclusion

[55]                         
It was open to the jury to conclude that Mr.
Rodgerson sought to conceal Ms. Young’s body and clean up the scene of her
death in order to conceal the nature and extent of her injuries and the degree
of force required to inflict them. This in turn could have been relevant on the
issue of whether Mr. Rodgerson had the requisite intent for murder: the more
severe the injuries, and the more force required to inflict them, the stronger
the inference that Mr. Rodgerson intended to kill, or to cause bodily harm
which he knew was likely to cause death.

[56]                         
This chain of inferential reasoning was narrow,
and the relevance of the evidence was attenuated. The trial judge should have
assisted the jury with a specific instruction on how to link the concealment
and clean-up evidence with the issue of intent. His failure to do so was a
legal error, and one that is sufficiently serious, in conjunction with the
erroneous instructions on Mr. Rodgerson’s flight from and lies to the police,
that the curative proviso cannot apply. I would dismiss the Crown’s appeal and
affirm the Court of Appeal’s judgment ordering a new trial on a charge of
second degree murder.

[1]   During the pre-charge conference, defence counsel relied on R. v. Mathisen, 2008
ONCA 747, 239 C.C.C. (3d) 63, to support his request for an instruction on the
defence of “involuntary act” accident. The trial judge expressed skepticism
that this defence had an air of reality on the record, but agreed to include
the instruction because Crown counsel did not oppose the request. In my view,
the facts of this case on this issue bear little resemblance to Mathisen.
On cross-examination, Mr. Rodgerson testified that he applied pressure to Ms.
Young’s face with his arm using as much force as he thought was necessary in
order to restrain her from stabbing him. In his closing submission to the jury,
defence counsel reiterated that Mr. Rodgerson “was pressing down on her face as
hard as [he] could” (A.R., vol. VIII, at p. 153). On this record and these
submissions, there was no basis to instruct the jury on the defence of
“involuntary act” accident.",2015-07-17 00:00:00,CA Supreme Court

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

                    Criminal
law — Defences — Colour of right — Evidence — Co-accused occupying commercial
space unlawfully — Trial judge entered acquittals for various breaking and
entering, assault, and drug offences — Trial judge referred to evidence that,
in her view, supported existence of colour of right to occupy space — Whether
trial judge erred in finding air of reality to colour of right defence — If so,
whether trial judge’s error in assessing this issue had material bearing on
verdicts.

                    S
and F, after having been lawfully evicted from their upstairs apartment, took
up residence in the vacant commercial space on the ground floor of the same
building in contravention of municipal bylaws. On February 1, 2011, the
Chief Municipal Inspector, joined by three police officers as a safety measure,
decided to inspect the premises. During the municipal building inspection, S
and F attacked the police. They were both arrested for assault. Police searched
S incident to his arrest and discovered methamphetamine and ecstasy pills. S
and F were charged with breaking and entering and assaulting a police officer.
In addition, S was charged with one count of assault with a weapon and two
counts of drug possession. On February 18, inspectors realized that S and F
were again occupying the ground floor, despite an order prohibiting its use. S
and F were arrested a second time, and again charged with breaking and entering.
The trial judge acquitted S and F of all charges. She held that S and F’s
s. 8 Charter rights were violated and excluded all evidence of what
occurred inside the commercial space. The trial judge also found that there was
an air of reality to S and F’s asserted colour of right defence, and that the
Crown had failed to disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt. A majority of the
Court of Appeal upheld the acquittals.

                    Held:
The appeal should be allowed, the acquittals set aside, and a new trial ordered
on all charges.

                    The
term “colour of right” denotes an honest belief in a state of facts which, if
true, would at law justify or excuse the act done. An accused bears the onus of
showing that there is an “air of reality” to the asserted defence — i.e.,
whether there is some evidence upon which a trier of fact, properly instructed
and acting reasonably, could be left in a state of reasonable doubt about
colour of right. 

                    Here,
the trial judge’s finding that there was an air of reality to the colour of
right defence in relation to the February 1 breaking and entering charges was
tainted by her improper reliance on certain evidence that did not, in fact,
support the existence of a colour of right. In particular, the trial judge
erred in relying on the landlord’s acknowledgment on cross-examination that it
is possible that his father, who once had control of the building, had a verbal
agreement with S and F for the use of the commercial space, and had given them
the keys to the space. A proposition put to a witness during cross-examination
does not constitute evidence of the proposition, unless the witness adopts it
as true. The landlord’s inability to reject the suggestions put to him does not
shed any light on whether those suggestions are true or not. His testimony cannot
be used in assessing whether the asserted colour of right defence passes the
air of reality threshold. The trial judge’s error in factoring this evidence
into the air of reality assessment might reasonably be thought to have had a
material bearing on the overall colour of right issue, and thus on the
resulting acquittals in respect of the February 1 breaking and entering
charges. 

                    With
respect to F’s charge of assaulting a police officer, the trial judge acquitted
her on the basis of self-defence. The acquittal turns on the trial judge’s
finding that F honestly believed it was unlawful for the police officers to
restrain S and place him under arrest for having attacked them inside the
commercial space. Implicit in this finding is an additional one: that F
honestly believed that she and S had a right to occupy the commercial space
and, by extension, a right to repel the police. Absent a colour of right
defence, there could be no basis for S and F’s purported belief that they had a
right to repel the police. The trial judge’s error on colour of right tainted
her finding that F acted in self-defence, and might reasonably be thought to
have had a material bearing on F’s acquittal on the assault charge.

                    The
trial judge’s error on the colour of right issue also tainted the acquittals on
S’s assault and drug possession charges. The basis for these acquittals was the
trial judge’s finding that S and F’s s. 8 rights were violated, and the
resulting exclusion of evidence. Section 8 of the Charter only
confers protection against unreasonable searches and seizures to the extent
that an individual establishes a reasonable expectation of privacy, on a
balance of probabilities. On the facts of this case, the trial judge’s error on
the colour of right issue brings into doubt whether there was a subjective
expectation of privacy, much less a reasonable one. To the extent that s. 8
of the Charter was not properly engaged, the trial judge was not in a
position to exclude any evidence. Accordingly, the trial judge’s error might
reasonably be thought to have had a material bearing on S’s acquittals for the
assault and drug possession charges.

                    Neither
the trial judge nor the Court of Appeal distinguished between the first and
second set of breaking and entering charges. The February 18 breaking and
entering charges should have been analyzed separately from those of February 1.
In light of the undisputed evidence, it is difficult to conceive that S and F
had an honest belief in their right to occupy the commercial space on February 18.
However, because the Crown did not request an alternate remedy, the
February 18 breaking and entering charges should be sent back for a new
trial along with the remaining charges.

Moldaver J. — This is an appeal as of right from a
judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal upholding the acquittals at trial of the
respondents, Mr. Andrew Simpson and Ms. Kizzy-Ann Farrell, on various breaking
and entering, assault, and drug offences. Like Thibault J.A., dissenting
in the Court of Appeal, but for the more detailed reasons that follow, I would
allow the appeal, set aside the acquittals, and order a new trial on all
charges. 

I.             
Facts

[2]                             
The bulk of the charges in this case arise from
a municipal building inspection carried out on February 1, 2011. The building,
located in the borough of Lachine in Montréal, had two apartments upstairs and
three vacant commercial units on the main floor. The owner, Marius Arcand, was
elderly and in declining health. A mandate in case of incapacity was sanctioned
in April 2010, giving his son, Jean-Marc Arcand, authority over the management
of the property. 

[3]                             
Mr. Simpson and Ms. Farrell had a lease for an
apartment on the second floor of the building. However, on November 10, 2010,
an eviction order was granted against them for non-payment of rent. A month
later, on December 6, Jean-Marc Arcand went to the building accompanied by a
locksmith and found that the respondents had vacated the apartment. However, he
believed that they had relocated to the commercial units on the ground floor. 

[4]                             
Suspecting that the respondents had taken up
residence in the commercial space, Jean-Marc Arcand contacted Pierre Dubois,
the Chief Municipal Inspector for the borough of Lachine, to inform him of the
situation. Inspector Dubois inquired about the ground floor units to determine
whether they were equipped to serve as a residence. He concluded that, if the
ground floor was being used as a residence, this would be in contravention of
municipal bylaws. He therefore decided to inspect the premises with the
permission and cooperation of Jean-Marc Arcand.  

[5]                             
The inspection took place during the day on
February 1, 2011. Inspector Dubois and four junior inspectors were present.
They were joined by three police officers, Sergeant Pierre Barbeau and Officers
Andre Troke and Sandra Fournier. Inspector Dubois had requested the presence of
the police as a safety measure, since he had previously encountered aggressive
behaviour from the respondents. 

[6]                             
The doors on the ground floor of the building
were locked and the windows were covered with dark sheets. Inspector Dubois
knocked several times, but there was no response. 

[7]                             
A locksmith was called to open the rear door.
Sergeant Barbeau and Officer Troke entered the building first to verify whether
anyone was inside. They repeatedly shouted “police” so as to make their
presence known. 

[8]                             
Inspector Dubois, Officer Fournier, and the
junior inspectors remained outside. Shortly after Sergeant Barbeau and Officer
Troke entered the building, Ms. Farrell exited through another door. She
approached Inspector Dubois and instructed him to leave. The inspector stated
that he had to inspect the premises and attempted to show her a copy of the
relevant bylaw dealing with safety and sanitation standards for residences. Ms.
Farrell refused to look at it and re-entered the building. 

[9]                             
Inside, Sergeant Barbeau and Officer Troke
continued with their search of the commercial space. After climbing up a set of
stairs, Sergeant Barbeau pushed open a door and observed a shadow moving in
front of him, which turned out to be Mr. Simpson. Mr. Simpson yelled at the
officers, telling them that they had no business being there and to “get out”:
A.R., vol. V, at p. 24. Sergeant Barbeau shouted back at Mr. Simpson and
instructed him to “get down on the ground”: ibid. 

[10]                         
Within seconds, Mr. Simpson started banging on
the wall of the staircase with an object. The object — what appeared to be a
wooden two-by-four — broke through the wall and came within an inch of Sergeant
Barbeau’s face. In response, Officer Troke shot pepper spray in Mr.
Simpson’s direction. 

[11]                         
The officers then saw a nearby door open, from
which Mr. Simpson exited the building. Officer Troke ran after him, and tackled
him to the ground. As Mr. Simpson was resisting arrest, Sergeant Barbeau came
to Officer Troke’s aid and the two officers tried to restrain him. 

[12]                         
At that point, Ms. Farrell jumped on to Sergeant
Barbeau’s back and hit him on the head. He pushed her away and ordered her to
back off. Ms. Farrell did not comply and charged toward him again. Sergeant
Barbeau responded by giving her a blow to the neck, bringing her to the ground,
and handcuffing her. 

[13]                         
The respondents were both arrested for assault.
Officer Troke searched Mr. Simpson incident to his arrest and discovered 14
methamphetamine and ecstasy pills. 

[14]                         
Charges were laid against Mr. Simpson and Ms. Farrell
as a result of the events of February 1. They consisted of one count each of
breaking and entering and committing mischief contrary to s. 348(1) (b)
and (e) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46  (“Code ”),
and one count each of assaulting a police officer contrary to
s. 270(1) (a) of the Code . In addition, Mr. Simpson was
charged with one count of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267 (a) of
the Code  and two counts of drug possession under the Controlled Drugs
and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19 . 

[15]                         
On February 9, 2011, Inspector Dubois issued an
order prohibiting the use of the ground floor of the building because it was
dangerous and unsanitary. Non-occupation notices were plastered on every door,
clearly indicating the prohibition. 

[16]                         
On February 18, inspectors realized that the
notices had been removed from the building and that the respondents were again
occupying the ground floor. They informed Inspector Dubois, who immediately
contacted the police. The respondents were arrested a second time. On this
occasion, they were charged with one count each of breaking and entering and
committing mischief contrary to s. 348(1) (b) and (e) of the Code .


II.          
Judgments Below

A.          
Court of Quebec (Ouimet J.; Oral Reasons for
Judgment)

[17]                         
The respondents dismissed their lawyers after
the first day of trial and were self-represented thereafter. Crown counsel
called evidence and the respondents chose not to testify. However, they brought
various motions alleging abuses by the City, the police, the prosecution, and
their former landlord, which the trial judge interpreted as motions under ss.
7 , 8 , and 24  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . 

[18]                         
The trial judge gave oral reasons for judgment.
After laying out the relevant facts, she addressed the s. 8  Charter  motion
in relation to the events of February 1. She concluded that the police
officers’ forced entry into the commercial space constituted a violation of the
respondents’ right to be free from unreasonable search or seizure.

[19]                         
Applying s. 24(2) of the Charter , the
trial judge held that this “is certainly a case for me to exclude the evidence
that was obtained following the violation”: A.R., vol. I, at p. 14.
Specifically, she excluded “all that was seen by the police officers after
their entering the place”, including the fact that Mr. Simpson had attacked
Sergeant Barbeau: ibid. She further excluded the drugs that were found
on Mr. Simpson after he was arrested. Accordingly, she acquitted him on the
drug possession counts as well as the charges of assault with a weapon and
assault of a police officer.

[20]                         
On Ms. Farrell’s charge of assaulting a police
officer, the trial judge found that Ms. Farrell had reacted to protect Mr.
Simpson from being unlawfully assaulted by the police. This was sufficient, in
her view, to raise a reasonable doubt that Ms. Farrell was acting in lawful
self-defence when she hit Sergeant Barbeau. Accordingly, she acquitted Ms.
Farrell on this charge. 

[21]                         
With respect to the breaking and entering
counts, the trial judge’s analysis is, at best, unclear. For one thing, she did
not distinguish between the breaking and entering charges stemming from the
February 1 arrest and those stemming from the subsequent arrest on February 18.
Rather, she appears to have assumed that the same analysis was applicable to
both dates, even though the circumstances surrounding the February 1 and
February 18 offences were markedly different. 

[22]                         
The trial judge’s analysis is also remarkably
short. She simply identified two pieces of evidence, which I will address in
due course, suggesting that the respondents “reasonably thought” that they had
a right to be in the commercial space: A.R., vol. I, at p. 18. Given that they
had at least “an appearance of right”, she acquitted them on the breaking and
entering charges for both February 1 and February 18. 

B.           
Quebec Court of Appeal (Duval Hesler C.J. and
Dalphond J.A.; Thibault J.A., Dissenting)

[23]                         
The Court of Appeal’s reasons are exceedingly
brief. They are set out in full below: 

It
was the Crown’s burden to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the
Respondents had no colour of right to occupy the premises. The trial judge
concluded that it had failed to do so. In the opinion of the majority, the
Appellant fails to demonstrate any reviewable error in the verdicts of acquittal
on all charges and the appeal must be dismissed. 

 

For
her part, Justice Thibault, in dissent, would have allowed the appeal and
ordered a new trial, on the basis that the absence of a right of occupation had
been demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt and that the inspector’s visit
accompanied by policemen was legal ([Chabotar] c. Ville de Laval,
[2004] J.Q. 149).

 

(2014
QCCA 1143, at paras. 1-2 (CanLII))

III.       
Issues on Appeal

[24]                         
This appeal comes to us as of right as a result
of the dissent of Thibault J.A. The respondents appeared in person. Mr.
Walid Hijazi was appointed amicus curiae to assist the Court, and we are
grateful to him for his assistance. 

[25]                         
In considering and addressing the issues in this
appeal, unfortunately this Court does not have the benefit of more fulsome
reasons from either the majority or the dissent in the Court of Appeal. More
complete reasons would, of course, have been useful, particularly here, where the
matter comes to us as of right. Section 677  of the Code  provides that,
where an appellate judge dissents from the judgment of the court, he or she
“shall specify any grounds in law on which the dissent, in whole or in part, is
based”. This Court is greatly assisted when the dissenting judge clearly and
explicitly specifies these grounds in law and provides sufficient reasons
explaining the basis of the dissent. Reasons explaining the position of the
majority are equally helpful. In this case, the brevity of the judgment below
has left us with the task of having to deduce the precise questions of law that
are properly before us, as well as having to infer the reasons in support of
the dissent. 

[26]                         
Pursuant to s. 693(1) (a) of the Code ,
the Crown’s right of appeal is limited to the questions of law on which
Thibault J.A. dissented. Here, it would appear that she disagreed with the
majority on two points. First, she concluded that “the absence of a right of
occupation had been demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt”. Second, she held
that “the inspector’s visit accompanied by policemen was legal”. Accordingly,
she would have allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial on all charges.

[27]                         
While there may be some ambiguity as to the
precise question of law that arises from Thibault J.A.’s first point, the Crown
submits that she was referring to the colour of right defence — in particular,
whether that defence had a sufficient evidential foundation in the record to
pass the air of reality test. Neither the respondents nor the amicus curiae
contested this framing of the issue. Having considered the matter, I am
satisfied that the first question of law properly before this Court is whether
there was an air of reality to the colour of right defence and whether the
trial judge’s error or errors (if any) in assessing this issue had a material
bearing on the verdicts such that a new trial should be ordered.

[28]                         
Justice Thibault’s second point of disagreement
relates to the lawfulness of the entry into the commercial space by the inspector
and police officers. This is a question of law that is also properly before the
Court. However, in view of my conclusion on the colour of right issue, I
believe this matter is best left for the trial judge conducting the new trial,
should the Crown choose to proceed again. 

IV.       
Analysis

A.          
Colour of Right Defence Relating to the February
1 Breaking and Entering Charges

[29]                         
The trial judge found that there was an air of
reality to the respondents’ colour of right defence, and that the Crown had
failed to disprove it. Accordingly, she acquitted Mr. Simpson and Ms. Farrell
on the breaking and entering charges stemming from the initial arrest on
February 1. A majority of the Court of Appeal saw no basis for interfering with
the trial judge’s finding that the Crown had failed to disprove the colour of
right defence. Thibault J.A. disagreed.

[30]                         
As I will explain, the trial judge’s finding
that there was an air of reality to the colour of right defence is tainted by
her improper reliance on certain evidence that did not, in fact, support the
existence of a colour of right. In the absence of that evidence, it is
uncertain whether she would have come to the same conclusion. It follows that I
respectfully disagree with the majority of the Court of Appeal’s conclusion
that there was no reviewable error in the trial judge’s colour of right
analysis. While Thibault J.A. did not provide any detailed explanations, I
agree with her implicit conclusion that the trial judge erred in her assessment
as to whether there was an air of reality to the colour of right defence, and
that this error tainted her findings with respect to all of the charges.

[31]                         
The colour of right defence is most commonly
invoked in relation to the offence of theft under s. 322  of the Code ,
which prohibits the taking of an object or its conversion “fraudulently and without
colour of right”. In R. v. DeMarco (1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 369 (Ont.
C.A.), at p. 372, Martin J.A. described the term “colour of right” in that
section as follows: 

The term
“colour of right” generally, although not exclusively, refers to a situation
where there is an assertion of a proprietary or possessory right to the thing
which is the subject-matter of the alleged theft. One who is honestly asserting
what he believes to be an honest claim cannot be said to act “without colour of
right”, even though it may be unfounded in law or in fact . . . .
The term “colour of right” is also used to denote an honest belief in a state
of facts which, if it actually existed would at law justify or excuse the act
done . . . . The term when used in the latter sense is
merely a particular application of the doctrine of mistake of fact. [Citations
omitted.]

The colour of right
defence would also appear to apply to other property-related offences,
including breaking and entering: R. v. Adgey, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 426, at
pp. 432-33; R. v. Charters, 2007 NBCA 66, 319 N.B.R. (2d) 179, at para.
12. 

[32]                         
To put the defence of colour of right into play,
an accused bears the onus of showing that there is an “air of reality” to the
asserted defence — i.e., whether there is some evidence upon which a trier of
fact, properly instructed and acting reasonably, could be left in a state of
reasonable doubt about colour of right: R. v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29,
[2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 49-53 and 83. Once this hurdle is met, the burden
falls on the Crown to disprove the defence beyond a reasonable doubt. Applying
these principles here, the respondents bore the burden of pointing to some
evidence upon which a trier of fact could be left in a state of reasonable
doubt about the respondents’ asserted claim of a colour of right to occupy the
commercial space. 

[33]                         
The respondents did not testify at trial.
Therefore, the record does not contain any direct evidence of their subjective
belief. That said, the trial judge referred to two pieces of evidence that, in
her view, supported the existence of a colour of right. The first is Jean-Marc
Arcand’s acknowledgment on cross-examination that it is possible that his
father, Marius, had a verbal agreement with the respondents for the use of the
commercial space, and that it is possible that Marius had given them the keys
to the space. The second piece of evidence is a small claims court application
filed by the respondents on January 14, 2011, against Jean-Marc and Marius
Arcand, alleging that they had been “lur[ed] into an agreement of business . .
. under false pretenses”: A.R., vol. XI, at p. 21. Although the precise nature
of the allegations is difficult to discern, certain statements in the
application imply that there might have been a lease agreement with the
respondents for the commercial space.

[34]                         
Before this Court, the amicus curiae put
forward a third piece of evidence arising from Sergeant Barbeau’s testimony,
specifically, a mention in the sergeant’s notes of the possible existence of a
lease entered into by the respondents for the commercial premises. The trial
judge did not consider this evidence on the issue of colour of right, nor does
it seem she was asked to. Whatever the case, there is nothing to suggest that
the respondents were aware of or relied on these notes as of February 1 or
February 18, and, as evidence of the truth of their contents, they were classic
hearsay and inadmissible for that purpose. As such, they do not assist the
respondents. 

[35]                         
I now turn to the two pieces of evidence upon
which the trial judge relied in assessing the defence of colour of right. 

(1)          
Jean-Marc Arcand’s Testimony 

[36]                         
During cross-examination, on at least two
occasions, the trial judge intervened and asked Jean-Marc Arcand whether it was
“possible” that his father had entered into a verbal agreement with the
respondents regarding the commercial space. The trial judge further inquired
into whether it was “possible” that Marius Arcand had given the respondents
keys to the space during the summer of 2010. Jean-Marc Arcand acknowledged that
it was possible that an agreement was concluded by his father and that keys
were handed over to the respondents. However, at no point in his testimony did
he accept that these events had actually occurred. He was simply unable to
reject the suggestions put to him, since Marius’s interactions with Mr. Simpson
and Ms. Farrell were not within his personal knowledge. 

[37]                         
The trial judge relied on Jean-Marc Arcand’s
answers as evidence of a colour of right. With respect, she erred in doing so.
As the Crown rightly observes, a proposition put to a witness during
cross-examination does not constitute evidence of the proposition, unless the
witness adopts it as true: see R. v. Skedden, 2013 ONCA 49, at para. 12;
R. v. Zebedee (2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 583 (C.A.), at para. 114; R. v.
M.B.M., 2002 MBCA 154, 170 Man. R. (2d) 131, at paras. 25-27. This rule
applies even where the proposition was put to the witness by the trial judge.

[38]                         
Jean-Marc Arcand’s inability to reject the
suggestions put to him does not shed any light on whether those suggestions are
true or not. Without more, all that his answers convey is that he was not
personally aware of the specific interactions, if any, that his father may have
had with the respondents. To rely on his answers as evidence of something
further — for example, that the respondents may have reached an agreement with
Marius Arcand — was not open to the trial judge. As a result, Jean-Marc
Arcand’s testimony cannot be used in assessing whether the asserted colour of
right defence passes the air of reality threshold. With respect, the trial
judge erred in law in concluding otherwise. 

(2)          
Small Claims Court Application 

[39]                         
On January 14, 2011, the respondents filed an
application in small claims court seeking damages from Jean-Marc and Marius
Arcand in the amount of $7,000 (“the application”). In the application, the
respondents alleged, among other things, that the Arcands lured them into a
business agreement on false pretences and that Jean-Marc “willfully and
knowingly allowed . . . Marius, to continue to rent out residential and
commercial spaces, in full knowledge that [he was] not in a mental position to
handle such legal obligations”: A.R., vol. XI, at p. 17. The respondents also
claimed that the Arcands failed “to render the property into proper functioning
order as required by the law and according to health regulations” and “[t]o
replace . . . goods and products” that sustained water damage: ibid.
They sought compensation for losses “incurred to the business” as well as for
“emotional distress and stress”: ibid. 

[40]                         
The allegations are sparse in terms of detail.
They do not disclose the type of business arrangement that the respondents
claim to have made with the Arcands. They also do not specify the nature of any
purported agreement relating to the downstairs commercial units. However, the
trial judge relied on the statements in the application as evidence that the
respondents honestly believed they had a right to occupy the commercial space
based on a verbal agreement with Marius Arcand.

[41]                         
Out-of-court statements made by an accused and
adduced for their exculpatory value are subject to the general exclusionary
rule against hearsay: see R. v. Rojas, 2008 SCC 56, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 111,
at paras. 36-37. They are typically inadmissible for the truth of their
contents because they are regarded as self-serving and lacking in probative
value: ibid. In this case, however, it was the Crown, and not the
respondents, who introduced the small claims application into evidence, and
following Rojas, both the Crown and the respondents could rely on it for
the truth of its contents. 

[42]                         
Here, in determining that the requisite
evidential foundation for the colour of right defence had been met, the trial
judge relied on two pieces of evidence. One of these — Jean-Marc Arcand’s lack
of knowledge of what his father may have done — was clearly of no value and
should not have been considered. The trial judge erred in law in doing so. The
trial judge’s error in factoring Jean-Marc Arcand’s evidence into the air of
reality assessment might reasonably be thought to have had a material bearing
on the overall colour of right issue, and thus on the resulting acquittals in respect
of the February 1 breaking and entering charges: R. v. Graveline, 2006
SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, at para. 14. Accordingly, the Crown has met its
burden of establishing that a new trial on these charges is warranted. I
therefore agree with Thibault J.A.’s conclusion on this point. 

B.           
Ms. Farrell’s February 1 Charge of Assaulting a
Police Officer

[43]                         
The trial judge held that Ms. Farrell was acting
in lawful self-defence when she hit Sergeant Barbeau. Regrettably, her
discussion on this point is cursory. She did not refer to any of the
self-defence provisions in the Criminal Code , nor offer any detailed
analysis. Despite the lack of analysis, it is evident that the trial judge’s
conclusion hinges on her finding that Ms. Farrell “reacted in order to protect Mr. Simpson”
whom “she felt . . . had been unlawfully assaulted by the police officer”:
A.R., vol. I, at p. 19. The Court of Appeal’s reasons make no mention of this
finding. However, Thibault J.A. concluded that a new trial should be
ordered on all charges, and I agree. As I will explain, the trial judge’s error
on the colour of right issue carries over and taints Ms. Farrell’s acquittal on
the charge of assaulting a police officer. 

[44]                         
The acquittal on Ms. Farrell’s assault charge
turns on the finding that she honestly believed Mr. Simpson was being
unlawfully assaulted. According to the trial judge, Ms. Farrell felt that it
was unlawful for the police officers to restrain Mr. Simpson and place him
under arrest for having attacked them inside the commercial space, and this
prompted her to hit Sergeant Barbeau. Implicit in this finding is an additional
one: that Ms. Farrell honestly believed that she and Mr. Simpson had a
right to occupy the commercial space and, by extension, a right to repel the
police — and that when Mr. Simpson attacked Sergeant Barbeau and later resisted
arrest, he was within his rights to do so. However, as I have discussed, it is
questionable whether the colour of right finding can be sustained on the
evidence that was properly before the trial judge.[1] 

[45]                         
Suffice it to say that, in the context of this
case, the colour of right finding was inextricably linked to the finding that
Ms. Farrell acted in self-defence. Absent a colour of right defence, there
could be no basis for the respondents’ purported belief that they had a right
to repel the police. It follows that, at a minimum, the trial judge’s error on
colour of right taints her finding that Ms. Farrell acted in self-defence. As
this error might reasonably be thought to have had a material bearing on Ms.
Farrell’s acquittal on the assault charge, I would order a new trial on that
charge as well. 

C.           
Mr. Simpson’s February 1 Assault and Drug
Possession Charges

[46]                         
The trial judge held that the respondents’ s. 8 
rights were violated. She excluded all evidence of what occurred inside the
commercial space, including the fact that Mr. Simpson attacked Sergeant
Barbeau. She also excluded the evidence of the drugs in his possession. This
led her to acquit Mr. Simpson on the charges of assault with a weapon, assault
of a police officer, and the two drug possession counts. The Court of Appeal
did not explicitly address the s. 8  issue. Given that the majority upheld the
acquittals on these charges, I take it to have concluded that the trial judge
did not err in her s. 8  finding or in the resulting exclusion of evidence. With
respect, I disagree. I am satisfied that the trial judge’s error on the colour
of right issue again taints Mr. Simpson’s acquittals on the assault and drug
possession charges and requires, as Thibault J.A. concluded, that a new trial
be directed on these charges as well.

[47]                         
Section 8  of the Charter  only confers
protection against unreasonable searches and seizures to the extent that an
individual establishes a reasonable expectation of privacy: Hunter v.
Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p. 159. It is the claimant who bears
the burden of demonstrating this expectation on a balance of probabilities: R.
v. Edwards, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128, at para. 45. In determining whether this
burden has been met, the court must assess the totality of the circumstances,
with particular emphasis on the existence of a subjective expectation of
privacy and the objective reasonableness of that expectation: R. v. Tessling,
2004 SCC 67, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 432, at para. 19; Edwards, at para.
45. 

[48]                         
The trial judge did not carry out a full s. 8 
analysis. Notably, she did not discuss whether the respondents had a reasonable
expectation of privacy in the commercial space, thereby engaging the protection
of s. 8 . Rather, in finding a s. 8  violation, she appears to have assumed that
s. 8  was properly engaged. The Court of Appeal seemingly agreed, but Thibault
J.A. can be taken to have disagreed on this point.  

[49]                         
The lack of analysis in the courts below has
left this Court in the difficult position of examining, for the first time, the
basis for the trial judge’s conclusion that s. 8  was engaged. While I am loath
to speculate on the trial judge’s reasoning, it would appear that her implicit
finding of a reasonable expectation of privacy was influenced by her colour of
right analysis. As noted, in the course of that brief analysis, the trial judge
stated that the respondents had at least “an appearance of right” or
“reasonably thought” they had a right to be in the commercial space. However,
as I have explained, that finding is questionable in light of the trial judge’s
erroneous reliance on Jean-Marc Arcand’s testimony. To the extent that the
evidential foundation for the colour of right defence is put into question, any
implicit finding of a reasonable expectation of privacy is also suspect. 

[50]                         
I should further emphasize that, even if the
trial judge was left in a state of reasonable doubt as to the existence of a
colour of right, it does not follow that the respondents discharged their
burden of demonstrating, on a balance of probabilities, that they had a
reasonable expectation of privacy in the commercial space. This is because the
evidential burden of showing an air of reality on colour of right is lower than
the persuasive burden of establishing that s. 8  is engaged. Furthermore, a
finding that the respondents had a colour of right could only assist them in
advancing the position that they had a subjective expectation of
privacy. To engage s. 8 , the respondents had to go one step further — they had
to show that this expectation was objectively reasonable. 

[51]                         
Although an individual need not show a
proprietary or possessory interest in a place in order to establish a
reasonable expectation of privacy, this Court has held that the fact that the
accused is a trespasser or otherwise has a tenuous connection to the place in
question may, when considered in the totality of the circumstances,
significantly undermine any reasonable expectation of privacy: Edwards,
at para. 43; R. v. Lauda, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 683, at para. 1; R. v.
Belnavis, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 341, at paras. 20-22. 

[52]                         
For present purposes, I need not come to a final
conclusion as to whether a reasonable expectation of privacy was established here.
As I have stated, the trial judge’s error on the colour of right issue brings
into doubt whether there was a subjective expectation of privacy, much less a
reasonable one, on the facts of this case. To the extent that s. 8  was not
properly engaged, the trial judge was not in a position to exclude any
evidence. Accordingly, the trial judge’s error might reasonably be thought to
have had a material bearing on the acquittals, and I would order a new trial on
Mr. Simpson’s assault and drug possession charges.   

[53]                         
In these circumstances, I consider it prudent to
leave for a new trial the issue of whether the inspector was lawfully entitled
to enter the premises under the authority of municipal bylaws and whether the
police were lawfully entitled to accompany the inspector and conduct a search
of the premises. That important legal issue was not fully addressed by the
trial judge or the Court of Appeal, and it is one that should be assessed on a
proper record after full legal argument and analysis.

D.          
Colour of Right Defence Relating to the February
18 Breaking and Entering Charges

[54]                         
As noted, neither the trial judge nor the Court
of Appeal distinguished between the first and second set of breaking and
entering charges. However, given that Thibault J.A. would have ordered a new
trial on all charges, I will address the February 18 breaking and entering
charges specifically. In my respectful view, the trial judge should have
analyzed the events of February 18 separately from those of February 1. I find
it difficult to conceive that the respondents had an honest belief in their
right to occupy the commercial space on February 18. The undisputed evidence
shows that, on February 9, non-occupation notices were plastered on the
entrances to the commercial space. These notices clearly indicated that no one
was to enter the premises. In spite of this, the respondents returned to the
ground floor of the building and began residing in it once again. However,
because the Crown did not request an alternate remedy, I would send the
February 18 breaking and entering charges back for a new trial along with the
remaining charges. 

V.          
Conclusion

[55]                         
I would allow the appeal, set aside the
acquittals, and order a new trial on all charges.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

                    Criminal
law — Sentencing — Legislation — Interpretation — Truth in Sentencing Act
providing that changes to how much credit given for pre-sentence custody “apply
only to persons charged after” Act came into force — Accused committed offences
before Truth in Sentencing Act came into force, but charged after Act came into
force — Whether s. 5 of Truth in Sentencing Act applies only to offenders
charged after amendments have come into force regardless of when offences were
committed — Truth in Sentencing Act, S.C. 2009, c. 29, s. 5. 

                    Section 5
of the Truth in Sentencing Act states that the caps on how much credit
should be given for pre-sentence custody “apply only to persons charged after”
the Act came into force.  The accused committed the offences for which
he was convicted before the Act came into force but he was charged after
the Act came into force.  He argued that since he committed the offences
before the Act came into force, the caps did not apply to him.  He did
not challenge the constitutionality of the provision.  The trial judge and the
Court of Appeal held that the impugned provision unambiguously applied.

                    Held: 
The appeal should be dismissed.

                    While
it is true that new sentencing legislation is presumed not to apply
retrospectively, in the absence of a constitutional challenge the presumption
can be displaced by a clear legislative direction that a provision is to apply
retrospectively.  In this case, the language used in s. 5 of the Truth
in Sentencing Act is unambiguous.  In the absence of ambiguity the court
must give effect to the clearly expressed legislative intent.  The application
of the interpretive assistance of Charter values is precluded by this
absence of ambiguity.  Section 5 states clearly that the new provisions
apply to persons charged after the Truth in Sentencing Act came into
force.  The only triggering event is when the person was charged, regardless of
when the offences were committed.  The presumption is therefore rebutted. 

                    In
this case, the accused was charged after the Truth in Sentencing Act
came into force.  He was therefore subject to the credit limits for pre-sentence
custody in accordance with s. 5.

                    Diana Lumba, for the appellant.

                    Mabel Lai, for the respondent.

                    The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

[1]                             
Abella J. — Sentencing legislation will not be given retrospective application
unless the legislation unequivocally states that it is to have retrospective
effect.  This does not immunize it from a Charter  challenge, but if no
such challenge is brought, the ordinary rules of statutory interpretation
apply.  This is not to suggest that these rules exclude Charter  values
as one aspect of the broader interpretive context contemplated by our “modern
rule of interpretation”, but that is different from using those values to create
ambiguity when none exists.

[2]                             
The focus of this appeal is on s. 5 of the Truth
in Sentencing Act,[1] a brief provision which says that the caps on how much credit
should be given for pre-sentence custody “apply only to persons charged after”
the Act came into force.  The marginal note to s. 5 says “Application —
persons charged after coming into force”. 

[3]                             
The accused in this case, Calvin Clarke, did
not bring a constitutional challenge to s. 5. Nor did he allege abuse of
process.  His argument instead was that the provision was ambiguous and that
the appropriate interpretive exercise involved the application of Charter 
values. 

[4]                             
With respect for those with a different view (R. v. Serdyuk (2012), 68 Alta. L.R. (5th) 152 (C.A.), and R. v. A.A.M. (2013), 335 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 199 (N.L.C.A.)), I agree with the trial judge and Court of Appeal in this case that
the impugned provision unambiguously applies only to those offenders charged
after the amendments came into force, regardless of when the offences were
committed.  In the absence of a Charter  challenge, this ends the
interpretive exercise.

Analysis

[5]                             
Prior to the enactment of the Truth in
Sentencing Act, judges routinely exercised their discretion to give
offenders extra credit for time spent in custody awaiting sentencing at a ratio
higher than one day of credit for every day in custody.  This was a reflection
of the reality that unlike custody after sentencing, pre-sentence custody
conditions were often harsher, remedial programs were unavailable and time
spent in custody did not count for the purposes of early release (statutory
release or remission) (R. v. Wust, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 455).  Credit was
usually given at a rate of two days for every day served in pre-sentence
custody, but could be higher depending on the offender’s pre-sentence custodial
circumstances.

[6]                             
Section 3 of the Truth in Sentencing Act
restricted this discretion by limiting it to “a maximum of one day for each
day” in “custody” (Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , s. 719(3) )
unless “the circumstances” justified an increase to a maximum of one and a half
days (s. 719(3.1) ).  Those provisions are the subject of two decisions of this
Court which are being concurrently released:  R. v. Summers, [2014]
1 S.C.R. 575, and R. v. Carvery, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 605.  These
decisions considered what “circumstances” would justify an increase to the
maximum allowable credit.  

[7]                             
On February 20 and 21, 2010, Mr. Clarke
committed a number of offences, including break and enter. The amendments were
enacted on February 22, 2010.  He was charged in March, 2010.

[8]                             
Mr. Clarke pleaded guilty on November 10, 2010
and was sentenced to 10 years.  The trial judge gave him the maximum allowable
credit under the amendments of one and a half days for each day spent in
pre-sentence custody.  His sentence was therefore reduced by 17 months.  

[9]                             
Mr. Clarke argued unsuccessfully at trial and
before the Court of Appeal that on a proper interpretation of s. 5, the Truth
in Sentencing Act did not apply to him because the offences were
committed before the legislation came into force and he was therefore entitled
to the two or three days’ credit that was available when the offences were
committed.  Rather than bring a direct Charter  challenge, he argued that
the provision was ambiguous and that Charter  values should therefore be
applied in a way that gave s. 5  prospective effect. 

[10]                         
It is true that new sentencing legislation
should be presumed not to apply retrospectively (R. v. Dineley, [2012] 3
S.C.R. 272). The presumption can be displaced, however, by a clear legislative
direction that a provision is to apply retrospectively.  The requirement for
clarity, as Deschamps J. noted in Dineley, ensures that  

the cases in which legislation has
retrospective effect must be exceptional. . . . New legislation that affects
substantive rights will be presumed to have only prospective effect unless it
is possible to discern a clear legislative intent that it is to apply retrospectively
. . . . [para. 10]

[11]                         
In this case, the language is sufficiently clear
to rebut the presumption. With respect, it is difficult to find a less
ambiguous expression of statutory intent than in the simple language of s. 5. 
It states clearly that the new provisions apply to persons charged after the Act
came into force.  The only triggering event is when the person was charged,
regardless of when the offences were committed. 

[12]                         
The absence of ambiguity also precludes the
application of the interpretive assistance of Charter  values, which only
play a role if there is genuine ambiguity as to the meaning of a provision (Bell
ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, and R.
v. Rodgers, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 554). If the statute is unambiguous, the
court must give effect to the clearly expressed legislative intent. 

[13]                         
The role of Charter  values in
interpreting statutes was explained by Iacobucci J. in Bell ExpressVu as
follows:

. .
. to the extent this Court has recognized a “Charter  values”
interpretive principle, such principle can only receive application in
circumstances of genuine ambiguity, i.e., where a statutory provision is
subject to differing, but equally plausible, interpretations. [Emphasis in
original; para. 62.]

 

. . .

 

.
. . a blanket presumption of Charter  consistency could sometimes
frustrate true legislative intent, contrary to what is mandated by the
preferred approach to statutory construction. . . . [para. 64]

 

. . . 

 

. .
. if courts were to interpret all statutes such that they conformed to the Charter ,
this would wrongly upset the dialogic balance. Every time the principle were
applied, it would pre-empt judicial review on Charter  grounds, where
resort to the internal checks and balances of s. 1  may be had. In this fashion,
the legislatures would be largely shorn of their constitutional power to enact
reasonable limits on Charter  rights and freedoms, which would in turn be
inflated to near absolute status. Quite literally, in order to avoid this
result a legislature would somehow have to set out its justification for
qualifying the Charter  right expressly in the statutory text, all
without the benefit of judicial discussion regarding the limitations that are
permissible in a free and democratic society. Before long, courts would be
asked to interpret this sort of enactment in light of Charter 
principles. The patent unworkability of such a scheme highlights the importance
of retaining a forum for dialogue among the branches of governance. As such,
where a statute is unambiguous, courts must give effect to the clearly
expressed legislative intent and avoid using the Charter to achieve a different
result. [Emphasis added; para. 66.]

[14]                         
In Rodgers, Charron J. confirmed these
interpretive borders in the criminal law context:

. .
. It has long been accepted that courts should apply and develop common law
rules in accordance with the values and principles enshrined in the Charter  .
. . . However, it is equally well settled that, in the interpretation of a
statute, Charter  values as an interpretative tool can only play a role
where there is a genuine ambiguity in the legislation. In other words, where
the legislation permits two different, yet equally plausible, interpretations,
each of which is equally consistent with the apparent purpose of the statute, it
is appropriate to prefer the interpretation that accords with Charter principles.
However, where a statute is not ambiguous, the court must give effect to the
clearly expressed legislative intent and not use the Charter to achieve a different
result. . . . [Emphasis added; para. 18.]

 

If
this limit were not imposed on the use of the Charter  as an
interpretative tool, the application of Charter  principles as an
overarching rule of statutory interpretation could well frustrate the
legislator’s intent in the enactment of the provision. Moreover, it would
deprive the Charter of its more powerful purpose — the determination of
the constitutional validity of the legislation . . . . [para. 19]

[15]                         
The requirement of statutory ambiguity as a
prerequisite to the application of Charter  values was most recently
acknowledged in R. v. Mabior, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584, where the
Chief Justice stated that Charter  values are “always relevant” to the
interpretation of a “disputed” provision of the Criminal Code  (para.
44).  The two cases relied on by the Chief Justice for this proposition — R.
v. Sharpe, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45, at para. 33 and Application under
s. 83.28 of the Criminal Code (Re), [2004] 2 S.C.R. 248, at para. 35 — both
assert that where more than one interpretation of a provision is equally
plausible, Charter  values should be used to determine which
interpretation is constitutionally compliant.

[16]                         
Nor, with respect, is Mr. Clarke assisted by Doré
v. Barreau du Québec, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 395, which was referred to by the
Alberta Court of Appeal in Serdyuk.  Only in the administrative law context is ambiguity not the
divining rod that attracts Charter  values. Instead, administrative law
decision-makers “must act consistently with the values underlying the grant of
discretion, including Charter  values” (Doré, at para. 24). The issue in the administrative context therefore, is
not whether the statutory language is so ambiguous as to engage Charter 
values, it is whether the exercise of discretion by the administrative
decision-maker unreasonably limits the Charter  protections in light of
the legislative objective of the statutory scheme. 

[17]                         
In the case before us, as Laskin J.A. noted in
his inarguable reasons, “[t]he words of s. 5 are clear and admit of only one
meaning”, namely: 

. .
. The new provisions apply to the sentencing of all persons charged after the
Act came into force, no matter when the offences were committed. . . . [T]o
give effect to the appellant’s position, one would have to read into s. 5 the
following underlined words:

 

[The
new provisions], as enacted by s. 3, apply only to persons charged with an
offence committed after the day on which those [provisions] come into
force. [para. 19]

 

Parliament
has to be taken to know the difference between the date an offence takes place
and the date a person is charged with the offence.  To read in those underlined
words would change Parliament’s intent on the applicability of the Truth in
Sentencing Act.  The trial judge’s interpretation of the Act is therefore
consistent with the plain words of the statute. [para. 20]

 

. . .

 

One
obvious purpose of the Truth in Sentencing Act is to reduce the credit
available for the population of offenders detained before sentencing.  The
triggering date for detention before sentencing is the date the person is
charged and held pending a bail hearing.  The date a person commits an offence
is of no relevance to this purpose of the Truth in Sentencing Act. . . .
[Text in brackets in original; para. 22.]

[18]                         
Mr. Clarke was charged after the Act came
into force.  He was therefore subject to the credit limits for pre-sentence
custody in accordance with s. 5.

The appeal is dismissed.

on appeal from the court of appeal for nova scotia

                    Criminal
law — Sentencing — Considerations — Credit for pre-sentence detention — Criminal
Code permitting enhanced credit at rate of up to one and one-half days for
every day of detention “if the circumstances justify it” — Sentencing judge
applying enhanced credit on basis of lost eligibility for early release — Whether
sentencing judge erred by granting credit for pre-sentence custody at rate of
one and one-half to one to account for loss of early release — Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , ss. 719(3) , 719(3.1) .

                    The
accused was on remand for 9.5 months.  The sentencing judge assigned a
credit calculated at a rate of one and one-half to one, on the basis of loss of
remission and parole eligibility.  The Court of Appeal upheld the decision
finding that the legislation provides for judicial discretion to grant credit
of up to 1.5 to 1 for time spent in pre-sentence custody on the basis of loss
of remission or parole eligibility.

                    Held:  The appeal
should be dismissed.

                    For
the reasons given in R. v. Summers, the circumstances justifying enhanced
credit of up to one and one-half days for every day of pre-trial detention
under s. 719(3.1)  of the Criminal Code  include the effect of pre-sentence
detention on access to early release.  In this case, there is nothing in the
record to indicate that the accused would be denied early release, and the
accused did not try to drag out his remand to manipulate or “game” the system. 
Thus, there are no grounds to interfere with the sentencing judge’s exercise of
discretion.

Introduction

[1]                             
Like its companion case, R. v. Summers,
2014 SCC 26, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 575, this appeal concerns the interpretation of s.
719(3.1)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .  This provision
allows judges to assign credit for pre-sentence detention at a rate of 1.5 days
for every day of detention “if the circumstances justify it”.  Pre-sentence
detention does not count towards eligibility for early release or parole, and
thus may result in a longer period of incarceration than if the offender were
released on bail.  The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal concluded that this loss of
eligibility for parole and early release is a “circumstance” justifying credit
at a rate of 1.5 to 1.

[2]                             
In light of the principles articulated in Summers,
and for the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.

II.          
Statutory Provisions

[3]                             
In 2009, Parliament enacted the Truth in
Sentencing Act, S.C. 2009, c. 29 (TISA).  Section 3 of the TISA amended
s. 719(3)  of the Criminal Code  and added s. 719(3.1)  as follows
(changes underlined):

     (3) In determining the
sentence to be imposed on a person convicted of an offence, a court may take
into account any time spent in custody by the person as a result of the offence
but the court shall limit any credit for that time to a maximum of one day
for each day spent in custody.

 

     (3.1) Despite subsection (3), if the circumstances justify
it, the maximum is one and one-half days for each day spent in custody unless
the reason for detaining the person in custody was stated in the record under
subsection 515(9.1) or the person was detained in custody under subsection
524(4) or (8).

III.       
Background

A.          
Facts

[4]                             
On September 9, 2010, the respondent was
arrested for being on the street after midnight in violation of his bail
conditions.  A search incident to arrest disclosed five grams of crack cocaine
in his sweatshirt.

[5]                             
He was not released on bail.  His trial was
scheduled for November 16, at which point he pled guilty to the charges of
possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and breach of his
recognizance.

[6]                             
Sentencing was adjourned to December 13;
however, defence counsel requested a pre-sentence report.  On January 13, 2011,
sentencing was again adjourned when the respondent announced his intention to
withdraw his guilty plea. Proceedings were repeatedly adjourned to permit the
respondent to retain and instruct alternate counsel. On May 27, 2011, new
counsel indicated that the respondent would not withdraw his guilty plea.

[7]                             
The sentencing hearing ultimately took place on
June 9, 2011 and the decision was rendered on June 22.  The respondent was on
remand for 9.5 months.

B.           
Sentencing Decision, 2011 NSPC 35, 305 N.S.R.
(2d) 167

[8]                             
The Crown sought a sentence of four years’
imprisonment, less credit of 9.5 months, calculated at a rate of 1 to 1.  The
defence ultimately sought a sentence of two years, less credit, calculated at a
rate of 1.5 to 1.

[9]                             
The sentencing judge determined the fit sentence
was 30 months.  Derrick Prov. Ct. J. concluded that loss of remission and
parole eligibility can justify enhanced credit under s. 719(3.1) .  She
concluded that s. 719(3.1)  was deliberately not limited to “exceptional
circumstances” and that the common law had long recognized that credit at a
rate in excess of 1 to 1 is fair.

[10]                         
Derrick Prov. Ct. J. concluded that the
respondent’s actions did not disentitle him from receiving enhanced credit
because he was not dragging out his remand to manipulate the system.  While the
respondent could have been sentenced earlier, had he not explored the
possibility of withdrawing his guilty plea, it would not be appropriate to
penalize him for considering a legal option.  She agreed that the conditions in
which the respondent was detained did not themselves justify enhanced credit.

[11]                         
The sentencing judge assigned credit of 14
months and one week, calculated at a rate of 1.5 to 1, on the basis of loss of
remission and parole eligibility.

C.           
Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, 2012 NSCA 107, 321
N.S.R. (2d) 321

[12]                         
The Crown appealed on the grounds that enhanced
credit at a rate higher than 1 to 1 is available only in exceptional
circumstances.  The Crown further argued that, even if a rate higher than 1 to
1 were available, it would be inappropriate on the facts of this case.

[13]                         
Beveridge J.A., writing for the Court of Appeal,
engaged in a detailed analysis of s. 719(3.1)  and concluded that
“circumstances” justifying enhanced credit need not be exceptional. 
Pre-sentence credit is generally granted because the conditions on remand are
usually harsher than those when serving a sentence and because pre-sentence
custody does not count towards remission or parole eligibility.

[14]                         
Thus, Beveridge J.A. concluded that the
legislation provides for judicial discretion to grant credit of up to 1.5 to 1
for time spent in pre-sentence custody on the basis of loss of remission or
parole eligibility.  He noted that the application of s. 719(3.1)  would
not be automatic — it would still be necessary to establish that an offender
would have earned remission or been granted parole, although doing so will not
be onerous.

[15]                         
A trial judge’s decision to credit pre-sentence
custody is discretionary, and in this case, there was no error in principle
justifying appellate intervention.

IV.       
Issue

[16]                         
Did the sentencing judge err by granting credit
for pre-sentence custody at a rate of 1.5 to 1 to account for loss of early
release?

V.          
Analysis

[17]                         
For the reasons given in the companion case, Summers,
I conclude that the “circumstances” justifying enhanced credit under s.
719(3.1)  include the effect of pre-sentence detention on access to early
release.  Therefore, the only remaining question is whether the sentencing
judge erred in granting enhanced credit on the facts of this case.

[18]                         
The Crown argues that the respondent’s own
actions disentitled him from receiving enhanced credit.

[19]                         
Much of the pre-sentencing delay was caused by
the respondent’s indecision as to whether he would plead guilty, and the
changes in counsel this necessitated.

[20]                         
However, the sentencing judge found that the respondent
did not try to drag out his remand to manipulate or “game” the system (paras.
55-56).  That finding was available to the sentencing judge on this record and
there are no grounds to set it aside.

[21]                         
Credit at a rate of 1.5 to 1 does not allow the
respondent to derive a “benefit” from the delay, unless he ultimately does not
qualify for early release.  Indeed, while that rate compensates for loss of
early release, if the respondent were to be paroled at any time before the 2/3
mark of his sentence, he would end up spending more time in jail because of the
delay, notwithstanding the enhanced credit.

[22]                         
There is nothing in the record to indicate that
the respondent would be denied early release.  Therefore, I agree with the
Court of Appeal that there are no grounds to interfere with the sentencing
judge’s exercise of discretion.

[23]                         
I would dismiss the appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

                    Criminal
law — Sentencing — Considerations — Credit for pre-sentence detention — Criminal
Code permitting enhanced credit at rate of up to one and one-half days for every
day of pre-sentence detention “if the circumstances justify it” — Sentencing
judge applying enhanced credit on basis of lost eligibility for early release
and parole — Whether lost opportunity for early release and parole during pre-sentence
detention can be circumstance capable of justifying enhanced credit at rate of
one and one-half to one — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , ss. 719(3) ,
719(3.1) .

                    The
Truth in Sentencing Act, passed in 2009, changed the statutory regime
governing credit for pre-sentence detention.  Parliament modified s. 719(3) 
of the Criminal Code  to limit credit for pre-trial custody “to a maximum
of one day for each day spent in custody”.  Parliament also provided in s. 719(3.1) 
that despite that limit, “if the circumstances justify it, the maximum is one
and one-half days for each day spent in custody”.

                    In
this case, the accused was on remand for 10.5 months.  The sentencing
judge assigned a credit calculated at a rate of 1.5 to 1, on the basis that pre-trial
detention did not count towards parole eligibility for the accused. The judge
found that this was a circumstance justifying credit at a ratio of 1.5 to 1
under the Criminal Code .  The Court of Appeal agreed and dismissed the
appeal.

                    Held:  The appeal
should be dismissed.

                    When
an accused person is not granted bail, and must be remanded in jail awaiting
trial, the Criminal Code  allows time served to be credited towards a
resulting sentence of imprisonment.  Historically, the Code imposed no
restrictions on the reasons for giving credit, nor the rate at which credit was
granted. 

                    Courts
generally gave enhanced credit, at a rate higher than one day for every day of
detention, for two reasons.  First, statutory rules for parole eligibility and
early release do not take into account time spent in custody before sentencing.
Therefore, the quantitative rationale recognized that pre-sentence
detention almost always needs to be credited at a rate higher than 1:1 to
ensure that an offender who is released after serving two thirds of his
sentence serves the same total amount of time in jail whether or not he is
released on bail.  Second, the qualitative rationale for enhanced credit
recognized that conditions in detention centres tended to be harsher than
corrections facilities.  As a result of these twin rationales, a practice
developed over time of granting credit for pre-sentence detention at a rate of
2:1.

                    The
Truth in Sentencing Act caps pre-sentence credit, but does not alter the
reasons for which it may be assigned.  Section 719(3.1)  is free of any
language limiting the scope of what may constitute “circumstances” justifying
enhanced credit.  While Parliament clearly turned its attention to the
circumstances under which s. 719(3.1)  should not apply, the provision is
devoid of any limiting language which would support the position that
“circumstances” resulting from the operation of law, and specifically lost
eligibility for early release and parole, could not justify enhanced credit.

                    While
s. 719(3.1) is structured as an exception to s. 719(3) , there is no
general rule of statutory interpretation that the circumstances falling under
an exception must be numerically fewer than those falling under the general
rule. Therefore, it is not a concern that most remand offenders will qualify
for enhanced credit on the basis of lost eligibility for early release or
parole.  Further, an interpretation of “circumstances” that includes loss of
eligibility for parole and early release does not render s. 719(3) 
redundant.  Where an accused falls under an explicit exception to s. 719(3.1),
the one-for-one cap set by s. 719(3)  will apply.  In addition, the
structure of s. 719 is consistent with the rationales for the existence of
pre-sentence credit.  Section 719(3)  reflects the general rationale for
giving credit; any time in jail should generally be credited day for day.  On
the other hand, s. 719(3.1) reflects the rationale for enhanced credit.
Crediting a day in pre-sentence custody as a day served is insufficient to
account for both loss of eligibility for parole and early release
(circumstances with quantitative impact) and the harshness of the conditions
(circumstances with qualitative impact).  

                    The
practice of using the former s. 719(3)  to award enhanced credit for both
the quantitative and qualitative consequences of pre-sentence detention was
deeply entrenched in our sentencing system.  It is inconceivable that
Parliament intended to overturn a principled and long-standing sentencing
practice, without using explicit language, by instead relying on inferences
that could possibly be drawn from the order of certain provisions in the Criminal
Code .  Rather, it seems more likely that Parliament intended to do what it
did explicitly.  The amendments clearly impose a cap on the rate at which
credit can be awarded, at 1.5 to 1.  Having made its intention so clear on that
point, Parliament gave no indication it intended to alter the reasons for which
enhanced credit can be granted.  Neither the language of the provision nor the
external evidence demonstrates a clear intention to abolish one of the
principled rationales for enhanced credit.  

                    As
the legislature is presumed to have created a coherent, consistent and
harmonious statutory scheme, s. 719 should be interpreted in a manner that
is consistent with the principles and purposes of sentencing set out in the Criminal
Code .  A rule that results in longer sentences for offenders who do not
obtain bail, compared to otherwise identical offenders is incompatible with the
sentencing principles of parity and proportionality.  This is particularly so,
given that vulnerable and impoverished offenders are less able to access bail.

                    The
loss of early release, taken alone, will generally be a sufficient basis to
award credit at the rate of 1.5 to 1, even if the conditions of detention are
not particularly harsh, and parole is unlikely.  However, if it appears to a
sentencing judge that an offender will be denied early release, there is no
reason to assign enhanced credit for the meaningless lost opportunity.  The
onus is on the offender to demonstrate that he should be awarded enhanced
credit based upon his pre-sentence detention.  Of course, the Crown may
challenge the inference that the offender has lost eligibility for parole or
early release, justifying enhanced credit.  Extensive evidence will rarely be
necessary.  A practical approach is required that does not complicate or
prolong the sentencing process. 

                    Here,
the sentencing judge did not err in law by granting enhanced credit under s. 719(3.1)
on the basis of the accused’s loss of eligibility for early release and
parole.  There is no serious challenge to the conclusion that the accused was
likely to access early release.  It was therefore appropriate to grant credit
at a rate of 1.5 days for every day in detention on the basis of the
quantitative rationale for enhanced credit.

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
When an accused person is not granted bail, and
must be remanded in jail awaiting trial, the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C-46 , allows time served to be credited towards a resulting sentence of
imprisonment.  A day in jail should count as a day in jail.

[2]                             
However, crediting a single day for every day
spent in a remand centre is often insufficient to account for the full impact
of that detention, both quantitatively and qualitatively.  Time in a remand
centre does not count for the purposes of eligibility for parole, earned
remission or statutory release, and this can result in a longer term of actual
incarceration for offenders who were denied bail.  Moreover, conditions in
remand centres tend to be particularly harsh; they are often overcrowded and
dangerous, and do not provide rehabilitative programs.

[3]                             
As a result, for many years courts frequently
granted “enhanced” credit:  2 days for each day spent in pre-sentence custody. 
This practice was endorsed by this Court in R. v. Wust, 2000 SCC 18,
[2000] 1 S.C.R. 455.  When conditions were exceptionally harsh, judges granted
credit at a rate of 3 to 1 or more.

[4]                             
The Truth in Sentencing Act, S.C. 2009,
c. 29 (TISA), passed in 2009, amended the Criminal Code  to cap
pre-sentence credit at a maximum of 1.5 days for every day in custody.  The
purpose was to remove any incentive for an accused to drag out time in remand
custody, and to provide transparency so that the public would know what the fit
sentence was, how much credit had been given, and why.

[5]                             
In this case, the Court is called upon to
interpret these amendments.  There is no dispute that Parliament imposed a cap
on enhanced credit at a rate of 1.5 to 1.  However, there are conflicting lower
court decisions on when “enhanced” credit at a rate higher than 1 to 1 is available.

[6]                             
The statute does not definitively address the
issue, providing simply that enhanced credit is available when “the
circumstances justify it” (s. 719(3.1) ).  The legislative history is
contradictory and inconclusive.  We must interpret the provisions to determine
what “circumstances” justify enhanced credit of up to a rate of 1.5 to 1. The
appellant, the Attorney General of Ontario, argues that the loss of eligibility
for parole and statutory release cannot be a “circumstance” justifying enhanced
credit under the new s. 719(3.1)  of the Criminal Code .[1]  The Ontario Court of Appeal in this case and the Nova Scotia Court
of Appeal in the companion case, R. v. Carvery, 2012 NSCA 107, 321
N.S.R. (2d) 321, came to the opposite conclusion,[2] and held
that the loss of eligibility for parole and statutory release is a
“circumstance” that can justify enhanced credit.

[7]                             
In my view, while the Truth in Sentencing Act
caps pre-sentence credit, it does not limit the “circumstances” that justify
granting credit.  Where Parliament intended to alter existing practice, as with
respect to the maximum amount of credit, it did so expressly.  However, the
legislation excludes no particular “circumstances” from consideration.  Had
Parliament intended to alter the well-established rule that enhanced credit
compensates for the loss of eligibility for early release, it would have done
so expressly.

II.          
Statutory Provisions

[8]                             
This appeal concerns amendments to s. 719(3)  of
the Criminal Code , resulting from the TISA.  Sections 719(3)  and 719(3.1) 
now read (changes underlined):

     (3) In determining the
sentence to be imposed on a person convicted of an offence, a court may take
into account any time spent in custody by the person as a result of the offence
but the court shall limit any credit for that time to a maximum of one day
for each day spent in custody.

 

     (3.1) Despite subsection (3), if the circumstances justify
it, the maximum is one and one-half days for each day spent in custody unless
the reason for detaining the person in custody was stated in the record under
subsection 515(9.1)  or the person was detained in custody under subsection
524(4)  or (8) .

Background

A.          
Facts

[9]                             
On July 9, 2010, Sean Summers, the respondent,
violently shook his infant daughter, resulting in her death three days later. 
He was initially arrested on a charge of second degree murder but, in April
2011, that information was withdrawn and he was charged with manslaughter.  On
May 30, 2011, he pleaded guilty to manslaughter.

[10]                         
The respondent was in custody for a period of
10.5 months, from his arrest in July 2010 until he pleaded guilty and was
sentenced, in May 2011.  There has been no suggestion that the conditions of
detention were unusually harsh.

B.           
Sentencing Decision, [2011] O.J. No. 6377 (QL)
(S.C.J.)

[11]                         
Counsel agreed that an appropriate range for the
sentence was between eight and ten years’ imprisonment.

[12]                         
Defence counsel argued that the respondent
should receive credit at a rate of 1.5 days for every day in custody; the lost
eligibility for early release and parole while in remand custody was a
circumstance justifying the application of s. 719(3.1) of the Code. 
The Crown did not object to granting credit for the first six months of
detention at a rate of 1.5 to 1; during this time, the accused was waiting for
a post-mortem report to be disclosed.  As for the rest of the detention, the
Crown invited the judge to use his discretion in assessing credit.

[13]                         
The sentencing judge, Glithero J., of the
Ontario Superior Court of Justice, reasoned that the traditional practice of granting
credit at a rate of two days for every day in detention was based upon the fact
that time served on remand did not count towards parole eligibility.  Since
most offenders are released on parole between the one-third and two-third marks
of their sentences, it would be inequitable not to give enhanced credit to
reflect time in pre-trial custody.  The fact that pre-trial detention did not
count towards parole eligibility for the respondent was a circumstance
justifying credit at a ratio of 1.5:1 under s. 719(3.1) of the Code.

[14]                         
The judge sentenced the respondent to 8 years’
imprisonment, less a credit of 16 months for 10.5 months of pre-trial
detention.  This resulted in a sentence of 6 years and 8 months.

C.           
Ontario Court of Appeal, 2013 ONCA 147, 114 O.R.
(3d) 641

[15]                         
The Crown appealed on the basis that, under s.
719(3.1) , credit cannot be assigned at a rate of 1.5:1 solely to account for an
accused’s loss of eligibility for early release and parole.

[16]                         
Cronk J.A., writing for the Court of Appeal,
concluded that enhanced credit under s. 719(3.1)  was not limited to exceptional
circumstances and could be justified on the basis of lost eligibility for early
release and parole.  She engaged in a thoughtful and thorough interpretation of
s. 719(3.1) , considering the text of the TISA, its legislative history,
and the principles that underpin the Criminal Code  sentencing scheme.

[17]                         
The Court of Appeal clarified that not every
remand offender will be granted enhanced credit under s. 719(3.1)  on the basis
of lost eligibility for early release and parole.  These may be circumstances
justifying credit, but only if the accused would probably have received early
release or parole.  A judge retains the discretion to deny credit at the
enhanced rate, for example when an accused intentionally delayed proceedings. 
Certain offenders are expressly excluded from s. 719(3.1) , and are
therefore entitled to no more than one-for-one pre-trial credit under s.
719(3) .

[18]                         
Given that there was no basis to conclude that
the respondent would have been denied parole or early release, there was no
error in granting enhanced credit at a rate of 1.5:1 to account for lost early
release and parole eligibility.

IV.       
Issue

[19]                         
Is ineligibility for early release and parole
while on remand a “circumstance” that can justify granting enhanced credit for
pre-sentence custody under s. 719(3.1)  of the Criminal Code ?

V.          
Analysis

A.          
Prior Regime for Crediting Pre-Sentence Custody

[20]                         
Prior to the enactment of the TISA in
2009, s. 719(3)  of the Criminal Code  simply provided that a sentencing
court “may take into account any time spent in custody by the person as a
result of the offence”.  The Code imposed no restrictions on the reasons
for giving credit, nor the rate at which credit was granted.  In R. v.
Rezaie (1996), 31 O.R. (3d) 713, Laskin J.A. of the Ontario Court of Appeal
explained the rationale for granting credit.  He noted that

a judge should not deny credit without
good reason. To do so offends one’s sense of fairness. Incarceration at any
stage of the criminal process is a denial of an accused’s liberty.  [p. 721]

[21]                         
This recognized that it would be unfair if a day
spent in custody, prior to sentencing, were not counted towards an offender’s
ultimate sentence.  Otherwise, an offender who spent time in pre-sentence
custody would serve longer in jail than an identical offender who committed an
identical offence, but was granted bail.  Thus, a day of incarceration requires
at least a credit of one day towards the sentence.

[22]                         
Courts generally gave enhanced credit in
recognition of the fact that “in two respects, pre-trial custody is even more
onerous than post-sentencing custody” (Rezaie, at p. 721).  As Laskin
J.A. explained:

First, other than for a sentence of
life imprisonment, legislative provisions for parole eligibility and statutory
release do not take into account time spent in custody before trial (or before
sentencing).  Second, local detention centres ordinarily do not provide
educational, retraining or rehabilitation programs to an accused in custody
awaiting trial.  [ibid.]

[23]                         
First, the quantitative rationale for the
practice of granting enhanced credit is to ensure that the offender does not
spend more time behind bars than if he had been released on bail.

[24]                         
Under the Corrections and Conditional Release
Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20  (CCRA ), parole becomes available
to a federal inmate after one third of the sentence has been served (s. 120 ),
and statutory release is available once two thirds of the sentence has been
served (s. 127(3) ).  Provincial inmates can earn essentially equivalent “earned
remission”, absent bad conduct, credited at 15 days per month as calculated
under the federal Prisons and Reformatories Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-20 ,
s. 6 .[3]  Throughout these reasons, I refer to statutory release and earned
remission collectively as “early release”.

[25]                         
In practice, the “vast majority of those serving
reformatory sentences are released on ‘remission’ . . . at approximately the
two-thirds point in their sentence”, and only two to three percent of federal
prisoners are not released either by way of parole or “statutory release”:  C.
C. Ruby, G. J. Chan and N. R. Hasan, Sentencing (8th ed. 2012), at §§13.38
and 13.39.

[26]                         
Because a sentence begins when it is imposed (s.
719(1)) and the statutory rules for parole eligibility and early release do not
take into account time spent in custody before sentencing, pre-sentence
detention almost always needs to be credited at a rate higher than 1:1 in order
to ensure that it does not prejudice the offender.

[27]                         
A ratio of 1.5:1 ensures that an offender who is
released after serving two thirds of his sentence serves the same amount of
time in jail, whether or not he is subject to pre-sentence detention.  A higher
ratio than 1.5:1 was therefore often used to account for other circumstances,
including the loss of parole eligibility (i.e., the loss of the opportunity to
be released after serving one third of the sentence).

[28]                         
The second rationale for enhanced credit is qualitative
in nature.  Remand detention centres tend not to provide the educational,
retraining or rehabilitation programs that are generally available when serving
a sentence in corrections facilities.  Consequently, time in pre-trial
detention is often more onerous than post-sentence incarceration.  As Cronk
J.A. noted in this case, overcrowding, inmate turnover, labour disputes and
other factors also tend to make pre-sentence detention more onerous.

[29]                         
The impact of overcrowding, or a lack of
educational programs, varies depending on the particular offender’s needs,
character and disposition.  Assigning enhanced credit on this basis is a
qualitative, fact-dependent and discretionary exercise.

[30]                         
As a result of these twin rationales, a practice
developed over time of granting credit for pre-sentence detention at a rate of
2:1.  In Wust, this Court endorsed this practice, but noted that the
correct rate cannot be determined by a rigid formula, and is best left to the
sentencing judge.

[31]                         
For example, when an accused was detained in a
remand institution with full access to educational and rehabilitation programs,
credit at a ratio of less than 2:1 was sometimes appropriate (although some
enhanced credit was still generally appropriate to account for the quantitative
rationale).  Similarly, when extended pre-sentence detention could be
attributed to bad conduct on the part of the accused (such as breaching bail
conditions), that militated against enhanced credit (Rezaie).  By
contrast, when an offender was subjected to particularly harsh conditions,
rates as high as 3:1 or (rarely) 4:1 were sometimes applied.

B.           
The Interpretation of Section 719(3.1) 

[32]                         
In 2009, Parliament changed the statutory
regime governing credit for pre-sentence detention.  As noted above, the TISA
amended s. 719  of the Criminal Code  in two relevant ways.  First,
Parliament modified s. 719(3)  to limit credit for pre-trial custody “to a
maximum of one day for each day spent in custody”.  Second, Parliament provided
in s. 719(3.1)  that despite that limit, “if the circumstances justify it, the
maximum is one and one-half days for each day spent in custody” unless the
accused was detained pending trial for specific reasons such as breach of bail
conditions.

[33]                         
Our task in this case is to interpret these
provisions.  Specifically, we must determine the meaning of “circumstances” in
s. 719(3.1) , and whether the lost opportunity for early release and parole in
pre-sentence detention can be such a circumstance, capable of justifying
enhanced credit at a rate of 1.5:1.

[34]                         
I conclude that loss of access to parole and
early release constitutes a “circumstance” capable of justifying enhanced
credit.  In reaching this conclusion, I am in substantial agreement with the
exemplary reasons of both Cronk J.A. in this case, and Beveridge J.A. in the
companion case Carvery.

[35]                         
In the reasons that follow, I discuss: (1) the
text of the provision, (2) the structure of the section, (3) the intention of Parliament,
and (4) the scheme of the Criminal Code  (see Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes
Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27).  In my view, the meaning of the
provision is clear on the basis of conventional principles of statutory
interpretation, and it is therefore neither appropriate nor necessary to have
recourse to the presumption that the legislation conforms to the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms :  see Bell ExpressVu Limited
Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at paras.
28-30 and 61-66.

(1)        
The Text of the Provision

[36]                         
Section 719(3.1)  reads as follows:

(3.1)
Despite subsection (3), if the circumstances justify it, the maximum is one and
one-half days for each day spent in custody unless the reason for detaining the
person in custody was stated in the record under subsection 515(9.1)  or the
person was detained in custody under subsection 524(4)  or (8) .

[37]                         
As Beveridge J.A. and Cronk J.A. noted, this
provision is free of any language limiting the scope of what may constitute
“circumstances”.  The legislature could easily have provided that only
“exceptional circumstances” or “circumstances other than the loss of
eligibility for early release and parole” justify enhanced credit.

[38]                         
As Cronk J.A. observed, language limiting the
scope of the word “circumstances” is used elsewhere in the Criminal Code . 
For example, reference is made to “exceptional circumstances” or “compelling
circumstances” in s.  672.14(3)  (fitness assessments last no longer than
30 days, except they may last for 60 if “compelling circumstances” so warrant),
s. 672.47(2)  (when an accused is found unfit to stand trial, a disposition must
be made within 45 days but, in “exceptional circumstances”, may be made within
90 days) and s. 742.6(16)  (when an offender breaches a conditional sentence
order, in “exceptional cases” some of the suspended sentence may be deemed to
be time served).

[39]                         
The absence of qualifications on “circumstances”
in s. 719(3.1)  is telling since Parliament did restrict enhanced credit,
withholding it from offenders who have been denied bail primarily as a result
of a previous conviction (s. 515(9.1) ), those who contravened their bail
conditions (ss. 524(4) (a) and 524(8) (a)), and those who committed
an indictable offence while on bail (ss. 524(4) (b) and 524(8) (b)). 
Parliament clearly turned its attention to the circumstances under which s.
719(3.1)  should not apply, but did not include any limitations on the
scope of “circumstances” justifying its application.

[40]                         
Consequently, at the hearing before this Court,
the Crown conceded that the circumstances referred to in s. 719(3.1)  need not
be exceptional.  Instead, the Crown took the position that “circumstances”
resulting from operation of law, and specifically lost eligibility for early
release and parole, could not justify enhanced credit.  The Crown argues that
“circumstances” suggest facts that are particular to the offender and do not
include those consequences that are universal and inherent to the statutory
regime.

[41]                         
However, the provision is devoid of any limiting
language supporting this interpretation.  Moreover, the impact of the
legal regime is a circumstance that is particular to each offender because the
law affects offenders differently.  For example, the loss of parole or early
release eligibility will not make a difference to offenders who would not have
received early release or parole in any event.  Moreover, the legislation can
change over time such that its impact on offenders becomes less uniform.

(2)        
Structure of the Section

[42]                         
The Crown submits that s. 719(3)  creates a
general rule of credit at a rate of 1:1, to which s. 719(3.1)  is an exception. 
If lost eligibility for early release or parole, while in pre-sentence custody,
is a “circumstance” justifying enhanced credit of 1.5:1, then almost every
remand offender will qualify.  This would transform the “exception” into the
new “general rule” and render s. 719(3)  irrelevant, an absurd result.

[43]                         
I agree that s. 719(3.1)  is structured as an
exception to s. 719(3) .  Section 719(3.1)  begins with the words “[d]espite
subsection (3)” and applies only when “circumstances justify it”, which tends
to indicate that it is an exception to the general rule.  While marginal notes
are not part of the enactment and are of limited value in statutory
interpretation (Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21 , s. 14 ), the
fact that the subsection has the marginal note “[e]xception” is consistent with
this conclusion.

[44]                         
I also agree with the Crown that it is somewhat
inelegant to create an exception that applies in more cases than the general
rule.  However, the strength of this argument is limited for three reasons.

[45]                         
First, there is no general rule of statutory
interpretation that the circumstances falling under an exception must be
numerically fewer than those falling under the general rule.  If the criteria
that permit departure from a general proposition are satisfied, the numerical
relationship is not relevant.

[46]                         
For example, s. 457(1) of the Code makes
it an offence to make, publish, print, execute, issue, distribute or circulate
anything in the likeness of a current bank-note.  However, s. 457(2) provides
exceptions, including for the Bank of Canada, its employees carrying out their
duties and its contractors.  Presumably, the overwhelming majority of
bank-notes are produced by the Bank of Canada, its employees, and its
contractors, and therefore fall under the exception.

[47]                         
Indeed, Crown counsel accepts that the lack of
programs in detention facilities and overcrowding are common problems, and
could result in exceptions under s. 719(3.1)  that are numerically greater than
those limited by s. 719(3) .

[48]                         
Second, an interpretation of “circumstances”
that includes loss of eligibility for parole and early release does not render
subsection (3) redundant.  Where an accused falls under an explicit exception
to s. 719(3.1)  (for instance, because she has been detained for breach of bail
conditions), the one-for-one cap set by s. 719(3)  will apply.  Moreover,
enhanced credit need not be granted in every case.  For example, when long
periods of pre-sentence detention are attributable to the wrongful conduct of
the offender, enhanced credit will often be inappropriate.  Section 719(3) 
continues to exist for such cases.

[49]                         
Third, the structure of s. 719  is consistent
with the rationales for the existence of pre-sentence credit.  Section 719(3) 
reflects the general rationale for giving credit.  As Laskin J.A. wrote in Rezaie,
at p. 721, “[i]ncarceration at any stage of the criminal process is a denial of
an accused’s liberty” ― any time in jail should generally be credited day
for day.  On the other hand, s. 719(3.1)  reflects the rationale for enhanced
credit.  Crediting a day in pre-sentence custody as a day served is
insufficient to account for the full prejudicial circumstances of remand
custody; enhanced credit accounts for both loss of eligibility for parole and
early release (circumstances with quantitative impact) and the harshness of the
conditions (circumstances with qualitative impact).  Thus, the division between
the subsections reflects the different theoretical underpinnings of credit and
enhanced credit.

[50]                         
Further, this structure builds resilience into
the statutory scheme.  For example, if Parliament were to amend the Corrections
and Conditional Release Act , so that pre-sentence custody counted for the
purposes of parole eligibility and early release,[4] s.
719(3.1)  would only be called upon to account for situations of qualitative
harshness, and an increased number of cases would fall solely under s. 719(3) . 
The structure of the provision logically mirrors the rationales for credit and
enhanced credit.

(3)        
Intention of Parliament

[51]                         
The intention of Parliament can be determined
with reference to the legislative history, including Hansard evidence and
committee debates, although the court should be mindful of the limited
reliability and weight of such evidence (R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the
Construction of Statutes (5th ed. 2008), at pp. 593-94 and 609).

[52]                         
Parliament clearly intended to restrict the
amount of pre-sentence credit.  This is plain from the cap of 1.5 days credit
for every day spent in detention.  It is also consistent with statements made
by the then-Justice Minister, before the House of Commons Standing Committee on
Justice and Human Rights, on May 6, 2009:

The practice
of awarding overly generous credit can put the administration of justice into
disrepute because it creates the impression that offenders are getting more
lenient sentences than they deserve.  The public does not understand how the
final sentence reflects the seriousness of the crime.  For these reasons, the
current practice of routinely awarding two-for-one credit must be curtailed. 

(Evidence, No. 20,
2nd Sess., 40th Parl., at p. 11)

This objective is
achieved regardless of what circumstances may justify the use of enhanced
credit in s. 719(3.1) .

[53]                         
Parliament also intended that the process of
granting credit under s. 719  should be more transparent and easily
understood by the public.  It achieved this end through the insertion of ss.
719(3.2) and 719(3.3), which provide that judges should give reasons for
granting credit and state both the fit sentence and the amount of credit
granted.

[54]                         
However, I agree with Beveridge J.A. and Cronk
J.A. that the intention of Parliament with respect to what “circumstances” may
justify enhanced credit under s. 719(3.1)  is far less clear and even
contradictory (Carvery, at paras. 79-82; Summers, at paras.
82-88).  Therefore, the legislative history is of no assistance in answering
this question.

[55]                         
Parliament is presumed to know the legal context
in which it legislates.[5] The practice of using the former s. 719(3)  to award enhanced credit
for both the quantitative and qualitative consequences of pre-sentence
detention was deeply entrenched in our sentencing system.  This practice was
expressly endorsed by this Court in Wust, where the Court identified the
loss of eligibility for early release and parole as a reason justifying
enhanced credit.

[56]                         
Parliament does, of course, have the power to
exclude these circumstances from consideration (barring a constitutional
challenge).  However, it strikes me as inconceivable that Parliament intended
to overturn a principled and long-standing sentencing practice, without using
explicit language, by instead relying on inferences that could possibly be
drawn from the order of certain provisions in the Criminal Code .

[57]                         
Rather, it seems more likely that Parliament
intended to do what it did explicitly.  The amendments clearly impose a cap
on the rate at which credit can be awarded, at 1.5:1.  This is a substantial
and clear departure from pre-TISA practice.  Having made its intention
so clear on that point, Parliament gave no indication it intended to alter the
reasons for which enhanced credit can be granted.

[58]                         
In my view, neither the language of the
provision nor the external evidence demonstrates a clear intention to abolish
one of the principled rationales for enhanced credit.

(4)        
Scheme of the Sentencing Regime

[59]                         
While the foregoing is sufficient to dispose of
the appeal, I recognize that ss. 719(3)  and 719(3.1)  do not exist in isolation,
but form part of the overall sentencing scheme in the Criminal Code .  As
the legislature is presumed to have created a coherent, consistent and
harmonious statutory scheme, s. 719  should be interpreted in a manner that is
consistent with the principles and purposes of sentencing set out in Part XXIII
of the Criminal Code . Sections 718, 718.1 and 718.2 of the Code
provide:

         718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with
crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a
just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or
more of the following objectives:

 

(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;

 

(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing
offences;

 

(c) to separate offenders from society, where
necessary;

 

(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;

 

(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the
community; and

 

(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and
acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.

 

         718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and
the degree of responsibility of the offender.

 

         718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration
the following principles:

 

. . .

 

(b) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on
similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;

[60]                         
As Beveridge J.A. and Cronk J.A. recognized, an
interpretation of s. 719(3.1)  that does not account for loss of
eligibility for early release and parole during remand custody means that
offenders who do not receive bail will serve longer sentences than otherwise
identical offenders who are granted bail.

[61]                         
This result is incompatible with the parity
principle.  A rule that results in longer sentences for offenders who do not
obtain bail, compared to otherwise identical offenders, does not result in
“similar . . . sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences
committed in similar circumstances”:  s. 718.2(b).

[62]                         
The Crown says that parity does not require
absolute equality and that in any event, enhanced credit is an ineffective tool
to achieve equality between offenders, since it is premised on both being
released on their statutory release date (after two thirds of their sentence). 
In practice, some offenders will be released on parole after one third of their
sentences; others will never be released during their sentence.

[63]                         
Obviously, the scope of the disparity will vary,
depending on if and when offenders are ultimately released.  Nonetheless, a
rule that creates structural differences in sentences, based on criteria
irrelevant to sentencing, is inconsistent with the principle of parity.

[64]                         
The Crown also says that the Court of Appeal’s
reliance on the sentencing principle of proportionality was misplaced. 
Proportionality is simply concerned with the imposition of a just sanction in a
particular case; any comparison with similar offenders is irrelevant.

[65]                         
However, it is difficult to see how sentences
can reliably be “proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of
responsibility of the offender” (s. 718.1) when the length of incarceration is
also a product of the offender’s ability to obtain bail, which is frequently
dependent on totally different criteria.

[66]                         
Judicial interim release requires the judge to
be confident that, amongst other things, the accused will neither flee nor
reoffend while on bail.  When an accused is able to deposit money, or be
released to family and friends acting as sureties (who often pledge money
themselves), this can help provide the court with such assurance. 
Unfortunately, those without either a support network of family and friends or
financial means cannot provide these assurances.  Consequently, as the
intervener the John Howard Society submitted, this means that vulnerable and
impoverished offenders are less able to access bail.

[67]                         
For example, Aboriginal people are more likely
to be denied bail, and make up a disproportionate share of the population in
remand custody.[6]  A system that results in consistently longer, harsher sentences
for vulnerable members of society, not based on the wrongfulness of their
conduct but because of their isolation and inability to pay, can hardly be said
to be assigning sentences in line with the principles of parity and proportionality. 
Accounting for loss of early release eligibility through enhanced credit
responds to this concern.

(5)        
Conclusion

[68]                         
For these reasons, I conclude that the
“circumstances” justifying enhanced credit under s. 719(3.1)  may include loss
of eligibility for early release and parole.

[69]                         
To conclude otherwise, it would be necessary for
the Court to read limiting language into s. 719(3.1)  that is simply not there. 
Such an interpretation would result in sentences inconsistent with the Code’s
own statement of principles, and would presume that the legislature intended to
abolish the quantitative rationale for enhanced credit — that offenders should
not be punished more severely because they were not released on bail — without
clear language.  And this despite the well-established practice, endorsed by
this Court in Wust in the year 2000, that enhanced credit can be
justified based upon the loss of eligibility for parole and early release. 
Such a conclusion is not plausible.

C.           
How to Calculate Pre-Sentence Credit

(1)        
Analytical Approach

[70]                         
In determining credit for pre-sentence custody,
judges may credit at most 1.5 days for every day served where circumstances
warrant.  While there is now a statutory maximum, the analytical approach
endorsed in Wust otherwise remains unchanged.  Judges should continue to
assign credit on the basis of the quantitative rationale, to account for lost
eligibility for early release and parole during pre-sentence custody, and the
qualitative rationale, to account for the relative harshness of the conditions
in detention centres.

[71]                         
The loss of early release, taken alone, will
generally be a sufficient basis to award credit at the rate of 1.5 to 1, even
if the conditions of detention are not particularly harsh, and parole is
unlikely.  Of course, a lower rate may be appropriate when detention was a
result of the offender’s bad conduct, or the offender is likely to obtain
neither early release nor parole.  When the statutory exceptions within
s. 719(3.1)  are engaged, credit may only be given at a rate of 1 to 1. 
Moreover, s. 719 is engaged only where the pre-sentence detention is a result
of the offence for which the offender is being sentenced.

[72]                         
This means that two offenders, one of whom lost
the opportunity for early release and parole, and a second who, in addition to
losing those opportunities, was also subject to extremely harsh conditions,
will likely both have credit assigned at a rate of 1.5 to 1.  The unavoidable
consequence of capping pre-sentence credit at this rate is that it is
insufficient to compensate for the harshness of pre-sentence detention in all
cases.  However, this does not mean that credit should be scaled back in order
to “leave room at the top” of the scale for the most egregious cases.  A cap is
a cut-off and means simply that the upper limit will be reached in more cases. 
It should not lead judges to deny or restrict credit when it is warranted.

[73]                         
Indeed, individuals who have suffered
particularly harsh treatment, such as assaults in detention, can often look to
other remedies, including under s. 24(1)  of the Charter .

[74]                         
The sentencing judge is also required to give
reasons for any credit granted (s. 719(3.2)) and to state “the amount of time
spent in custody, the term of imprisonment that would have been imposed before
any credit was granted, the amount of time credited, if any, and the sentence
imposed” (s. 719(3.3)).  This is not a particularly onerous requirement, but
plays an important role in explaining the nature of the sentencing process, and
the reasons for giving credit, to the public.

(2)        
The Particular Offender’s Prospects of Early
Release

[75]                         
For many offenders, the loss of eligibility for
early release and parole will justify credit at a rate of 1.5:1.  However, as
Beveridge J.A. concluded, it is not an “automatic or a foregone conclusion that
a judge must grant credit at more than 1:1 based on loss of remission or
parole” (Carvery, at para. 60).  If it appears to a sentencing judge
that an offender will be denied early release, there is no reason to assign
enhanced credit for the meaningless lost opportunity.

[76]                         
As Beveridge J.A. wrote:

         . . . it would not
be onerous for most offenders to establish that they would have earned
remission or been granted parole, and hence, it is not likely to be a rare
occurrence for an offender to be worthy of a credit of more than 1:1.  [para.
66]

[77]                         
The Crown says it is not appropriate for the
sentencing court to inquire into the likelihood that a particular offender will
receive parole because considerations relating to the administration of the
sentence are irrelevant to sentencing.  Further, it is improper to reduce a
sentence by granting enhanced credit based on speculation about when the
offender may be released.

[78]                         
However, judges are often called upon to make
assessments about an offender’s future, for example by considering prospects
for rehabilitation.  I see no reason why judges cannot draw similar inferences
with respect to the offender’s future conduct in prison and the likelihood of
parole or early release.

[79]                         
The process need not be elaborate.  The onus is
on the offender to demonstrate that he should be awarded enhanced credit as a
result of his pre-sentence detention.  Generally speaking, the fact that
pre-sentence detention has occurred will usually be sufficient to give rise to
an inference that the offender has lost eligibility for parole or early
release, justifying enhanced credit.  Of course, the Crown may respond by
challenging such an inference.  There will be particularly dangerous offenders
who have committed certain serious offences for whom early release and parole
are simply not available.[7]  Similarly, if the accused’s conduct in jail suggests that he is
unlikely to be granted early release or parole, the judge may be justified in
withholding enhanced credit.  Extensive evidence will rarely be necessary.  A
practical approach is required that does not complicate or prolong the
sentencing process.

[80]                         
As well, when evaluating the qualitative
rationale for granting enhanced credit, the onus is on the offender, but it
will generally not be necessary to lead extensive evidence.  Judges have dealt
with claims for enhanced credit for many years.  The conditions and
overcrowding in remand centres are generally well known and often subject to
agreement between the parties; there is no reason this helpful practice should
not continue.  There is no need for a new and elaborate process — the TISA
introduced a cap on the amount of enhanced credit that may be awarded, but did
not alter the process for determining the amount of credit to apply.

(3)        
No Double Counting

[81]                         
The intervener the Quebec Director of Criminal
and Penal Prosecutions argues that factors based on the personal circumstances
of a particular inmate, with no relation to the conditions in which he or she
was detained, cannot justify enhanced credit under s. 719(3.1) .

[82]                         
It has long been recognized that credit for
pre-sentence detention is intended to ensure that individuals are punished equally,
whether they are released on bail or remanded in custody prior to trial. 
Consequently, any circumstances that speak to the relative harshness of
pre-sentence custody, as opposed to serving a sentence, are relevant.

[83]                         
On this basis, it is difficult to see how
factors such as reduced moral culpability of the offender, or the fact that it
was a first conviction, could be relevant circumstances with respect to the relative
harshness of pre-trial detention.  The fact that the respondent entered an
early guilty plea, accepted responsibility for his actions, and expressed
sincere remorse are generally only relevant to the determination of a fit
sentence and not to assigning credit under s. 719(3)  or s. 719(3.1) .  To
consider them again is what was described as “double dipping”.

VI.       
Application to the Facts

[84]                         
The sentencing judge did not err in law by
granting enhanced credit under s. 719(3.1)  on the basis of the
respondent’s loss of eligibility for early release and parole.

[85]                         
The sentencing judge in this case did not rely
on improper factors in assessing credit for pre-trial detention.  In his
analysis of the appropriate credit, the judge focused on the lack of access to
parole, not the respondent’s guilty plea and remorse (paras. 39-43).  His
discussion of the latter factors was directed at sentencing generally.

[86]                         
To the extent Cronk J.A. referred to these
considerations, at para. 124 of her decision, I take her to be suggesting they
are relevant for the limited purpose of determining whether the respondent was
likely to be granted parole (which is relevant to whether the respondent, in
fact, lost the opportunity for parole and early release).  She did not treat
them as independent circumstances justifying enhanced credit.

[87]                         
I agree with Cronk J.A. that there was no basis
to think that the respondent would be denied parole or early release.  She said
of Crown counsel at trial:

By her reference to the likelihood of
early parole for the respondent, she also conceded, in effect, the respondent’s
good behaviour while in remand custody.  Certainly, she did not suggest that
the respondent’s conduct would in any way disentitle him to earned remission or
negatively affect his statutory release and parole eligibility.  [para. 125]

[88]                         
While little evidence was available on this
point, there is no serious challenge to the conclusion that the respondent was
likely to access parole and early release.  Therefore, it was appropriate to
grant credit at a rate of 1.5 days for every day in detention on the basis of
the quantitative rationale for enhanced credit.

[89]                         
I would dismiss the appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

                    Criminal law — Evidence — Disclosure — Whether police occurrence reports prepared in the investigation of
unrelated incidents involving a complainant or witness are “records” within the
meaning of s. 278.1 of the Criminal Code, such that they are subject to the
Mills regime — Whether
the exemption for investigatory and prosecutorial records applies to all police
occurrence reports or only those made in relation to the offence in question — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 ,
ss. 278.1  to 278.91 .

                    Q
was charged with sexually assaulting two complainants.  Before
trial, Q made an application seeking disclosure of certain police
occurrence reports which involved a complainant but which were not made in the
course of the investigation of the charges against Q.  The trial judge ruled
that the occurrence reports at issue were “records” under the Mills
regime, specifically s. 278.1  of the Criminal Code .  As such, Q applied
for disclosure of the occurrence reports pursuant to s. 278.3 of the Code. 
The trial judge dismissed the application and Q was ultimately convicted.  The
Court of Appeal allowed Q’s appeal on the basis that the police occurrence
reports were not “records” under the Mills regime and should have been
part of regular Crown disclosure under R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991]
3 S.C.R. 326.  The Court of Appeal therefore ordered a new trial.  

                    Held: The appeal is
allowed, the order for a new trial is set aside, and the conviction is restored
with the sentence appeal remitted to the Court of Appeal.

                    Sections 278.1  to 278.91  of the Criminal
Code , known as the Mills regime, permit disclosure of private
records relating to complainants and witnesses in cases involving particular
sexual offences only where a record is likely relevant and its disclosure is
necessary in the interests of justice.  The regime reflects Parliament’s intention to
accommodate and reconcile the right of the accused to make full answer and
defence with the privacy and equality rights of complainants in sexual offence
cases.  While it governs the disclosure of “records” in
sexual offence trials, the regime does not displace the Crown’s duty to make
reasonable inquiries and obtain potentially relevant material in
accordance with R. v. McNeil, 2009 SCC 3, [2009]
1 S.C.R. 66.

                    Whether
a document counts as a “record” depends first on whether the document contains
personal information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy,
and second on whether it falls into the exemption for investigatory and
prosecutorial documents.  Section 278.1  provides an illustrative list of some
types of records that generally give rise to a reasonable expectation of
privacy, but other documents will still be covered if they attract a reasonable
expectation of privacy. Trial judges will usually assess
reasonable expectations on the basis of the type of document at issue.  Police occurrence reports prepared in the investigation of previous
incidents involving a complainant or witness other than the offence being
prosecuted count as “records”
and are subject to the Mills regime.

                    Given the sensitive nature of the information frequently contained
in such police occurrence reports, and the impact that their disclosure can
have on the privacy interests of complainants and witnesses, there will
generally be a reasonable expectation of privacy in such reports.  Police occurrence reports may contain
highly sensitive material including unproven allegations and statements of
complainants.  They may reveal family status, health information, and other
personal details.  Most significantly, they can reveal previous instances where
the witness or complainant has been the victim of criminal activity, including
previous sexual assaults.  Disclosure of this information engages complainants’
and witnesses’ “informational privacy”, the right to control how their
information is shared.  Disclosure of this information to the accused is
particularly likely to engage the dignity interests of complainants and
witnesses, and to discourage victims of sexual offences from coming forward.  The
fact that this information has already been obtained by police does not destroy
the affected person’s interest in keeping the information private from others. 
People are entitled to provide information to police with confidence that the
police will only disclose it for good reason.

                    The exemption for investigatory and prosecutorial records
contained in s. 278.1  does not strip the protection of the Mills regime
from police occurrence
reports.  In light of the text of the provision in both
languages, as well as its purpose, context, and the consequences of concluding
otherwise, the trial judge was correct in deciding that the
exemption applies only to records made in relation to the offence in question,
and not to police occurrence reports made in the course of unrelated
investigations.

I.         
Overview

[1]                             
In sexual offence cases, the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 ,
limits the disclosure of private records relating to complainants and
witnesses.  The relevant provisions, ss. 278.1  to 278.91 , known as the Mills
regime, permit disclosure only where a record is likely relevant and its
disclosure is necessary in the interests of justice.  The
regime applies to “records” that contain personal information for which there
is a reasonable expectation of privacy, unless they are made by persons
responsible for the investigation or prosecution of the offence.  The
issue on appeal is whether these provisions apply to police occurrence reports
prepared in the investigation of previous incidents involving a complainant or
witness and not the offence being prosecuted.  The question is whether these
unrelated police occurrence reports count as “records” as defined in s. 278.1 ,
such that the statutory disclosure limits apply.

[2]                             
I conclude that the Mills regime applies to police
occurrence reports that are not directly related to the charges against the
accused.  Privacy is not an all or nothing right. Individuals involved in a
criminal investigation do not forfeit their privacy interest for all future
purposes; they reasonably expect that personal information in police reports
will not be disclosed in unrelated matters.  Moreover, while the regime exempts
investigatory and prosecutorial records, that exemption applies only to records
made in relation to the particular offence in question.

[3]                             
Accordingly, I agree with the trial judge that
the unrelated police occurrence reports at issue were “records” within the
definition of s. 278.1  and thus subject to the Mills regime.  The
trial judge was entitled to conclude that the reports should not be disclosed.  I would allow the appeal, set aside the
order for a new trial, and restore the conviction, remitting the sentence
appeal to the Court of Appeal.

II.      
Facts

[4]                             
The respondent, Vincent Quesnelle, was
charged with sexually assaulting two complainants, T.R. and L.I.  Prior to
trial, CBC Radio aired a documentary about the complainant T.R. (a street sex worker), during which the lead investigator in this case
indicated that she had obtained and reviewed four or five police occurrence
reports which involved T.R. but were not made in the course of the
investigation that resulted in the charges against the respondent.  The
detective did not include the reports in the investigatory file.

[5]                             
The police create occurrence reports to document
incidents to which they respond, including disturbances, requests for
assistance, reports of alleged crimes and even medical emergencies or car
accidents.  The reports contain police officers’ recollections and notes
concerning the facts of the incident.

III.    Judicial History

A.       Ontario Superior Court of Justice

[6]                             
Before trial, the respondent made an application
seeking disclosure of the police occurrence reports that had been reviewed by
the detective.  The trial judge, Thorburn J., ruled that the occurrence reports
at issue were “records” under the Mills regime for two reasons: 2009
CanLII 73645.  First, occurrence reports contain personal information in which
there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Second, the reports do
not fall under the exception to the Mills regime in s. 278.1  because
they are not “records made by persons responsible for the investigation or
prosecution of the offence”: that section excludes only police records made in
relation to the case being prosecuted.  Under the Mills regime, a
“record” may only be disclosed to the accused if the trial judge is satisfied
that it is likely relevant to an issue at trial and disclosure is necessary in
the interests of justice.

[7]                             
Since the records fell within the Mills regime,
the respondent applied for disclosure of the occurrence reports pursuant to s.
278.3 of the Code.  He argued that the records were likely relevant to
assess the complainant’s credibility.  The defence chose not to rely on the
documentary in making this application.  He did not want to alert the
complainant ― who was a party to the application ― to his theory of
the relevance of the occurrence reports.  The trial judge ruled against the
respondent because there was no evidentiary basis on which to conclude that the
documents requested were likely relevant or that their production was necessary
in the interests of justice: 2010 ONSC 175 (CanLII).

[8]                             
The respondent was ultimately convicted and
sentenced to six and a half years in jail, less credit for time served: 2010
ONSC 3713 (CanLII).

 

B.       Ontario Court of Appeal, 2013 ONCA 180, 114 O.R. (3d) 779

[9]                             
The respondent appealed his conviction and
sentence to the Ontario Court of Appeal.  He argued that the police occurrence
reports were not “records” under the Mills regime, and therefore should
have been part of regular Crown disclosure under R. v. Stinchcombe,
[1991] 3 S.C.R. 326.

[10]                         
The Court of Appeal allowed his appeal on this
basis and ordered a new trial.  First, MacFarland J.A. concluded that
complainants and witnesses who give information to the police have no
reasonable expectation of privacy in police documents recording that
information.  Second, she concluded that s. 278.1  exempts all records that are
prepared by the investigating police service, whether or not the records are
related to the case being prosecuted.  Thus the police occurrence reports at
issue were not subject to the Mills regime.  The court reasoned that the
police occurrence reports reviewed by Detective Leaver were fruits of the
investigation, and ordered their disclosure.

IV.    Analysis

A.       The Principles Governing Crown Disclosure

(1)      Disclosure in Criminal Cases Generally 

[11]                         
The Crown has a broad duty to disclose relevant
evidence and information to persons charged with criminal offences.  Stinchcombe,
at pp. 336-40, provides that the Crown is obliged to disclose
all relevant, non-privileged information in its possession or control so as to
allow the accused to make full answer and defence.  For purposes of this “first
party” disclosure, “the Crown” does not refer to all Crown entities, federal
and provincial: “the Crown” is the prosecuting Crown.  All other Crown entities,
including police, are “third parties”.  With the exception of the police duty
to supply the Crown with the fruits of the investigation, records in the hands
of third parties, including other Crown entities, are generally not subject to
the Stinchcombe disclosure rules.

[12]                         
In R. v. McNeil, 2009 SCC 3, [2009]
1 S.C.R. 66, this Court recognized that the Crown cannot merely be a passive
recipient of disclosure material.  Instead, the Crown has a duty to make
reasonable inquiries when put on notice of material in the hands of police or
other Crown entities that is potentially relevant to the prosecution or the
defence.  This Court also recognized that police have a duty to disclose,
without prompting, “all material pertaining to its investigation of the accused”
(para. 14) as well as other information “obviously relevant to the accused’s
case” (para. 59).

[13]                         
In R. v. O’Connor, [1995] 4
S.C.R. 411, at paras. 15-34, this Court established a separate disclosure
regime for records in the hands of “third parties” that are “likely relevant”
to an issue at trial.  Under O’Connor, an application is made to the
court and the judge determines whether production
should be compelled in accordance with a two-stage test.  At the first stage,
the applicant has an onus to establish the likely relevance of the record.  At
the second stage, the judge examines the record and determines whether, and to
what extent, it should be produced for the accused: in the case of relevant
information, privacy interests yield to the right to a full answer and defence.

(2)      Disclosure in Sexual Offence Cases ― the Mills Regime

[14]                         
Beginning in the late 1980s, it became
commonplace in sexual offence trials for defence counsel to seek the private
records of complainants in order to attack the complainant through invasive
(and often inappropriate) credibility probing: House of Commons Debates,
vol. 134, No. 122, 2nd Sess., 35th Parl., February 4, 1997.  The Mills regime,
enacted in 1997, was a response to these practices.  The provisions of the Mills
regime are set out in the Appendix.  The central idea, according to the
preamble to the legislation enacting the regime, is that

while production to the court
and to the accused of personal information regarding any person may be
necessary in order for an accused to make a full answer and defence, that
production may breach the person’s right to privacy and equality and therefore
the determination as to whether to order production should be subject to
careful scrutiny; 

 

(An
Act to amend the Criminal Code (production of records in sexual offence
proceedings), S.C. 1997, c. 30)

The regime reflects Parliament’s
intention to accommodate and reconcile the right of the accused to make full
answer and defence with the privacy and equality rights of complainants in
sexual offence cases.  In the words of Professor Lise Gotell, the regime was
created in order to “to limit what it is that a woman/child complainant must be
forced to reveal at trial as the price of her access to the criminal justice
system” (“When Privacy is not Enough: Sexual Assault Complainants, Sexual
History Evidence, and the Disclosure of Personal Records” (2006), 43 Alta.
L. Rev. 743, at p. 745).  That approach was upheld by this Court in R.
v. Mills, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668, and its constitutionality is not
challenged in this appeal.

[15]                         
The Mills regime governs the disclosure
of records containing private information of witnesses and complainants in
certain sexual offence prosecutions (Criminal Code , 278.1 to 278.91). 
It establishes a two-part process through which accused persons may apply for
disclosure of such records.  First, a record ― whether in the hands of
the Crown, the police, or a third party (s. 278.2(2) ) ― will only be
produced to the court where the trial judge is satisfied that the record is likely
relevant to an issue at trial or to the competence of a witness to testify, and
that disclosure to the court is necessary in the interests of justice: s.
278.5 .  Second, after reviewing the record, the judge may only order disclosure
to the accused if the record is likely relevant and disclosure is in the
interests of justice: s. 278.7 .

[16]                         
Once the Crown obtains a record and determines
that it is covered by the Mills regime, it must give notice to the
accused: Criminal Code , s. 278.2(3) .  While the Crown may not disclose
the contents of the record, it should in appropriate circumstances give an
assessment of the likely relevance of a record in its possession, as well as
indicate the basis of its relevance.  At a minimum, the Crown should advise if
it intends to use any information contained in records protected by Mills
as part of its case against an accused.  The Crown’s assessment that the record
is relevant for a specific reason will likely establish a basis for the judge to
order production to the court.

[17]                         
The mere fact that a police occurrence report
concerns a complainant or witness is not enough to make the report relevant to
an otherwise unrelated prosecution.  The Mills provisions echo this
Court’s frequent warnings against relying on myths and stereotypes about sexual
assault complainants in assessing the relevance of evidence in the context of
sexual assault trials.  For example, the fact that a complainant has reported
sexual violence in the recent or distant past, provides sexual services for
money, or suffers from addiction is not, without more, enough to render a
police occurrence report “relevant”: see, e.g., R. v. Esau, [1997] 2
S.C.R. 777, at para. 82 (per McLachlin J., dissenting); R. v.
Ewanchuk, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330, at paras. 86-97 (per
L’Heureux-Dubé J.); R. v. Osolin, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at pp. 670-72
(per Cory J.).  However, occurrence reports which raise legitimate
questions about the credibility of the complainant or a witness, or some other
issue at trial, will be treated as relevant.

(3)      The McNeil Duties and the Mills Notice Obligation 

[18]                         
The Crown’s McNeil duty to make
reasonable inquiries and the corresponding police duty to supply relevant
information and evidence to the Crown apply notwithstanding the Mills
regime.  The Mills regime governs the disclosure of “records” in
sexual offence trials, but does not displace the Crown’s duty to make
reasonable inquiries and obtain potentially relevant material (or the
police duty to pass on material to the Crown) under McNeil.  As an
officer of the court and Minister of Justice, the Crown is duty-bound to seek
justice, not convictions, and to avoid wrongful convictions, in the
prosecutions of all offences, including sexual offences.  The Mills regime
simply replaces the obligation to produce relevant records directly with
an obligation to give notice of their existence: Criminal Code ,
s. 278.2(3) .

B.       Are Unrelated Police Occurrence Reports “Records”?

[19]                         
The issue in this appeal is
whether police occurrence reports prepared in the investigation of
unrelated incidents involving a complainant or witness are “records” within the meaning of s. 278.1  of the Criminal Code ,
such that they are subject to the Mills regime.  Section 278.1  defines
“records” as follows:

278.1 For the purposes of sections 278.2 to 278.9, “record” means any
form of record that contains personal information for which there is a
reasonable expectation of privacy and includes, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, medical, psychiatric, therapeutic, counselling, education,
employment, child welfare, adoption and social services records, personal
journals and diaries, and records containing personal information the
production or disclosure of which is protected by any other Act of Parliament
or a provincial legislature, but does not include records made by persons
responsible for the investigation or prosecution of the offence.

[20]                         
The determination of
whether a document counts as a “record” involves two inquiries.  First, does
the document contain personal information for which there is a reasonable
expectation of privacy?  Second, does it fall into the exemption for
investigatory and prosecutorial documents?  I consider these questions in turn.

(1)      Documents Attracting a Reasonable Expectation of Privacy

(a)   Section 278.1  Requires a Categorical Approach

[21]                         
Under the first step of
the Mills regime, the trial judge makes a preliminary determination of
whether a document is a “record” covered by the regime, without seeing the
specific document.  Only if the judge decides that the document is likely
relevant to an issue at trial or to the competence of a witness to testify and
that production to the court is necessary in the interests of justice will the
judge then have the opportunity to view and assess the particular document. 
Therefore, the judge will usually determine whether a record “contains personal information for which there is a reasonable
expectation of privacy”, on
the basis of the type of document at issue.

[22]                         
The definition of “record”
is broad and non-exhaustive.  Section 278.1  provides an illustrative list of
some of the types of records that usually give rise to a reasonable expectation
of privacy.  However, documents that do not fall into
the listed categories will still be covered by the Mills regime if they
contain information that gives rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy.

[23]                         
The question here is
whether the trial judge committed a reversible error at the preliminary stage
by holding that police occurrence reports relating to the complainant were
“records” because they generally contain information that gives rise to a
reasonable expectation of privacy.  The Court of Appeal concluded that the
trial judge erred because the definition of “record” under s. 278.1 
contemplates the types of personal information disclosed in the context of a
“trust-like, confidential or therapeutic relationship” and which an individual
would “seek to withhold from the state” (paras. 32-33).  In my view, such a
restricted approach is not warranted. The trial judge was right to treat the
reports as “records” under the Mills regime because the reports
generally contain information in which there is a reasonable expectation of
privacy.

(b)   Reasonable Expectation of Privacy

[24]                         
In order for a document
to constitute a “record” and therefore fall within the Mills regime it
must be a “record that contains personal information for which there is a
reasonable expectation of privacy”: s. 278.1 .

[25]                         
The appellant submits that police occurrence
reports will often contain deeply personal and potentially embarrassing
information, and that witnesses and complainants retain a privacy interest in
the reports.  The subject of an occurrence report will not expect the report to
be disclosed to impeach his or her credibility in an unrelated case.

[26]                         
The respondent agrees with the Court of Appeal
that police occurrence reports do not “implicate the types of privacy interests
envisioned in s. 278.1  or in Mills” (R.F., at para. 58, citing Court of
Appeal reasons, at para. 41).  The Court of Appeal observed that the
complainant cannot have a subjective expectation of privacy in previous
complaints to police: she will know, at the time of making a complaint to
police, that the information she discloses will end up in a public trial.  Moreover,
the victim of an attack does not speak to police in the context of a
trust-like, confidential, or therapeutic relationship.

(i) 
General Principles

[27]                         
The assessment of
whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy for purposes of s. 278.1 
of the Criminal Code  draws on the jurisprudence applying s. 8  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms : see Mills, at para.
99.  That jurisprudence establishes that expectations of privacy must be
assessed in light of the “totality of the circumstances” (R. v. Patrick, 2009 SCC 17, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 579, at para. 26; R. v. Edwards,
[1996] 1 S.C.R. 128, at para. 45; R. v. Tessling, 2004 SCC 67, [2004] 3
S.C.R. 432, at para. 19).  The circumstances (or nature of the relationship) in
which information is shared are not determinative: the reasonable expectation
of privacy is not limited to trust-like, confidential, or therapeutic
relationships.

[28]                         
 Unlike much of the jurisprudence under s. 8  of
the Charter , the analysis of the reasonable expectation of privacy in
this case does not concern the right to be free from unreasonable intrusion by
the state.  Rather, the question is whether it is reasonable to expect that the
state will keep information that it has legitimately acquired private from
other private individuals.

[29]                         
A reasonable
expectation of privacy is not an all or nothing concept: Mills, at para.
108.  A person may have a reasonable expectation that the state will not have
access to her hotel room, even if she fully expects hotel staff to enter the
premises: R. v. Buhay, 2003 SCC 30,
[2003] 1 S.C.R. 631, at para. 22, discussing R. v. Dinh, 2001 ABPC
48, 42 C.R. (5th) 318.  Equally, a person may divulge information to an
individual or an organization with the expectation that it be used only for a
specific purpose: R. v. Dyment, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417, at pp.
429-30.  The same principle applies to disclosure to the police.

[30]                         
In this case, the question is whether the
subjects of police occurrence reports could reasonably expect the police to
safeguard their private information, unless and until disclosure is justified. 
After describing the information contained in the reports, I will discuss the
privacy interests engaged by that information.  Finally, I will address the
implications arising from the fact that the reports are in the hands of police.

(ii)            
The Information in Police Occurrence Reports

[31]                         
Police occurrence reports contain information
disclosed to police by the persons concerned, by third parties, or obtained by
police through search, seizure, surveillance, or information sharing.

[32]                         
This Court observed in McNeil, at para.
19:

Criminal investigative files may
contain highly sensitive material including: outlines of unproven allegations;
statements of complainants or witnesses — at times concerning very personal matters
. . . .

[33]                         
Police occurrence reports may reveal family
status, health information (including statements concerning mental health or
the use of drugs and alcohol), and details about housing and employment.  They
may reveal personal conflicts or details about relationships between
individuals.  See P. C. Keen, “Gebrekirstos: Fallout from Quesnelle”
(2013), 4 C.R. (7th) 56, at pp. 60-61.  Moreover, they very often reveal the
extent of an individual’s engagement with the criminal justice system.  Most significantly,
they can reveal previous instances where the witness or complainant has been
the victim of criminal activity, including previous sexual assaults.

(iii)      
The Price of Disclosure

[34]                         
The disclosure of the
information described above engages complainants’ and witnesses’
“[i]nformational privacy”, “the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions
to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about
them is communicated to others” (Tessling, at para. 23, quoting A. F.
Westin, Privacy and Freedom (1970), at p. 7).  As L’Heureux-Dubé J.
observed in O’Connor, at para. 119:

Although it may appear trite to say so,
I underline that when a private document or record is revealed and the
reasonable expectation of privacy therein is thereby displaced, the invasion is
not with respect to the particular document or record in question.  Rather, it
is an invasion of the dignity and self-worth of the individual, who enjoys the
right to privacy as an essential aspect of his or her liberty in a free and
democratic society.

The disclosure of police
occurrence reports that contain intimate personal information ― such as
details of previous allegations of sexual assault ― may do particularly
serious violence to the dignity and self-worth of an affected person.

[35]                         
The Mills regime regulates disclosure in
the context of a criminal trial: information that is disclosed will often be
exposed in court.  Significantly, even where the information is not used in the
trial, it will certainly be seen by the accused, who will often be known to the
affected person, and whose use of the information is not subject to the legal
oversight of the Charter  or privacy legislation that applies when such
information is given to law enforcement.  Consequently, disclosure may involve
a more serious violation of the complainant’s dignity than disclosure to the
state.

[36]                         
There are tangible
harms associated with disclosure of personal information in the context of
prosecutions for sexual offences, particularly when information about the
complainant is disclosed to the person accused of sexually assaulting her.  In
the preamble to the legislation enacting the Mills regime, Parliament
recognized “that the compelled production of personal information may deter
complainants of sexual offences from reporting the offence to the police”. 
Victims of sexual offences will be less likely to come forward if they know
that doing so will entail disclosure of their past interactions with police to
the very person who they claim has wronged them.

(iv)      
The Effect of Third Party Disclosure on
Expectations of Privacy

[37]                         
It bears repeating that
privacy is not an all or nothing concept; rather, “[p]rivacy interests in modern society include the reasonable
expectation that private information will remain confidential to the persons to
whom and restricted to the purposes for which it was divulged” (Mills,
at para. 108).  Consequently, the fact that information about a person has been disclosed to a third
party does not destroy that person’s privacy interests.  Because the contents
of occurrence reports will be disclosed under certain circumstances does
not mean that there is not a reasonable expectation of privacy in those
records.

[38]                         
The Court of Appeal erred in concluding that the
complainant could not have a reasonable expectation of privacy because the
information was disclosed outside the context of a “trust-like, confidential or
therapeutic relationship”.  While such relationships may give rise to
heightened privacy interests, their absence is not dispositive.  Whether a person
is entitled to expect that their information will be kept private is a
contextual inquiry.

[39]                         
Where an individual
voluntarily discloses sensitive information to police, or where police uncover
such information in the course of an investigation, it is reasonable to expect
that the information will be used for the purpose for which it was obtained:
the investigation and prosecution of a particular crime.  Similarly, it is
reasonable to expect individual police officers to share lawfully gathered
information with other law enforcement officials, provided the use is
consistent with the purposes for which it was gathered.

[40]                         
However, when the
government divulges sensitive information to private individuals this may
violate reasonable expectations of privacy.  For example, if police were to
publicly broadcast a wiretap recording this would clearly constitute an
interference with privacy (see Escher v. Brazil, Inter-American Court of
Human Rights, judgment of July 6, 2009, series C, No. 200, at paras. 157-58) as
well as a violation of s. 193(1)  of the Criminal Code .  To
indiscriminately publicize the contents of police occurrence reports would
result in similar interference.

[41]                         
That is not to say that
all disclosures of personal information by the police unreasonably intrude upon
privacy.  Where private information becomes part of a criminal case, the
disclosure of that information to the court, the accused, and to the public is
reasonable and unavoidable.  For example, police occurrence reports made in the
course of the investigation of the offence being prosecuted must be disclosed
under Stinchcombe.

[42]                         
But what of police
occurrence reports that were made in connection with separate incidents, rather
than as part of the investigation into the offence being prosecuted?  There will certainly be times when the disclosure of
such records is necessary to ensure a fair trial.  Consequently, the Mills
regime gives trial judges the power to disclose records under such
circumstances.  The judge must balance the privacy of complainants and
witnesses against ensuring the disclosure necessary to make full answer and
defence.  However, the fact that a record might be disclosed under appropriate
circumstances does not nullify the expectation of privacy in that record in
general.

[43]                         
People provide information to police in order to
protect themselves and others.  They are entitled to do so with confidence that
the police will only disclose it for good reason.  The fact that the
information is in the hands of the police should not nullify their interest in
keeping that information private from other individuals.

(c)   Conclusion on Reasonable Expectation of Privacy

[44]                         
Fundamentally, the privacy analysis turns on a
normative question of whether we, as a society, should expect that police
occurrence reports will be kept private.  Given the sensitive nature of the
information frequently contained in such reports, and the impact that their
disclosure can have on the privacy interests of complainants and witnesses, it
seems to me that there will generally be a reasonable expectation of privacy in
police occurrence reports.

(d)  Personal
Information Protected by Legislation

[45]                         
The appellant Crown
submits that police occurrence reports are “records containing personal
information the production or disclosure of which is protected by any other Act
of Parliament or a provincial legislature” and are therefore “records” for
purposes of s. 278.1 .  The trial judge held that police occurrence reports
“contain personal information protected by provincial legislation” (2009 CanLII
73645, at para. 18).  Given my conclusion that such reports contain information
in which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, it is unnecessary to
decide whether they are protected by the Municipal Freedom of Information
and Protection of Privacy Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.56.

(2)      The Exemption for Investigatory and Prosecutorial Records

[46]                         
Even records that give rise to a
reasonable expectation of privacy are not covered by the Mills regime if
they fall into the exemption contained in s. 278.1 :

                 278.1 . . .
“record” . . . does not include records made by persons responsible
for the investigation or prosecution of the offence.

 

           278.1 . . . N’est pas visé par la
présente définition le dossier qui est produit par un responsable de l’enquête
ou de la poursuite relativement à l’infraction qui fait l’objet de la
procédure.

[47]                         
The trial judge held
that the exemption applies only to records made in relation to the offence in
question, and not to police occurrence reports made in the course of unrelated
investigations.  Other courts have generally reached the same conclusion: see, e.g.,
R. v. Fiddler, 2012 ONSC 2539, 258 C.R.R. (2d) 193, at paras. 36-38; R.
v. McAdam (2008), 172 C.R.R. (2d) 27 (Ont. S.C.J.).

[48]                         
The Court of Appeal,
however, held that the exemption applies to all records made by the responsible
police force, whether or not they were made in relation to the offence at
issue.  The Court of Appeal relied on the plain wording of the English version
of the provision, the view that such records are unlikely to engage privacy
interests, and this Court’s description of the exemption, in Mills, as “excluding
investigatory or prosecutorial records” (para. 39, citing Mills, at
para. 50).

[49]                         
With respect, I do not
agree with the Court of Appeal’s interpretation of the exception.  In light of
the text of the provision in both languages, as well as its purpose, context,
and the consequences of the Court of Appeal’s interpretation, I conclude that
the trial judge correctly interpreted the exemption to exclude only those
records made in relation to the offence at issue.

(a)   The Text of the Provision

[50]                         
The trial judge
reasoned that “[t]he words ‘records made by persons responsible for the
investigation or prosecution of the offence’ must be limited by ‘the’ offence”,
encompassing only records made in relation to the offence at issue (2009 CanLII
73645, at para. 20).  The Court of Appeal, on the other hand, emphasized that
the exemption refers only to the creators of the records ― the police and
prosecution services ― not to the purpose for which they are made.  In my
view the English text, read in isolation, could bear both meanings.

[51]                         
However, the French “le dossier qui est
produit par un responsable de l’enquête ou de la poursuite relativement
à l’infraction qui fait l’objet de la procédure” can only mean that the
exemption applies to records made by police or prosecutors in relation to
the offences at issue.

[52]                         
The Court of Appeal did not address the French
version of the provision, because the Crown’s position in that court was that
the French text was amenable to both interpretations.  Before this Court, the
Crown resiled from that position.  Because the word “relativement” is an
adverb, the expression “relativement à l’infraction qui fait l’objet
de la procédure” must modify the expression “qui est produit”.  The
word “relativement” cannot modify the nouns “enquête” or “poursuite”. 
If the last clause of the exemption were intended to apply to “enquête”
and “poursuite”, the grammatically correct phrase would be “de
l’enquête ou de la poursuite relative à l’infraction qui
fait l’objet de la procédure”.

[53]                         
Section 133  of the Constitution Act, 1867 
establishes that Parliament enacts legislation in both French and English. 
This “means that both language versions of a bilingual statute or
regulation are official, original and authoritative expressions of the law” (R.
Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (5th ed. 2008), at p.
95).  It is a rule of statutory interpretation that where the version in one
language can bear two meanings, only one of which is consistent with the
version in the other language, the shared meaning governs: R. v. Daoust,
2004 SCC 6, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 217, at para. 28.

(b)   The Purpose of the Exemption in Section 278.1 

[54]                         
The Mills regime
serves two goals: first, the regime protects the privacy of complainants and
witnesses, and second, it preserves the fair trial rights of the accused.

[55]                         
The definition of
“record” in s. 278.1  serves a gatekeeping function within the regime.  The
reasonable expectation of privacy test sweeps in records that merit the
protection afforded by the Mills regime.  The exemption further
contributes to the gatekeeping role of the section by bypassing the balancing
process for records that Parliament recognized should always be produced.

[56]                         
Records created in the
investigation of the offence are presumptively relevant to an issue at trial
and it is in the interests of justice for the case against the accused to be
disclosed to the defence.  There is no need to consider such records under the
second step of Mills because they will always be produced anyway ―
the exemption is eminently logical.  However, for records unrelated to the
offence at issue, the balancing exercise will often have important work to do. 
The rationale for the exemption does not apply, and to bypass the balancing
process on the grounds that the document was made by the same police force that
investigated the claim would not accord with the goals of the scheme.

(c)   Incongruous Consequences of a Broad Exemption

[57]                         
If the s. 278.1 
exemption excluded all documents made by the police force and prosecution
agency ― even those unrelated to the offence ― the consequences
would be illogical.  This would mean that unrelated police occurrence reports
would be treated differently depending on whether they were made by members of
the investigating police force or members of a different police force.  If
Parliament wanted to exempt unrelated police and prosecution documents from the
Mills regime, it is hard to see why it would have excluded only those
documents made by some police departments and not others.

[58]                         
This would mean that an
accused whose case was investigated by a large police force would be more
likely to get easy access to occurrence reports than if the case was
investigated by a small force.  For example, where the RCMP is involved in an
investigation, the Court of Appeal’s interpretation of the exemption would
waive the Mills regime for RCMP occurrence reports from across the
country.

(d)   Application of the Exemption to Other Third Party Documents in the
Investigative File

[59]                         
I would reject the
submission of the intervener the Attorney General of Alberta that all documents
in the investigative file ― all of the fruits of the investigation
― are covered by the exemption.  This point was not addressed in the
courts below, and was raised only at oral argument.

[60]                         
The English and French
versions of the provision, considered in isolation, provide some support for
the intervener’s position.  The terms “record” and “dossier” can refer
to individual documents or to collections of documents such as case files. 
Consequently, on a purely textual basis, one might think that the exemption
covers the investigative “record” in its entirety, as opposed to only
individual “records”.

[61]                         
However, the scheme and
purpose of the regime run counter to such an interpretation.  Section 278.2(2) 
of the Criminal Code  provides that the Mills regime applies to
records “in the possession or control of any person, including the prosecutor
in the proceedings”.  Hence the Mills regime operates in part as an
exception to the Crown’s obligation to produce the fruits of the investigation.[1]  If the exemption
captured all documents in the investigative file ― all the fruits of the
investigation ― the Mills regime would not perform this function
or protect privacy interests the regime was meant to serve.  The fact that
documents in the investigative file may generally be presumed to be relevant
does not mean that the privacy value of those documents will always be
outweighed.  For example, where police obtain a highly sensitive therapeutic
record without waiver, to exclude the record from the scrutiny of the Mills
regime simply because it is included in the investigative file would undermine
the purposes of the regime.  I would therefore reject the suggestion that the
exemption excludes all documents made by third parties simply because they are
placed in the investigative or prosecution file.

(e)   The Effect on Trial Fairness

[62]                         
The respondent and the
intervener the Criminal Lawyers’ Association of Ontario raise concerns about
the effect of an expansive interpretation of “records” in s. 278.1  on trial
fairness.  A broad interpretation of “records” means
that the Mills regime applies to a larger number of documents.  While
this furthers Parliament’s objective of protecting the privacy of complainants
and witnesses, it may also impose procedural burdens on defendants and create
the risk that some helpful documents would not be available to the defence. 
However, largely for the reasons set out in Mills, I do not think these
concerns require a narrower reading of s. 278.1 .

[63]                         
Documents protected by the Mills regime
are not inaccessible to the defence.  Defendants can access records when the
privacy infringement is proportionate, given the relevance of the record to the
defence.  Where the Crown plans to use information from police occurrence
reports as part of its case against an accused, disclosure of that information
will always be in the interests of justice.  In Mills, this Court held
that the process for accessing documents was adequate to preserve the
constitutionality of the regime.

[64]                         
The principles of fundamental justice and trial
fairness do not guarantee defence counsel the right to precisely the
same privileges and procedures as the Crown and the police (Mills, at
para. 111).  Nor is the right to a full answer and defence a right to pursue
every conceivable tactic to be used in defending oneself against criminal
prosecution.  The right to a full answer and defence is not without limit.

[65]                         
Because the Crown is an officer of the court,
with undivided loyalty to the administration of justice, the Crown is not in an
adversarial role in relation to its disclosure obligations.  The information
obtained through investigation is “not the property of the Crown for use in
securing a conviction but the property of the public to be used to ensure that
justice is done” (Stinchcombe, at p. 333).  The Crown has an obligation
under s. 278.2(3)  of the Criminal Code , to notify the accused of records
in its possession covered by the Mills regime.  Moreover, as
discussed above, both police and Crown have common law duties aimed at ensuring
proper disclosure, which apply notwithstanding the application of the Mills
regime.

(f)    Conclusion on the Exemption

[66]                         
For these reasons, I
conclude that s. 278.1  exempts records made in relation to the offence being
prosecuted, not other records made by the same police or prosecution agencies.

V.      
Disposition

[67]                         
It follows from this analysis that the police
occurrence reports mentioned in the CBC radio documentary were subject to the Mills
regime for disclosure, not Stinchcombe.  The trial judge was right to
require a Mills application before disclosing them to the defence, and
the Court of Appeal was wrong to interfere.  The trial judge’s application of
the Mills regime was not challenged before us.  Accordingly, I would
allow the appeal, set aside the order for a new trial, and restore the
conviction, remitting the sentence appeal to the Court of Appeal.

[68]                         
I would grant the motion to strike para. 10 of
the respondent’s factum, but dismiss the motion to strike para. 11.  I would
also grant the motion to strike the appellant’s reply factum.

APPENDIX

 

Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1985, c. C-46 

      278.1 For
the purposes of sections 278.2 to 278.9, “record” means any form of record that
contains personal information for which there is a reasonable expectation of
privacy and includes, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
medical, psychiatric, therapeutic, counselling, education, employment, child
welfare, adoption and social services records, personal journals and diaries,
and records containing personal information the production or disclosure of
which is protected by any other Act of Parliament or a provincial legislature,
but does not include records made by persons responsible for the investigation
or prosecution of the offence.

 

      278.2 (1) No record relating to a complainant or a
witness shall be produced to an accused in any proceedings in respect of

 

(a) an offence under section 151, 152, 153, 153.1, 155, 159,
160, 170, 171, 172, 173, 210, 211, 212, 213, 271, 272 or 273,

 

(b) an offence under section 144 , 145 , 149 , 156 , 245  or 246 
of the Criminal Code , chapter C-34 of the Revised Statutes of Canada,
1970, as it read immediately before January 4, 1983, or

 

(c) an offence under section 146 , 151 , 153 , 155 , 157 , 166  or
167  of the Criminal Code , chapter C-34 of the Revised Statutes of
Canada, 1970, as it read immediately before January 1, 1988,

 

or in any proceedings in respect of two or more offences that
include an offence referred to in any of paragraphs (a) to (c),
except in accordance with sections 278.3  to 278.91 .

 

      (2) Section 278.1 , this section and sections 278.3  to 278.91 
apply where a record is in the possession or control of any person, including
the prosecutor in the proceedings, unless, in the case of a record in the
possession or control of the prosecutor, the complainant or witness to whom the
record relates has expressly waived the application of those sections.

 

      (3) In the case of a record in respect of which this section
applies that is in the possession or control of the prosecutor, the prosecutor
shall notify the accused that the record is in the prosecutor’s possession but,
in doing so, the prosecutor shall not disclose the record’s contents.

 

      278.3 (1) An accused who seeks production of a record
referred to in subsection 278.2(1) must make an application to the judge before
whom the accused is to be, or is being, tried.

 

      (2) For greater certainty, an application under subsection (1)
may not be made to a judge or justice presiding at any other proceedings,
including a preliminary inquiry.

 

      (3) An application must be made in writing and set out

 

(a) particulars identifying the record that the accused seeks
to have produced and the name of the person who has possession or control of
the record; and

 

(b) the grounds on which the accused relies to establish that
the record is likely relevant to an issue at trial or to the competence of a
witness to testify.

 

      (4) Any one or more of the following assertions by the accused
are not sufficient on their own to establish that the record is likely relevant
to an issue at trial or to the competence of a witness to testify:

 

(a) that the record exists;

 

(b) that the record relates to medical or psychiatric
treatment, therapy or counselling that the complainant or witness has received
or is receiving;

 

(c) that the record relates to the incident that is the
subject-matter of the proceedings;

 

(d) that the record may disclose a prior inconsistent
statement of the complainant or witness;

 

(e) that the record may relate to the credibility of the
complainant or witness;

 

(f) that the record may relate to the reliability of the testimony
of the complainant or witness merely because the complainant or witness has
received or is receiving psychiatric treatment, therapy or counselling;

 

(g) that the record may reveal allegations of sexual abuse of
the complainant by a person other than the accused;

 

(h) that the record relates to the sexual activity of the
complainant with any person, including the accused;

 

(i) that the record relates to the presence or absence of a
recent complaint;

 

(j) that the record relates to the complainant’s sexual
reputation; or

 

(k) that the record was made close in time to a complaint or
to the activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge against the
accused.

 

      (5) The accused shall serve the application on the prosecutor,
on the person who has possession or control of the record, on the complainant
or witness, as the case may be, and on any other person to whom, to the
knowledge of the accused, the record relates, at least seven days before the
hearing referred to in subsection 278.4(1) or any shorter interval that the
judge may allow in the interests of justice. The accused shall also serve a
subpoena issued under Part XXII in Form 16.1 on the person who has possession
or control of the record at the same time as the application is served.

 

      (6) The judge may at any time order that the application be
served on any person to whom the judge considers the record may relate.

 

      278.4 (1) The judge shall hold a
hearing in camera to determine whether to order the person who has
possession or control of the record to produce it to the court for review by
the judge.

 

      (2) The person who has possession or control of the record,
the complainant or witness, as the case may be, and any other person to whom
the record relates may appear and make submissions at the hearing, but they are
not compellable as witnesses at the hearing.

 

      (3) No order for costs may be made against a person referred
to in subsection (2) in respect of their participation in the hearing.

 

      278.5 (1) The judge may order the person who has
possession or control of the record to produce the record or part of the record
to the court for review by the judge if, after the hearing referred to in
subsection 278.4(1), the judge is satisfied that

 

(a) the application was made in accordance with subsections
278.3(2) to (6);

 

(b) the accused has established that the record is likely
relevant to an issue at trial or to the competence of a witness to testify; and

 

(c) the production of the record is necessary in the
interests of justice.

 

      (2) In determining whether to order the production of the
record or part of the record for review pursuant to subsection (1), the judge
shall consider the salutary and deleterious effects of the determination on the
accused’s right to make a full answer and defence and on the right to privacy
and equality of the complainant or witness, as the case may be, and any other
person to whom the record relates. In particular, the judge shall take the
following factors into account:

 

(a) the extent to which the record is necessary for the
accused to make a full answer and defence;

 

(b) the probative value of the record;

 

(c) the nature and extent of the reasonable expectation of
privacy with respect to the record;

 

(d) whether production of the record is based on a
discriminatory belief or bias;

 

(e) the potential prejudice to the personal dignity and right
to privacy of any person to whom the record relates;

 

(f) society’s interest in encouraging the reporting of sexual
offences;

 

(g) society’s interest in encouraging the obtaining of
treatment by complainants of sexual offences; and

 

(h) the effect of the determination on the integrity of the
trial process.

 

      278.6 (1) Where the judge has ordered the production of
the record or part of the record for review, the judge shall review it in the
absence of the parties in order to determine whether the record or part of the
record should be produced to the accused.

 

      (2) The judge may hold a hearing in camera if the judge
considers that it will assist in making the determination.

 

      (3) Subsections 278.4(2) and (3) apply in the case of a
hearing under subsection (2).

 

      278.7 (1) Where the judge is satisfied that the record
or part of the record is likely relevant to an issue at trial or to the
competence of a witness to testify and its production is necessary in the
interests of justice, the judge may order that the record or part of the record
that is likely relevant be produced to the accused, subject to any conditions
that may be imposed pursuant to subsection (3).

 

      (2) In determining whether to order the production of the
record or part of the record to the accused, the judge shall consider the
salutary and deleterious effects of the determination on the accused’s right to
make a full answer and defence and on the right to privacy and equality of the
complainant or witness, as the case may be, and any other person to whom the
record relates and, in particular, shall take the factors specified in paragraphs
278.5(2)(a) to (h) into account.

 

      (3) Where the judge orders the production of the record or
part of the record to the accused, the judge may impose conditions on the
production to protect the interests of justice and, to the greatest extent
possible, the privacy and equality interests of the complainant or witness, as
the case may be, and any other person to whom the record relates, including,
for example, the following conditions:

 

(a) that the record be edited as directed by the judge;

 

(b) that a copy of the record, rather than the original, be
produced;

 

(c) that the accused and counsel for the accused not disclose
the contents of the record to any other person, except with the approval of the
court;

 

(d) that the record be viewed only at the offices of the
court;

 

(e) that no copies of the record be made or that restrictions
be imposed on the number of copies of the record that may be made; and

 

(f) that information regarding any person named in the
record, such as their address, telephone number and place of employment, be
severed from the record.

 

      (4) Where the judge orders the production of the record or
part of the record to the accused, the judge shall direct that a copy of the
record or part of the record be provided to the prosecutor, unless the judge
determines that it is not in the interests of justice to do so.

 

      (5) The record or part of the record that is produced to the
accused pursuant to an order under subsection (1) shall not be used in any
other proceedings.

 

      (6) Where the judge refuses to order the production of the
record or part of the record to the accused, the record or part of the record
shall, unless a court orders otherwise, be kept in a sealed package by the
court until the later of the expiration of the time for any appeal and the
completion of any appeal in the proceedings against the accused, whereupon the
record or part of the record shall be returned to the person lawfully entitled
to possession or control of it.

 

      278.8 (1) The judge shall provide reasons for ordering or
refusing to order the production of the record or part of the record pursuant
to subsection 278.5(1) or 278.7(1).

 

      (2) The reasons referred to in subsection (1) shall be entered
in the record of the proceedings or, where the proceedings are not recorded,
shall be provided in writing.

 

      278.9 (1) No person shall publish in any document, or
broadcast or transmit in any way, any of the following:

 

(a) the contents of an application made under section 278.3 ;

 

(b) any evidence taken, information given or submissions made
at a hearing under subsection 278.4(1) or 278.6(2); or

 

(c) the determination of the judge pursuant to subsection
278.5(1) or 278.7(1) and the reasons provided pursuant to section 278.8, unless
the judge, after taking into account the interests of justice and the right to
privacy of the person to whom the record relates, orders that the determination
may be published.

 

      (2) Every person who contravenes subsection (1) is guilty of
an offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

      278.91 For the purposes of sections 675 and 676, a
determination to make or refuse to make an order pursuant to subsection
278.5(1) or 278.7(1) is deemed to be a question of law.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

                    Criminal
law — Appeals — Dangerous offenders — Courts — Curative powers — Fresh evidence
— Trial judge declaring accused to be dangerous offender without considering long‑term offender
designation — Whether trial judge committed error of law — Whether Court of Appeal
erred by using curative powers and upholding dangerous offender designation —
Role of fresh evidence in dangerous offender designation appeals — Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 , ss. 753 , 759 .

                    In
1996, a jury convicted the accused of multiple sexual offences and physical
assaults.  In 1998, the accused was declared a dangerous offender and given an
indeterminate sentence.  Between the time of the convictions and the decision
on the dangerous offender proceeding, the Criminal Code  was amended to
add a new designation of long-term offenders.  The sentencing judge did not
consider a long‑term offender designation before declaring the accused to
be a dangerous offender.  In 2012, the Court of Appeal heard an appeal from the
sentence. The accused filed fresh evidence consisting of a risk assessment
created in 2010 and information about his performance in sexual offender programs
while in custody.  A psychiatrist opined that the accused continued to meet the
standard for being found a dangerous offender but also that some factors
suggested suitability for release in 2016 with 10 years long‑term
supervision.  The Court of Appeal admitted the fresh evidence. It held that the
sentencing judge committed a legal error by not considering the long‑term
offender provisions.  However, it applied its curative powers and upheld the
dangerous offender designation.

                    Held: 
The appeal should be dismissed.

                    An
offender may appeal a dangerous offender designation on any ground of law or
fact or mixed law and fact.  Appellate review is concerned with legal errors
and whether the designation was reasonable.  An appellate court may exercise
its curative power despite a legal error if there is no reasonable possibility
that the verdict would have been different had the error not been made.  On
dangerous offender appeals, the test set out in Palmer v. The Queen,
[1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, governs the admissibility of fresh evidence.  Fresh
evidence addressing events between the time of sentencing and the time of the
appeal raises competing values.  Changes cannot be ignored but routinely
deciding sentence appeals on the basis of after‑the‑fact
developments could jeopardize the integrity of the criminal process by
undermining its finality and could surpass the appropriate bounds of appellate
review.  The appellate process should be both responsive to the demands of
justice and respectful of the limits of appellate review.

                    Fresh
evidence generally has little role to play when determining whether the
curative power should be exercised.  In dangerous offender appeals, an
appellate court may use its curative power only where there is no reasonable
possibility that the result would have been different had the error not been
made.  The exercise is necessarily focused on the record before the sentencing
judge because the question concerns what that judge might have done had he or
she applied correct legal principles.  The appellate court must consider
whether the legal error may have resulted in exclusion of evidence that ought
to have been admitted or otherwise affected the evidentiary record or the
judge’s assessment of it. Fresh evidence meeting the Palmer test might
be admitted but where new evidence has nothing to do with the possible impact
of the legal error on the sentencing decision, it should not be considered. 

                    In
this case, the fresh evidence has nothing to do with the impact of the legal
error made by the sentencing judge.  The sentencing judge’s only realistic
option was a dangerous offender designation.  There is no suggestion that the
failure to consider a long‑term offender designation affected the
evidentiary record.  The correct focus is on the possible impact of the error
on the sentencing judge’s decision, not on the accused’s current prospects for
control in the community. 

                    On
the other hand, an offender may appeal a dangerous offender designation on the
basis that it is unreasonable.  There is a wider role for fresh evidence in
appellate review on this basis.  The appellate court may review the sentence in
light of the whole record, including admissible fresh evidence.  In dangerous
offender appeals, appellate courts are frequently confronted with evidence
about an offender’s rehabilitation efforts and prospects.  Appellate courts
generally take a very cautious approach to intervening solely on the basis of
evidence of this nature but in exceptional and proper cases, in which the
evidence is sufficiently compelling, they may intervene on the basis of after‑the‑fact
evidence.  The focus is still on the impact of the new evidence on the
sentencing proceeding, viewed in the context of the whole record. 

                    The
accused’s fresh evidence indicates a reasonable possibility of eventual
control of the risk in the community if he were released from incarceration in
about 2016 with a further period of 10 years long‑term
supervision, subject to many qualifications.  However, viewed in light of the
full record before the sentencing judge, the fresh evidence falls considerably
short of showing that the dangerous offender designation was unreasonable. 
Placing ourselves in the position of the sentencing judge with the added
information from the fresh evidence, there is no reasonable possibility that
the result of the dangerous offender proceedings would have been different. 
The evidence does not show that the dangerous offender designation was
unreasonable and this is not a case that demands appellate intervention.

                    The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

                    Cromwell J. — 

I.             
Introduction 

[1]                             
This appeal poses two related questions about
appellate review of a dangerous offender designation. The first is whether the
sentencing judge’s legal error in the course of imposing the designation on the
appellant, Mr. Sipos, was “harmless” in the sense that it had no impact on the
ultimate decision. A related question concerns the role on the appeal of fresh
evidence about the offender’s current treatment and prospects. 

[2]                             
The Ontario Court of Appeal held that an error
is harmless if there is no reasonable possibility that the sentencing judge’s
decision would have been different had he not made the legal error. Where there
is fresh evidence, this standard is applied as if the sentencing judge had
access to it at the time of the original sentencing. Approaching the matter in
this way, the Court of Appeal dismissed Mr. Sipos’ appeal. The Court of Appeal
rejected Mr. Sipos’ position that the appeal should be allowed if the fresh
evidence raises any reasonable possibility that the outcome of a new dangerous
offender proceeding could be different from the original one. 

[3]                             
Mr. Sipos appeals by leave of the Court. He
submits that the Court of Appeal was wrong in two respects. First, he says that
the Court of Appeal was wrong to dismiss his appeal in light of the fresh
evidence suggesting that there is a reasonable possibility that a new dangerous
offender hearing might produce a different result from that reached at the
original hearing. He further submits that the Court of Appeal erred by holding
that the record in this case met the high standard required to conclude that
the sentencing judge’s legal error was harmless. The appellant’s submissions
are best considered by addressing the role of fresh evidence when the Court of
Appeal is asked to use its curative powers in relation to dangerous offender
appeals and by reviewing whether the Court of Appeal erred in using those
curative powers in this case.  

[4]                             
I agree with the result reached by the Court of
Appeal and would dismiss the appeal.  However, as I will explain, I take a
somewhat narrower view of the role of fresh evidence in relation to the
question of whether the sentencing judge’s legal error was harmless.

II.          
Overview of the Facts and Proceedings

A.          
Procedural History

[5]                             
The appeal has followed a long and complicated
path before arriving here. This is a result of the intersection of developments
in the legislation and case law coupled with very long delays in moving the
appeal forward. I say this not to attribute fault to anyone, but to underline
the unusual circumstances before us. The result is that the Court of Appeal in
2012 had before it a dangerous offender designation made in 1998, roughly 14
years earlier, and fresh evidence created in 2010, roughly 12 years after the
conclusion of the proceedings before the sentencing judge. 

[6]                             
The beginning of the most relevant part of the
story takes us back to April of 1996.  Lofchik J. sitting with a jury convicted
Mr. Sipos of multiple sexual offences and physical assaults against three women
committed from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. The convictions included
attempted buggery, indecent assault, rape, sexual assault, assault causing
bodily harm and common assault.  Mr. Sipos also had a considerable record of
other offences of violence against women between the late 1970s and the mid-1980s. 


[7]                             
Nearly two years after his conviction at trial,
that is, in March of 1998, the judge found that Mr. Sipos was a dangerous
offender and imposed an indeterminate sentence ([1998] O.J. No. 985 (QL)).  

[8]                             
Between the time of the convictions and the
ultimate decision nearly two years later on the dangerous offender proceeding,
new legislation that is important to the case intervened.  The Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , was amended to add a new designation of long-term
offenders (S.C. 1997, c. 17, s. 4). These new provisions were in force at the
time Mr. Sipos was found to be a dangerous offender but the judge did not
consider them in reaching his decision.  There are many differences in both
substance and procedure between the two designations.  But the main one is that
in order to be found to be a long-term offender, the judge must be satisfied
that “there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the
community”: s. 753.1(1)(c). 

[9]                             
Mr. Sipos appealed from the convictions and
sentence, but indicated that his sentence appeal was contingent on his
convictions appeal being at least partially successful. The Court of Appeal
dismissed the convictions appeal and did not deal with the sentence appeal
(2001 CanLII 8541).  The judgment of the Court of Appeal was delivered in May
of 2001 but, as noted, Mr. Sipos’ sentence appeal remained outstanding and
undecided.

[10]                         
The next relevant event came about five years
after Mr. Sipos’ dangerous offender designation. In 2003, this Court released
its decision in R. v. Johnson, 2003 SCC 46, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 357.  It
decided that in dangerous offender proceedings that occurred after the new
long-term offender provisions came into force — in other words, in cases like
Mr. Sipos’ — judges must consider the option of a long-term offender
designation, which may lead to a determinate sentence followed by long-term
community supervision, before declaring a defendant to be a dangerous offender
and imposing an indeterminate sentence.  Failure to do this is a legal error, often
referred to as a “Johnson error”.

[11]                         
As noted, the judge in 1998 did not consider the
recently enacted long‑term offender provisions and, with the benefit of
hindsight, this constituted a legal error in light of the 2003 judgment in Johnson. 
On the basis of this error and other considerations, the Court of Appeal
granted leave to reopen Mr. Sipos’ unresolved sentence appeal (2008 ONCA 325,
235 O.A.C. 277). But it took more than four years for this occur, so that the
appeal was reopened only in late April of 2008. 

[12]                         
There was a further long delay: the appeal on
the merits was not heard for more than four years, in August of 2012 (2012 ONCA
751, 298 O.A.C. 233). With the Crown’s consent, Mr. Sipos filed fresh evidence
in the appeal proceedings.  The fresh evidence consisted of a risk assessment,
prepared by Dr. Jeff McMaster in 2010, and information about his performance in
sexual offender maintenance programs while in custody. 

[13]                         
This is how the Court of Appeal came to address
in 2012 a dangerous offender designation that had been made roughly 14 years
earlier and had evidence before it that was created in 2010, roughly 12 years
after the designation.

B.           
Judgment of the Court of Appeal

[14]                         
The Court of Appeal concluded that, in light of Johnson,
there was clearly a legal error in not considering the long-term offender
option before designating Mr. Sipos as a dangerous offender. The Court of
Appeal noted, however, that this error does not automatically compel a new
dangerous offender hearing. Rather, the appellate court has a curative power:
it may dismiss the appeal if persuaded that there is no reasonable possibility
that the sentence would have been different had the legal error not been made
(see Johnson, at paras. 47-50).

[15]                         
Putting aside the fresh evidence, the Court of
Appeal concluded that there was no such reasonable possibility, noting that Mr.
Sipos did not contend otherwise.  The sentencing judge, in comprehensive
reasons, found that the evidence before him did not support the view that, at
some determinate point in the future, the risk that Mr. Sipos posed to society
could be reduced to an acceptable level if he were to be allowed to live in the
community. The sentencing judge’s analysis of the evidence would have
inevitably led him to reject a long-term offender designation for the same
reasons that he rejected the determinate sentence option: sentencing judge’s
reasons, at paras. 199-207; Court of Appeal reasons, at para. 29. 

[16]                         
The question then arose as to how the Court of
Appeal should use the new evidence in considering whether to exercise this
curative power. The new evidence suggests that there is now a
possibility that the risk that Mr. Sipos poses can be controlled in the
community by 2016 with appropriate supervision. The Court of Appeal held that,
while the new evidence must be considered, appellate review is fundamentally an
error-correcting exercise that looks backward to the decision under appeal, in
order to determine whether the court below fell into reversible error when it
made the decision being reviewed. It held that the possibility that a different
decision might be made if a new dangerous offender hearing were held now is
irrelevant.  The question on appeal was whether, having regard to the
evidence before the sentencing judge, and the fresh evidence admitted on
appeal, there was any reasonable possibility that the result of the dangerous
offender hearing would have been any different had the judge considered the
long-term offender provisions. 

[17]                         
The Court of Appeal answered this question in
the negative. The court noted that the new evidence from Dr. McMaster consisted
of his assessment as of 2010 and pertained to whether Mr. Sipos could meet the
criteria for a long-term offender. Even on Dr. McMaster’s “‘best case’
scenario”, his potential release into the community was at least some 18 years
away in 1998 (para. 34). Considering the report in light of the other evidence
before the sentencing judge, the Court of Appeal concluded that Dr. McMaster’s
risk assessment did not cast any doubt on the sentencing judge’s conclusion
that as of 1998, an indeterminate sentence was appropriate. 

III.       
Analysis

[18]                         
Before returning to the two issues in detail, it
will be helpful to place them in their proper legal framework. That, in turn,
requires a brief review of the difference between long-term offender and
dangerous offender status, this Court’s decision in Johnson, the nature
of appellate review and the powers of the court of appeal on dangerous offender
appeals.

A.          
Legal Framework

(1)        
The Two Regimes

[19]                         
The dangerous offender and long-term offender
provisions found in Part XXIV of the Criminal Code  are both examples of
preventive sanctions. While they may only come into play once the offender has
been convicted of offences of a certain degree of seriousness, their focus is
on imposing special measures on the offender in order to address an elevated
risk of future offending. A dangerous
offender may be sentenced to an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment; this is
preventive detention in its clearest and most extreme form. A long-term
offender may be sentenced for the underlying offence and, in addition, to a
long-term supervision order not to exceed 10 years.  This is a preventive
sanction that is finite in length and built on supervision in the community.

[20]                         
For the purposes
of this appeal, s. 753(1)(b) is the relevant provision in relation to
Mr. Sipos’ designation as a dangerous offender.  Before the designation may be
imposed, the offence for which the offender has been convicted must be a
“serious personal injury offence”. Serious personal injury offences include offences
involving the use or attempted use of violence for which the offender may be
sentenced to imprisonment for at least 10 years and a number of specified
sexual offences: s. 752. There is no question that Mr. Sipos’ convictions
qualify.  The remaining elements required for the designation are both
retrospective and prospective. The offender must be shown to have failed in the
past “to control his or her sexual impulses” and, in the future, that there is
“a likelihood of causing injury, pain or other evil to other persons through
failure in the future to control his or her sexual impulses”: s. 753(1)(b).

[21]                         
The long-term
offender provisions permit the court to impose a sentence for the offence for
which the offender has been convicted and order that he or she be
subject to long-term supervision for a period that does not exceed 10 years: s.
753.1(3). In order to make a long-term offender designation, the court must be
satisfied that it would be appropriate to impose a sentence of imprisonment of
at least two years for the offence for which the offender has been convicted,
that there is a substantial risk that the offender will reoffend, and that
there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community:
s. 753.1(1). 

(2)        
Johnson and the “Johnson
Error”

[22]                         
The two regimes
must be considered together. At the time of the sentencing judge’s decision,
the version of s. 753  in force was the same as the one interpreted by this
Court in Johnson. The Court held that if a
sentencing judge is satisfied that the long-term offender provisions are
sufficient to reduce the risk to the life, safety or physical or mental
well-being of other persons to an acceptable level, the judge “cannot properly
declare an offender dangerous and thereupon impose an indeterminate sentence,
even if all of the statutory criteria have been satisfied”: Johnson, at
para. 40.  Failure to consider these options became known as the “Johnson error”.
There is no dispute between the parties that the sentencing judge made it in
this case and it has not been suggested that the 2008 amendments to the
provisions (S.C. 2008, c. 6) affect that conclusion in this case. 

(3)        
Dangerous Offender Appeals

[23]                         
A person who has been found to be a dangerous offender
may appeal to the court of appeal on any ground of law or fact or mixed law and
fact: s. 759(1).  The appellate court has the statutory power to dismiss the
appeal or to allow it. If the court allows the appeal, it may find that the
offender is not a dangerous offender or a long-term offender, make an order
that the trial court could make or order a new hearing: s. 759(3)(a). 
There is no explicit reference to appellate review of the fitness of the
designation.  This Court has determined that appellate review is concerned with
legal errors and whether the dangerous offender designation was reasonable: R.
v. Currie, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 260, at para. 33. 

[24]                         
Consistent with this broad understanding of the
appellate court’s review of the sentence, this Court in Johnson interpreted
the power to dismiss an appeal as including the power to do so even in the face
of a legal error, provided that the error occasioned no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice. The Court emphasized, however, that this will be so “in
only the rarest of circumstances, if any”: para. 50. For the court to exercise
this curative power, the Crown must show that there is “no reasonable
possibility that the verdict would have been any different had the error of law
not been made”: para. 49.  

[25]                         
It is worth pausing here to contrast appellate
review of a dangerous offender designation with that of what I will refer to as
“regular” sentence appeals.  In indictable matters, the offender may appeal the
sentence passed by the trial court unless the sentence is one fixed by law: s.
675(1) (b).  On the appeal, the court of appeal is to “consider the
fitness of the sentence” and may “on such evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to
require or to receive”, vary the sentence or dismiss the appeal: s. 687(1).
This allows for appellate review for error in principle and for whether the
sentence is demonstrably unfit or manifestly wrong.  This is a highly
deferential standard of review. As Lamer C.J. put it in R. v. M. (C.A.),
[1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 90:

     . . . absent an
error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis
of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a
sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably unfit.

 

(See
also R. v. Shropshire, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, at paras. 45-50; R. v.
McDonnell, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, at paras. 14-17.)

[26]                         
The Court in Currie held that appellate
review of a dangerous offender designation is somewhat more robust.
Nonetheless, this does not call for a completely fresh look on appeal at the
designation (or as lawyers say, a de novo assessment).  The appellate
court must give some deference to the findings of the sentencing judge: Currie,
at para. 33.

[27]                         
Unlike dangerous offender appeals, there is no
curative power on “regular” sentence appeals and the predominant view is that
there is no authority in the court of appeal to remit the matter to the trial
judge for a new sentencing hearing. On a regular sentence appeal, the appellate
court’s role is to determine the legality and fitness of the sentence imposed
at trial. If the court of appeal finds that there are grounds requiring its
intervention, it imposes a fit sentence in what amounts to a new sentencing
hearing: Criminal Code , s. 687 . 

(4)        
Fresh Evidence on Sentence Appeals

[28]                         
On sentence appeals in indictable offences, the
court may consider “such evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to
receive”: s. 687(1). There is no parallel provision in relation to appeals of
dangerous offender designations. However, on those appeals, the court of appeal
may admit fresh evidence when it is in the interests of justice to do so: s.
759(7)  and s. 683(1) .  

[29]                         
The Court established in R. v. Lévesque,
2000 SCC 47, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 487, that while the sources and types of new evidence
are more flexible in relation to sentence appeals, the well-known “Palmer”
test governs admissibility of fresh evidence. That test, as is well known, sets
out four criteria concerned with due diligence, relevance, credibility and
impact on the result: Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759,
at p. 775. Generally, fresh evidence should not be received if it could have
been obtained at trial by exercising due diligence, although this criterion is
not strictly applied in criminal matters when it would be contrary to the
interests of justice to do so. The evidence must be relevant in the sense that
it relates to a potentially decisive issue and reasonably worthy of belief.
Finally, the evidence, if accepted, must reasonably be expected to have
affected the result when considered along with the trial evidence.  As Charron
J. explained in R. v. Angelillo, 2006 SCC 55, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 728, at
para. 15:

     In accordance with the
last three of the Palmer criteria, an appellate court can therefore
admit evidence only if it is relevant and credible and if it could
reasonably be expected to have affected the result had it been adduced at trial
together with the other evidence. [Emphasis added.]

 

[30]                         
Fresh evidence addressing events that have
occurred between the time of sentencing and the time of the appeal may raise
difficult issues which bring competing values into sharp relief. On one hand,
we must recognize, as Doherty J.A. put it in R. v. Hamilton (2004), 72
O.R. (3d) 1, at para. 166, that “[a]ppeals take time. Lives go on. Things
change. These human realities cannot be ignored when the Court of Appeal is
called upon to impose sentences well after the event.”  However, we must
equally pay attention to the institutional limitations of appellate courts and
the important value of finality. Routinely deciding sentence appeals on the
basis of after-the-fact developments could both jeopardize the integrity of the
criminal process by undermining its finality and surpass the appropriate bounds
of appellate review: Lévesque, at para. 20; R. v. Smith (2005),
376 A.R. 389 (C.A.), at paras. 21-25. 

[31]                         
Given the almost infinite variety of
circumstances that may arise, it is neither desirable nor possible to formulate
any hard and fast, detailed rules about the sorts of after-the-fact evidence
that should or should not be considered in all cases. The abundant appellate
jurisprudence cannot be reduced to a tidy set of rules, but rather reflects the
courts’ attempts to balance these at times competing values in light of
particular and widely varying sets of circumstances: see, e.g., R. v. Riley
(1996), 150 N.S.R. (2d) 390 (C.A.); R. v. Faid (1984), 52 A.R. 338
(C.A.); R. v. Jimmie, 2009 BCCA 215, 270 B.C.A.C. 301; R. v. Halliday,
2012 ONCA 351 (CanLII); and generally, C. C. Ruby, G. J. Chan and N. R. Hasan, Sentencing
(8th ed. 2012), at §§ 4.49 ff.; R. v. N.A.S., 2007 MBCA 97, 220
Man. R. (2d) 43; R. v. Martin, 2012 QCCA 2223 (CanLII). At the level of
principle, the approach set out in Lévesque and Angelillo strikes
the balance between the competing values and, when applied thoughtfully to the
particular circumstances before the court, provides sufficient flexibility to
ensure that the appellate process is both responsive to the demands of justice
and respectful of the proper limits of appellate review.

[32]                         
With this legal framework in mind, I now return
to the issues raised on appeal by Mr. Sipos.

B.           
Did the Court of Appeal Err by Using Its
Curative Powers?

[33]                         
The appellant’s basic point is that the Court of
Appeal’s error was to limit the application of its curative power by asking
whether there was a reasonable possibility that the result at the original
hearing would have been different but for the legal error. Instead, the
appellant submits that the Court of Appeal ought to have followed what he says
is the usual practice on sentence appeals of considering what would be a fit
sentence at the time of the appeal: A.F., at paras. 16-17. This position, in my
respectful view, is fundamentally flawed.

[34]                         
The appellant’s submission in my view confuses
appellate review for legal error with appellate review for the reasonableness
of the designation. Whether the curative power should be exercised is part of
appellate review for legal error. The question essentially involves considering
what impact, if any, the legal error had on the outcome. In considering that
question, fresh evidence generally has little role to play.  On the other hand,
whether the designation is reasonable is a more searching form of appellate
review and fresh evidence that meets the Palmer criterion potentially
has a greater role to play in that context. 

(1)        
The Curative Power and Fresh Evidence

[35]                         
 In dangerous offender appeals, the appellate
court may use its curative power to dismiss an appeal even though there was a
legal error at first instance. This power may be used only where the legal
error was “harmless” in the sense that there is no reasonable possibility that
the result would have been different had the error not been made. It follows
that a legal error does not necessarily require reconsideration of the
sentence. The appellate court must consider whether the error had any impact on
the result. But there is a heavy onus on the Crown: it must show that there is
no reasonable possibility that the result would have been different had the error
not been made.  

[36]                         
This exercise is necessarily focused on the
record before the sentencing judge because the question concerns what that
judge might have done had he or she applied correct legal principles. Of
course, the appellate court must also consider whether the judge’s legal error
may have resulted in exclusion of evidence that ought to have been admitted or
otherwise affected the state of the evidentiary record or the judge’s
assessment of it: see, e.g., R. v. Williamson, 2003 BCCA 673, 191
B.C.A.C. 208; R. v. Ferguson (2005), 207 O.A.C. 380; R. v. B.J.M.,
2007 ONCA 221 (CanLII). In cases of that nature, fresh evidence meeting the Palmer
test might be admitted so that the appellate court can properly consider the
impact of the error on the outcome. But generally speaking, where proposed new
evidence has nothing to do with the possible impact of the legal error on the
sentencing judge’s decision, it should not be considered in relation to the use
of the curative power. This is nothing more than application of the second Palmer
criterion: that the evidence be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a
decisive or potentially decisive issue relating to the sentence. Evidence that
is in no way linked to the legal error made by the sentencing judge is not relevant
to the question of whether the curative power should be used.

[37]                         
In this respect, I differ from the view of the
Court of Appeal. It held that evidence of the offender’s current rehabilitative
prospects has a role to play in connection with applying the proviso. In my
view, absent some connection between the fresh evidence and the sentencing
judge’s legal error, it does not.

[38]                         
In this case, the fresh evidence has nothing to
do with the impact of the legal error made by the sentencing judge. There is no
dispute that, on the record before the sentencing judge, the only realistic
option was a dangerous offender designation. There is no suggestion that the
judge’s failure to consider a long-term offender designation in any way
affected the evidentiary record before him or that he might have weighed the
evidence differently if he had considered the long-term offender option.

[39]                         
The appellant’s submission amounts to this:
every legal error made by the sentencing judge requires the appellate court to
direct a new hearing if there is any reasonable possibility that a different
sentence would now be imposed. This approach, in my view, has two flaws. First,
it loses entirely the correct focus when exercising the curative power. That
focus is on the possible impact of the error on the sentencing judge’s
decision, not on the offender’s current prospects for control in the
community. Second, losing that focus in effect creates a very low threshold for
obtaining a new sentencing hearing.  This, in my respectful view, turns the
legal framework on its head. The appellate court would no longer be assessing
the possible impact of the legal error on the result arrived at by the
sentencing judge, but would be using the error to trigger a complete assessment
of the current appropriateness of the sentencing judge’s decision. In short,
any legal error, even though it could have had no conceivable impact on the
sentencing judge’s decision, would require a new hearing unless the same result
would almost inevitably be reached now.  This approach, if adopted, would
convert appellate review for legal error into sentencing by instalment. 

[40]                         
The issue for the appellate court is not, as the
appellant contends, what the outcome might conceivably be today. Rather, the
issue is whether the past decision would have been the same notwithstanding the
error: R.F., at para. 51.  I respectfully agree with Doherty J.A., writing for
the Court of Appeal in this case, that on the appellant’s proposed approach,

the claim
is not that the appellant was wrongly sentenced to an indefinite period of
incarceration because the trial judge made a legal error, but that because the
judge made a legal error the appellant should have his status reassessed as of
the time of the appeal. 

. . . 

     . . . Where
an offender’s real claim is that he has progressed to the point that his status
should be reassessed, an appeal from the original decision is not the
appropriate mechanism by which to achieve that new assessment. [paras. 20 and
23] 

C.           
 Should the Dangerous Offender Designation
Nonetheless Be Set Aside?

[41]                         
As I have explained, my view is that the Court
of Appeal took too expansive a view of the role of fresh evidence in relation
to exercising the court’s curative power.  As I see it, there is no role for
the fresh evidence in relation to the curative power in this appeal; the only
remaining question is whether the dangerous offender designation should be set
aside because it is unreasonable. This, in my respectful view, is the better
lens through which to consider whether the Court of Appeal erred in its
ultimate conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed. In my view, it did
not.

[42]                         
The offender may appeal a dangerous offender
designation on the basis that it is unreasonable: Currie.  There is thus
potentially a wider role for fresh evidence in relation to appellate review on
this basis than there is when the appellate court is considering whether or not
a legal error was harmless. While the new evidence must satisfy the Palmer criteria,
the appellate court may review the sentence in light of the whole record,
including any admissible fresh evidence. However, in the case of review on this
basis, the onus is on the offender.

[43]                         
In dangerous offender appeals, the appellate
courts are frequently confronted, as we are in this appeal, with evidence about
the offender’s rehabilitation efforts and prospects long after the initial
sentencing.  While the Lévesque/Angelillo test sets out the applicable
legal framework for admitting this sort of evidence, appellate courts generally
take a very cautious approach to intervening solely on the basis of evidence of
this nature: see, e.g., R. v. T.L., 2008 ONCA 766 (CanLII); R. v.
Mason (2001), 147 O.A.C. 388; Halliday; R. v. Henry, 2002
BCCA 575, 174 B.C.A.C. 238; Jimmie.  Appellate courts have also
recognized that in a proper case, in which the evidence is sufficiently
compelling, they may intervene on the basis of after-the-fact evidence: see,
e.g., Halliday, at para. 17; R. v. Armistead, 2003 BCCA 699, 192
B.C.A.C. 227. However, evidence about the offender’s post-sentencing
rehabilitative efforts and prospects will only exceptionally meet the Lévesque/Angelillo
test. Those developments are generally speaking matters for the correctional
authorities to consider in the course of administering the offender’s
indeterminate sentence.

[44]                         
While fresh evidence has a potentially larger
role to play in this context, the focus is still to a degree retrospective. The
focus is on the impact of the new evidence on the sentencing proceeding, viewed
in the context of the whole record. 

[45]                         
Mr. Sipos highlights that the thrust of the
sentencing judge’s reasons was that “[the latter] was unpersuaded on the record
before him that [he] would ever be a suitable candidate for release even
if a very long determinate sentence were imposed”: A.F., at para. 38 (emphasis
in original). Mr. Sipos refers to the sentencing judge’s conclusion that there
was “no hard evidence . . . supporting the probability of a cure”
during any determinate sentence that could be imposed: ibid., citing the
sentencing judge’s reasons, at para. 200. The sentencing judge based this
conclusion on the findings that the appellant refused drug therapy and that any
positive comments on rehabilitation prospects were “islands of optimism in a
sea of pathology”: sentencing judge’s reasons, at para. 201.  Mr. Sipos submits
that the new evidence from Dr. McMaster shows that the assessment at the time
of the original sentencing hearing was unduly pessimistic. 

[46]                         
As the appellant’s case rests on Dr. McMaster’s
report, it is useful to summarize its key elements and conclusions. Dr.
McMaster produced a comprehensive report in 2010 assessing Mr. Sipos’
psychiatric status. He was asked “whether Mr. Sipos present[ed] with a
substantial risk of re-offence [as of 2010] and if there [was] a reasonable
possibility of eventual control of that risk in the community”.  Dr. McMaster concluded that Mr. Sipos “continue[d] to meet the
standard for being found a dangerous offender (D.O.)”. 

[47]                         
Dr. McMaster noted that some factors, which he
reviewed in detail, suggested that Mr. Sipos was “now suitable for gradual
release and reintegration into the community”. These factors included “his
increased age, his successful treatment at sex offender and other groups, [his]
successful treatment with sex drive reducing medication, and his plans which
will assist him in adjusting to living in the community”. 
Dr. McMaster noted, however, that it was “unclear” whether Mr. Sipos’
success in sex offender groups and lower risk would result in no recidivism in
the “real world practical sense” and that any reintegration into the community
should be undertaken in a “slow and step-wise fashion” using “extremely close
monitoring and structure”. He concluded that from a psychiatric perspective he
would not consider Mr. Sipos to be an assumable risk for the community until
approximately the age of 60 with a further period of 10 years under a long-term
supervision order “for safe measure”. In other words, Dr. McMaster thought
there was a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the
community if Mr. Sipos were released from incarceration in about 2016 and was
subject to the maximum 10-year long-term supervision order. This opinion was
subject to many qualifications in relation to such matters as whether Mr.
Sipos’ advancing age would in fact reduce the risk; whether he would continue
to take medication reducing his sex drive; whether his motivation to engage in
treatment would be decreased if he were released into the community and whether
adequate supervision was available in a community setting. 

[48]                         
This evidence shows that Mr. Sipos has made commendable progress
in recent years, progress that was not foreseen at the time of his sentencing
in 1998. However, Dr. McMaster’s report, viewed in light of the full record
before the sentencing judge, falls considerably short of showing that
the dangerous offender designation was unreasonable. I agree
with Doherty J.A. that, placing ourselves in the position of the sentencing
judge with the added information from Dr. McMaster’s assessment, there is no
reasonable possibility that the result would have been different. It follows
that there is also insufficient evidence to show that the sentencing judge’s
decision, even had he had the benefit of Dr. McMaster’s report, was
unreasonable. As Doherty J.A. put it:

     I do not think that Dr. McMaster’s
risk assessment casts any doubt on the trial judge’s assessment that as of
1998, an indeterminate sentence was the appropriate sentence.  Despite the
positive treatment developments, Dr. McMaster still viewed the appellant’s
potential release into the community as about six years distant.  We now
know, with the benefit of hindsight, and accepting Dr. McMaster’s opinion, that
on a “best case” scenario, the appellant’s potential for release into
the community was at least some 18 years away in 1998. [Emphasis added;

Nor am I persuaded that this evidence places the
appeal in that exceptional category in which the evidence is sufficiently
compelling that it demands appellate intervention.  

[50]                         
My view is that the Court of Appeal was correct
to uphold the dangerous offender designation in this case.

on appeal from the court of appeal
for newfoundland and labrador

                    Criminal law — Evidence — Admissibility —
Confessions — “Mr. Big” confessions — Accused confessing to murdering his
two young daughters at end of lengthy Mr. Big operation — Whether new

                    H’s
twin daughters drowned on August 4, 2002.  The police immediately suspected
that H was responsible for their deaths.  However, they lacked the evidence
needed to charge him.  As a result, two years after the drowning, undercover
officers began a “Mr. Big” operation by recruiting H into a fictitious
criminal organization.  At the time, H was unemployed and socially isolated —
he rarely left home and when he did, he was in the company of his wife.  After
he was recruited to the organization, H worked with the undercover officers and
was quickly befriended by them.  Over the next four months, H participated in
63 “scenarios” with the undercover officers and was paid more than $15,000 for
the work that he did for the organization.  As part of that work, H was also
sent on several trips across Canada — to Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto and
Vancouver.  H often stayed in hotels and occasionally dined in expensive
restaurants during these trips, all at the fictitious organization’s expense. 
Over time, the undercover officers became H’s best friends and H came to view
them as his brothers.  According to one of the undercover officers, during this
time frame, H made a bald statement in which he confessed to having drowned his
daughters.

                    The
operation culminated with a meeting akin to a job interview between H and “Mr. Big”,
the man purportedly at the helm of the criminal organization.  During their
meeting, Mr. Big interrogated H about the death of his daughters, seeking
a confession from him.  After initially denying responsibility, H confessed to
drowning his daughters.  Two days later, H went to the scene of the drowning
with an undercover officer and explained how he had pushed his daughters into
the water.  He was arrested shortly thereafter.  

                    At
trial, H’s confessions were admitted into evidence.  The trial judge denied H’s
request for permission to testify with the public excluded from the courtroom. 
A majority of the Court of Appeal allowed H’s appeal and ordered a new trial. 
The Court of Appeal unanimously held that the trial judge erred in refusing to
allow H to testify outside the presence of the public.  A majority of the court
also concluded that the Mr. Big operation had breached H’s right to
silence under s. 7 of the Charter.  The majority excluded two of
H’s confessions, the one to Mr. Big and the one to the undercover officer
at the scene of the drowning.  However, the majority concluded that H’s bald
confession was admissible and ordered a new trial.  

                    Held:
 The appeal should be dismissed.

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Abella, Moldaver and Wagner JJ.: There
is agreement with the Court of Appeal that, in the circumstances of this case,
H should have been allowed to testify outside the presence of the public.

                    The
Mr. Big technique is a Canadian invention.  Although a version of the
technique appears to have been used more than a century ago, its modern
use began in the 1990s and, by 2008, it had been used by police across Canada
more than 350 times.  The technique, used only in cases involving serious
unsolved crimes, has secured confessions and convictions in hundreds of cases. 
The confessions wrought by the technique are often detailed and confirmed by
other evidence. 

                    However,
the Mr. Big technique comes at a price.  Suspects confess to Mr. Big
during pointed interrogations in the face of powerful inducements and sometimes
veiled threats — and this raises the spectre of unreliable confessions. 
Unreliable confessions provide compelling evidence of guilt and present a clear
and straightforward path to conviction.  In other contexts, they have been
responsible for wrongful convictions — a fact we cannot ignore. 

                    Mr. Big
confessions are also invariably accompanied by evidence that shows the accused
willingly participated in “simulated crime” and was eager to join a criminal
organization.  This evidence sullies the accused’s character and, in doing so,
carries with it the risk of prejudice.  

                    Experience
in Canada and elsewhere teaches that wrongful convictions are often traceable
to evidence that is either unreliable or prejudicial.  When the two combine,
they make for a potent mix — and the risk of a wrongful conviction increases
accordingly.  Wrongful convictions are a blight on our justice system.  We must
take reasonable steps to prevent them before they occur.  

                    Mr. Big
operations also run the risk of becoming abusive.  Undercover officers provide
their targets with inducements, including cash rewards, to encourage them to
confess.  They also cultivate an aura of violence by showing that those who
betray the criminal organization are met with violence.  There is a risk these
operations may become coercive.  Thought must be given to the kinds of police
tactics we, as a society, are prepared to condone in pursuit of the truth.

                    Under
existing law, Mr. Big confessions are routinely admitted under the party
admissions exception to the hearsay rule.  Attempts to extend existing legal
protections to Mr. Big operations have failed.  This Court has held that Mr. Big
operations do not engage the right to silence because the accused is not
detained by the police at the time he or she confesses.  And the confessions
rule — which requires the Crown to prove an accused’s statement to a person in
authority is “voluntary” — is inoperative because the accused does not know
that Mr. Big is a police officer when he confesses.

                    In
sum, the law as it stands provides insufficient protection to accused persons
who confess during Mr. Big operations.  A two-pronged response is needed
to address the concerns with reliability, prejudice and police misconduct
raised by these operations.

                    The
first prong requires recognizing a new common law rule of evidence.  Under this
rule, where the state recruits an accused into a fictitious criminal
organization and seeks to elicit a confession from him, any confession made by
the accused to the state during the operation should be treated as
presumptively inadmissible.  This presumption of inadmissibility is overcome
where the Crown can establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the
probative value of the confession outweighs its prejudicial effect. 

                    The
probative value of a Mr. Big confession is a function of its reliability. 
In assessing the reliability of a Mr. Big confession, courts must first
look to the circumstances in which the statement was made.  These circumstances
include — but are not strictly limited to — the length of the operation, the
number of interactions between the police and the accused, the nature of the
relationship between the undercover officers and the accused, the nature and
extent of the inducements offered, the presence of any threats, the conduct of
the interrogation itself, and the personality of the accused, including his or
her age, sophistication and mental health.  The question for the trial judge is
whether and to what extent the reliability of the confession has been called
into doubt by the circumstances in which it was made.

                    After
considering the circumstances in which the confession was made, the court
should look to the confession itself for markers of reliability.  Trial judges
should consider the level of detail contained in the confession, whether it
leads to the discovery of additional evidence, whether it identifies any
elements of the crime that have not been made public, or whether it accurately
describes mundane details of the crime the accused would likely not know had he
or she not committed it.  Confirmatory evidence is not a hard and fast
requirement, but where it exists, it can provide a powerful guarantee of
reliability.  The greater the concerns raised by the circumstances in which the
confession was made, the more important it will be to find markers of
reliability in the confession itself or the surrounding evidence. 

                    Weighing
the prejudicial effect of a Mr. Big confession is a more straightforward
and familiar exercise.  Trial judges must be aware that admitting Mr. Big
confessions creates a risk of moral and reasoning prejudice.  With respect to
moral prejudice, the jury learns that the accused wanted to join a criminal
organization and committed a host of “simulated crimes” that he believed were
real.  Moral prejudice may increase with operations that involve the accused in
simulated crimes of violence, or that demonstrate the accused has a past
history of violence.  As for reasoning prejudice — defined as the risk that the
jury’s focus will be distracted away from the charges before the court — it too
can pose a problem depending on the length of the operation, the amount of time
that must be spent detailing it, and any controversy as to whether a particular
event or conversation occurred.  However, the risk of prejudice can be
mitigated by excluding certain pieces of particularly prejudicial evidence that
are unessential to the narrative, or by providing limiting instructions to the
jury.  

                    In
the end, trial judges must weigh the probative value and the prejudicial effect
of the confession at issue and decide whether the Crown has met its burden.  Because
trial judges, after assessing the evidence before them, are in the best
position to conduct this exercise, their decision to admit or exclude a Mr. Big
confession will be afforded deference on appeal.

                    This
new common law rule of evidence goes a long way toward addressing the concerns
with reliability, prejudice, and police misconduct that are raised by Mr. Big
operations.  It squarely tackles the problems with reliability and prejudice.  In
addition, it takes account of police misconduct both by placing the admissibility
onus on the Crown and by factoring the conduct of the police into the
assessment of a Mr. Big confession’s probative value.  However, the common
law rule of evidence I have proposed does not provide a complete response to
the problems raised by Mr. Big operations.  On its own, it might suggest
that abusive police conduct will be forgiven so long as a demonstrably reliable
confession is ultimately secured. 

                    The
second prong of the response fills this gap by relying on the doctrine of abuse
of process.  The doctrine of abuse of process is intended to guard against
state misconduct that threatens the integrity of the justice system and the
fairness of trials. 

                    Trial
judges must be aware that Mr. Big operations can become abusive.  It is of
course impossible to set out a precise formula for determining when a Mr. Big
operation will reach that threshold.  But there is one guideline that can be
suggested.  In conducting an operation, the police cannot be permitted to
overcome the will of the accused and coerce a confession.  This would almost
certainly amount to an abuse of process.  While violence and threats of
violence are two forms of unacceptable coercion, operations can become abusive
in other ways.  Operations that prey on an accused’s vulnerabilities, such as
mental health problems, substance addictions, or youthfulness, can also become
unacceptable.

                    Unsurprisingly,
the trial judge did not apply this two pronged framework in determining the
admissibility of H’s confessions.  Nor did the parties address it in the courts
below or before this Court.  Nonetheless, this Court is in a position to decide
whether the respondent’s confessions were properly admitted.  Although a new
rule has emerged, the issues have not changed: the reliability of H’s
confessions, their potential for prejudice, and the conduct of the police in
carrying out this Mr. Big operation have been in issue from the outset.  The
parties have addressed these issues, and there is a substantial record before
us.  These proceedings have also been difficult and protracted.  More than a
decade has passed since H’s daughters died.  Ordering a new trial and leaving
the admissibility of H’s confessions to be determined by a new trial judge
would be tantamount to sending this case back to square one.  That would not be
in the interests of justice.

                    Applying
the new common law rule to the three confessions attributed to H, it is
apparent that their probative value does not outweigh their prejudicial
effect.  At the time the operation began, H was unemployed and socially
isolated.  The operation had a transformative effect on his life, lifting him
out of poverty and providing him with illusory friendships.  These financial
and social inducements provided H with an overwhelming incentive to confess —
either truthfully or falsely.

                    Nor
do the confessions themselves contain any markers of reliability that are
capable of restoring faith in their reliability.  The confessions contain
internal contradictions, and there is no confirmatory evidence capable of
verifying any of the details contained within the confessions.  When the
circumstances in which the respondent’s confessions were made are considered
alongside their internal inconsistencies and the lack of any confirmatory
evidence, their reliability is left in serious doubt.  

                    On
the other hand, these confessions — like all Mr. Big confessions — carried
with them an obvious potential for prejudice.  The jury heard extensive
evidence that for four months H devoted himself to trying to join a criminal organization
and that he repeatedly participated in what he thought were criminal acts.  It
is easy to see how the jury could come to view H with disdain.  Here was a man
who bragged about killing his three-year-old daughters to gain the approval of
criminals.  The potential for prejudice in these circumstances was significant.         

                    On
balance, the Crown has not met its onus.  The probative value of H’s
confessions does not outweigh their prejudicial effect.  Put simply, these
confessions are not worth the risk they pose.  It would be unsafe to rest a
conviction on this evidence.  It is accordingly unnecessary to decide whether
the police conduct amounted to an abuse of process.

                    Having
excluded H’s confessions from evidence, it is doubtful whether any admissible
evidence remains upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably,
could convict H of murder.  However, the final decision on how to proceed rests
with the Crown.  

                    Per Cromwell J.: There
is agreement with the majority’s analysis of the legal framework that ought to
apply to statements obtained from accused persons as a result of Mr. Big
operations.  However, the admissibility of H’s statements to the undercover
officers ought to be determined at a new trial where the judge and the parties
would have the benefit of the new framework set out in the majority’s reasons.

                    Per Karakatsanis J.:
Confessions to state agents raise particular dangers for the criminal justice
system.  The very structure of Mr. Big operations creates
circumstances that (1) compromise the suspects’ autonomy, (2) undermine
the reliability of confessions, and (3) raise concerns about abusive state
conduct.  Yet, Mr. Big confessions are not caught by the
traditional rules governing confessions to the state, such as the confessions
rule or the right to silence.  The common law rule proposed by the majority
fails to consistently take into account broader concerns that arise when state
agents generate a confession at a cost to human dignity, personal autonomy and
the administration of justice.  The principle against self-incrimination, under
s. 7 of the Charter, provides comprehensive and flexible protection
in such circumstances.

                    The
principle against self-incrimination provides the appropriate analytical
framework for several reasons.  First, Mr. Big operations directly engage
the individual privacy, autonomy and dignity interests that the principle is
meant to protect.  Second, this approach draws on existing jurisprudence
concerning the principle against self-incrimination, making it unnecessary to
create a new rule.  Third, the principle provides an opportunity to
weigh intertwined concerns about reliability, autonomy and state conduct
together in a nuanced way.  Finally, it addresses suspects’ rights both during
the operation and at trial.

                    In
R. v. White, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 417, this Court identified four factors for
determining whether the principle against self-incrimination has been violated
by the production or use of a suspect’s statements: adversarial relationship;
coercion; reliability; and abuse of state power.  While these factors should be
considered together, each emphasizes a particular legal interest.

                    The
onus will be on the accused to establish a prima facie breach of the
principle against self-incrimination.  To do so, the accused must show that
concerns about autonomy, reliability, and police conduct exist, as they will in
nearly every Mr. Big operation.  In such circumstances, the burden will
shift to the Crown to establish that there is no breach. 

                    As
concerns the first factor, the relationship between H and the state was
adversarial.  As in any Mr. Big operation, the police deliberately set out
to obtain a confession from him.  

                    As
for the second factor, coercion is primarily concerned with the autonomy and
dignity of the suspect and asks whether the suspect had a choice to speak to
the authorities.  There will almost always be some degree of coercion in a Mr. Big
operation.  The court should consider: the magnitude and duration of the
operation, any explicit or implied threats used, any financial, social or
emotional inducements applied, and the characteristics of the suspect,
including any mental, physical, social or economic disadvantages.  This
approach protects the autonomy of the suspect. 

                    In
this case, the trial judge concentrated on the lack of violent coercion during
the operation, but did not consider the effect of the financial and social
inducements on H.  These inducements were significant by anyone’s measure, but must
be viewed as more seriously infringing H’s autonomy interests, given his extreme
poverty and social isolation as well as his lack of education.  The deceit employed
was extensive.  By preying on his vulnerabilities to such a degree, the police
deprived H of meaningful choice about whether to give an incriminating
statement to Mr. Big.  

                    The
reliability enquiry focuses on the trustworthiness of any statement obtained. 
The court must execute a gatekeeper function in assessing the risk of a false
confession and corroborating evidence will usually be a prerequisite to
admission.  This function is important because juries often struggle to
properly assess the ultimate reliability of Mr. Big confessions.  They
find it difficult to believe that someone would confess to a crime that he or
she did not commit and are loath to disregard a confession even where it is
known to be coerced.  This danger is compounded by the criminal propensity
evidence generated during a Mr. Big investigation.  An accused must either
let the confession stand or explain that he or she made it to continue their
new criminal lifestyle.  Thus, confessions made to Mr. Big are
particularly hazardous and the judge must evaluate their threshold reliability to
satisfy the principle against self-incrimination.  Generally, an
uncorroborated, unverified confession will not be sufficiently reliable and
will be inadmissible.  However, the inverse does not necessarily hold.  The
principle against self-incrimination is not solely concerned with ensuring
reliable statements; even true statements may be excluded if they were obtained
through coercion that overrode the suspect’s autonomy interest. 

                    In
this case, H had every incentive to confess, whether he committed the crime or
not.  Not only was his final confession uncorroborated, but it contained
inconsistencies with the other known facts of the case.  Likewise, H’s April 10
confession carries many of the same reliability concerns.

                    Under
the fourth and final factor, the conduct of the state is examined with a view
to determining whether the authorities used their position of power in an
unfair, abusive, or shocking manner.  State conduct throughout a Mr. Big
operation must be scrutinized to determine whether it unfairly, unnecessarily
or disproportionately manipulated the suspect.  This inquiry will also consider
other objectionable police tactics such as involving the suspect in dangerous
conduct or exposing him or her to physical or psychological harm.  The
entrapment doctrine assists by identifying factors which may be considered in
examining the conduct of the state.

                    In
this case, the police conduct was egregious and this factor especially weighs
in favour of exclusion.  The extreme lengths to which the police went to pursue
H, exploiting his weaknesses in this protracted and deeply manipulative
operation, is troubling.  This was not the usual undercover investigation where
police join an existing criminal organization to witness criminals in action.  This
case is more akin to entrapment. 

                    The
court should consider these factors collectively,
attaching weight to them, depending on the degree to which they are present in
the individual case.  The four factors above clearly point
to a s. 7 violation.  Statements obtained in violation of the principle
against self-incrimination will almost always be excluded under s. 24(2). 
This case is no exception; both the risk of a miscarriage of justice and the
abusive police conduct call for exclusion.

                    The
abuse of process doctrine always
remains independently available to provide a remedy where the conduct of the
state rises to such a level that it risks undermining the integrity of the judicial
process.  In this case, the threshold is met.

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
When conventional investigations fail to solve
serious crimes, police forces in Canada have sometimes used the “Mr. Big”
technique.  A Mr. Big operation begins with undercover officers luring their
suspect into a fictitious criminal organization of their own making.  Over the
next several weeks or months, the suspect is befriended by the undercover
officers.  He is shown that working with the organization provides a pathway to
financial rewards and close friendships.  There is only one catch.  The crime
boss — known colloquially as “Mr. Big” — must approve the suspect’s membership
in the criminal organization.  

[2]                             
The operation culminates with an interview-like
meeting between the suspect and Mr. Big.  During the interview, Mr. Big brings
up the crime the police are investigating and questions the suspect about it. 
Denials of guilt are dismissed, and Mr. Big presses the suspect for a
confession.  As Mr. Big’s questioning continues, it becomes clear to the
suspect that by confessing to the crime, the big prize — acceptance into the
organization — awaits.  If the suspect does confess, the fiction soon unravels
and the suspect is arrested and charged.

[3]                             
This case provides us with an opportunity to
take an in-depth look at Mr. Big confessions and the principles that should
govern their admissibility.  While such operations have a long history in this
country, courts have yet to create a legal framework that addresses the unique
issues which accompany such confessions.  As we undertake that task in this
case, we must strive to achieve a just balance — one which guards against the
risk of wrongful convictions that stem from false confessions but which ensures
the police are not deprived of the opportunity to use their skill and ingenuity
in solving serious crimes.

[4]                             
To be sure, the Mr. Big technique has proven to
be an effective investigative tool.  It has produced confessions and secured
convictions in hundreds of cases that would otherwise have likely gone
unsolved.  The confessions elicited are often detailed and confirmed by other
evidence.  Manifestly, the technique has proved indispensible in the search for
the truth.  

[5]                             
But the technique comes with a price.  Suspects
confess to Mr. Big during pointed interrogations in the face of powerful
inducements and sometimes veiled threats — and this raises the spectre of
unreliable confessions.  

[6]                             
Unreliable confessions present a unique danger. 
They provide compelling evidence of guilt and present a clear and
straightforward path to conviction.  Certainly in the case of conventional
confessions, triers of fact have difficulty accepting that an innocent person
would confess to a crime he did not commit.  And yet our experience with
wrongful convictions shows that innocent people can, and do, falsely confess. 
Unreliable confessions have been responsible for wrongful convictions — a fact
we cannot ignore. 

[7]                             
The concern about Mr. Big confessions does not
end there.  The confessions are invariably accompanied by evidence that shows
the accused willingly participated in “simulated crime” and was eager to join a
criminal organization.  This evidence sullies the accused’s character and, in
doing so, carries with it the risk of prejudice.  It also creates credibility
hurdles that may be difficult to overcome for an accused who chooses to
testify.

[8]                             
Experience in Canada and elsewhere teaches that
wrongful convictions are often traceable to evidence that is either unreliable
or prejudicial.  When the two combine, they make for a potent mix — and the
risk of a wrongful conviction increases accordingly.  Wrongful convictions are
a blight on our justice system and we must take reasonable steps to prevent
them before they occur.  

[9]                             
Finally, Mr. Big operations run the risk of
becoming abusive.  Undercover officers provide their targets with inducements,
including cash rewards, to encourage them to confess.  They also cultivate an
aura of violence by showing that those who betray the criminal organization are
met with violence.  Thought must be given to the kinds of police tactics we, as
a society, are prepared to condone in pursuit of the truth.

[10]                         
Against that background, I am of the view that a
principled rule of evidence is required to assess the admissibility of Mr. Big
confessions.  For reasons that follow, I would propose that where the state
recruits an accused into a fictitious criminal organization of its own making
and seeks to elicit a confession from him, any confession made by the accused
to the state during the operation should be treated as presumptively
inadmissible.  This presumption of inadmissibility will be overcome where the
Crown can establish, on balance, that the probative value of the confession
outweighs its prejudicial effect.  In this context, the confession’s probative
value is a function of its reliability.  Its prejudicial effect stems from the
harmful character evidence that necessarily accompanies its admission.  If the
Crown is unable to demonstrate that the accused’s confession is admissible, the
rest of the evidence surrounding the Mr. Big operation becomes irrelevant.  

[11]                         
Trial judges must also carefully scrutinize the
conduct of the police to determine if an abuse of process has occurred.  No
matter how reliable the confession, the courts cannot condone state conduct —
such as physical violence — that coerces the target of a Mr. Big operation into
confessing.  Where an accused establishes that an abuse of process has
occurred, the court can fashion an appropriate remedy, including the exclusion
of the confession or a stay of proceedings. 

[12]                         
In this case, at the end of a lengthy Mr. Big
operation, the respondent confessed to murdering his two young daughters.  At
trial, his confessions were admitted into evidence.  A majority of the
Newfoundland Court of Appeal concluded that two of the three confessions should
have been excluded, but allowed a third confession to be introduced and, on
that basis, ordered a new trial.  

[13]                         
Applying the framework I propose here, I would
exclude all three of the respondent’s confessions.  Each of them came about in
the face of overwhelming inducements.  This calls into question their
reliability — and there is no confirmatory evidence capable of restoring our
faith in them.  As such, they carry little if any probative value.  On the
other hand, the bad character evidence accompanying the confessions carries
with it an obvious and serious potential for prejudice.  In these
circumstances, the prejudicial effect of the respondent’s confessions outweighs
their probative value.

[14]                         
Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.

II.          
Background Facts

[15]                         
The facts in this case are important.  I propose
to review them in some detail.

A.          
The Deaths of Karen and Krista Hart

[16]                         
The respondent’s three-year-old twin daughters —
Karen and Krista Hart — drowned on August 4, 2002.  Their deaths triggered a
three-year-long investigation that culminated with the respondent confessing to
their murder at the end of a protracted Mr. Big operation. 

[17]                         
The respondent was the last person to see his
daughters alive.  On the morning of August 4, 2002, he took them to play on the
swings at a park near their home in Gander, Newfoundland.  There was a lake
adjacent to the park.  According to his wife, the respondent returned home 30
to 45 minutes later, in a panic, and told her that Krista had fallen into the
water.  When his wife asked where Karen was, the respondent claimed to have
forgotten her at the park.

[18]                         
The respondent and his wife raced back to the
park and an ambulance was
called.  First responders found Karen and Krista floating in the lake several
hundred meters apart from each other.  By then, it was too late to save their
lives.  

[19]                         
The respondent’s unusual behaviour provoked the
suspicion of the police.  They questioned him that evening.  The respondent
said that when he got to the park and removed his daughters from their car
seats, they ran onto a dock and Krista fell into the water.  The respondent
said he panicked because he could not swim, so he ran back to his car and drove
home to get his wife, forgetting Karen on the dock.  The police remained
unconvinced and asked the respondent why he did not call for help using either
of the cell phones that were found in his car.  The respondent explained that
his phone did not have any minutes on it, and that the other phone did not
belong to him.  He also said that he never thought of stopping at a
nearby restaurant or hospital for help instead of driving all the way home to
get his wife.  When the police confronted him directly, the respondent denied
that he had drowned his daughters.

[20]                         
The police were convinced that the respondent
killed his daughters and lied to them during his first interview.  They
questioned him again on September 12, 2002.  During the interrogation, which
lasted approximately eight hours, the police told the respondent they had no
doubt about his guilt and urged him to confess.  The respondent stood firm.

[21]                         
Two weeks later, however, the respondent changed
his story.  He contacted the police and volunteered that he had not been
truthful in his previous statements.  He told the police that he had a seizure
at the park after he removed his daughters from the car.  When the seizure
passed and he “[came] to”, he was “dopey” but he could see one of his daughters
“in the water”.  His only thought was to drive home to his wife.  He explained
that he had lied in his earlier statements because he did not want to lose his
driver’s licence.  The respondent suffers from epilepsy and his licence
has been suspended on previous occasions because of his condition.

[22]                         
The police remained convinced of the
respondent’s guilt, but they did not have sufficient evidence to charge him. 
The investigation went cold.  

B.           
The Mr. Big Operation

[23]                         
Two years later, the police rekindled the investigation
after deciding to target the respondent in a Mr. Big operation.  The
preliminary stages of the undercover operation began in December 2004 when
officers conducted several weeks of “lifestyle” surveillance on the
respondent.  The surveillance revealed that the respondent was on social
assistance and that he was socially isolated — he rarely left home, and when he
did he was accompanied by his wife.

[24]                         
Undercover officers made their first move in
February 2005.  An officer, whom I will call “Jim”, approached the respondent
outside of a convenience store.[1] 
Jim asked the respondent to help him look for his missing sister.  The
respondent obliged and was paid $50.  During the day, Jim told the respondent
that he owned a trucking company and that he needed a driver.  The respondent
volunteered for the job.

[25]                         
The goal of the operation over the next several
weeks was to develop a relationship between the respondent and the undercover
officers.  The respondent worked for Jim and drove truckloads of goods for him from
one location to another.  He was introduced to another undercover officer, whom
I will call “Paul”, whose role was to work with him and become his “best
friend”.[2] 
Initially, the respondent sought to bring his wife with him when he did
deliveries, but early on, Jim and Paul forbade him from doing so.

[26]                         
Around the same time, Jim and Paul revealed that
they were part of a criminal organization and that there was a “boss” who
headed up their operations.  Thereafter, the respondent participated in
simulated criminal activity with the officers, delivering trucks that
purportedly contained smuggled alcohol and packages with stolen credit cards.

[27]                         
The financial rewards that flowed from working
with the organization quickly became apparent.  In February and March, the
respondent travelled to St. John’s and Halifax, spending several nights in
hotels paid for by his benefactors and enjoying frequent dinners with Jim and
Paul.  In the two month period, he was paid approximately $4,470 for his work.

[28]                         
By the beginning of April, the respondent was
fully immersed in his new fictitious life.  The respondent would “constant[ly]”
tell Jim that he loved him.  At a dinner with Jim and Paul, he told both
officers that they were “brothers” to him and that there was nowhere else in the
world he would rather be.  He raised a toast to the boss.

[29]                         
On April 10, 2005, according to Jim, the
respondent confessed to murdering his daughters.  That night, the respondent
had dinner with Jim.  Jim told the respondent that their organization was involved
with prostitution in Montreal, and that if prostitutes were dishonest, the
organization had to deal with them.  Jim claimed that he had assaulted a
prostitute himself, and that bad things sometimes had to be done.  The
respondent informed Jim that he had no problem getting his hands dirty.  He too
had done terrible things in the past.  At that point, he produced a picture of
his daughters from his wallet and told Jim that they were both dead.  He
confided that he had planned their murder and carried it out.[3] 

[30]                         
The operation continued over the next two
months.  Jim and Paul constantly preached the importance of trust, honesty and
loyalty within the organization.  Those who were not trustworthy were met with
violence.  On one occasion, Jim slapped another undercover officer across the
face in front of the respondent, ostensibly because he had spoken to others
about their business dealings.

[31]                         
In the middle of May 2005, the operation began
building towards the climatic meeting with Mr. Big.  During a trip to Vancouver,
Jim told the respondent that there was a “big deal” coming in the future that
would “set [the respondent] financially”.  The respondent was told he would be
paid between $20,000 and $25,000 if he participated.  Later on, while on a trip
to Toronto, the respondent was shown $175,000 in cash.  The money was said to
be a down payment toward the impending deal.  

[32]                         
Jim informed the respondent that he would only
be allowed to participate in the deal if Mr. Big gave his approval.  Jim took
the respondent’s licence and social insurance number so the organization could
perform a background check to see if he had any “heat” on him or was a “rat”. 
In early June, while in Montreal, Jim told the respondent that Mr. Big had
checked into him and that he had found a problem.  The respondent would not be
allowed to work with the organization until the issue was resolved.  The
respondent did not know what the problem was, but he became very concerned that
he would not be involved in the impending deal.

[33]                         
The respondent met with Mr. Big on June 9,
2005.  Jim told the respondent that Mr. Big was going to question him about the
problem that had been uncovered during his background check.  Jim urged the
respondent to be honest with Mr. Big.  

[34]                         
At the beginning of the meeting, the respondent
expressed his gratitude to Mr. Big, telling him that his life had turned around
since he started working for the organization.  Mr. Big shifted the topic of
the conversation to the death of the respondent’s daughters.  He told the respondent
that there might be some “heat” coming regarding their deaths and he asked the
respondent why he killed his daughters.  The respondent replied that he had
suffered a seizure, implying that their deaths were accidental.  Mr. Big
dismissed this explanation and told the respondent not to “lie” to him.

[35]                         
After some further prodding by Mr. Big, the
respondent confessed to killing his daughters.  He explained that he had done
so because he feared Child Welfare was going to take his daughters from him and
place them with his brother.  When the respondent was asked how he killed his
daughters, he said that they “fell” over the wharf at the park.  Mr. Big
pressed the respondent for more details, and the respondent explained that he
“struck” his daughters with his shoulder and that they fell over the wharf into
the water.  

[36]                         
Two days later, on June 11, 2005, the respondent
returned with Jim to the park where his daughters drowned.  Jim had the
respondent re-enact how the drowning occurred.  During the re-enactment, Jim
knelt down and the respondent demonstrated how he pushed his daughters into the
water by nudging Jim with his knee.  

[37]                         
On June 13, the respondent was arrested and
charged with two counts of first degree murder.  The police allowed the
respondent to make a phone call, and his first call for help went to Jim.  

[38]                         
The respondent’s arrest came four months after
the Mr. Big operation began and nearly three years after his daughters died. 
During the course of the Mr. Big operation, the respondent participated in 63
“scenarios” with the undercover officers.  The operation saw him travel to
Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto and Vancouver, where he stayed in hotels and
dined frequently in some of the country’s finest restaurants.  In total, the
respondent was paid $15,720 for his work.  The police also paid an unknown
amount for the respondent’s hotels, room service, dinners, trips to the casino,
and transportation.  The total cost of the operation was $413,268.

[39]                         
At trial, the confessions the respondent made
during the Mr. Big operation were admitted into evidence and he was convicted
by a jury of two counts of first degree murder.

III.       
Proceedings Below

A.         
Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador Trial
Division, 2007 NLTD 74, 265 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 266

(1)     The Admissibility of the Mr. Big Confessions

[40]                         
The respondent moved at trial to have the
confessions he made during the Mr. Big operation excluded from evidence.  The
respondent argued that the intimidating and threatening conduct of the officers
throughout the Mr. Big operation was oppressive and led to a “fundamental
breach” of his rights under s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms  (para. 43).  He also argued that this same conduct rendered
his confessions inadmissible under the principled approach to the rule against
hearsay, as the threatening police conduct made his confessions unreliable. 
The respondent testified on the voir dire and explained that he worked
for the fictitious criminal organization because he was making good money and
he was afraid of Jim and Paul.  He denied confessing to Jim on April 10, 2005
and said that he had lied in his confessions on June 9 and 11, 2005 because he
was afraid of Mr. Big. 

[41]                         
The trial judge denied the respondent’s
application.  He rejected the respondent’s evidence that he felt threatened and
intimidated by the undercover operatives.  Instead, he found that the
respondent had bonded with them and continually sought more work from them.  In
addition, the trial judge found that the respondent was given a number of
chances to leave the operation but he made no effort to do so.  

(2)     Testifying With the Public Excluded From the Courtroom

[42]                         
Towards the end of his trial, the respondent
brought an application requesting that he be allowed to testify with the public
excluded from the courtroom.  A voir dire was held and the respondent
gave evidence.  He explained that he wanted the public excluded during his
testimony because he had never been good at “talk[ing] in front of a crowd”.  He
said he would get “frustrated”, “confused”, and “all tangled up”.  He worried
that the pressure of testifying in front of a courtroom full of people would
cause him to have a seizure.  

[43]                         
The trial judge denied the respondent’s
application.  The trial judge commented that he was “reluctant” to prevent the
public from “hear[ing]” the respondent’s evidence.  In his view, “stress” was
an insufficient reason for excluding the public from the courtroom.  He also
noted that the respondent had already given evidence in front of the public on
the voir dire into the admissibility of his confessions and at his bail
hearing.  

B.          
Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador,
Court of Appeal, 2012 NLCA 61, 327 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 178

(1)     The Admissibility of the Mr. Big Confessions

[44]                         
At the Court of Appeal, the respondent argued
that the confessions he made during the Mr. Big operation ought to have been
excluded because they were obtained in breach of his right to silence under s.
7  of the Charter .  Green C.J., writing for himself and Harrington J.A.,
allowed the appeal on this ground.

[45]                         
The majority held that the protection afforded
by the right to silence could be extended beyond situations where an individual
had been detained by the state.  In the majority’s view, the question was not
whether the respondent was “det[ained]” at the time of his confession to Mr.
Big, but whether he was under “state control” (para. 198).  In so concluding,
the majority borrowed from the test articulated by this Court in R. v. White,
[1999] 2 S.C.R. 417, to determine if a breach of his s. 7  right to silence had
occurred.  

[46]                         
On the facts, the majority found that the
respondent was clearly under state control when he confessed to Mr. Big.  After
considering the factors from White, the majority concluded a breach of
s. 7  had occurred.  As a result, the majority turned to s. 24(2)  of the Charter 
and concluded that admitting the respondent’s June 9 and 11, 2005 confessions
would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  

[47]                         
Barry J.A. dissented on the issue of the
admissibility of the respondent’s confessions.  In his view, the respondent’s
right to silence was not triggered prior to detention.  Moreover, the trial
judge’s finding that the respondent had numerous chances to leave the operation
but made no effort to do so were findings of fact entitled to considerable
deference on appeal.  Even if the “state control” test was applicable, Barry
J.A. would not have found a s. 7  violation.  

(2)     Testifying With the Public Excluded From the Courtroom

[48]                         
The Court of Appeal unanimously found that the
trial judge unreasonably denied the respondent’s application to testify with
the public excluded from the courtroom.  Barry J.A., with whom the majority
agreed, held that fairness in this case required that the respondent have the
opportunity to present his evidence as “clearly as possible” (para. 125).  The
respondent’s history with seizures, his evidence that he became confused and
had difficulty thinking straight in front of a crowd, the importance of any
explanation he could provide regarding his confessions to Mr. Big, and the
prejudice that would result if he resiled from his commitment made in the
presence of the jury that he planned to testify, all weighed in favour of
granting his request.

IV.       
Issues

[49]                         
The Crown was granted leave to appeal on the
following two issues:

(1)                 
Did the trial judge err in admitting the
confessions made by the respondent during the Mr. Big operation?

 

(2)              
Did the trial judge err in precluding the
respondent from testifying with the public excluded from the courtroom? 

V.          
Analysis

[50]                         
While the crux of this appeal involves the
respondent’s confessions during the Mr. Big operation, I begin with his request
to testify with the public excluded from the courtroom.  That aspect of the
appeal is straightforward and can be dealt with briefly.

A.         
Testifying With the Public Excluded From the
Courtroom

[51]                         
While the importance of the open court principle
cannot be doubted, s. 486(1)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 ,
provides trial judges with a discretion to exclude the public from the
courtroom in several circumstances, including where such an order is in the
interests of “the proper administration of justice”.  In Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), [1996] 3 S.C.R.
480, this Court set out three factors trial judges are to consider in making
such an order: (1) the availability of reasonable and effective alternatives;
(2) whether the order is limited as much as possible; and (3) the importance of
the order’s objectives and its probable effects when weighed against the
importance of openness and the particular expression that will be limited.

[52]                         
In this case, the trial judge denied the
respondent’s request, noting that “stress” was an insufficient reason for
excluding the public from the courtroom.  In consequence, the respondent did
not testify.  

[53]                         
A trial judge’s decision under s. 486(1)  is
entitled to deference and “should not lightly be interfered with” (Canadian
Broadcasting Corp., at para. 78).  Here, however, I am respectfully of the
view that the trial judge erred in refusing the respondent’s request.  The
trial judge’s error lay at the third stage of the test.  To begin, the
respondent’s testimony was critically important in the circumstances of this
case.  If he was to be acquitted, the jury would have to believe, or at least
have a reasonable doubt, that the confessions he made during the Mr. Big
operation were false.  Testifying in order to disavow them was a near tactical
necessity for the respondent.  The respondent sought to testify outside of the
presence of the public in part because he was concerned that the stress of
testifying in front of a full courtroom would cause him to have a seizure.  It
was incumbent on the trial judge, in the unique circumstances of this case, to
take reasonable steps to accommodate the respondent’s disability and to
facilitate his testimony.  

[54]                         
Unfortunately, the trial judge mistook the
nature of the respondent’s request, as is apparent from his comment that he was
reluctant to prevent the public from “hear[ing]” the respondent’s evidence. 
The respondent was not asking that the public be completely foreclosed from
hearing his evidence.  Rather, he simply wanted to testify outside of
their physical presence.  As such, his evidence could have been made available
to the public, while granting his request, by broadcasting his testimony into
another courtroom on closed circuit television.  In the particular circumstances
of this case, granting the accommodation sought would not, in my view, have
undermined the open court principle.  

[55]                         
As a result, I agree with the conclusion of the
Court of Appeal.  This error alone necessitates a new trial. 

B.           
The Admissibility of the Mr. Big Confessions 

(1)     Mr. Big Operations in Canada

[56]                         
The Mr. Big technique is a Canadian invention. 
Although a version of the technique appears to have been used by the police as
far back as 1901, its modern use began in the 1990s and has continued
since then (see R. v. Todd (1901), 4 C.C.C. 514 (Man. K.B.), at p.
523).  According to the B.C. RCMP, the technique has been used across Canada on
more than 350 occasions as of 2008.[4] 


[57]                         
The technique tends to follow a similar script
in each case.  Undercover officers conduct surveillance on a suspect in order
to gather information about his or her habits and circumstances.  Next, they
approach the suspect and attempt to cultivate a relationship.  The suspect and
the undercover officers socialize and begin to work together, and the suspect
is introduced to the idea that the officers work for a criminal organization
that is run by their boss — “Mr. Big”.  The suspect works for the criminal
organization and is assigned simple and apparently illegal tasks — serving as a
lookout, delivering packages, or counting large sums of money are common
examples.  As occurred in this case, this stage of the operation can last for
several months.  See T. E. Moore, P. Copeland and R. A. Schuller, “Deceit,
Betrayal and the Search for Truth: Legal and Psychological Perspectives on the
‘Mr. Big’ Strategy” (2009), 55 Crim. L.Q. 348, at pp. 351-52; K. T.
Keenan and J. Brockman, Mr. Big: Exposing Undercover Investigations in
Canada (2010), at p. 19.

[58]                         
As the operation wears on, the suspect is
offered increasing responsibility and financial rewards.  By flying the suspect
across the country, putting him up in hotels, and taking him to expensive
restaurants, undercover officers show the suspect that working with the group
provides a life of luxury and close friendships.  All the while, the suspect is
constantly reminded that his or her ultimate acceptance into the group depends
on Mr. Big’s approval (see Keenan and Brockman, at p. 20).

[59]                         
Throughout the operation, the suspect is also
told that the organization demands honesty, trust and loyalty from its
members.  An aura of violence is cultivated to reinforce these values. 
Officers teach the suspect that those who betray the trust of the organization
are met with violence.  They do this by telling the suspect that the
organization kills “rats”, or by exposing him to simulated acts of violence
perpetrated by members of the organization against other undercover officers as
punishment for imagined betrayals (see, e.g., Moore, Copeland and Schuller, at
pp. 356-57).  R. v. Hathway, 2007 SKQB 48, 292 Sask. R. 7 , provides a
stark example.  In that case, undercover officers simulated an assault on a
woman who had crossed the criminal organization.  During the beating, officers
threatened to kill the woman, her husband, and her infant child.  The accused
watched as undercover officers threw the bloodied woman into the trunk of a
car.  

[60]                         
Once the stage is set, the operation culminates
in a meeting, akin to a job interview, between the suspect and Mr. Big.  Invariably
during these meetings, Mr. Big expresses concern about the suspect’s criminal
past and the particular crime under investigation by the police.  As the
meeting unfolds, it becomes clear that confessing to the crime provides a
ticket into the criminal organization and safety from the police.  Suspects may
be told that Mr. Big has conclusive evidence of their guilt and that denying
the offence will be seen as proof of a lack of trustworthiness.  In another
variation, suspects are told that Mr. Big has learned from contacts within the
police that a prosecution for the offence is imminent based on new evidence. 
The organization offers to protect the target through a variety of means — by
offering to eliminate a witness or by having someone else confess to the crime
— if the suspect confesses to Mr. Big.  Throughout the interrogation, any
denials of guilt are dismissed as lies, and Mr. Big presses for a confession
(see, e.g., C.L.A. factum, at paras. 7-8; Keenan and Brockman, at pp. 19-21).  

[61]                         
As indicated, the technique has proved valuable
and has been used to secure convictions in hundreds of cases (see, e.g., R.
v. Copeland, 1999 BCCA 744, 131 B.C.A.C. 264, where a confession elicited
through a Mr. Big operation led the police to the victim’s previously
undiscovered body).  

[62]                         
To date, there are no established wrongful
convictions stemming from its use.  However, in 1992, Kyle Unger was convicted
of murder based in part on a confession elicited through a Mr. Big operation,
as well as forensic evidence found at the scene of the crime.  In 2004, the
forensic evidence was called into question by a review committee.  The Minister
of Justice ordered a review of the conviction, and the Crown ultimately
withdrew the charges after determining it did not have sufficient evidence to
proceed with a new trial (see also R. v. Bates, 2009 ABQB 379, 468 A.R.
158, where an accused, though properly convicted of manslaughter, overstated
his involvement by falsely confessing to Mr. Big that he was the person who
shot a rival drug dealer).

(2)     Do We Need a Test
for Determining the Admissibility of Mr. Big Confessions?

[63]                         
In cases where the Mr. Big technique has been
used, the ensuing confessions have typically been received at trial.  Under the
existing case law, they have been admitted under the party admissions exception
to the hearsay rule (see R. v. Evans, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 653, at p. 664;
R. v. Osmar, 2007 ONCA 50, 84 O.R. (3d) 321, at para. 53).  The
admissibility of party admissions flows from the adversarial nature of our
trial system, and the belief that “what a party has previously stated can be
admitted against the party in whose mouth it does not lie to complain of the
unreliability of his or her own statements” (Evans, at p. 664).

[64]                         
Attempts to extend existing legal protections to
Mr. Big operations have failed.  This Court has held that Mr. Big operations do
not engage the right to silence because the accused is not detained by the
police at the time he or she confesses (see R. v. McIntyre, [1994] 2
S.C.R. 480; R. v. Hebert, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151).  And the confessions
rule — which requires the Crown to prove an accused’s statement to a person in
authority is “voluntary” — is inoperative because the accused does not know
that Mr. Big is a police officer when he confesses (see R. v. Grandinetti,
2005 SCC 5, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 27).  

[65]                         
Under existing law, it appears that defence
counsel have only two options for challenging the admissibility of these
confessions: under the doctrine of abuse of process, or under a trial judge’s
overriding discretion to exclude evidence that is more prejudicial than
probative.  Trial judges have only rarely excluded Mr. Big confessions under
either of these doctrines.  Indeed, the parties could find no case in which a
Mr. Big confession was excluded as an abuse of process, and only one case in
which a confession was excluded on the basis that its prejudicial effect
exceeded its probative value (see R. v. Creek, 1998 CanLII 3209
(B.C.S.C.)).

[66]                         
A threshold issue raised by this appeal is
whether the existing framework adequately protects the rights of those subject
to Mr. Big investigations.  The Crown contends that no further protections are
needed and that the law as it stands strikes a proper balance between the
accused’s rights and the need for effective policing.  By contrast, the
respondent and amicus curiae submit that Mr. Big confessions present
unique dangers that must be addressed by placing a filter on their
admissibility. 

[67]                         
I agree with the respondent and amicus curiae. 
In my view, the law as it stands today provides insufficient protection to
accused persons who confess during Mr. Big operations.  Three concerns lead me
to this conclusion.  

(a)     The Danger of Unreliable Confessions

[68]                         
First, because of the nature of Mr. Big
operations, concerns arise as to the reliability of the confessions they
produce.  The purpose of these operations is to induce confessions, and they
are carefully calibrated to achieve that end.  Over a period of weeks or
months, suspects are made to believe that the fictitious criminal organization
for which they work can provide them with financial security, social acceptance,
and friendship.  Suspects also come to learn that violence is a necessary part
of the organization’s business model, and that a past history of violence is a
boast-worthy accomplishment.  And during the final meeting with Mr. Big — which
involves a skillful interrogation conducted by an experienced police officer —
suspects learn that confessing to the crime under investigation provides a
consequence-free ticket into the organization and all of the rewards it
provides.  

[69]                         
It seems a matter of common sense that the
potential for a false confession increases in proportion to the nature and
extent of the inducements held out to the accused.  Unsurprisingly, this view
is supported by academic literature (see R. v. Oickle, 2000 SCC 38,
[2000] 2 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 39 and 44; S. M. Kassin et al.,
“Police-Induced Confessions: Risk Factors and Recommendations” (2010), 34 Law & Hum. Behav. 3,
at pp. 14-15).

[70]                         
The common law confessions rule serves to
illustrate the importance of a trial judge’s role in assessing reliability. 
The confessions rule has long concerned itself with the dangers posed by
unreliable confessions (see, e.g., G. A. Martin, “The Admissibility of
Confessions and Statements” (1963), 5 Crim. L.Q. 35, at p. 35).  Under
the confessions rule, we recognize that unreliable confessions made by
an accused pose particular dangers, as juries often attach great weight to the
accused’s own words.  When an accused falsely confesses to a crime, the risk of
a wrongful conviction becomes acute.  This Court recognized as much in Oickle,
when it noted that false confessions have played an “important role” in cases where wrongful convictions have
occurred (para. 36).  Subsequent research has confirmed that risk.  In 40 of
the first 250 DNA exonerations in the United States, for example, the accused
was found to have falsely confessed to the crime (see B.
L. Garrett, “The Substance of False Confessions” (2010), 62 Stan. L. Rev.
1051).

[71]                         
The confessions rule thus guards against the
danger of unreliable confessions by requiring the Crown to prove to a judge
beyond a reasonable doubt that an accused’s statement was voluntarily made. 
Where the Crown is unable to do so, the accused’s statement is rendered
inadmissible.  

[72]                         
But as the law stands today, unlike our approach
with the confessions rule, we have failed to adopt a consistent approach to
assessing the reliability of Mr. Big confessions before they go to the jury. 
This is so despite the obvious nature of the inducements these operations
create.  In my view, it would be dangerous and unwise to assume that we do not
need to be concerned about the reliability of Mr. Big confessions simply
because the suspect does not know that the person pressuring him to confess is
a police officer.  And although it will be easier for a jury to understand why
an accused would falsely confess to Mr. Big than to the police during a
conventional interrogation (because of the more obvious nature of the inducements
and the accused’s belief that it is in his self-interest to confess), this does
not provide a complete answer to the reliability concerns raised by these
confessions.  Under the confessions rule, we do not abandon our concern for
reliability in cases where a confession is the product of clear threats or
inducements, on the assumption that the jury will have an easier time
understanding why it is unreliable.  

(b)     The Prejudicial Effect of Mr. Big Confessions

[73]                         
The second concern with Mr. Big confessions — and
one that distinguishes them from confessions made in other contexts — is that
they are invariably accompanied by prejudicial facts regarding the accused’s
character.  Putting these confessions into evidence requires showing the jury
that the accused wanted to join a criminal organization and that he
participated in “simulated” crimes that he believed were real.  The absence of
a consistent approach in assessing the admissibility of these confessions sits
uneasily with the general rule that bad character evidence is presumptively
inadmissible for the Crown.  This centuries-old rule prohibits the Crown from
leading evidence of misconduct engaged in by the accused that is unrelated to
the charges before the court, unless it can demonstrate that its probative
value outweighs its prejudicial effect (see R. v. Handy, 2002 SCC 56,
[2002] 2 S.C.R. 908).

[74]                         
Bad character evidence causes two kinds of
prejudice.  It causes “moral prejudice” by marring the character of the accused
in the eyes of the jury, thereby creating a risk that the jury will reason from
the accused’s general disposition to the conclusion that he is guilty of the
crime charged, or that he is deserving of punishment in any event (Handy,
at para. 31).  And it causes “reasoning prejudice” by distracting the jury’s
focus away from the offence charged, toward the accused’s extraneous acts of
misconduct (ibid.).  As this Court held in Handy, the “poisonous
potential” of bad character evidence cannot be doubted (para. 138).

[75]                         
When a Mr. Big confession is admitted, the
character evidence that accompanies it places the accused in a difficult
situation.  In these cases, the accused is often obliged, as a tactical
necessity, to testify in order to explain why he falsely confessed to Mr Big. 
The character evidence that has already been admitted is damaging in this
context because it shrouds the accused with an aura of distrust before he or
she steps into the witness box.  This distrust is compounded when the accused
asks the jury to disregard his confession because he was lying when he gave
it.  And all of this furnishes the Crown with ample fodder for a forceful
attack on the accused’s credibility in cross-examination.

[76]                         
Despite the well-established presumption that
bad character evidence is inadmissible, it is routinely admitted in Mr. Big
cases because it provides the relevant context needed to understand how the
accused’s pivotal confession came about.  Indeed, even the accused comes to
depend on this evidence in order to show the nature of the inducements he faced
and the reason his confession should not be believed.

[77]                         
In my view, the prejudicial effect of Mr. Big
confessions is a substantial concern, especially since these confessions may
also be unreliable.  Putting evidence before a jury that is both unreliable and
prejudicial invites a miscarriage of justice.  The law must respond to these
dangers.  The fact that there are no proven wrongful convictions in cases
involving Mr. Big confessions provides little comfort.  The criminal justice
system cannot afford to wait for miscarriages of justice before taking
reasonable steps to prevent them. 

(c)     Police Misconduct

[78]                         
Finally, Mr. Big operations create a risk that
the police will resort to unacceptable tactics in their pursuit of a
confession.  As mentioned, in conducting these operations, undercover officers
often cultivate an aura of violence in order to stress the importance of trust
and loyalty within the organization.  This can involve — as it did in this case
— threats or acts of violence perpetrated in the presence of the accused.  In
these circumstances, it is easy to see a risk that the police will go too far,
resorting to tactics which may impact on the reliability of a confession, or in
some instances amount to an abuse of process. 

[79]                         
At present, however, these operations are
conducted in a legal vacuum.  The legal protections afforded to accused
persons, which are often intended at least in part to place limits on the
conduct of the police in their investigation and interrogation of accused
people, have no application to Mr. Big operations.  The confessions rule, for
example, is intended not only to guard against the risk of unreliable
confessions, but also to prevent abusive state conduct (see R. v. Hodgson,
[1998] 2 S.C.R. 449, at para. 20).  Yet its protection does not apply because
the accused does not know the person he is speaking to is a person in
authority.  Other protections — like the right to counsel under s. 10 (b)
of the Charter  — are rendered inapplicable because the accused is not
“det[ained]” by the police while the operation is ongoing.  And the doctrine of
abuse of process — intended to protect against abusive state conduct — appears
to be somewhat of a paper tiger.  To date, it has never operated to exclude a
Mr. Big confession, nor has it ever led to the stay of charges arising from one
of these operations.

[80]                         
In my view, the lack of an effective mechanism
for monitoring the conduct of the undercover officers who engage in these
operations is problematic.  The law must enable trial judges to respond effectively
to police misconduct in this context. 

(3)     How Should the Law
Respond to the Problems Posed by Mr. Big Confessions? 

[81]                         
Having determined that the law must respond to
the risks inherent in Mr. Big confessions, the more difficult question is what
form that response should take.  Mr. Big operations raise three distinct
concerns — reliability, prejudice, and the potential for police misconduct —
and we must ensure that trial judges have the tools they need to address all
three of these issues.

[82]                         
The parties and interveners have provided a long
list of options for dealing with the problems raised by Mr. Big confessions. 
They include affirming the Court of Appeal’s extension of the s. 7  right to
silence, expanding the common law confessions rule to apply to Mr. Big
operations, subjecting Mr. Big confessions to the principled approach that now
governs hearsay evidence, or assessing the reliability of Mr. Big confessions
before admitting them into evidence as a means of ensuring an accused’s right
to a fair trial under ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .  Rather
than pointing to a clear solution, the diversity of the options provided
reflects the difficulty of the task that confronts us.

[83]                         
In searching for a response to the concerns
these operations raise, we must proceed cautiously.  To
be sure, Mr. Big operations can become abusive, and they can produce
confessions that are unreliable and prejudicial.  We must seek a legal
framework that protects accused persons, and the justice system as a whole,
against these dangers.  On the other hand, Mr. Big operations are not necessarily
abusive, and are capable of producing valuable evidence, the admission of which
furthers the interests of justice.  We ought not forget that the Mr. Big
technique is almost always used in cold cases involving the most serious
crimes.  Put simply, in responding to the dangers posed by Mr. Big confessions,
we should be wary about allowing serious crimes to go unpunished.

(a)     Summary of a Proposed Solution

[84]                         
In this section, I propose a solution that, in
my view, strikes the best balance between guarding against the dangers posed by
Mr. Big operations, while ensuring the police have the tools they need to
investigate serious crime.  This solution involves a two-pronged approach that
(1) recognizes a new common law rule of evidence, and (2) relies on a more
robust conception of the doctrine of abuse of process to deal with the problem
of police misconduct.

[85]                         
The first prong recognizes a new common law rule
of evidence for assessing the admissibility of these confessions.  The rule
operates as follows:  Where the state recruits an accused into a fictitious
criminal organization of its own making and seeks to elicit a confession from
him, any confession made by the accused to the state during the operation
should be treated as presumptively inadmissible.  This presumption of
inadmissibility is overcome where the Crown can establish, on a balance of
probabilities, that the probative value of the confession outweighs its
prejudicial effect.  In this context, the confession’s probative value turns on
an assessment of its reliability.  Its prejudicial effect flows from the bad
character evidence that must be admitted in order to put the operation and the
confession in context.  If the Crown is unable to demonstrate that the
accused’s confession is admissible, the rest of the evidence surrounding the
Mr. Big operation becomes irrelevant and thus inadmissible.  This rule, like
the confessions rule in the case of conventional police interrogations,
operates as a specific qualification to the party admissions exception to the
hearsay rule.[5]

[86]                         
As regard the second prong, I would rely on the
doctrine of abuse of process to deal with the problem of police misconduct.  I
recognize that the doctrine has thus far proved less than effective in this
context.  While the problem is not an easy one, I propose to provide some
guidance on how to determine if a Mr. Big operation crosses the line from
skillful police work to an abuse of process.

[87]                         
The purposes of this two-pronged approach are to
protect an accused’s right to a fair trial under the Charter , and
to preserve the integrity of the justice system.  Those are the ends that must
ultimately be achieved.  This approach strives to reach them by ensuring that
only those confessions that are more probative than prejudicial, and which do
not result from abuse, are admitted into evidence.  

[88]                         
However, it must be remembered that trial judges
always retain a discretion to exclude evidence where its admission would
compromise trial fairness (see R. v. Harrer, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562).  This
is because “the general principle that an accused is entitled to a fair trial
cannot be entirely reduced to specific rules” (ibid., at para. 23).  It
is impossible to predict every factual scenario that could present itself.  As
such, I do not foreclose the possibility that, in an exceptional case, trial
fairness may require that a Mr. Big confession be excluded even where the
specific rules I have proposed would see the confession admitted.

[89]                         
In practice, this two-pronged approach will
necessitate that a voir dire be held to determine the admissibility of
Mr. Big confessions.  The Crown will bear the burden of establishing that, on
balance, the probative value of the confession outweighs its prejudicial
effect, and it will be for the defence to establish an abuse of process.  Trial
judges may prefer to begin their analysis by assessing whether there has been
an abuse of process.  A finding of abuse makes weighing the probative value and
prejudicial effect of the evidence unnecessary. 

[90]                         
Against this backdrop, I will now elaborate on
the main features of this two-pronged solution.

(b)     Why Does the Crown
Bear the Onus of Establishing That the Probative Value of a Mr. Big Confession
Outweighs Its Prejudicial Effect?

[91]                         
The common law rule of evidence I have proposed
creates a presumption that Mr. Big confessions are inadmissible, and places the
onus of demonstrating that they ought to be received on the Crown.  The onus is
justified because of the central role played by the state in creating these
confessions.  It is the state that designs and implements these operations,
expending significant resources and acting as puppeteer in the production of
the accused’s ultimate confession.  The state creates the potent mix of a potentially
unreliable confession accompanied by prejudicial character evidence.  Given its
pivotal role, the state should bear the responsibility of showing that the
confession it has orchestrated and produced warrants admission into evidence.  

[92]                         
Placing the onus on the Crown also works to
address concerns with abusive state conduct.  Confronted by the reality that
the Crown will ultimately bear the burden of justifying reception of a Mr. Big
confession, the state will be strongly encouraged to tread carefully in how it
conducts these operations.  As I will explain, the conduct of the police is a
factor to be taken into account in assessing the reliability of a Mr. Big
confession.  This creates a strong incentive for the state to conduct these
operations with restraint.

[93]                         
The onus has the added benefit of encouraging
the creation of a more thorough record of the operation.  At present, many of
the key interactions between undercover officers and the accused are
unrecorded.  This is problematic.  Where it is logistically feasible and would
not jeopardize the operation itself or the safety of the undercover officers,
the police would do well to record their conversations with the accused.  With
the onus of demonstrating reliability placed on the Crown, gaps in the record
may undermine the case for admissibility, which will encourage better record
keeping.[6]

(c)     How Is Probative Value Assessed?

[94]                         
Determining whether the probative value of an
item of evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect requires engaging in a “cost benefit
analysis” (R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9, at p. 21).  That is, trial
judges must assess “whether [the evidence’s] value is worth what it costs” (ibid.). 
The first step in conducting this exercise, then, is to assess the value of the
proposed evidence.

[95]                         
How are trial judges to assess the value of
evidence?  This requires more than asking whether the evidence is logically
relevant; it necessitates some weighing of the evidence.  After all, probative
means “tending to prove an issue” and “questionable evidence will have less of
that tendency” (R. v. McIntyre, 1993 CanLII 1488 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 2).  It
would be “artificial” and “self-defeating” for trial judges to ignore defects
in the evidence during the assessment of its value (D. M. Paciocco and L. Stuesser,
The Law of Evidence (6th ed. 2011), at p. 38).  Generally, what this
weighing exercise requires will vary depending on the specific inferences
sought to be drawn from a piece of evidence.

[96]                         
As one example, trial judges are routinely
called upon to determine the admissibility of expert evidence.  Part of the
admissibility inquiry involves taking stock of the probative value of the
proposed evidence.  This requires weighing the evidence and assessing its
reliability:

When one looks to potential
probative value, one must consider the reliability of the evidence. Reliability
concerns reach not only the subject matter of the evidence, but also the
methodology used by the proposed expert in arriving at his or her opinion, the
expert’s expertise and the extent to which the expert is shown to be impartial
and objective. 

 

(R.
v. Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624, 97 O.R. (3d) 330, at para. 87, per Doherty
J.A.)

[97]                         
Similarly, in R. v. Humaid (2006), 81
O.R. (3d) 456 (C.A.), Doherty J.A. held that otherwise admissible hearsay evidence
may be excluded on the basis that its prejudicial effect outweighs its
probative value.  This can occur in circumstances where “the credibility or
reliability of the narrator of the out-of-court statement is so deficient that
it robs the out-of-court statement of any potential probative value” (para.
57).  This Court endorsed that approach in R. v. Blackman, 2008 SCC 37,
[2008] 2 S.C.R. 298, at para. 51.

[98]                         
Undoubtedly, weighing evidence in this way
thrusts trial judges into a domain that is typically reserved for the jury. 
The jury, as the trier of fact, is ultimately responsible for weighing evidence
and drawing conclusions from it.  The overlap of roles cannot be avoided, but
this is not problematic as long as the respective functions of the trial judge,
as gatekeeper, and the jury, as finder of fact, are fundamentally respected. 
In conducting this weighing exercise, the trial judge is only deciding the
threshold question of “whether the evidence is worthy of being heard by the
jury” and not “the ultimate question of whether the evidence should be accepted
and acted upon” (Abbey, at para. 89; see also Paciocco and Stuesser, at
p. 38).

[99]                         
Returning to Mr. Big confessions, their
probative value derives from their reliability.  A confession provides powerful
evidence of guilt, but only if it is true.  A confession of questionable
reliability carries less probative force, and in deciding whether the probative
value of a Mr. Big confession outweighs the prejudicial effect of the character
evidence that accompanies it, trial judges must examine its reliability.

[100]                     
What factors are relevant in assessing the
reliability of a Mr. Big confession?  A parallel can perhaps be drawn between
the assessment of “threshold reliability” that occurs under the principled
approach to hearsay.  Under the principled approach, hearsay becomes admissible
where it is both necessary and reliable.  Reliability can generally be
established in one of two ways: by showing that the statement is trustworthy,
or by establishing that its reliability can be sufficiently tested at trial (R.
v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at paras. 61-63). 
The latter route to reliability is often met through an opportunity to
cross-examine the hearsay declarant, but this has no application in the present
context because the accused is not a compellable witness.

[101]                     
However, the factors used to demonstrate the
trustworthiness of a hearsay statement are apposite.  In assessing the
trustworthiness of a hearsay statement, courts look to the circumstances in
which the statement was made, and whether there is any confirmatory evidence (Khelawon,
at paras. 62 and 100).

[102]                     
Confessions derive their persuasive force from
the fact that they are against the accused’s self-interest.  People do not
normally confess to crimes they have not committed (Hodgson, at para.
60).  But the circumstances in which Mr. Big confessions are elicited can
undermine that supposition.  Thus, the first step in assessing the reliability
of a Mr. Big confession is to examine those circumstances and assess the extent
to which they call into question the reliability of the confession.  These
circumstances include — but are not strictly limited to — the length of the
operation, the number of interactions between the police and the accused, the nature
of the relationship between the undercover officers and the accused, the nature
and extent of the inducements offered, the presence of any threats, the conduct
of the interrogation itself, and the personality of the accused, including his
or her age, sophistication, and mental health.

[103]                     
Special note should be taken of the mental
health and age of the accused.  In the United States, where empirical data on
false confessions is more plentiful, researchers have found that those with
mental illnesses or disabilities, and youth, present a much greater risk of
falsely confessing (Garrett, at p. 1064).[7] 
A confession arising from a Mr. Big operation that comes from a young person or
someone suffering from a mental illness or disability will raise greater reliability
concerns.

[104]                     
In listing these factors, I do not mean to
suggest that trial judges are to consider them mechanically and check a box
when they apply.  That is not the purpose of the exercise.  Instead, trial
judges must examine all the circumstances leading to and surrounding the making
of the confession — with these factors in mind — and assess whether and to what
extent the reliability of the confession is called into doubt.

[105]                     
After considering the circumstances in which the
confession was made, the court should look to the confession itself for markers
of reliability.  Trial judges should consider the level of detail contained in
the confession, whether it leads to the discovery of additional evidence,
whether it identifies any elements of the crime that had not been made public
(e.g., the murder weapon), or whether it accurately describes mundane details
of the crime the accused would not likely have known had he not committed it
(e.g., the presence or absence of particular objects at the crime scene). 
Confirmatory evidence is not a hard and fast requirement, but where it exists,
it can provide a powerful guarantee of reliability.  The greater the concerns
raised by the circumstances in which the confession was made, the more
important it will be to find markers of reliability in the confession itself or
the surrounding evidence.

(d)    How Is Prejudicial Effect Measured?

[106]                     
Weighing the prejudicial effect of a Mr. Big
confession is a more straightforward and familiar exercise.  Trial judges must
be aware of the dangers presented by these confessions.  Admitting these
confessions raises the spectre of moral and reasoning prejudice.  Commencing
with moral prejudice, the jury learns that the accused wanted to join a
criminal organization and committed a host of “simulated crimes” that he
believed were real.  In the end, the accused is forced to argue to the jury
that he lied to Mr. Big when he boasted about committing a very serious crime
because his desire to join the gang was so strong.  Moral prejudice may increase
with operations that involve the accused in simulated crimes of violence, or
that demonstrate the accused has a past history of violence.[8]  As for reasoning
prejudice — defined as the risk that the jury’s focus will be distracted away
from the charges before the court — it too can pose a problem depending on the
length of the operation, the amount of time that must be spent detailing it,
and any controversy as to whether a particular event or conversation occurred.

[107]                     
On the other hand, the risk of prejudice can be
mitigated by excluding certain pieces of particularly prejudicial evidence that
are unessential to the narrative.  Moreover, trial judges must bear in mind
that limiting instructions to the jury may be capable of attenuating the
prejudicial effect of this evidence.

(e)     How Are Probative Value and Prejudicial Effect Compared?

[108]                     
In the end, trial judges must weigh the
probative value and the prejudicial effect of the confession at issue and
decide whether the Crown has met its burden.  In practice, the potential for
prejudice is a fairly constant variable in this context.  Mr. Big operations
are cut from the same cloth, and the concerns about prejudice are likely to be
similar from case to case.  As a result, trial judges will expend much of their
analytical energy assessing the reliability of the confessions these operations
generate.  

[109]                     
Determining when the probative value of a Mr.
Big confession surpasses its potential for prejudice will never be an exact
science.  As Justice Binnie observed in Handy, probative value and
prejudicial effect are two variables which “do not operate on the same plane”
(para. 148).  Probative value is concerned with “proof of an issue”, while
prejudicial effect is concerned with “the fairness of the trial” (ibid.). 
To be sure, there will be easy cases at the margins.  But more common will be
the difficult cases that fall in between.  In such cases, trial judges will
have to lean on their judicial experience to decide whether the value of a
confession exceeds its cost.

[110]                     
Despite the inexactness of the exercise, it is
one for which our trial judges are well prepared.  Trial judges routinely weigh
the probative value and prejudicial effect of evidence.  And as mentioned, they
are already asked to examine the reliability of evidence in a number of
different contexts, as well as the prejudicial effect of bad character
evidence.  They are well positioned to do the same here.  Because trial judges,
after assessing the evidence before them, are in the best position to weigh the
probative value and prejudicial effect of the evidence, their decision to admit
or exclude a Mr. Big confession will be afforded deference on appeal. 

(f)     What Is the Role of the Doctrine of Abuse of Process?

[111]                     
The rule of evidence I have proposed goes a long
way toward addressing all three of the concerns raised by Mr. Big operations. 
It squarely tackles the problems they raise with reliability and prejudice. 
And it takes significant account of the concern regarding police misconduct
both by placing the admissibility onus on the Crown, and by factoring the
conduct of the police into the assessment of a Mr. Big confession’s probative
value.

[112]                     
I should not, however, be taken as suggesting
that police misconduct will be forgiven so long as a demonstrably reliable
confession is ultimately secured.  That state of affairs would be unacceptable,
as this Court has long recognized that there are “inherent limits” on the power
of the state to “manipulate people and events for the purpose of . . .
obtaining convictions” (R. v. Mack, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, at p. 941).  

[113]                     
In my view, this is where the doctrine of abuse
of process must serve its purpose.  After all, the doctrine is intended to
guard against state conduct that society finds unacceptable, and which
threatens the integrity of the justice system (R. v. Babos, 2014 SCC 16,
[2014] 1 S.C.R. 309, at para. 35).  Moreover, the doctrine provides trial
judges with a wide discretion to issue a remedy — including the exclusion of
evidence or a stay of proceedings — where doing so is necessary to
preserve the integrity of the justice system or the fairness of the trial (ibid.,
at para. 32).  The onus lies on the accused to establish that an abuse of
process has occurred.  

[114]                     
I acknowledge that, thus far, the doctrine has
provided little protection in the context of Mr. Big operations.  This may be
due in part to this Court’s decision in R. v. Fliss, 2002 SCC 16, [2002]
1 S.C.R. 535, where Binnie J., writing for the majority, described the Mr. Big
technique as “skillful police work” (para. 21).  But the solution, in my view,
is to reinvigorate the doctrine in this context, not to search for an
alternative framework to guard against the very same problem.  The first step
toward restoring the doctrine as an effective guard against police misconduct
in this context is to remind trial judges that these operations can become
abusive, and that they must carefully scrutinize how the police conduct them.

[115]                     
It is of course impossible to set out a precise
formula for determining when a Mr. Big operation will become abusive.  These
operations are too varied for a bright-line rule to apply.  But there is one
guideline that can be suggested.  Mr. Big operations are designed to induce
confessions.  The mere presence of inducements is not problematic (Oickle,
at para. 57).  But police conduct, including inducements and threats, becomes
problematic in this context when it approximates coercion.  In conducting these
operations, the police cannot be permitted to overcome the will of the accused
and coerce a confession.  This would almost certainly amount to an abuse of
process.

[116]                     
Physical violence or threats of violence provide
examples of coercive police tactics.  A confession derived from physical
violence or threats of violence against an accused will not be admissible — no
matter how reliable — because this, quite simply, is something the community
will not tolerate (see, e.g., R. v. Singh, 2013 ONCA 750, 118 O.R. (3d)
253).  

[117]                     
Violence and threats of violence are two forms
of unacceptable coercion.  But Mr. Big operations can become coercive in other
ways as well.  Operations that prey on an accused’s vulnerabilities — like
mental health problems, substance addictions, or youthfulness — are also highly
problematic (see Mack, at p. 963). Taking advantage of these
vulnerabilities threatens trial fairness and the integrity of the justice
system.  As this Court has said on many occasions, misconduct that offends the
community’s sense of fair play and decency will amount to an abuse of process
and warrant the exclusion of the statement. 

[118]                     
While coercion is an important factor to
consider, I do not foreclose the possibility that Mr. Big operations can become
abusive in other ways.  The factors that I have outlined, while not identical,
are similar to those outlined in Mack, with which trial judges are
well-familiar (p. 966).  At the end of the day, there is only so much guidance
that can be provided.  Our trial judges have long been entrusted with the task
of identifying abuses of process and I have no reason to doubt their ability to
do the same in this context.

(g)     Why Use This Two-Pronged Approach?

[119]                     
As we have seen, Mr. Big operations raise three
interrelated concerns — reliability, prejudice, and police misconduct.  I have
proposed two separate tests that, taken together, address all three. 

[120]                     
The reason for this lies in the analytically
distinct problems that the three concerns raise.  Reliability and prejudice are
fundamentally evidentiary issues.  They are concerned with the quality of the
evidence these operations produce.  Indeed, they do not emerge as problems at
all until a Mr. Big confession is admitted at trial.  The concern that the
police may engage in misconduct, by contrast, is focused on the behaviour of the
state in eliciting the evidence.  To be sure, there is significant overlap
between the concerns.  Police misconduct is more likely to produce an
unreliable confession.  But the overlap is not perfect.  For example, a
confession elicited during a Mr. Big operation where there has been no
misconduct may still turn out to be unreliable and prejudicial.  Similarly, a
confession that is the product of misconduct may turn out to be
reliable.  Thus, in order to take complete account of both issues, two legal
tools are required — one that looks directly at the evidence, and one that
serves as a check on the conduct of the police.  

[121]                     
I have turned to a common law rule of evidence
to address the concerns these confessions raise with reliability and
prejudice.  Without question, unreliable and prejudicial evidence implicate
rights under the Charter , including the right to a fair trial and the
presumption of innocence.  But our common law rules of evidence are, and must
be, capable of protecting the constitutional rights of the accused.  It is
axiomatic that the common law must be developed in a manner consistent with the
fundamental values enshrined in the Charter  (see RWDSU v. Dolphin
Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573, at p. 603).  Our rules of evidence have
embraced this constitutional imperative and have evolved into principled,
flexible tools that are “highly sensitive to the due process interests of the
accused” (D. Paciocco, “Charter Tracks: Twenty-Five Years of Constitutional
Influence on the Criminal Trial Process and Rules of Evidence” (2008), 40 S.C.L.R.
(2d) 309, at p. 311).  The common law rule of evidence I have proposed fits
comfortably with this Court’s approach in the post-Charter  era.

[122]                     
To deal with the concern regarding police
misconduct, I have turned to the doctrine of abuse of process.  Doing so makes
good sense because, as mentioned, the doctrine is intended to guard against
state misconduct that threatens the integrity of the justice system and the
fairness of trials.  Moreover, a form of abuse of process has long provided a
residual protection against unfair police tactics in the context of
conventional police interrogations (see Oickle, at paras. 65-67; Rothman
v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640, at p. 697).  The doctrine is therefore
well suited to providing a check against police misconduct in this context. 

[123]                     
The two-pronged approach I have articulated is
also consistent with the demands of the principle against self-incrimination. 
The principle against self-incrimination has two purposes: protecting against
abusive state conduct, and guarding against unreliable confessions (Hebert,
at p. 175; R. v. Jones, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 229, at p. 250).  These
protections flow from “the value placed by Canadian society upon individual
privacy, personal autonomy and dignity” (White, at para. 43). However,
the principle does not act as a free-standing legal protection.  Rather, the
principle is a “general organizing principle of criminal law from which
particular rules can be derived” (Jones, at p. 249).  Where its
underlying rationale suggests that legal protection is needed in a specific
context, but the law provides for none, the principle can be used to fashion a
“contextually-sensitive” new rule to address the gap in the law (White,
at para. 45).[9] 
In my view, the common law rule of evidence I have proposed acts, along with
the abuse doctrine, as yet another specific legal protection that derives from
the general principle and its underlying rationale.

[124]                     
Unlike my colleague Karakatsanis J., I would not
respond to the concerns Mr. Big confessions raise by subjecting them to an
assessment under the framework developed by this Court in White.  It is
true that the White test was used to determine whether admitting a class
of statements made by an accused under statutory compulsion would offend the
principle against self-incrimination.[10] 
But White did not transform the principle against self-incrimination
from a general organizing principle into a freestanding legal rule.  To the
contrary, the Court was careful to note that the principle provided only
“residual protections” in the absence of “specific common law and Charter 
rules”, whether existing or new (paras. 44-45).  In that regard, the Court in White
observed that the principle “demands different things at different times”
and that the task in each case is “to determine exactly what the principle
demands, if anything, within the particular context at issue” (ibid.).  

[125]                     
Thus the general factors identified in White are
best understood as serving to illustrate that Mr. Big operations raise concerns
with the principle against self-incrimination.   But White does not tell
us what the principle demands in this context, nor does it assist in fashioning
an appropriate response.  That task can only be accomplished — as White
itself contemplated — by tailoring the two-pronged approach of a common law
evidentiary rule and the doctrine of abuse of process, to address the
particular concerns raised by Mr. Big operations.  This is how the confessions
rule and the right to silence operate to address the concerns with
self-incrimination that arise during conventional police interrogations and
upon detention.  And it is how my two-pronged approach addresses the challenges
posed by Mr. Big operations.  

(4)     Application to the Facts

(a)     The Admissibility of the Respondent’s Confessions

[126]                     
During the Mr. Big operation, the respondent
confessed on three separate occasions: on April 10, June 9, and June 11, 2005. 
These confessions — and in particular the June 9 and 11 confessions — were the
heart of the Crown’s case against the respondent at trial.  Guided by the legal
framework I have proposed, I must decide whether these confessions were
properly admitted into evidence.

[127]                     
At the outset, I acknowledge that these reasons
recast the test for determining the admissibility of Mr. Big confessions. 
Unsurprisingly, the trial judge did not apply this test in determining the
admissibility of the respondent’s confessions.  In addition, the arguments in
the courts below, and before this Court, did not squarely address whether the
respondent’s confessions ought to be admitted under this framework.

[128]                     
Nonetheless, I am of the view that this Court is
in a position to decide whether the respondent’s statements were properly
admitted — and that we ought to do so.  Although the precise test for
determining the admissibility of Mr. Big confessions has changed, the issues
have not.  The reliability of the respondent’s confessions, their potential for
prejudice, and the conduct of the police in carrying out this Mr. Big operation
have been in issue from the outset.  The parties have addressed these issues,
and there is a substantial record before us.

[129]                     
Nor does applying this test require overturning
the trial judge’s findings of fact.  The details of the Mr. Big operation that
was conducted in this case are not in dispute.  In assessing the admissibility
of the respondent’s confessions, the trial judge’s reasons focused on the
threatening and intimidating conduct of the undercover officers.  The trial
judge found that the respondent was not threatened by the officers (see, e.g.,
para. 65).  Assessing the admissibility of the respondent’s confessions simply
requires analyzing the uncontroversial facts through a different lens — that of
the common law rule of evidence I have proposed.

[130]                     
Moreover, these proceedings have been difficult
and protracted.  Nearly a decade has passed since the respondent was arrested
and charged with the murder of his daughters.  Concerns with the respondent’s
mental health prompted the appointment of amicus curiae at this Court
and at the Court of Appeal.  Ordering a new trial and leaving the admissibility
of the respondent’s confessions to be determined by a new trial judge would be
tantamount to sending this case back to square one.  In my view, that would not
be in the interests of justice.  

(i)      The June 9 and June 11, 2005 Confessions

[131]                     
The June 9 confession was elicited by Mr. Big
during his meeting with the respondent.  The June 11 confession is a brief
re-enactment of how the drowning occurred.  As mentioned, these confessions
were critical to the Crown’s case against the respondent.  Because the
re-enactment followed from the respondent’s confession to Mr. Big, these
confessions are intertwined, and I will consider their admissibility together. 


[132]                     
The first step is to take stock of the probative
value of these confessions, which hinges on an assessment of their
reliability.  This requires considering the circumstances in which the
confessions were made, and whether the confessions contain any markers of
reliability.

[133]                     
Turning first to the circumstances in which
these confessions were made, I am of the view that the circumstances cast
serious doubt on the reliability of the respondent’s confessions.  At the time
the Mr. Big operation began, the respondent was socially isolated, unemployed,
and living on welfare.  Over the next four months, the Mr. Big operation
transformed the respondent’s life, becoming its focal point.  The respondent
participated in 63 “scenarios” in which he worked with undercover officers.  He
also had near daily phone contact with two of these officers, Jim and Paul, who
became his closest friends.  Even when the respondent was not working with the
undercover officers, much of his time was devoted to the work doled out to him
by the fictitious organization.  He spent long hours driving across
Newfoundland, spending nights in hotels, as he delivered mysterious packages
and cargo.  By all accounts, this was a lengthy and intense operation.

[134]                     
With this transformation of the respondent’s
life came powerful inducements.  Financially, the Mr. Big operation lifted the
respondent out of poverty.  Undercover officers paid the respondent over
$15,000 in cash for his work.  And they promised him much greater financial
rewards in the future if he was admitted into the organization; the undercover
officers had him count hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, and told him a
$25,000 pay day was coming if he was allowed to participate in an upcoming “big
job”.  There was a corresponding change in the respondent’s lifestyle.  Dinners
at expensive restaurants became common.  Paul bought the respondent new clothes
to wear, and the respondent relied on Paul to teach him how to behave during
their dinners, as dining at expensive restaurants was “all new to him” and he
often felt uncomfortable.

[135]                     
The respondent attested to the powerful impact
of these financial inducements at the outset of his meeting with Mr. Big,
telling the crime boss that his life had been “really rough” before he started
working for the organization, and that he had been unable to afford even a bed
to sleep on.  He told Mr. Big that he had come from having “nothing”, that
working for the organization had lifted him out of those dire circumstances,
and that he would “never ever forget” how good they had been to him.

[136]                     
At least as enticing as the financial
inducements held out to the respondent was the promise of friendship that came
with working for the criminal organization.  The undercover officers — aware of
the respondent’s social isolation — sought to become his “best friend”.  At the
outset of the operation, the officers plotted to separate the respondent from
his wife, telling him that she was not allowed to accompany him as he traveled
across the country working for the organization.  

[137]                     
With remarkable ease, the officers quickly and
deeply engrained themselves in the respondent’s life.  By early April, less
than two full months into the operation, the respondent told Jim and Paul that
they were like brothers to him and that he loved them — a sentiment he would
repeat throughout the rest of the operation.  Indeed, the respondent preached
that loyalty to this “family” was more important to him than money.

[138]                     
The depth of the respondent’s commitment to the
organization and the undercover officers can hardly be exaggerated.  The
respondent would constantly call his friends — Jim and Paul — looking for work,
and he would anxiously await their planned meetings.  He told the officers he
was planning to leave Newfoundland so he could work for the organization full
time.  He even purported a willingness to leave his wife if that is what it
would take to join the organization.  And when he was finally arrested on June
13, the respondent’s first call for help was naturally placed to Jim.  

[139]                     
It was in these circumstances that the
respondent confessed to Mr. Big and participated in the re-enactment.  When he
entered their June 9 meeting, the respondent knew that his ticket out of
poverty and social isolation was at stake.  Jim implored him to be “honest”
with the boss.  Early on in the interrogation, Mr. Big drove home the
importance of honesty, telling the respondent that “the minute the trust is
gone . . . everything is gone”.  The conversation quickly turned to the death
of the respondent’s daughters, and Mr. Big immediately asserted that the
respondent had killed them.  When the respondent denied it and claimed to have
had a seizure, Mr. Big perfunctorily dismissed this explanation as a lie: “No
don’t lie to me . . . don’t go with the seizure stuff . . . [y]ou’re lying to
me on this okay.”

[140]                     
The circumstances left the respondent with a
stark choice: confess to Mr. Big or be deemed a liar by the man in charge of
the organization he so desperately wanted to join.  In my view, these
circumstances, considered as a whole, presented the respondent with an
overwhelming incentive to confess — either truthfully or falsely.

[141]                     
Having determined that the circumstances in
which these confessions were made cast serious doubt on the reliability of the
respondent’s confessions, the next question is whether these confessions
contain any indicators of reliability.  In my view, they do not.  

[142]                     
In the first place, the respondent’s description
of how the crime was committed is somewhat inconsistent.  In his meeting with
Mr. Big, the respondent started off by denying that he killed his daughters. 
Later, he said that they “fell” into the water.  After further pressing by Mr.
Big, the respondent claimed that he pushed his daughters into the water by
striking them with his shoulder.  But when he participated in the re-enactment
with Jim two days later, his explanation changed again.  When Jim knelt down
next to the respondent and asked him to demonstrate how he pushed his
daughters, the respondent nudged him with his knee.  He had to use his knee
because Jim, kneeling down, was not tall enough for the respondent to shove
with his shoulder.  The same would undoubtedly have been true for his small
children. 

[143]                     
More important than these inconsistencies is the
complete lack of confirmatory evidence.  Given the peculiar circumstances of
the case, this is unsurprising.  The issue has always been whether the
respondent’s daughters drowned accidentally or were murdered.  There was never
any question that the respondent was present when his daughters entered the
water.  All of the objectively verifiable details of the respondent’s
confession (e.g., his knowledge of the location of the drowning) flow from his
acknowledged presence at the time the drowning occurred.

[144]                     
When the circumstances in which the respondent’s
confessions were made are considered alongside their internal inconsistencies
and the lack of any confirmatory evidence, their reliability is left in serious
doubt, and I am forced to conclude that their probative value is low.  

[145]                     
On the other hand, these confessions — like all
Mr. Big confessions — carried with them an obvious potential for prejudice. 
The jury heard extensive evidence that — for four months — the respondent
devoted his entire life to trying to join a criminal gang.  They heard that he
repeatedly participated in what he thought were criminal acts, including
transporting stolen property and smuggling alcohol.  On one occasion, he and
Jim, wearing balaclavas, broke into a car to steal a package from it.  The jury
was repeatedly told that the respondent had described himself as having “no
limits”, and that he would do anything “as long as the trust was there”.  And
it is easy to see how the jury could come to view the respondent with disdain. 
Here was a man who bragged about killing his three-year-old daughters to gain
the approval of a group of criminals.  The potential for moral prejudice in
these circumstances was significant. 

[146]                     
Comparing the probative value and prejudicial
effect of these confessions leads me to conclude that their limited probative
value is outweighed by their prejudicial effect.  Put simply, these confessions
are not worth the risk they pose.  In my view, it would be unsafe to rest a
conviction on this evidence.

(ii)     The April 10 Confession

[147]                     
I reach the same conclusion with respect to the
respondent’s alleged April 10 confession.  This confession also suffers from
serious reliability concerns.  Although unprompted, it came about during a
conversation in which the respondent and Jim were bragging about their
willingness to engage in violence.  By this time, the respondent was already
under the spell of powerful financial and social inducements.  The confession
came after two months and more than 30 scenarios with undercover officers, at a
time when the respondent had already begun professing his love for Jim and
Paul.  Importantly, the confession itself contains no details — it amounts to a
bald assertion by the respondent that he killed his daughters and that he
“planned it”.  Finally, the confession was not recorded and the respondent
denies making it, which only makes it harder to assess its probative value.  On
the other hand, admitting this confession into evidence carries with it all of
the attendant prejudice I have already discussed.  In my view, the probative
value of this confession does not outweigh its prejudicial effect. 

(b)     Abuse of Process

[148]                     
Given my conclusion that the respondent’s
confessions must be excluded under the common law, it is not necessary to
consider whether the police conduct in this case amounted to an abuse of
process.  But there is no denying that this was an extremely intensive Mr. Big
operation, and one that preyed upon the respondent’s poverty and social
isolation.  In addition, the respondent had a seizure in front of an undercover
officer.  The respondent’s past seizures had caused his licence to be suspended
to protect against the risk that a seizure would cause him to have an accident
while driving.  However, the operation continued after this seizure, and
undercover officers continued to send the respondent long distances over public
roads in order to make deliveries for the fictitious criminal organization. 
The respondent submits that this placed his and the public’s safety at risk,
and that this conduct warrants excluding the confessions.  

[149]                     
Without question, the police conduct in this
case raises significant concerns, and might well amount to an abuse of
process.  However, this is not how the issue was presented at trial.  At trial,
the respondent took issue with the threatening and intimidating conduct of the
officers, and the trial judge rejected those arguments.  Given this, and the
fact that there is no need to decide the matter, I do not believe this is an
appropriate case to decide whether an abuse of process has been established.

VI.       
Disposition

[150]                     
The Court of Appeal excluded the respondent’s
June 9 and 11 confessions and quashed his convictions.  It ordered a new trial
on the basis that the respondent’s April 10 confession was admissible, and that
it provided a “sliver” of evidence upon which a jury could convict the
respondent of murder (para. 258).

[151]                     
I have concluded that the April 10 confession
must also be excluded.  As such, it is doubtful whether any admissible evidence
remains upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably, could
convict.  However, the final decision on how to proceed rests with the Crown. 
In the result, I would dismiss the appeal.

                    The
following are the reasons delivered by

[152]                     
Cromwell J. — I agree with my colleague Moldaver J.’s
analysis of the legal framework that ought to apply to statements obtained from
accused persons as a result of “Mr. Big” operations. I also agree with his
analysis of the question of whether the trial judge erred in law in his
approach to the respondent’s request that he be allowed to testify with the
public excluded from the courtroom. My only point of disagreement with my
colleague is with respect to whether this Court should decide the question of
whether Mr. Hart’s statements to the undercover officers are admissible. In my view,
we should not. I would therefore uphold the Court of Appeal’s order for a new
trial, but leave the question of admissibility of the statements to the trial
judge, to be decided in accordance with the framework set out in Moldaver J.’s
reasons. I reach this conclusion for four reasons.  

[153]                     
First, we have in this record three versions
from Mr. Hart himself of what happened to the children. One is that he
panicked. This is the version that he doggedly maintained under extensive and
challenging police interrogation.  The second is that he had an epileptic
seizure. Mr. Hart contacted the police, told them that he had not been truthful
with them in his earlier interrogations and recounted this version of events.
The third version is that he deliberately killed them, the version that Mr.
Hart told to the undercover officers — allegedly twice — during the Mr. Big
operation. 

[154]                     
In my view, it is in the interests of the proper
administration of justice that Mr. Hart’s involvement, if any, in the death of
these helpless children should be determined at a trial, applying the correct
legal framework, which we have now established.

[155]                     
Second, the Court today sets out, for the first
time, a comprehensive framework for dealing with the admissibility of
statements obtained in the course of Mr. Big operations. This framework is
significantly different from the one advanced on behalf of Mr. Hart at trial
and considered by the trial judge and also from the approach adopted by the
majority of the Court of Appeal. In my respectful view, it is fundamentally
unfair for an appellate court to apply this new legal framework to the
evidentiary record developed at trial, a record developed to address markedly
different legal issues. The Crown submitted, and not at all implausibly, that
if the issue of vulnerability, for example, had been advanced at trial, the
Crown would have adduced additional and different evidence: transcript, at pp.
32-34.  

[156]                     
Third, although the legal issues in relation to
the admissibility of Mr. Hart’s statements are different in light of our
holding in this case, the findings made by the trial judge nonetheless convince
me that it would be unwise for this Court to attempt to apply this new
framework to the existing record. 

[157]                     
At trial, Mr. Hart maintained that he was “intimidated,
scared and felt trapped in his ability to get out” and that his motive to lie
about having murdered his children was “the money, the friendships he created
with undercover operators, the lifestyle and the chance to get out of
Newfoundland”: trial judge’s voir dire reasons, 2007 NLTD 74, 265 Nfld.
& P.E.I.R. 266, at para. 33.  Mr. Hart argued at trial that his statements
resulted from implied threats, coercions and psychological coercion: ibid.,
at para. 42. 

[158]                     
The trial judge, who had the advantage of seeing
and hearing the witnesses, including Mr. Hart, flatly rejected these
contentions as having no foundation in fact. The trial judge found as a fact
that Mr. Hart was offered the opportunity to stop his involvement at any time:
“[h]e had numerous chances to leave the operation, but made no effort to do so”
(voir dire reasons, at para. 61). In fact, Mr. Hart, according to the
trial judge, “continued to show his willingness to become more involved and to
take greater risks.  . . . Mr. Hart wanted to work and continually
pressured [the undercover officers] for more work outside of Newfoundland”: ibid.,
at paras. 59 and 61. 

[159]                     
The trial judge also considered Mr. Hart’s
position that his statements should be excluded because they did not meet the
threshold requirements of reliability. The statements, argued Mr. Hart, were
the result of implied threats and intimidation and occurred in the context of
paying him to perform illegal activities. In light of all these circumstances,
the statements did not meet the required threshold reliability for admission. 

[160]                     
The trial judge rejected these submissions: voir
dire reasons, at paras. 136-42.  He referred to his earlier findings that
there was no intimidation or coercion. He also found that the motive to lie
advanced by Mr. Hart did not make sense. Why would Mr. Hart risk being caught
in his own lie to the “boss” in an attempt to gain the confidence of the
organization, after being warned of what the consequences of lying would be
shortly before the interview (para. 138)?.  As the trial judge explained:

It is true that Mr. Hart
wanted into the organization and he did have a motive to lie, but there was
reason for him to come clean with the “boss”, especially when coming clean
meant any potential problem Mr. Hart may have had could be eliminated by
the very person he was telling the problem to. It is interesting to note that
Mr. Hart actually went to a WalMart store and stood in front of a video camera
to have his photo taken at a designated time. This designated time was supposed
to be the time when a particular individual who witnessed the drowning was
supposed to have been taken care of by one of the crime gang members. 

 

     The purpose of the picture
was to provide an alibi for Mr. Hart as it related to taking care of the
individual that supposedly had seen Mr. Hart commit the crime. [paras. 140-41]

[161]                     
Finally, there is evidence that about mid-way through
the Mr. Big operation, Mr. Hart, in order to establish his ability to do what
might be required of him, told an undercover officer that he had deliberately
killed his daughters. This is the April 10, 2005 statement. The evidence was
that Mr. Hart showed the officer a picture of the twins and said that they were
his own blood but that he had killed them and had planned it: 2012 NLCA 61, 327
Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 178, per Barry J.A., at para. 10. Mr. Hart denied
making this statement in his voir dire evidence. It is not clear to me
that this statement would inevitably be excluded at a new trial on the
framework governing admissibility established in Moldaver J.’s reasons. Of
course, if ruled admissible, it would be for the jury to decide whether Mr.
Hart made this statement and what weight, if any, to give it. The Court of
Appeal refused to exclude this statement, leaving its admissibility to be
determined at a new trial: para. 258.  I agree with that conclusion.

[162]                     
In my respectful view, the admissibility of the
respondent’s statements to the undercover officers ought to be determined at a
new trial where the parties and the trial judge will have the benefit of the
new framework established in Moldaver J.’s reasons and will be able to focus
their evidence and arguments accordingly.

[163]                     
In the result, I would dismiss the appeal.

                    The  following are the
reasons delivered by

                    Karakatsanis J.  — 

I.             
Introduction 

[164]                     
The Mr. Big technique is a Canadian innovation
that has proven effective in resolving intractable criminal investigations. 
During a typical Mr. Big operation, undercover police officers befriend the
suspect and induct him into a fictional criminal organization.  Over time, they
secure his loyalty and trust.  Ultimately, they introduce the target to the
leader of the organization, who requires him to admit his involvement in the
offence the police are investigating.

[165]                     
However, Mr. Big operations entail significant
dangers.  The detailed artificial reality created by the operation is
purposively manipulative and can compromise the autonomy and human dignity of
the suspect.  Moreover, the technique generates a significant risk of false
confessions, as an individual who is pressured to confess may do or say
anything to please Mr. Big and avoid losing his new life.  The technique
entangles the target in a web of prejudicial evidence that may undermine trial
fairness.  Finally, the unrestricted use of this tactic risks abusive state
conduct, as the police devote substantial resources to manipulating suspects
who are presumed to be innocent.

[166]                     
Mr. Big confessions are not caught by the
traditional rules governing confessions to the state, such as the confessions
rule or the right to silence.  My colleague Moldaver J. would therefore address
the admissibility of Mr. Big confessions by creating a new rule of evidence
under the common law.  Under this rule, Mr. Big confessions are inadmissible
unless the Crown establishes that the probative value of the confession
(factoring in its reliability) outweighs its prejudicial effect.  He would
leave concerns about state conduct to the abuse of process doctrine.

[167]                     
I fear that the proposed common law rule fails
to consistently take into account broader concerns that arise when state agents
generate a confession at a cost to human dignity, personal autonomy and the
administration of justice.  These concerns are recognized in our jurisprudence
dealing with confessions to the state and lie at the root of the principle
against self-incrimination.

[168]                     
In my view, the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms  provides the appropriate analytical framework to regulate Mr.
Big operations because of the state’s central role in generating the
confession.  These operations raise three vital concerns:  the reliability of
the evidence generated, the autonomy of suspects, and the potential for abuse
of state power.  In addition, the technique creates criminal propensity
evidence that can undermine trial fairness.  The principle against
self-incrimination, under s. 7  of the Charter , provides
comprehensive and flexible protection in such circumstances.

[169]                     
In this case, the respondent, Mr. Hart, was
suspected of drowning his daughters.  Over two years later, the police
undertook an intensive months-long operation in which they exploited his
poverty and social isolation by offering him novel experiences:  lucrative
employment, friendship and a sense of self-worth.  The respondent was led to
believe that for this life to continue, he must confess to “Mr. Big”.  The
investigation and resulting confession demonstrate the serious risks of these
operations.  The police used their overwhelming power and resources to create
an alternate reality and to obtain a confession of dubious reliability through
an operation with a devastating impact on the accused.  In doing so, they
violated the principle against self-incrimination under s. 7  of the Charter .

[170]                     
I agree with Moldaver J.’s decision to exclude
the confessions.  However, I would reach that conclusion through the analytical
lens of the principle against self-incrimination.

II.          
Framework for Admissibility of State-Induced
Confessions

A.          
The Dangers Inherent to Confessions to the State

[171]                     
Confessions to state agents raise special concerns for the criminal
justice system.  Over the centuries, our common law tradition has responded to
these dangers.  The jurisprudence recognizes that individuals sometimes make
false confessions that can result in miscarriages of justice, affirms that
respect for human dignity and free choice means that individuals should not be
coerced by the state to provide self-incriminating evidence, and discourages
the state from conducting criminal investigations in a way that offends our
sense of fair play or compromises the integrity of the administration of
justice.  Recognizing that particular vigilance is required to protect against
miscarriages of justice caused by unreliable confessions, the law has developed
specialized rules that respect both fairness to the individual and the societal
interest in investigating crime and seeking the truth at trial.

[172]                     
Mr. Big operations have procured confessions when
traditional investigative techniques have failed.  Indeed, that is their sole
purpose.  These operations, often costly and complex, create elaborate
false realities for their targets in which they are valued and rewarded. 
Threats and inducements are tailored to exploit suspects’ vulnerabilities, and
confessing becomes necessary for their new lives to continue.  The very
structure of Mr. Big operations creates circumstances that (1) compromise the
suspects’ autonomy, (2) undermine the reliability of confessions, and (3) raise
concerns about abusive state conduct.  In addition, Mr. Big operations create
prejudicial evidence of criminal propensity which has the potential to
compromise accused persons’ ability to make full answer and defence,
undermining the fairness of the trial.

[173]                     
Despite these dangers, the Mr. Big technique has
not been extensively reviewed by this Court.  In R. v. McIntyre, [1994]
2 S.C.R. 480, the Court upheld the admissibility of the Mr. Big statements
obtained in that case in a brief oral judgment, finding that “the tricks used
by the police were not likely to shock the community” (p. 481).  But McIntyre
was very different from this case:  the operation lasted for only 10 days, the
police officers posing as criminals immediately revealed the illegal nature of
their activities, and the “job” offer they made to McIntyre at the outset
required him to prove he was capable of killing (see R. v. McIntyre
(1993), 135 N.B.R. (2e) 266 (C.A.)).

[174]                     
Existing safeguards that govern confessions made
to the state are rooted in traditional investigative techniques and fail to
properly regulate Mr. Big operations.  The confessions rule does not apply in a
Mr. Big operation because the suspect is not aware that he is speaking to a
person in authority (R. v. Hodgson, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 449, at paras.
24-29; R. v. Grandinetti, 2005 SCC 5, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 27), nor does
the right to silence, which arises only upon a suspect’s detention (R. v.
Hebert, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151, at p. 184; McIntyre).  Thus, Mr. Big
confessions fall into the gaps between the traditional rules.

[175]                     
The Court cannot countenance this void.  The
existing rules assist in identifying the interests affected and dangers
generated by Mr. Big operations and in structuring a principled and responsive
legal framework.  The confessions rule guards against unreliable
confessions and regulates state conduct to protect basic fairness in the
criminal process (R. v. Oickle, 2000 SCC 38, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 3, at
paras. 68-69).  The right to silence focuses on autonomy, choice and fairness
by protecting detained persons’ “right to choose whether to speak to the
authorities or to remain silent” (Hebert, at p. 180).  More
broadly, the principle against self-incrimination from which these protections
stem is based upon respect for an individual’s autonomy and human dignity,
which give that individual the right to choose whether to incriminate herself.  The
principle serves “at least two key purposes, namely to protect against
unreliable confessions, and to protect against abuses of power by the state” (R.
v. White, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 417, at para. 43;
see also R. v. Jones, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 229, at p. 250).

B.           
The Principle Against Self-Incrimination

[176]                     
Mr. Big confessions engage the constitutional principle against
self-incrimination protected under s. 7  of the Charter .  Section 7  
reads:

Everyone has the right to life,
liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof
except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

[177]                     
In R. v. P. (M.B.), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 555,
Lamer C.J. described the principle against self-incrimination as follows:

Perhaps
the single most important organizing principle in criminal law is the right of
an accused not to be forced into assisting in his or her own prosecution . . .
.

 

The
broad protection afforded to accused persons is perhaps best described in terms
of the overarching principle against self-incrimination, which is firmly rooted
in the common law and is a fundamental principle of justice under s. 7  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  As a majority of this Court suggested in Dubois
v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 350, the presumption of innocence and the
power imbalance between the state and the individual are at the root of this
principle and the procedural and evidentiary protections to which it gives rise. 
[Emphasis added; pp. 577-78.]

[178]                     
Section 7 has a well-recognized residual role
with respect to the principles of fundamental justice, of which ss. 8 to 14 are
examples (Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at pp.
502-3 and 512).  The principle against self-incrimination manifests itself in
specific protections such as the s. 7 right to silence recognized in Hebert,
the s. 10 (b) right to counsel, the s. 11 (c) rule of
non-compellability and the s. 13  privilege against self-incrimination
(see Jones, at pp. 251-56; H. Stewart, Fundamental
Justice: Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (2012),
at pp. 8-9).  However, in considering the scope of the
principle, in Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v.
Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices
Commission), [1990]
1 S.C.R. 425, Lamer J. (dissenting, but not on this point), agreed with the
majority that “the specific
enumerations in ss. 11 (c) and 13  of the Charter  are not
necessarily exhaustive of the protection afforded by s. 7 , and do not prevent
residual content being given to s. 7 ” (p. 442).

[179]                     
The principle against
self-incrimination is, therefore, a robust and dynamic concept which
addresses the dangers that arise from confessions made to state agents.  It provides a principled approach to dealing
with confessions to the state.[11] 
In my view, the principle provides the appropriate
response to Mr. Big cases, for several reasons.

[180]                     
First, Mr. Big operations deploy significant
state resources to create a new world, where the target often feels that there
is no choice but to confess.  They directly engage the individual privacy,
autonomy and dignity interests that the principle against self-incrimination is
meant to protect.  The principle against self-incrimination acknowledges the
tremendous power of the state and protects the individual’s freedom to choose
whether to make a statement to the police.  The right not to be
compelled to incriminate oneself has deep roots.  It is an overarching
organizing principle in our criminal justice system, of which the confession
rule and the right to silence are emanations (Hebert, at p.
175).  It makes sense to rely upon this foundational principle in responding to
confessions that are generated by and made to state agents.

[181]                     
Second, this approach draws on existing jurisprudence concerning the
principle against self-incrimination, making it unnecessary to create a new
rule.  The scope of s. 7’s protection
against self-incrimination is to be “determined on a case-by-case basis” (Jones,
at p. 257).

[182]                     
Third, the principle against self-incrimination
provides an opportunity to weigh concerns about reliability, autonomy and state
conduct together in a nuanced way.  These concerns are factually and
conceptually intertwined.  For example, if the police overreach in their
reliance on threats and inducements, this will be relevant to determining
whether the operation was unduly coercive, may undermine the reliability of the
confession, and will raise the spectre of abuse.

[183]                     
Finally, the principle against self-incrimination addresses
suspects’ rights both during the Mr. Big operation and at trial; a rule for
addressing these operations must regulate both.  A fair trial cannot be based
on evidence obtained through fundamentally unfair state tactics.  That being
so, trial fairness and investigative fairness should not be addressed in
freestanding inquiries.  As the Court explained in White, “[i]n every
case, the facts must be closely examined to determine whether the principle
against self-incrimination has truly
been brought into play by the production or use of the declarant’s
statement” (para. 48 (emphasis added)).

[184]                     
Consistent with Charter  jurisprudence,
the onus is on the accused to establish a prima facie breach of the
principle against self-incrimination.  To do so, the accused must show that
concerns about autonomy, reliability, and police conduct exist, as they will in
nearly every Mr. Big operation.  In such circumstances, the burden will shift
to the Crown to establish that there is no breach.  Consequently, the Crown
should always be prepared to demonstrate the admissibility of the resulting
evidence.  This will encourage the police to give careful consideration to the
constitutionality of the operation and will incentivize recording of the Mr.
Big “scenarios” where possible.  Given that the entire operation, not just the
final meeting, is relevant to the admissibility of any evidence obtained,
thorough records would make it easier for the court to assess the investigation
and would allow the police to defend against allegations of undue coercion or
state misconduct.

[185]                     
The principle against self-incrimination also
works to secure trial fairness, which is a principle of fundamental justice
recognized under ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .  Trial fairness
may be compromised whenever there are concerns about how police have obtained
self-incriminating evidence, where such evidence is of dubious reliability, and
where juries have difficulty evaluating the truthfulness of confessions.  There
is scope to consider all of these factors under the principle against
self-incrimination.

C.           
Applying the Principle Against
Self-Incrimination to Mr. Big Cases

[186]                     
The Court applied the principle against
self-incrimination in White.  The White framework deals
directly with three interrelated concerns which ground the traditional rules
respecting confessions to the state:  autonomy, reliability, and state
conduct.  As the Court explained,

[t]he
definition of the principle against self-incrimination as an assertion of human
freedom is intimately connected to the principle’s underlying rationale. As
explained by the Chief Justice in Jones, supra, at pp. 250-51, the
principle has at least two key purposes, namely to protect against unreliable
confessions, and to protect against abuses of power by the state.  There is
both an individual and a societal interest in achieving both of these
protections.  Both protections are linked to the value placed by Canadian
society upon individual privacy, personal autonomy and dignity: see, e.g., Thomson
Newspapers, supra, at p. 480, per Wilson J.; Jones, supra,
at pp. 250-51, per Lamer C.J.; and Fitzpatrick, supra, at
paras. 51-52, per La Forest J.  [Emphasis added; para. 43.]

[187]                     
The Court identified four factors which help to
determine whether the principle against self-incrimination has been violated by
the production or use of a suspect’s statements:

(1)              
whether there was an adversarial relationship
between the accused and the state at the time the statements were obtained;

 

(2)              
whether there was coercion by the state in
obtaining the statements;

 

(3)              
whether there was a risk of unreliable
confessions as a result of any compulsion; and

 

(4)              
whether permitting the use of the statements
would lead to an increased risk of abusive state conduct. (White, at
paras. 53-66)

[188]                     
While these factors are interrelated, in the Mr.
Big context, each emphasizes a particular legal interest or principle.  The
coercion factor is primarily concerned with the autonomy and dignity of the
suspect and asks whether the suspect had a choice to speak to the authorities. 
The reliability enquiry focuses on the trustworthiness of any statement
obtained.  Finally, the conduct of the state is examined with a view to
determining whether the authorities used their position of power in an unfair,
abusive, or shocking manner.  Although each factor underscores a particular
concern, specific facts or tactics may implicate more than one danger, and
therefore may be considered under more than one part of the analysis. 
Ultimately, these factors are intertwined and should be considered together.

[189]                     
This approach does not identify prejudice as a factor to be considered
under the principle against self-incrimination.  However, the prejudice created
by the evidence of criminal propensity is indirectly relevant to reliability
and state conduct.  Moreover, the trial judge retains the residual power to
exclude evidence on the basis of trial fairness (see R. v. Harrer, [1995]
3 S.C.R. 562, at paras. 24 and 41) or when its probative value is outweighed by
its prejudicial effect.

[190]                     
When applying this principled approach to
state-induced confessions, the courts should apply the test in a way that
protects the fundamental interests at stake and responds to the dangers raised
by the particular circumstances.

(1)    Adversarial Relationship

[191]                     
The principle against self-incrimination is directly
applicable where individuals are in adversarial relationships with the state. 
In a Mr. Big operation, the state deliberately sets out to obtain a confession
from the suspect.  By definition, the relationship is adversarial.  Thus, this
factor does not add to the analysis where there is a confession to Mr. Big.

(2)    Coercion

[192]                     
A confession is coerced when the accused is deprived of a free choice
whether to admit, deny, or refuse to answer (Black’s Law Dictionary (6th
ed. 1990), at p. 258).  In the context of a Mr. Big operation, a confession is
coerced when the suspect is deprived of any reasonable alternative to
confessing.  While there will almost always be some degree of
coercion in a Mr. Big operation, the issue at this stage is the extent
of that constraint.  Coercion is not a binary.  This means that even if the
suspect had some alternative to confessing, the degree to which
his free choice was compromised must be examined.

[193]                     
While threats of violence are manifestly coercive, the
principle of autonomy abhors coercion in all its forms.  In Rothman v. The
Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640, and Oickle, this Court held that
particularly manipulative trickery ― for example, a police officer
pretending to be a chaplain or a legal aid lawyer to obtain a confession
― would shock the community.  A Mr. Big operation is built upon layers
of deception.  The target is exposed not only to a false confidante, but false
friends, a false job, and a false life.

[194]                     
In determining the degree of coercion, the court should
consider the magnitude and duration of the operation, any explicit or implied
threats used, any financial, social, or emotional inducements applied, and the
characteristics of the suspect, including any mental, physical, social, or
economic disadvantages.

[195]                     
By way of example, when financial inducements are
offered to a person of means, it will be difficult to argue that he or she had
no reasonable choice but to confess.  On the much more serious end of the
spectrum are operations which exploit individuals’ particular weaknesses, such
that they feel obliged to make a self-incriminating statement.  Of course,
sufficient pressure may cause even well-situated individuals to feel the force
of coercion.

[196]                     
This approach protects the autonomy of the
suspect, a cardinal concern of the confessions rule (where it is also expressed
as voluntariness) and the principle against self-incrimination more broadly. 
In Hodgson, for example, Cory J. (quoting L. Herman, “The
Unexplored Relationship Between the Privilege Against Compulsory
Self-Incrimination and the Involuntary Confession Rule (Part I)” (1992), 53 Ohio
St. L.J. 101, at p. 153, citing Sir G. Gilbert, The Law of Evidence
(1769)) noted that the common law “will not force any Man to accuse himself”,
and held  that “from its very inception, the confessions rule was designed not
only to ensure the reliability of the confession, but also to guarantee
fundamental fairness in the criminal process” (para. 18 (emphasis deleted)).

[197]                     
Although the concern for autonomy interweaves
with the goals of obtaining reliable evidence and curbing offensive state
conduct, it exists in our adversarial legal system as an idea with its own
normative force, namely, “a basic distaste for self-conscription” (R. v. S.
(R.J.), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 451, at para. 83).  As this Court has explained,
“proper rules of battle between government and individual require that the
individual . . . not be conscripted by his opponent to defeat himself” (White,
at para. 42, citing Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 8 (McNaughton rev.
1961), § 2251, at p. 318).

[198]                     
In S. (R.J.), the Court described the
principle against self-incrimination as “the principle of sovereignty embodied
in the idea that individuals should be left alone in the absence of
justification, and not conscripted by the state to promote a self-defeating
purpose” (para. 81).

[199]                     
While there will almost always be some
degree of coercion in a Mr. Big operation, this does not mean that any
resulting confession will automatically be excluded.  The police must have
leeway to employ the Mr. Big technique up to a certain point.  However, if the
coercion was so great that the suspect was made to believe that he had no
alternative but to confess, the statement will have been obtained
unconstitutionally.  Barring such extreme cases, the court must weigh the nature
and severity of coercion alongside the reliability of any resulting
statement and the conduct of the state, two factors I delineate below.

(3)    Reliability

[200]                     
False confessions can cause miscarriages of
justice, condemn innocent individuals, and result in failures to convict the
truly guilty (Oickle, at para. 32).  Concern for reliability rightly
underpins numerous protections against self-incrimination.  Under the
“reliability” analysis, the court will execute a robust gatekeeper function in
assessing the risk of a false confession, and corroborating or supporting
evidence will usually be a prerequisite to admission.

[201]                     
This appraisal is of paramount importance because juries often
struggle to properly assess the ultimate reliability of Mr. Big confessions. 
Juries generally find it difficult to believe that someone
would confess to a crime she did not commit (Oickle, at para. 34), and
are loath to disregard a confession even where it is known to be coerced (S. M.
Kassin et al., “Police-Induced Confessions:  Risk Factors and Recommendations”
(2010), 34 Law & Hum. Behav. 3, at p. 24).  This danger is
compounded by the criminal propensity evidence generated during a Mr. Big
investigation.  An accused who falsely confessed is in a catch-22 situation;
his only course to explain away his statement is to admit that it was made to
preserve his criminal lifestyle.

[202]                     
As a consequence, the trial judge must play a
gatekeeper role in assessing the reliability of the confession.  Although the
assessment of ultimate reliability ― the final weight to be given
to the confession ― is the purview of the jury, a gatekeeping function is
far from unprecedented.  For example, trial judges are called upon to gauge the
threshold reliability of hearsay evidence.  In doing so, the judge may find
evidence sufficiently trustworthy either because the circumstances of the
statement are indicative of reliability or because the jury will have the tools
to assess it (R. v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at
paras. 62-63; R. v. Youvarajah, 2013 SCC 41, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 720, at
paras. 29-30).

[203]                     
However, traditional indicia of reliability
often cannot be relied upon in a Mr. Big operation.  The confession of
an accused is generally considered to be admissible hearsay, in part because it is a “statement against interest” and therefore
more likely to be reliable.  But statements to Mr. Big are not
“against” the accused’s interest at all:  the target has been made to feel safe
from legal consequences, and confessing is a precondition to membership in the
organization, access to work, or some other benefit.  Confessions are also
treated as admissible hearsay because the
accused, a party to the case, can testify that the confession was false (see R.
v. Osmar, 2007 ONCA
50, 84 O.R. (3d) 321, leave to appeal refused, [2007] 2 S.C.R. vii; R. v.
Bonisteel, 2008 BCCA 344,
259 B.C.A.C. 114).  However, by design, the Mr. Big operation creates prejudicial
evidence of criminal propensity.  The accused must either let the confession
stand or explain that he made it in order to continue his new criminal
lifestyle.

[204]                     
Thus, confessions made to Mr. Big are particularly
hazardous, and the judge must evaluate their threshold reliability in order to
satisfy the principle against self-incrimination.

[205]                     
In order to find that a confession was constitutionally obtained,
supporting evidence will usually be required.  Under the confessions
rule, corroborative evidence cannot salvage an involuntary statement.  That
rule is not concerned with the reliability of the particular confession, but
with the manner in which it was obtained.  This is because “if the state were
left with the option of simply corroborating forced confessions, there would be
little incentive to refrain from reprehensible investigative measures” (Hodgson,
at para. 20).  However, under the self-incrimination framework, coercion
and state conduct are independently considered under other factors, so there is
no need to use reliability as a proxy for these concerns, and corroborative
evidence may be considered.

[206]                     
Moreover, corroborative evidence compensates for the reliability
concerns inherent to a Mr. Big operation.  Such tactics involve powerful
inducements:  the suspect is promised financial rewards, membership in an organization, legal protection, approval and friendship, or some
combination of these in exchange for simply admitting to the commission of the
crime.  At the same time, the suspect has usually been warned
about the consequences of
failing to behave as the organization expects, and the “truth” that Mr. Big
wants to hear has already been made very clear.

[207]                     
A confession is more likely to be reliable if it leads to the discovery
of details of the crime scene, describes unusual aspects of the crime, or refers to “hold back” evidence ― provided, of course, such
details or evidence could not be guessed or otherwise identified by the
suspect.  I agree with amicus curiae that, generally, an
uncorroborated, unverified confession will not be sufficiently reliable and
will be inadmissible.  However, the inverse does not necessarily hold.  The
principle against self-incrimination is not solely concerned
with ensuring reliable statements; even true statements may be excluded if they
were obtained through abusive state conduct or through coercion that overrode
the suspect’s autonomy interest.

[208]                     
This is not to say that Mr. Big confessions will always be
inadmissible.  When the police elicit confessions in a way that respects the
autonomy of the suspect and the integrity of the administration of justice
― likely through shorter, less exploitative Mr. Big investigations like
that in McIntyre ― the resulting confessions will be less
grievously afflicted with reliability concerns and will more likely be
admissible, particularly when corroborated.

(4)    Abuse of Power/Police Misconduct

[209]                     
The state must conduct its law enforcement
operations in a manner that is consonant with the community’s underlying sense
of fair play and decency.  It cannot manipulate suspects’ lives without limit,
turning their day-to-day existence into a piece of theatre in which they are
unwitting participants.  Such an approach does violence to the dignity of
suspects and is incompatible with the proper administration of justice.

[210]                     
I agree with my colleague Moldaver J. that the abuse of process
doctrine recognized under s. 7  remains independently available to provide a
remedy for state misconduct in the Mr. Big context.  However, the high
threshold for its application means that conduct may tend to undermine the
integrity of the administration of justice, yet fail to warrant a remedy under
this doctrine.  The need to restrain
state misconduct is one of the rationales for the principle against
self-incrimination (as well as the confessions rule and the right to silence). 
Therefore, police conduct in Mr. Big operations must be
considered, even when it does not rise to the level of abuse of process.

[211]                     
State conduct throughout a Mr. Big
operation must be scrutinized to determine whether the police unfairly,
unnecessarily or disproportionately manipulated the suspect.  This inquiry
will also consider other objectionable police tactics such as involving the
suspect in dangerous conduct or exposing him to physical or
psychological harm.

[212]                     
A certain degree of trickery is, of course, inherent to many
effective and appropriate police tactics.  But the more
disreputable the police tactics become, and the less they comport with the
responsibility to conduct a fair prosecution which respects the dignity of the
suspect, the more likely it is that s. 7  has been violated.

[213]                     
The entrapment doctrine ― a specific
variant of abuse of process ― assists with this analysis.  While
it is not directly applicable outside the entrapment context,
it nonetheless identifies useful factors to consider in examining the conduct
of the state.  R. v. Mack, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, establishes that,
unless the authorities have a reasonable suspicion that a suspect is already
engaged in criminal activity, or act pursuant to a bona fide inquiry,
they cannot provide the suspect with an opportunity to commit an offence.  Even
when that threshold for suspicion is met, the authorities cannot go beyond providing
an opportunity to commit an offence by crossing over into inducing
commission of the offence (Mack, at p. 964).  Lamer J. provided a
useful non-exhaustive list of factors to consider in
determining whether that line has been crossed.  In the Mr. Big context, these
kinds of factors can assist in deciding whether the inducements, threats, and
manipulation used constitute abusive state conduct.  Adapting the factors from Mack,
at p. 966, the following considerations are relevant to Mr. Big operations:

1.                 
the type of crime being
investigated and the availability of other techniques for the police detection
of its commission;

 

2.                 
the strength of the
evidence causing the police to target the suspect;

 

3.                 
the types and strength of inducements used by the police, including deceit, fraud, trickery or
reward;

 

4.                 
the duration of the operation and
the number of interactions between the police and the suspect;

 

5.                 
whether the police
conduct involved an exploitation of human characteristics such as the emotions
of compassion, sympathy and friendship;

 

6.                 
whether the police appear to have
exploited a particular vulnerability of the suspect such as mental, social, or
economic vulnerabilities or substance addiction;

 

7.                 
the degree of
harm to the suspect that the police caused or risked;

 

8.                 
the existence and
severity of any threats, implied or express, made to the suspect by the police
or their agents, including threats made to third parties where those threats
carry an indirect threat to
the accused;

 

9.                 
whether an average
person, with both strengths and weaknesses, in the position of the suspect
would be induced to falsely confess;

 

10.             
the persistence and
number of attempts made by the police before the suspect agreed to confess.

[214]                     
My intention is not to
create a formalistic checklist or to overcomplicate the analysis.  These
factors are simply examples which may help the court to determine whether the
conduct of the police in obtaining a confession has contravened our society’s
basic expectations of fair play or undermined the reputation of the justice
system.  More abusive state conduct makes it more likely that the confession
was obtained in a manner incompatible with the principle against
self-incrimination.

(5)    Weighing the Contextual Factors

[215]                     
As I have explained,
the foregoing contextual factors are not binaries that are “present” or “not
present”.  In most cases, there will be some degree of concern about coercion,
about the reliability of the confession, and about the state conduct. This does not automatically mean the statement should
be excluded.  The court should consider the concerns collectively, attaching
weight to them, depending on the degree to which they are present in the
individual case.  For example, if a confession is corroborated and reliable,
this factor may outweigh relatively minor concerns about coercive conduct.  In some cases ― if the statements
were obtained in a highly coercive manner or the state conduct cannot be
condoned by the courts ― the principle against self-incrimination may be
violated even if the statement is reliable.  Except in such extreme cases, it is the collective, rather than individual, impact
of these concerns that will determine whether the principle against
self-incrimination has been violated.

[216]                     
Typical undercover operations, therefore, will not violate the
principle against self-incrimination.  Unlike Mr. Big operations, these
strategies are not designed around the coercive use of threats and inducements
or entrapment-like state conduct.  Undercover officers usually role-play within
existing circumstances to observe suspects and gather evidence ―
not to generate confessions ― resulting in reduced concerns with
respect to both autonomy interests and the reliability of the evidence
obtained.  By contrast, the very structure of Mr. Big operations is coercive
― officers deliberately set out to enmesh the suspect in a criminal
organization and drive him or her towards a confession.  In the usual
undercover context, police must be careful to avoid entrapping suspects into
committing the crimes for which they are being investigated.  Thus, by design,
such an operation must guard against abusive entrapment police conduct that is
typical in a Mr. Big operation.  It is therefore highly unlikely that in
classic undercover operations, concerns about personal autonomy, reliability,
and abusive conduct ― even when weighed together ― will result in a
violation of the principle against self-incrimination.

D.          
Probative Value Versus Prejudicial Effect

[217]                     
My colleague Moldaver J. is, of course,
correct that trial judges should exclude evidence where its probative value is
exceeded by its prejudicial effect.  This rule is a principle of
fundamental justice which safeguards trial fairness.

[218]                     
However, even as modified by my colleague, this rule is not sufficient
to respond to the dangers of a confession to Mr. Big because it does not
protect the human dignity and autonomy of the suspect or temper state conduct. 
Under my colleague’s approach, a highly reliable confession will likely be admitted
― regardless of whether the target was coerced by the state to
incriminate himself.  His rule does not permit these concerns
to be assessed and considered collectively under a single principled
framework.  It is preferable for the reliability of a confession and the manner
in which it was obtained to be considered together.

[219]                     
My colleague’s rule, including the presumption
of inadmissibility, only applies if the police employ a Mr. Big investigation. 
As such, it may inspire a threshold debate about the boundaries of the Mr. Big
tactic.  By contrast, an approach that responds to the dangers of
state-induced confessions applies regardless of the label attached to the
tactic.  It is the threats to which the rule responds that call it to action.

[220]                     
This is not to diminish the trial judge’s
responsibility to exclude evidence that is more prejudicial than probative. 
Highly prejudicial evidence that is unnecessary to explain the context in which
the confession was made, such as details of the suspect’s involvement in
egregious fake crimes, should continue to be edited or excised completely. 
Additionally, jury instructions must warn against impermissible reasoning based
upon criminal propensity.

III.       
Application to This Case

A.          
Was the Principle Against Self-Incrimination
Violated?

(1)    Coercion

[221]                     
The Mr. Big operation in this case lasted for
four months and involved 63 staged “scenarios”.  The deceit employed was
extensive.  The police deliberately exploited the accused’s particular
vulnerabilities to ensure he had no realistic option but to give Mr. Big the
confession he demanded.

[222]                     
In the first several scenarios, the operatives
went to considerable lengths to show Hart that the trucking business owned by
“Jim” was legitimate.  Although Hart accepted remuneration under the table, he
was only introduced to artificial criminality after 14 “scenarios” had been
completed, when he was already hooked into the manufactured reality of
lucrative employment and close friendship.

[223]                     
The trial judge found that violence was not used
or directly threatened against Mr. Hart (2007 NLTD 74, 265 Nfld. & P.E.I.R.
266, at paras. 58 and 63-65).  However, the police created an aura of
violence.  The respondent was told that sometimes bad deeds had to be done and
was led to believe that one of the operatives had assaulted a sex worker in
retaliation for betrayal.  The operatives also described the Hell’s Angels as
“flunkies” compared to the boss.  As the officer leading the investigation
testified, the purported violence of the organization went “hand in hand with
portraying ourselves to be criminals”.  “Paul” boasted to Hart that he could
kill rats and that “if he ever ratted on me there would be no turning back, it
would be a one way street”.

[224]                     
The trial judge found that Hart was motivated by a desire to take a
cut of the profits.  For this he had to take greater risks and gain the trust
of the “boss” (para. 62).  The financial
inducements were significant by anyone’s measure.  But for someone who was
known to live in poverty so extreme that he did not even have a bed to sleep on, they were life
changing: generous wages and per diems, visits to expensive restaurants,
train trips and flights to new cities.  At the voir dire, Hart
explained, “[y]ou know, it was almost like a
new life.”  Given his poverty, it is easy to understand why he did not turn down the opportunity to make such money.

[225]                     
The evidence also makes
it clear that, for the respondent, the friendships he believed he had gained were at least as important as the money.  The operatives deliberately separated the respondent from his wife in the
early days of the operation.  They created an alternate reality for the
respondent, intentionally disorienting him to the point that in the final interview
with Mr. Big, he was persuaded that incriminating himself was the only route to
take.  Hart’s fear of losing his new “family” was palpable.  Mr. Hart would
have viewed losing these friendships, around which his life had been totally
restructured, as no choice at all.

[226]                     
The trial judge concentrated on the lack of
violent coercion in the operation, but did not consider the effect of the
financial and social inducements on Mr. Hart.  The extent of the deceit and the
inducements used must be viewed as more seriously infringing the respondent’s
autonomy interests, given his known characteristics:  his extreme poverty and
social isolation, and his lack of education and sophistication.  I conclude
that by preying on these vulnerabilities to such a degree, the police deprived
the respondent of meaningful choice about whether to give an incriminating
statement to Mr. Big.

(2)    Reliability

[227]                     
The incentives for Mr. Hart to have falsely
confessed are very substantial. It was made clear to him that his friendships,
his wages, and his membership in the organization (essentially his new family)
were dependent on telling Mr. Big what he wanted to hear.  In short, he had
every incentive to confess, whether he committed the crime or not. 
Nevertheless, he protested his innocence until it was apparent that only a
confession would be accepted.  Hart testified at the voir dire that the boss “kept saying, don’t lie to me, you are lying to me
Nelson, don’t lie to me.  What was I suppose[d] to do, stay there all day and
go on like that[?]”

[228]                     
Moreover, not only was the final confession
uncorroborated, but it contained inconsistencies with the other known facts of
the case.  The motive that the respondent cited for killing his daughters
― that he did not want them to be taken from his custody and placed in
his brother’s ― is of dubious plausibility.  The idea that the girls
might temporarily stay with his brother had been considered very briefly in
June and was quickly abandoned a day or two later when the family’s housing
difficulties were solved.  Hart’s brother had little contact with the family
for approximately two months before the deaths.

[229]                     
The respondent’s description of the commission
of the offence does little to reassure us of its reliability.  When he
described the alleged murder to Mr. Big, he twice described using his shoulder
to push his daughters into the water, and matched his words with a simulated
shoulder check ― a movement that does not make sense, given the girls’
small size.  When he subsequently “re-enacted” the offence, Jim knelt down to
simulate their height, and the respondent accordingly made a pushing motion
with his knee.

[230]                     
 The “confession” of April 10 described by the
officers carries many of the same concerns.  The confession was allegedly made
during the 29th scenario, just before the initial 90-day deadline for the
operation (compare, for instance, to McIntyre, where a confession was
obtained after only 10 days).  While at dinner, Jim told Hart that the
organization controlled 70 percent of the prostitution in Montreal and that he
had had to “deal with” two prostitutes who had been dishonest with him.  He
told Hart that sometimes “bad things need to be done”.  Hart responded that he
had “no problem getting his hand dirty”; the two boasted about the skeletons in
their closets; and Hart then allegedly confessed to having killed his
daughters.  Clearly the same reliability concerns arise:  Hart had every reason
to lie, given his desire to impress a member of the organization.  Moreover,
the statement was not recorded, making it impossible to rely on body tone or
language.  Finally, the respondent explicitly denied the April 10 confession,
both during his final “confession” to Mr. Big, when he repeatedly stated that
Mr. Big was the first person he had told about it, and on the voir dire.

(3)    Abuse of Power

[231]                     
In my view, the state conduct in this case was egregious, and
this factor weighs heavily in favour of exclusion.

[232]                     
The police led Mr. Hart through the looking glass into a parallel
universe where, for many months, they employed extensive state resources to
prey on his lack of education, intellect, and life experience, his social
isolation, and his extreme poverty.  The undercover operatives fostered the
respondent’s emotional dependency on them; as Jim noted, it was a “constant
thing” for Hart to tell them he loved them.  Mr. Hart’s beloved friends
gradually involved him in an increasingly serious world of criminality,
beginning with dealing in supposedly stolen goods and eventually portraying the
organization as a violent international group with a boss who made the Hell’s
Angels look like “flunkies”.  As Hart involved himself in more dangerous and
illegal activity, his pay increased.

[233]                     
The degree of harm caused by the Mr. Big
operation is also relevant.  The respondent was so thoroughly enmeshed
in his make-believe world that upon his arrest, his first reaction was
to call his supposed “friend”, Jim.  It should have come as no surprise,
particularly to the officers who knew him so well, that Hart was devastated to
learn that his new life, where he had felt valued and respected, had all been a
carefully constructed illusion.  He had no friends.  He had not been employed
because he was “smart”:  rather, he was thoroughly duped.  The respondent
developed paranoia, believing that everyone was part of the “sting” against
him, and was unable to trust his lawyers and even his own wife.[12] 
He was eventually committed to a psychiatric hospital, and amicus curiae made
submissions on his behalf at the appeal.  Such an emotional collapse is by no
means a prerequisite to a finding of abusive state conduct.  However, this kind
of psychological manipulation by state agents harms not only the suspect but
the integrity of the justice system.

[234]                     
This was not the usual undercover investigation where police join
an existing criminal organization in order to witness criminals in action.  As
explained above, such strategies tend not to be particularly coercive or
abusive, and therefore are unlikely to violate the principle against
self-incrimination.

[235]                     
This case is more akin to entrapment.  The police employed the
power of the state to create an elaborate invented reality, designed to exploit
a vulnerable person, introduce him to criminality, and force him to incriminate
himself.  In addition, the police witnessed the
respondent suffering seizures both before the investigation began and during
the operation itself.  Yet, the undercover operatives continued to send him on
driving assignments.

[236]                     
Mr. Big operations are a creative and sometimes useful law
enforcement technique, but the courts must carefully police their boundaries
lest they stray from being useful strategies into ploys that allow the state to
manipulate and destroy the lives of individuals who are presumed to be
innocent.

[237]                     
I am greatly troubled by the extreme lengths to
which the police went to pursue the respondent, exploiting his weaknesses in
this protracted and deeply manipulative operation.  The abuse of process
doctrine always remains independently available to provide a remedy where the
conduct of the state rises to such a level that it risks undermining the
integrity of the judicial process (R. v. O’Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411,
at para. 73; R. v. Babos, 2014 SCC 16, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 309, at para.
31).  In my view, as will be clear from my discussion of the state conduct in
this case, that threshold is met.  To condone the actions of the police would
“leave the impression that the justice system condones conduct that offends
society’s sense of fair play and decency” (Babos, at para. 35). 
However, given the outcome of this appeal, it is not necessary to discuss this
issue further.

(4)    Conclusion on Contextual Factors

[238]                     
The factors considered above clearly point to a
s. 7  violation.  The accused’s liberty interests were obviously engaged.  The
police procured a confession by preying on the respondent’s particular
vulnerabilities in a complex sting.  Despite going to these lengths, the
confession is of dubious reliability and is unsupported by any corroborative
evidence or detail.  Ultimately, to countenance such a ploy would give the
police carte blanche to engage in unfair, manipulative, and coercive
investigations.

B.           
Remedy

[239]                     
In White, the Court excluded the
compelled accident report under s. 24(1)  of the Charter  on the basis
that its admission at trial would violate s. 7 .  The acquisition
of the compelled accident report was not impugned.  But where, as in this case,
evidence is obtained in breach of the Charter , s. 24(2)  is the
mechanism for exclusion (R. v. Therens, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 613).

[240]                     
Under s. 24(2), the court must determine
whether, in all the circumstances, admitting evidence obtained in breach of the
Charter  would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

[241]                     
In R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, McLachlin C.J. and Charron J. noted that statements by the accused
engage the cornerstone principle against self-incrimination (at para. 89) and concluded that, while not an absolute
rule, “as a matter of practice, courts have tended to
exclude statements obtained in breach of the Charter , on the ground that
admission on balance would bring the administration of justice into disrepute”
(para. 91).

[242]                     
Statements obtained in violation of the
principle against self‑incrimination will almost always be excluded under
s. 24(2).  In order to find a s. 7  violation, the court will have already
determined that the reliability of the statement is outweighed by abusive or
coercive police conduct.  If the statement was obtained in a manner that
violated s. 7  due to reliability concerns, its admission would risk a
miscarriage of justice and it must be excluded.  Similarly, if the statement is
reliable but was rendered unconstitutional because of concerns about coercion
or state conduct, its admission would also bring the administration of justice
into disrepute.  This case is no exception; both the risk of a miscarriage of
justice and the abusive police conduct call for exclusion.

[243]                     
As a result, I agree
with my colleague Moldaver J.’s conclusion that the evidence obtained in the operation must be excluded, and I would dismiss the
appeal.

[2] This officer’s name is also protected by the publication ban.





[3] This conversation was not recorded.  The respondent denied that
this confession occurred.   





[4]
“Undercover Operations”, B.C. RCMP (online). 





[5] This rule targets Mr. Big operations in their present form. 
A change in the way the police use undercover operations to elicit confessions
may escape the scope of this rule.  However, it is not for this Court to anticipate
potential developments in policing.  To do so would be speculative.  Time will
tell whether, in a future case, the principles that underlie this rule warrant
extending its application to another context.





[6]   It appears that the RCMP have already adopted the practice
of recording a substantial number of the interactions between the accused and
undercover officers in British Columbia (see W. E. Dawson, “The Use of ‘Mr. Big’
in Undercover Operations”, in Criminal Law: Special Issues (2011), Paper
5.2, at p. 5.2.44).





[7]   This study relates to incidents of false confessions arising from
conventional police interrogations.  In my view, the groups of people that
present the greatest danger of falsely confessing during conventional
interrogations warrant enhanced scrutiny in the context of Mr. Big operations.





[8]   For
example, in R. v. Bonisteel, 2008 BCCA 344, 259 B.C.A.C. 114, admitting
the accused’s confession to Mr. Big also required admitting evidence that the
accused had committed two unrelated, violent sexual assaults.  This evidence
had to be admitted because it was “inextricably interwoven with the undercover
confession” (para. 29).  Obviously, this sort of evidence increases the moral
prejudice that accompanies an accused’s confession.  





[9]   See, e.g., R. v. S. (R.J.), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 451, where
this Court recognized that witnesses enjoy a protection against the use of
“derivative evidence” discovered as a result of their compelled testimony (at
paras. 165-202), and British Columbia Securities Commission v. Branch,
[1995] 2 S.C.R. 3, where this Court recognized that a witness ought to be
exempted from a compulsion to testify where the witness can establish that the
state’s predominant purpose for compelling his testimony is to seek
incriminating evidence against him (paras. 5-12).

 





[10] Four factors were used to decide whether the principle had been
breached: (1) the existence of coercion; (2) the
existence of an adversarial relationship between the accused and the state; (3)
the prospect that an unreliable confession would be given; and (4) a concern
that admitting the statement would increase the likelihood of abusive conduct
by the state.  





[11] While these reasons concentrate on its
application to the Mr. Big context, I see no reason why the principle cannot be
adapted to govern other innovative police tactics designed to elicit
confessions.

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

                    Criminal law — Defences — Provocation — Accused
convicted of second degree murder — Whether defence of provocation should have
been put to jury — Whether objective and subjective elements of defence of
provocation were established, thereby lending air of reality to this defence.

                    A
jury found the accused guilty of second degree murder.  In the middle of the
night, he had intervened in an altercation that ended in the victim’s death. 
The evidence in the record showed that the accused was under the influence of “many
emotions” when he acted:  he was angry, mad, upset, “out of it”, scared,
afraid, worried, trying to protect himself and reacting emotionally.  At trial,
the judge refused three requests by the defence that he put to the jury the
defence of provocation raised by the accused.  The Court of Appeal, in a
majority judgment, affirmed that decision and dismissed the appeal.  All three
justices in the Court of Appeal agreed that the evidence was sufficient in
respect of the objective element.  Only the dissenting judge, however,
considered the evidence to be equally capable of supporting the subjective
element.

                    Held (LeBel and Wagner JJ.
dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed.  The verdict of guilty should be
set aside and a new trial ordered. 

                    Per Fish, Moldaver
and Karakatsanis JJ.:  To the extent that the evidence adduced before him
was reasonably capable of supporting the inferences necessary to make out the
defence, the trial judge was bound to put the defence of provocation to the
jury.  The air of reality test is not intended to assess whether the defence is
likely, unlikely, somewhat likely, or very likely to succeed at the end of the
day.  The relevant question is whether the record contains a sufficient factual
foundation for a properly instructed jury to give effect to the defence.  In
this case, a careful reading of the deposition of the accused ― in light
of the evidence as a whole ― sufficiently supports the inferences
necessary for the defence of provocation to apply.  It was open to a properly
instructed jury to resolve the question whether the accused had acted on the
sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool within the meaning of
s. 232(2)  of the Criminal Code .  Furthermore, the trial judge is
not at all in the best position to determine whether a defence has an air of
reality, since that is a question of law.

                    Per LeBel and Wagner JJ.
(dissenting):  The trial judge must put to the jury only those defences that
have an air of reality and are capable of being accepted by the jury.  There is
no minimal air of reality test in Canadian law.  A defence either has an air of
reality or does not have one.  To determine whether a defence meets the air of
reality test, the trial judge must consider the totality of the evidence in the
record.  The defence of provocation has two elements:  an objective element
that presupposes the existence of a wrongful act or an insult that is
sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self‑control,
and a subjective element that requires evidence establishing that the accused
acted in response to the provocation, on the sudden and before there was time
for his or her passion to cool.  In this case, neither the objective element
nor the subjective element of the defence of provocation met the air of reality
test. 

                    Regarding
the objective element, the evidence established that when the accused stabbed
the victim, he had come to his cousin’s defence and had helped push the victim
back in circumstances such that the defence of provocation could no longer be
relied on.  The willing participation of the accused in the fight made it
foreseeable that the victim would react as he did, and the accused could not
claim that his acts were a response to a sudden, unexpected, spontaneous and
unforeseeable situation.

                    As
for the subjective element, there is no credible evidence in the record that
the accused committed the murder in response to an act of provocation by the
victim before his passion had cooled.  On the contrary, the accused testified
that he had acted knowingly, with full knowledge of what he was doing, to
defend himself out of fear that the victim might recover his weapon and attack him. 
The only defence raised by the accused that had an air of reality in light of
the evidence was self‑defence. 

                    Even
if the test of correctness is applied to the trial judge’s decision, an
appellate court must bear in mind that the trial judge, who saw and heard the
witnesses, is in the best position to determine whether the evidence that is
capable of supporting the necessary inferences is credible.

                    English version of the
judgment of Fish, Moldaver and Karakatsanis JJ. delivered by

                    Fish
J. — 

I

[1]                             
At the conclusion of his trial by judge and jury
in the Superior Court, District of Montreal, the appellant, Didier Buzizi, was
convicted of second degree murder. 

[2]                             
The Quebec Court of Appeal, in a majority
judgment, dismissed his appeal.

[3]                             
This is an appeal, as of right, against the
judgment of the Court of Appeal.

II

[4]                             
The sole issue before us is whether the trial
judge erred in law in refusing three requests by the defence that he put to the
jury the defence of provocation raised by Mr. Buzizi.

[5]                             
The two majority judges answered this question
in the negative; Bich J.A., dissenting on this issue, answered in the
affirmative.

[6]                             
With respect for those who are of a different
view, I agree with Justice Bich.

III

[7]                             
The defence of provocation comprises an
objective element and a subjective element (R. v. Tran, 2010 SCC 58,
[2010] 3 S.C.R. 350, at para. 23).

[8]                             
To the extent that the evidence adduced before
him was “reasonably capable of supporting the inferences necessary to make out
the defence” (Tran, at para. 41), the trial judge was bound to put
Mr. Buzizi’s defence of provocation to the jury. 

[9]                             
All three justices in the Court of Appeal agreed
that the evidence was sufficient in respect of the objective element (2012 QCCA
906 (CanLII)).  Only Justice Bich, however, considered the evidence to be
equally capable of supporting the subjective element. 

[10]                         
I think it is useful to reproduce her reasons on
this point in their entirety:

                           [translation] 
To the extent that the victim’s conduct, as described by the appellant, meets,
as Doyon J.A. explains, the requirements of the objective element of the
defence of provocation, in my view the present circumstances also meet the
requirements of the subjective element.  It appears to me that we are dealing
here with a very particular situation in which self‑defence (in this
case, under s. 34(2)  Cr.C .) and provocation are intertwined:  the
victim’s aggressive act was capable of causing a reaction which could
conceivably arise in the context of either self‑defence or provocation. 

                           Assuming that it is believed, the
appellant’s testimony as I understand it does not foreclose this dual theory,
which has a sufficient (albeit minimal) air of reality to it, and I think it
would be dangerous to parse his statements at this stage in order to determine
whether his act stemmed from fear or uncontrollable anger, whether or not he
had time to reflect, and whether or not he acted “on the sudden and before
there was time for his passion to cool” (s. 232(2)  Cr.C .).  The
trial judge should have put the defence of provocation to the jury and, after
proper instruction, left the jury the task of deciding on the facts.

                           In
my opinion, this error warrants the ordering of a new trial.  It cannot,
in my view, be assumed ― as that would amount to usurping the function of
the jury ― that had the jury been properly instructed on the defence of
provocation, it would not have accepted that defence and would have arrived at
the same verdict, rather than finding the appellant guilty of manslaughter.  In
other words, it cannot be said with any certainty that the jury, tasked with
evaluating the evidence based on a legal framework comprising a charge of
second degree murder, a defence of self‑defence and a defence of
provocation (potentially carrying with it a verdict of manslaughter), would
have arrived at the same verdict it rendered in a framework from which the
defence of provocation had been excluded.  [Footnote omitted; paras. 104‑6.]

[11]                         
It is difficult to distinguish the instant case
from R. v. Gill, 2009 ONCA 124, 241 C.C.C. (3d) 1, in which the Ontario
Court of Appeal held:

                           . . . in this case, the trial
judge’s decision that there was no air of reality to the defence of provocation
appears to be premised on two factors:  first, the appellant’s evidence
disavowing anger as the trigger for his actions, and second, a finding that
there was no evidence of the appellant acting in the heat of passion or as a
result of a loss of self control.

                           We
agree that there will be some cases in which the appellant’s disavowal of one of
the elements of a defence will preclude the availability of the defence based
on the air of reality threshold.  However, this is not one of those cases.  In
challenging the appellant’s evidence that he was afraid at the time he stabbed
Mr. Garavellos, the Crown suggested, both in cross‑examination and
in his closing address to the jury, that the appellant’s true emotion was
anger.  If the jury rejected the appellant’s evidence that he was afraid, there
was evidence capable of supporting an inference that he was angry. 
[paras. 18‑19]

[12]                         
Moreover, it is far from clear that
Mr. Buzizi disavowed any of the essential elements of the defence of
provocation.  Even if certain excerpts from his testimony might leave the
impression that he did, I am satisfied that a careful reading of his deposition
― in light of the evidence as a whole ― sufficiently supports the
inferences necessary for his defence of provocation to apply. 

[13]                         
Finally, unlike Gill, it is common ground
in this case that the appellant was under the influence of [translation] “many emotions” (A.R., at
p. 1864) when he acted.  Moreover, the majority in the Court of Appeal
recognized that [translation]
“[t]he appellant was angry, mad, upset, ‘out of it’, scared, afraid, worried,
trying to protect himself, reacting emotionally, according to the various
expressions used” in the evidence in the record (para. 41).  The only
disputed question is whether he “acted . . . on the sudden and before
there was time for his passion to cool” within the meaning of s. 232(2)  of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 .  I agree with
Bich J.A. that it was open to a properly instructed jury to resolve this
dispute in the appellant’s favour.

IV

[14]                         
With respect, I have three brief observations
concerning the reasons of Justice Wagner.

[15]                         
First, my colleague finds that an appellate
court must defer to the trial judge in determining whether a defence has an air
of reality.  As my colleague acknowledges, however, the applicable standard of
review in this regard is correctness.  It follows, in my view, that the
trial judge is not at all in the “best position” to determine whether a defence
has an air of reality, since that is a question of law:  “. . . the
interpretation of a legal standard (the elements of the defence) and the determination
of whether there is an air of reality to a defence constitute questions of law,
reviewable on a standard of correctness” (Tran, at para. 40).

[16]                         
In addition, and again with respect, I find that
my colleague errs — as did the trial judge — in his application of the “air of
reality” test.  As the Court held in Cinous, “the air of reality test
[is not] intended to assess whether the defence is likely, unlikely, somewhat
likely, or very likely to succeed at the end of the day” (R. v. Cinous,
2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 54).  Rather, the relevant
question is whether the record contains a sufficient factual foundation for a
properly instructed jury to give effect to the defence.

[17]                         
Finally, my colleague’s assessment of the
evidence is both incomplete and flawed.  For example, he does not consider at
all the evidence of an eyewitness, Diane
Rudakenga, that the appellant was [translation]
“like . . . out of it . . . like in a trance” (A.R., at p. 1464).

V

[18]                         
For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set
aside the jury’s verdict of guilty and order a new trial.

                    English version of the reasons of LeBel
and Wagner JJ. delivered by

[19]                         
Wagner J. (dissenting) — I have read the reasons of
my colleague Fish J., who adopts the brief reasons of the dissenting judge
in the Court of Appeal.  With respect, I am of the view that they are wrong. 
The reasons for my conclusion follow.  

[20]                         
The only issue to be resolved is whether the
appellant’s defence of provocation met the air of reality test and should have
been put to the jury.  

I.       Facts

[21]                         
Before addressing this issue, I must briefly
review the principal facts.

[22]                         
Doyon J.A. provided a good overview of the
general context in his reasons for the Court of Appeal’s decision (2012 QCCA
906 (CanLII)):

                           [translation]  In the middle of the
night, several members of the group moved on to another restaurant/bar, on
Ontario Street.  Around 5:00 a.m., they were asked to leave the premises. 
Some of them gathered in the alley behind the bar.  A verbal altercation broke
out between the victim and Pierre Mumpereze, also known as “Peter”, the
appellant’s cousin.  A man named Rassem Chamaa intervened, but not for long, as
things went no further.  He saw the two men who had been arguing head toward
Ontario Street.  A few minutes later there was another altercation, in which
the appellant was involved, that ended in the death of Mr. Rushemeza.  The
appellant would be found guilty of second degree murder and sentenced to
imprisonment without eligibility for parole for at least 12 years. 
[para. 10]

[23]                         
Although the different accounts of what happened
are contradictory in some regards, they are consistent as they relate to the
essential elements.

[24]                         
There are some facts that are worth noting. 
From a fair distance away, the appellant saw that his cousin was involved in a
fight with the victim, and he decided to run to where his cousin was and to
intervene by pushing the victim back in order to get his cousin out of harm’s
way.  He then noticed that his cousin was seriously wounded in the throat and
that the victim was brandishing an exacto knife, using it to threaten the
members of the group the appellant was with.  

[25]                         
After pushing the victim, who was trying to
defend himself by threatening his assailants with his knife, the appellant saw
the victim drop his knife.  Fearing for his life should the victim pick his
weapon up, the appellant then used his own knife, the blade of which was
20 centimetres long, to stab the victim several times.  

[26]                         
According to the Crown’s theory, the appellant
intentionally caused the victim’s death to take revenge for what the victim had
done to his cousin.  According to the appellant, he stabbed the victim in
response to an act of provocation.  Doyon J.A. explained the defence’s
theory as follows: 

                           [translation]  The appellant argued
before the jury that he had had no choice.  Reacting emotionally and being “out
of it”, to avoid being a victim himself, he had to defend himself by stabbing
Mr. Rushemeza with his knife before Mr. Rushemeza had time to pick
his own weapon up.  He struck without really knowing what part of the body he
had hit or how many times he had stabbed him.  He never intended to wound the
victim seriously while being reckless as to whether death ensued.  He was
afraid for his life after seeing his cousin stabbed in the throat by an
aggressive person who was armed and was bigger than him, and who was
threatening him.  He acted as he did in self‑defence, to save his life,
without there being time for his passion to cool.  [para. 32]

[27]                         
At the end of the pre‑charge conference,
the appellant suggested that the trial judge put both self‑defence and
provocation to the jury as defences.  

[28]                         
The trial judge, Champagne J., citing, inter
alia, the comments made by my colleague Moldaver J. in R. v. Pintar
(1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (Ont. C.A.), stated:

                    [translation] 
So, after considering the view expressed by my colleague
Moldaver J.A. in Pintar and briefly reviewing the evidence produced
by Mr. Buzizi before the triers of fact, I found it unlikely that
Mr. Buzizi could not have intended to kill the victim; this is because he
had in his possession a 30‑centimetre‑long knife that he plunged at
least twice into the victim’s back to a depth of 18 centimetres while the
victim was bent over.  

                    I also took into account from the testimony of
the accused that he was scared and highly emotional, that he was afraid, that
the guy, that is to say, the victim, was a big, burly man, that his life was in
danger, that his cousin’s throat had been cut and that he himself had been
attacked.

                    As
a result, I conclude that the only defence I should put to the jury is the one
provided for in s. 34(2)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada. [A.R., at
pp. 2182‑83]

II.    Analysis

[29]                         
I agree with the view expressed by my colleague
Fish J. in R. v. Graveline, 2006 SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, at
para. 10, on the dangers of putting theoretically incompatible defences to
a jury:

                               . . .
the particular defences in issue here — automatism and self‑defence —
are, as the Crown suggested on the hearing of this appeal, incompatible in
theory, though perhaps not always in practice.  That is because self‑defence
implies deliberate conduct that is at odds with the fundamental premise of
automatism, a state of dissociative, involuntary conduct.

[30]                         
Furthermore, the following comments made by
LeBel J. in his dissenting reasons in that case reflected the concerns
voiced by Fish J. (at para. 25):

                           In
the instant case, counsel for the accused presented a defence of automatism,
with all its strengths and weaknesses, to the court of assize.  At the
beginning of the trial, counsel had indicated that he also intended to argue
self‑defence, but he said no more about this.  The trial judge nevertheless
put that defence to the jury on his own initiative.  He decided to do so even
though, as Nuss J.A. found, the available evidence did not lend even an
“air of reality” to some of the principal elements of that very particular
defence.  Moreover, the judge undeniably misdirected the jurors regarding the
defence.  All he did, in essence, was tell them that they had to acquit the
accused if they believed her.  He said nothing about the subjective and
objective aspects of the defence.  Self‑defence was thus submitted to the
jurors, without the necessary factual basis and after inadequate instructions
had been given, together with the defence of automatism. 

[31]                         
In circumstances such as these, a trial judge
who must decide whether to put defences to a jury that appear at first glance
to be incompatible must exercise caution and make sure that each of them has
the common denominator of every successful defence — an air of reality — that
will ultimately make it possible to determine which defences are available to the
accused.

[32]                         
It will be helpful to reiterate the reasons why
defences that do not meet the air of reality test should be excluded.  The
cardinal rule was explained in R. v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2
S.C.R. 3, at para. 50:

                          The
principle that a defence should be put to a jury if and only if there is an
evidential foundation for it has long been recognized by the common law.  This
venerable rule reflects the practical concern that allowing a defence to go to
the jury in the absence of an evidential foundation would invite verdicts not
supported by the evidence, serving only to confuse the jury and get in the
way of a fair trial and true verdict.  [Emphasis added.]

A.     Defence of Provocation

[33]                         
The defence of provocation has two elements. 
The first, an objective element, presupposes the existence of a wrongful act or
an insult that is sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self‑control. 
The second, a subjective element, requires evidence establishing that the
accused acted in response to the provocation, on the sudden and before there
was time for his or her passion to cool. 

[34]                         
In the case at bar, I am of the opinion that
neither the objective element nor the subjective element of the defence of
provocation met the air of reality test. 

                    (1)     Objective
Element 

[35]                         
In Canadian criminal law, s. 232(1)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 , provides that accused persons may
reduce their criminal liability if they reacted to wrongful acts or insults
that were serious enough to cause them to lose the power of self‑control. 
However, such an act or words must also be unjust, unexpected and sudden.

[36]                         
This Court has commented in the past on the
distinction between acts resulting from provocation and acts motivated purely
by revenge:  The Queen v. Tripodi, [1955] S.C.R. 438.

[37]                         
The evidence related to the elements of the
defence of provocation must be sufficient for a properly instructed jury acting
reasonably to accept the defence if it believes the evidence to be true.  

[38]                         
Is the evidence sufficient in the case at bar?

[39]                         
The evidence adduced at trial established that
when the appellant stabbed the victim, he had come to his cousin’s defence and
had helped push the victim back in circumstances such that the defence of
provocation can no longer be relied on.  

[40]                         
The appellant himself admitted in his testimony
that he had seen from a distance that his cousin was fighting with the victim,
and that he had decided to intervene in the fight to come to his cousin’s aid
by pushing the victim back.

[41]                         
Indeed, the appellant acknowledged that he had
knowingly decided to intervene in his cousin’s fight:

[translation]

                    Q.    Okay.
And when you pushed him, Maxime Rushemeza, after that, did you say to him,
“Listen, I don’t want to fight”?

                    A.    I
didn’t have . . .

                    Q.    “Stop
. . .”

                    A.    . . .
time to . . . .

                    Q.    “Stop
it.  I don’t want to fight with you.”  Did you tell him that?

                    A.    Well, I didn’t have time, really, because
when I went up to him, really, and I pushed him and got Peter behind me, that’s
when I realized Peter had been cut.  I turned my head and said nothing.  He
just said to me, “You want a piece of this?”  He undoubtedly thought I wanted
to attack him and take him on, two on one.  But I didn’t have time to say
anything to him.  [A.R., at pp. 1956‑57]

[42]                         
In the circumstances, the appellant’s willing
participation in the street brawl made it foreseeable that the victim would
then brandish his weapon (the exacto knife); the appellant could not therefore
claim to have been taken by surprise in this context.

[43]                         
In my opinion, the trial judge had to assess all
the circumstances of the appellant’s acts when he stabbed the victim in order
to determine whether there was any credible evidence, and, if there was, the
judge had to take the evidence that was most favourable to the appellant into account.

[44]                         
In this case, the evidence does not support a
conclusion that the appellant’s acts were a response to a sudden, unexpected,
spontaneous and unforeseeable situation.  

[45]                         
As I mentioned above, the trial judge must
identify evidence capable of showing that the objective element and the
subjective element of the defence of provocation have an air of reality.  

[46]                         
Even if it were assumed that the evidence
supported the objective element, which I cannot find to be the case, it is my
view that an analysis of the subjective element resolves the issue of whether
the defence of provocation has an air of reality in this case.  

                    (2)     Subjective
Element

[47]                         
I agree with the trial judge and the majority of
the Court of Appeal that the only defence raised by the appellant that had an
air of reality in light of the evidence was self‑defence, since there is
no credible evidence in the record that the appellant committed the murder in
response to an act of provocation by the victim before his passion had cooled. 
On the contrary, the appellant testified that he had acted knowingly, with full
knowledge of what he was doing, to defend himself out of fear that the victim
might recover his weapon and attack him.  He said: 

                    [translation]  

 

A.    Then, while I was protecting my face, I felt his body touch mine. 
That’s when he dropped his weapon, his . . . his exacto knife. 
That’s when I noticed that it was an exacto knife.  But at the same time, my
first thought was to not let him pick it up.  Because he tried to pick it up. 
When he tried to pick it up, that’s when I grabbed him by his sweater.  I was
able to take my knife.  Then I stabbed him.  [Emphasis added; A.R., at
p. 1805.]

[48]                         
The appellant’s own statements made it
impossible for the trial judge to find that the defence of provocation had an
air of reality.  

[49]                         
The appellant said the following in cross‑examination:


[translation]

                    Q.    . . .
Was the state of shock, if I understand your answer, is it that you were mad?

                    A.    Huh,
mad . . . the thing is, I didn’t really have time to get mad.  I had time
instead to . . . look, I didn’t even have time to do anything
really.  I turned toward him, and he just said:  “You want a piece of this?” 
Then he started slashing at me with his knife.

                    Q.    I
may be annoying here.  If I am, I apologize, but . . .

                    A.    No
problem.

                    Q.    . . .
the shock, if I understand how you’ve defined it for us . . .

                    A.    Uh‑huh.

                    Q.    . . .
it’s that you were mad . . .

                    A.    Yes.

                    Q.    . . .
about what’d happened to your cousin?

                    A.    No.  Of course I was.  I was mad, because
all kinds of feelings were mixed together.  But at the same time, I was scared
more than anything else.  Because, like I told you, I’m only human.  Also,
there was a guy who was a lot bigger than me, and looked a lot older than me,
who was attacking me, and who’d even attacked my cousin before me.  So all that
in me . . . what was in front of me, it still looked pretty clear to
me that my life was in danger.  [A.R., at pp. 1858‑59]

[50]                         
Later in his cross‑examination, the
appellant added the following: 

[translation]

                    A.    No. 
He attacked me.

                    Q.    Yes. 
I understand.  But if we assume he attacked you, okay?  After that, you
continued the fight with him?  You didn’t back off, is that right?

                    A.    Well,
as I explained to you, I didn’t actually think of backing off, because it
happened so fast, first of all.  And second, he dropped it.  And in my mind,
there was no doubt he was gonna pick it up, but not to put it back in his
pocket and say, “Okay, let’s stop.”  He was gonna pick it up eventually to
attack me.  

                    Q.    Okay. 
So, if I understand your testimony, despite everything you did, despite the
fact that you stabbed him several times, despite the fact that you attacked and
then retreated, you’re telling the Court that you never agreed to fight?  Is
that what you’re . . . 

                    A.    I
. . . 

                    Q.    . . .
saying?

                    A.    . . .
never said that.  At one point, yes, I can tell you I had to defend myself. 
So when you defend yourself, in a way, you’re consenting to fight.  But at some
point, since he had his weapon . . . he had his knife . . .
his exacto knife in his hands, and I had my knife in my hands.  But that
doesn’t mean that, because I had my knife in my hands, that I felt any safer.

                    Q.    That’s
not my question.

                    A.    Okay.

                    Q.    My
question is this:  Did you agree at that time to fight with him?

. . .

                    A.    . . .
it’s sure that I ran to get there.  So . . .

                    Q.    Uh‑huh.

                    A.    . . .
I saw where the two individuals were, given that I was not part of the
altercation.  But once I was in the alter . . . altercation, it’s
sure that at some point, I couldn’t see the little details of things that were
around me.

                    Q.    When
you in fact began . . . you saw it begin, this altercation, did you
at any time see Peter Mumpereze stab Maxime Rushemeza?

                    A.    No.  [Emphasis added; A.R., at
pp. 1957‑59 and 1974.]

[51]                         
Earlier, the appellant had said the following: 

[translation]

                    Q.    . . .
the way you defined it, its effect was that you didn’t know what you were
doing?

                    A.    Sure
I knew what I was doing, in the sense that . . . look, I saw what was
going on.  But . . .  

                    Q.    Uh‑huh.

                    A.    . . .
at the same time, I . . . I didn’t have time to figure anything out,
like.  I . . . it happened really fast, and it happened in a
situation that was dangerous not only for me, but it could have been anybody. 

                    Q.    Okay.  So if I understand correctly, your
state of shock did not cause you to lose control?  You knew what you were
doing, Mr. Buzizi, according to your answer.  [Emphasis added; A.R., at
p. 1860.]

[52]                         
In this case, I agree with the trial judge and
the majority of the Court of Appeal that the appellant knew what he was doing
when he stabbed the victim before the victim could pick up his weapon.  He
interfered, carrying a knife, in a fight he had seen from a certain distance
without even knowing what his cousin’s situation was.  This was not a sudden,
impulsive act in response to an act of provocation by the victim.  

[53]                         
I adopt Doyon J.A.’s comments on this
aspect of the case (at paras. 44‑45): 

                           [translation] 
While saying that he was angry, the appellant also insisted that he was
afraid.  He gave no indication whatsoever that he had lost his self‑control
during the incident.

                           Provocation
and self‑defence are not necessarily mutually exclusive or incompatible
in every case.  However, there are situations in which, by the admission of the
accused persons themselves, there is no evidence of an impulsive reaction
before they were able to control their passion.  In my view, this is one
such case.  This conclusion could be avoided only by ignoring the appellant’s
explanations and assessing the evidence on the basis of the objective standard
alone, which is clearly inappropriate.  We cannot project ourselves into the
appellant’s mind and consider the evidence on the basis of our own hypothetical
reactions.  The trial judge must consider the evidence, not his or her opinion
on what might have happened.  And that is what he did.  [Emphasis added.]

[54]                         
In this case, the appellant’s conduct — as
revealed by the evidence — was compatible only with self‑defence, a
defence the jury clearly rejected.  This Court dealt with a similar situation
in Olbey v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1008:

                           It
will be recalled that the appellant did not raise the defence of provocation at
trial but relied on self‑defence.  It may be observed here that at no
time did the appellant say that he had been provoked into violent action by the
words and conduct of the deceased.  In fact, his description of events goes far
to negate any suggestion of provocation.  His evidence reveals an attack,
described clearly and with some detail, to which he reacted, not on the sudden,
but by defending himself.  When, according to his evidence, he saw the deceased
put his hand inside his sweater, he considered that the deceased was reaching
for a gun and, in fear of his life, he shot and killed him.  This describes a
calculated and rational series of defensive acts, not a sudden reaction in the
heat of passion.  [p. 1022]

[55]                         
The reasons of my colleague Fish J. are
based essentially on a parallel he draws with R. v. Gill, 2009 ONCA 124,
241 C.C.C. (3d) 1.  With respect, I find that the conclusions reached in that
case were based on a specific set of facts, which means that any comparison
would be shaky in the circumstances.  

[56]                         
In my opinion, the principles laid down by this
Court in Olbey and in R. v. Faid, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 265, should
prevail.  In Faid, the Court made the following comments:

                           There
can be no doubt that a reasonable jury acting judicially could find a blow to the
head or a knife attack to be a wrongful act or insult of the nature and effect
set forth in s. 215(3).  Provocation no doubt existed here but that is not
the end of the inquiry.  The critical question to be answered in this case was
whether there was any evidence that Faid was provoked.  Was there any
evidence of passion or that he “acted upon” the provocation on the sudden and
before there was time for his passion to cool?  We have only his evidence on
the point and nowhere in that evidence does one find any suggestion that as a
result of the blows or other conduct of Wilson he was enraged, or that his
passions were inflamed, or that he killed in heat of blood.  [Emphasis
added; p. 278.]

[57]                         
It is clear that the appellant in the case at
bar was aware of everything he did.  He had the opportunity to come to his
senses, if he had in fact taken leave of them.  Noticing that the victim had
momentarily dropped his weapon, the appellant deliberately stabbed him to keep
him from picking it up again. 

[58]                         
To determine whether a defence meets the air of
reality test, the trial judge must consider the totality of the evidence
in the record and assume the evidence relied on by the accused to be true (Cinous,
at para. 53).  I agree with Doyon J.A. that the trial judge was correct
to assess the evidence not solely on an objective basis, but taking the
appellant’s point of view and the explanations he gave into account in light of
all his testimony.

[59]                         
Both the appellant and other eyewitnesses
maintained that he had acted in a context in which he was experiencing a number
of different emotions.  

[60]                         
Nevertheless, the strong emotions experienced by
the appellant, whether they resulted from anger or from fear, were not
necessarily contingent upon the existence of a state of provocation.  As a
result, the fact that he experienced them is not on its own sufficient to prove
that he was provoked.  The appellant’s emotional state must be understood in
the context of a drunken street brawl that took place early in the morning.

[61]                         
This aspect of the case was correctly assessed
by Doyon J.A., who wrote the following for the majority of the Court of
Appeal (at paras. 50‑52):

                           [translation] 
The appellant was in shock.  That is understandable, but it is not
enough.  Any person in the same situation would be in shock.  The question to
ask is instead:  Did the provocation cause him to act on the sudden and before
there was time for his passion to cool?  The answer to this question is no.

                           The loss of control of which he spoke
related primarily to the situation, over which he had no control, and not to
his emotions or to his passion that had allegedly been inflamed.  On the
contrary, he said that he knew what he was doing and that he had to stab the
victim before the victim picked his weapon up.  The limited time to think is
typical of self‑defence, and all this evidence provides ample
justification for the trial judge’s decision.  

                           In
short, there is an allegation of self‑defence here that precludes any
defence of provocation.  

B.     Privileged Position of the
Trial Judge in Applying the Air of Reality Test

[62]                         
The important role of the trial judge should be
borne in mind.  The judge must decide whether there is evidence capable of
supporting a defence raised by the accused.  This is not an arbitrary exercise,
as the judge must carefully review the record in order to identify evidence
that, if believed by a properly instructed jury, could lead the jury to accept
the defence’s theory.  

[63]                         
It would of course be possible for the trial
judge to put to the jury all the defences raised by the accused, even the most
frivolous ones, in the hope that the jury, in its wisdom, would disregard those
that could not stand.  But that is not the judge’s role.  The judge must put to
the jury only those defences that have an air of reality and are capable of
being accepted by the jury.  This Court made this point in Cinous (at
paras. 82‑83): 

                           We conclude that the authorities after Pappajohn
continue to support a two‑pronged question for determining whether there
is an evidential foundation warranting that a defence be put to a jury.  The
question remains whether there is (1) evidence (2) upon which a
properly instructed jury acting reasonably could acquit if it believed the evidence
to be true.  The second part of this question can be rendered by asking whether
the evidence put forth is reasonably capable of supporting the inferences
required to acquit the accused.  This is the current state of the law,
uniformly applicable to all defences.

                           . . .
There is no authority for a threshold that could be satisfied by pointing to
evidence that is incapable of reasonably supporting the inferences
necessary to acquit an accused.  Before putting a defence to a jury, it is the
trial judge’s duty to ask not just whether there is evidence in some general
sense, but whether there is evidence that is reasonably capable of
supporting an acquittal.  This requires an assessment of whether the
evidence relied upon is reasonably capable of supporting the inferences
required for the defence to succeed.  [Emphasis in original.]

[64]                         
In her dissenting reasons in the Court of Appeal
— which my colleague endorses — Bich J.A. referred to the air of reality
as a minimal one to justify her decision to order a new trial.  There is no
minimal air of reality test in Canadian law.  A defence either has an air of
reality or does not have one.  Using a qualifier such as “minimal” here would
seem instead to indicate a serious doubt or a certain unease regarding the sufficiency
of the evidence supporting the appellant’s defence of provocation.  

[65]                         
In light of this unease related to the weakness
of the evidence, even if the test of correctness is applied to the trial
judge’s decision, an appellate court must bear in mind that the trial judge,
who saw and heard the witnesses, is in the best position to determine whether
the evidence that is capable of supporting the necessary inferences is
credible.  This is especially true in a case such as the one at bar in which it
is considered necessary to mention that the air of reality of the defence is
minimal.

III.    Conclusion

[66]                         
Since there was no evidence that would be
reasonably capable of supporting the objective and the subjective elements of
the defence of provocation, that defence did not meet the air of reality test,
and a properly instructed jury could not have accepted it.  The trial judge
therefore did not err in refusing to put the defence of provocation to the
jury.  The Court of Appeal was right to dismiss the appeal.

[67]                         
For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal
and affirm the conviction.

on appeal from the court of appeal for saskatchewan

                    Criminal
law — Child abandonment — Mens rea — Accused gave birth in washroom at retail
store and left newborn in toilet — Accused testified that she had not realized
she was pregnant and that she believed child was born dead — Acquittal entered —
Whether fault element is subjective or objective — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C‑46 , ss. 214  “‘abandon’ or ‘expose’”, 218.

                    The
accused, not previously knowing that she was pregnant, gave birth while using
the toilet in a retail store.  Thinking the child was dead, she cleaned up as
best she could and left, leaving the child in the toilet.  The child was in
fact alive, was quickly attended to by others and transported to the hospital
where he was successfully resuscitated and found to be completely healthy.  The
accused was eventually identified as the woman seen entering and leaving the
washroom at the time in question.  When contacted by police, she cooperated
fully and confirmed that she was the mother of the child.  She was charged with
unlawfully abandoning a child under the age of 10 years old and thereby endangering
his life contrary to s. 218  of the Criminal Code .

                    The
trial judge noted that the accused acknowledged that she had left her child in
the toilet, thereby committing the actus reus of the s. 218 
offence.  As for the mens rea, the trial judge decided that subjective
fault was required and found that the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable
doubt that the accused intended to abandon her child.  She had not known she
was pregnant and truly believed she had delivered a dead child.  Her fear and
confusion explained her subsequent behaviour.  The trial judge accordingly
found the accused not guilty and dismissed the charge.  The majority of the
Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that s. 218  of the Criminal
Code  requires subjective fault.

                    Held: 
The appeal should be dismissed.

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and Fish, Abella, Cromwell and Karakatsanis JJ.: The
text of s. 218  of the Criminal Code  does not expressly set out a
fault requirement, but when read in light of its full context, it supports the
conclusion that subjective fault is required.  An important part of the context
in which we must interpret s. 218  is the presumption that Parliament
intends crimes to have a subjective fault element.  There is nothing in the
text or context of the child abandonment offence to suggest that Parliament
intended to depart from requiring subjective fault.  The text, scheme and
purpose of the provision support this conclusion, and to the extent that
Parliament’s intent is unclear, the presumption of subjective fault ought to
have its full operation in this case.  The legislative evolution of the child
abandonment offence is, if anything, more supportive than not of this
conclusion.

                    There
is no doubt that the purpose of the abandonment offence is the protection of
children from risk even when no harm occurs.  Viewed in the light of the broad
scope of potential liability under s. 218  of the Criminal Code , the
requirement for subjective fault serves an important purpose of ensuring that
the reach of the criminal law does not extend too far.  While the conduct and
people that fall within s. 218  are broadly defined, the requirement for
subjective fault ensures that only those with a guilty mind are punished.

                    The
words “abandon”, “expose” and “wilful” all suggest a subjective fault
requirement.  The first two of these words involve more than just leaving a
child alone or failing to take care of it: they denote awareness of the risk
involved and, as defined in s. 214  of the Criminal Code , they
suggest a requirement for knowledge of the consequences flowing from the
prohibited acts of abandonment or exposure.  As for the word “wilful”, it is
used only in the non‑exhaustive definition of the words “abandon” and
“expose” in relation to omissions, and a wilful omission is the antithesis of a
crime involving a mere failure to act in accordance with some minimum level of
behaviour.  Likewise, the use of the word “likely” in both ss. 214  and 218 
does not suggest an objective fault requirement given that it is simply aimed
at criminalizing the creation of risk.

                    Conversely,
what is absent from the text of s. 218  of the Criminal Code  and the
broader scheme in which it appears strongly suggest that subjective fault is
required.  The text of the child abandonment provision does not contain any of
the language typically employed by Parliament when it intends to create an
offence of objective fault.  The prohibition applies to everyone, not just to a
particular group engaged in a regulated activity or standing in a particular,
defined relationship with the alleged victim.  Nothing in the text suggests an
intention to impose a minimum and uniform standard of care.  There are no
references in the text to “dangerous”, “careless” or “reasonable” conduct or
any requirement to take “reasonable precautions”.  There is no predicate
offence and no actual harm is required by the provision, and it does not
create, define or impose a duty to do anything other than in the sense that all
criminal offences could be considered to create a duty not to commit them.  While
failure to perform a duty imposed by law on persons in particular relationships
is the essence of the necessaries of life offence created by s. 215 , this
is not at all the case with respect to the child abandonment offence under
s. 218 .

                    The
text, context and purpose of s. 218  of the Criminal Code  show that
subjective fault is required. It follows that the trial judge did not err in
acquitting the respondent on the basis that this subjective fault requirement
had not been proved.  The Court of Appeal was correct to uphold the acquittal.

                    Per
Rothstein and Moldaver JJ.: Section 218  is child protection
legislation.  It targets three limited classes of people faced with a situation
where a child under 10 is or is likely to be at risk of death or permanent
injury.  A common sense approach dictates that the offence is duty‑based
and that penal negligence is the level of fault required to establish guilt as
regards the proscribed consequences.  Further support for this view is found in
a review of the provision’s language, its placement in the Criminal Code ,
relevant scholarly opinion, its legislative evolution and history and the
gravity and social stigma associated with the offence.

                    Once
it is accepted that in enacting s. 218  Parliament intended to guard
against dangerous conduct that any reasonable person would foresee is likely to
endanger a child’s life or expose it to permanent injury, common sense suggests
that Parliament would not provide accused persons with a host of defences based
on their individual characteristics.  Doing so would effectively defeat the provision’s
purpose of imposing a societal minimum standard of conduct, since crimes of
subjective fault require an assessment of personal characteristics to the
extent that they tend to prove or disprove an element of the offence.

                    The
recognition that s. 218  sweeps within its ambit persons who are already
duty‑bound to protect a child leads to the central difficulty with
holding that s. 218  is, in its entirety, a subjective mens rea offence. 
If the great bulk of people to whom the provision applies have a pre‑existing
and ongoing legal duty to take charge of children who fall below the age of 10,
it hardly seems reasonable that they should be judged against a subjective mens
rea standard when the very same people who run afoul of the duty‑based
provision next door (s. 215 (failure to provide necessaries)) are judged
on a penal negligence standard in light of this Court’s decision in R. v.
Naglik, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 122.  The result would be a double standard — an
objective standard under s. 215 and a subjective standard under s. 218  —
for provisions that serve similar, if not identical, purposes.

                    Section 218 
can be read purposefully and harmoniously, such that it applies only to persons
who are cloaked with a duty, whether pre‑existing and ongoing or
situational, to protect a particular child under the age of 10 from death or
permanent injury, all of whom are properly subject to an objective
standard with respect to the consequences element of s. 218 .  The s. 214 
definition should be restricted in scope as applying only to persons falling
into the following three categories: (1) those with a pre‑existing
and ongoing legal duty to the child; (2) those who come to the aid of the
child who is or is likely to be at risk of death or permanent injury, and; (3) those
who actually place the child in that situation.  Interpreting the scope of
s. 218  in this way goes a long way toward addressing concerns about the
broad scope of potential liability under the provision.

                    Section 218 
finds its place in Part VIII of the Criminal Code  under the heading
“Duties Tending to Preservation of Life”.  It is one of two offences located
under that heading — the other being s. 215 .  This provides some
indication that Parliament intended that s. 218  be construed as a duty‑based
offence.  It seems anomalous that Parliament would insert a non‑duty‑based
offence into a thicket of duty‑related provisions.  The scenario becomes
even more remarkable when one appreciates that s. 218  is concerned with
inherently dangerous conduct that places or is likely to place the lives and
safety of helpless young children at risk.  This is the very type of situation
which requires a societal minimum standard of conduct and calls out for a
standard of fault based on objective foreseeability.  Likewise, the plain
language of s. 218  — supported by the place of situational duties in
Canadian criminal law, the offence’s placement among other duty‑based
provisions in the Criminal Code  and the scholarship on s. 218  —
leads to the conclusion that the offence of child abandonment is duty‑based.

                    The
legislative history of s. 218  further supports the conclusion that the
fault element for s. 218  is penal negligence.  The provision has never
included words of subjective intention, as confirmed by the early English interpretation
of the offence.  Furthermore, neither the social stigma associated with it nor
the gravity of the offence of child abandonment require it to be treated
differently than its sister provision s. 215 (failure to provide
necessaries), where penal negligence was found to be the requisite fault
element.

                    Under
a penal negligence standard, a mistake of fact that is both honest and
reasonable affords a complete defence.  Thus, an objective mens rea
standard does not punish the morally blameless.  In the present
circumstances, the trial judge found that the respondent honestly believed that
her child was dead at birth and that this belief was objectively reasonable. 
As such, she was entitled to be acquitted based on the defence of honest and
reasonable mistake of fact.

I.    Overview and Issue

[1]                             
Criminal offences generally consist of
prohibited conduct (the actus reus) which is committed with a required
element of fault (the mens rea). This appeal concerns the offence of
child abandonment under s. 218  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c.
C-46  (“Code ”). The provision prohibits abandoning or exposing a
child under the age of 10 years so that the child’s life is (or is likely to
be) endangered, or its health is (or is likely to be) permanently injured. (The
full text of the provision is found in the Appendix.) The question on appeal
concerns the fault element of the offence: Is the fault element to be assessed
subjectively or objectively?  

[2]                             
The issue arises out of a heart-rending story
which, fortunately, has a happy ending. The respondent, not previously knowing
that she was pregnant, gave birth to a baby boy while using the toilet in a
Wal-Mart store.  Thinking the child was dead, she cleaned up as best she could
and left, leaving the child in the toilet. The child was in fact alive, was
quickly attended to by others and, by all reports, is now a healthy little boy.
The trial judge believed the respondent’s claim that she was not aware of her
pregnancy until the child appeared and that she believed the child was dead
when she left him. Thus, whether the fault element is assessed according to
what the respondent actually knew or by what a reasonable person would have
known and done is an important issue in this case. 

[3]                             
In general terms, when a fault element is
assessed subjectively, the focus is on what the accused actually knew: Did the
accused know that abandoning the child would put the child’s life or health at
risk? If, as the respondent believed, the child was dead when she abandoned
him, she would not know that her abandonment of him risked putting his life or
health at risk. Again to speak generally, when assessed objectively, the focus
is not on what the accused actually knew, but on whether a reasonable person in
those circumstances would have seen the risk and whether the accused’s conduct
is a marked departure from what a reasonable person would have done. If a court
were persuaded that a reasonable person would have seen the risk of abandoning
the child in these circumstances and concluded that the accused’s conduct was a
marked departure from that expected of a reasonable person, the fault element
would be established even though the accused in fact did not see the risk.

[4]                             
It follows that the issue for decision is this:

•           Does s. 218 of the Code  require proof that the
accused knew that the acts of alleged abandonment or exposure of a child were
such that the abandoned child’s life was or was likely to be endangered or his
or her health permanently injured, as the respondent contends? Or, as the appellant
Crown contends, is the fault element established by proof that the accused’s
conduct constituted a marked departure from that expected of a reasonable
person in the same circumstances and that the risk to the child’s life or
health would have been a foreseeable result by such a person?

[5]                             
As I will explain, I agree with the respondent
that the trial judge and the majority judges of the Court of Appeal were
correct to require subjective fault.  I would therefore dismiss the Crown’s
appeal.

II.  Facts and Proceedings

A.  Overview of the Facts

[6]                             
On May 21, 2007, users of the washroom at a
Wal-Mart store discovered a puddle of blood on the floor of one of the stalls
and heard the sounds of a young woman who we know now to have been the
respondent struggling inside. The customers alerted the store staff, but when
an assistant manager asked the young woman if she was all right, she responded
from inside the stall that she was fine.

[7]                             
Shortly thereafter, a customer reported that she
had discovered a baby’s arm sticking out of the toilet bowl of the stall where
the young woman had been. Other customers had seen the baby by that point, but
all of them thought it was dead. When the store manager went into the bathroom
to see what was happening, he observed that the baby’s leg had started
twitching. He pulled the baby out of the toilet. An emergency response team was
called and the baby, A.J.H., was transported to the hospital where he was
successfully resuscitated and found to be completely healthy. 

[8]                             
Police gave video surveillance tapes of the
store to various media outlets and the respondent was eventually identified as
the woman seen entering and leaving the washroom at the time in question. When
contacted by police, she cooperated fully and confirmed that she was the mother
of the child. She was charged with unlawfully abandoning a child under the age
of 10 years and thereby endangering his life contrary to s. 218  of the Code .

[9]                             
At her trial, the respondent testified. She was
22 years of age by that time and was living with her boyfriend and their baby,
S.K. Prior to the birth of A.J.H., she had been gaining weight and so she had
taken three home pregnancy tests, all of which were negative. She did not
believe she was pregnant because she had been getting her period every month
prior to the birth. When she arrived at the Wal-Mart store, she was not feeling
well and so she went to the bathroom, where she gave birth a minute or two
later. She was surprised by the birth. She did not try to pick the baby up
because it was all blue and she thought it was dead. She did not respond to
offers for help or tell anyone what had happened because she was afraid. She
tried to clean up the blood on the floor and then returned to her friend’s car.


[10]                         
When she heard the police were looking for her,
the respondent told her mother she was the one that had given birth to the baby
in the store. When she found out the baby was alive, she was eager to see him. He
now lives with the respondent’s mother and the respondent visits him almost
every day. A.D.H. testified that it took her five or six months to realize that
she was pregnant with her second child, S.K.

B.     Court of Queen’s Bench, 2009 SKQB 261, 335 Sask. R. 173 (Gabrielson J.)

[11]                         
The trial judge noted that the respondent
acknowledged that she had left her child in the toilet at the Wal-Mart store,
thereby committing the actus reus of the s. 218  offence.  As for the
fault element, the trial judge decided that subjective fault was required. He
therefore expressed the issue he had to decide as follows: “. . . whether the
accused . . . intended to abandon the child, A.J.H., or did so recklessly with
full knowledge of the facts and circumstances or was wilfully blind in respect
to them” (para. 15).

[12]                         
The trial judge answered this question in the
negative and found that the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that
the respondent intended to abandon her child (paras. 23-26). The accused had
been credible in her testimony. She had not known she was pregnant and truly
believed she had delivered a dead child. Her fear and confusion explained her
subsequent behaviour. The trial judge also relied on the evidence of Dr.
Simpson, who testified that, “[u]nder these circumstances of an unknown
pregnancy and a premature, precipitous birth, it is understandable that the
accused thought the child was not alive and that she would be scared or
panicked, not request help and immediately leave the scene of the birth” (para.
24). Thus, the trial judge found the respondent not guilty and dismissed the
charge (para. 26).

C.     Court
of Appeal, 2011 SKCA 6, 366 Sask. R. 123
(Richards, Smith and Ottenbreit JJ.A.)

[13]                         
Richards J.A. (Smith J.A. concurring) agreed
with the trial judge that s. 218  of the Code  requires subjective fault.  He
supported his conclusion with a detailed analysis of the text and context of
the provision.  On the other hand, Ottenbreit J.A. concluded that s. 218  only
requires an objective fault element, but that an honest and reasonable mistake
of fact could be a defence.  He found that the respondent had acted on the
basis of the mistaken but reasonable belief that her child was dead and
concluded that the trial judge’s verdict of acquittal should be upheld on that
basis.

III.    Brief Summary of the Positions
of the Parties

[14]                         
The appellant Crown submits that the fault
element of the child abandonment offence should be assessed “objectively”
according to what has been called the “penal negligence” standard, whereas the
respondent submits that the fault element should be assessed subjectively,
adopting the position taken by the trial judge and a majority of the Court of
Appeal.

[15]                         
In this case, a penal negligence standard means
that the Crown must prove two things to establish the fault element:  first,
that the risk to the child resulting from the respondent’s acts would have been
foreseeable by a reasonable person in the same circumstances and, second, that
her conduct was a marked departure from the conduct expected of a reasonable
person in those circumstances. Penal negligence is the fault element that
applies to the offence of failing to provide a child with the necessaries of
life under s. 215  of the Code  and the Crown submits that the same
standard of fault should apply here. 

[16]                         
On the other hand, a subjective standard means,
in the context of an offence under s. 218  of the Code , that the fault
element requires proof at least of recklessness, in other words that the
accused persisted in a course of conduct knowing of the risk which it
created.  Subjective fault, of course, may also refer to other states of
mind. It includes intention to bring about certain consequences; actual knowledge
that the consequences will occur; or wilful blindness — that is, knowledge of the need to inquire
as to the consequences and deliberate failure to do so. But here, the element
of risk (“is likely to”) is part of the definition of the prohibited
consequences: the prohibited consequences under s. 218  are that the child’s
life “is or is likely to be” endangered or its health “is or is likely to be”
permanently injured.  It is because the definition of the offence
incorporates the notion of risk to life or health that a subjective fault
element would require the Crown to show at least recklessness, that is, that
the accused actually knew of the risk to the child’s life or health. (Wilful blindness
would also suffice, but was not argued in this case. I also note that
self-induced intoxication is not relevant here and was not argued. I do not
find it either necessary or desirable to speculate about the various issues
that would arise if it were raised in the context of this general intent
offence. Simply by way of example, one would have to consider among other
things issues such as whether the ratio of R. v. Daviault, [1994]
3 S.C.R. 63, applies, whether its application would or should be any different
depending on whether the offence requires subjective or objective fault and
whether the child abandonment offence falls within the exclusion from the
self-induced intoxication defence set out in s. 33.1(3)  of the Code  relating
to offences that include as an element any interference or threat of
interference by a person with the bodily integrity of another person.)    

[17]                         
The respondent also submits, in the alternative,
that even if the required fault element is objective, the appeal should
nonetheless be dismissed because she acted on the basis of a reasonable mistake
of fact, that is, that the child was dead when she left him.  I do not need to
address this submission as I conclude that the fault element is subjective and
therefore that the trial judge did not err in acquitting the respondent on the
basis that the fault element had not been proved.

IV.    Analysis

A.     Introduction

[18]                         
This Court has never addressed the fault element
for the child abandonment offence and the relatively scant jurisprudence in
other courts is inconclusive on this issue.  Some cases have applied a
subjective standard of fault: R. v. L.M., [2000] O.J. No. 5284 (QL) (Ct.
J.), at para. 49; R. v. C.C.D., [1998] O.J. No. 4875 (QL) (Ct. J. (Prov.
Div.)), at paras. 24-30; R. v. Reedy (No. 2) (1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 104
(Ont. D.C.J.C.C.), at pp. 106-8. Others have either applied an objective
standard or been unclear about the standard: R. v. McIntosh, [2008] O.J.
No. 5742 (QL) (Ct. J.), at paras. 32-33; R. v. Bokane-Haraszt, 2007 ONCJ
228 (CanLII), at paras. 25-26; R. v. Christiansen, [1997] O.J. No. 5733
(QL) (Ct. J. (Prov. Div.)), at paras. 8 and 18-19; R. v. R. (J.), 2000
CarswellOnt 5325 (Ct. J.).

[19]                         
Given that existing case law does not settle the
question, our task is to “discern the intent of Parliament, having regard to
the purpose of the section and the applicable principles of statutory
construction”: R. v. Gosset, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 76, at p. 89. We must,
therefore, read the words of the statute in their entire context, in their
grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the statute, its
objective and the intention of Parliament: Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re),
[1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at p. 41 (quoting E. Driedger, Construction of Statutes
(2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87).

B.     Statutory Interpretation and Fault Requirements

[20]                         
Discerning parliamentary intent in relation to
the fault element of crimes is often not an easy task.  Offences that have long
been held to have subjective fault requirements do not expressly say so and
even when Parliament decides to expressly set out fault requirements, it does
not use language consistently:  M. Manning and P. Sankoff, Manning, Mewett
& Sankoff: Criminal Law (4th ed. 2009), at pp. 148-49.  As a
result, the courts must, and often do, infer the fault element: see, e.g.,  Pappajohn
v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120, per Dickson J. (as he then was),
at p. 146; Sweet v. Parsley, [1970] A.C. 132 (H.L.), per Lord
Reid, at p. 148; K. Roach, Criminal Law (5th ed.  2012), at
pp. 163-64. 

[21]                         
In my view, this is such a case.  The text of
the provision does not expressly set out a fault requirement, but the text read
in light of its full context supports the conclusion that subjective fault is
required.  I will begin my analysis by touching on an important presumption of
parliamentary intent that applies here and then turn to the purpose, text and
scheme of the provision.  In the course of that analysis, I will explain why,
in my opinion, the Crown’s position that this is an offence of penal negligence
must be rejected.

C.     The Broader Context

[22]                         
I will review three elements of the broader
context of the child abandonment provision: the presumption of legislative
intent in favour of subjective fault, the provision’s legislative evolution and
finally its purpose.

1.     Presumed
Legislative Intent

[23]                         
An important part of the context in which we
must interpret s. 218  is the presumption that Parliament intends crimes to have
a subjective fault element.  The Court has stated and relied on this
interpretative principle on many occasions:  see, e.g., Watts v. The Queen,
[1953] 1 S.C.R. 505, at p. 511; R. v. Rees, [1956] S.C.R. 640, at p.
652; Beaver v. The Queen, [1957] S.C.R. 531, at pp. 542-43; R. v.
Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, at pp. 1303 and 1309-10;  R. v.
Prue, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 547, at pp. 551 and 553; R. v. Bernard, [1988]
2 S.C.R. 833, at p. 871; R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 633, at p. 645;
R. v. Théroux, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 5, at p. 18;  R. v. Lucas, [1998]
1 S.C.R. 439, at para. 64. Perhaps the classic statement is that of Dickson J. (as
he then was) for the Court in Sault Ste. Marie:

In the case of true crimes
there is a presumption that a person should not be held liable for the
wrongfulness of his act if that act is without mens rea . . . . 

 

 . .
. Where the offence is criminal, the Crown must establish a mental element,
namely, that the accused who committed the prohibited act did so intentionally
or recklessly, with knowledge of the facts constituting the offence, or with
wilful blindness toward them. Mere negligence is excluded from the concept of the
mental element required for conviction. Within the context of a criminal
prosecution a person who fails to make such enquiries as a reasonable and
prudent person would make, or who fails to know facts he should have known, is
innocent in the eyes of the law. [Citations omitted; pp. 1303 and 1309-10.]

[24]                         
Notwithstanding these many statements, the Crown
in effect submits that there is no such presumption of legislative intent
because it has not always been applied. The Crown notes that there are many
offences in the Code  that do not require subjective fault and further
that there is no absolute rule requiring complete symmetry between the fault
element and the prohibited consequences of the offence. In my view, however,
these points do not negate the existence of the presumption of legislative
intent. They show merely that the presumption does not invariably determine the
outcome of a full contextual and purposive interpretation of a particular
provision.

[25]                         
Presumptions of legislative intent are not
self-applying rules. They are instead principles of interpretation. They do
not, on their own, prescribe the outcome of interpretation, but rather set out
broad principles that ought to inform it. As Professor Sullivan has observed,
presumptions of legislative intent, such as this one, serve as a way in which
the courts recognize and incorporate important values into the legal context in
which legislation is drafted and should be interpreted.  These values both
inform judicial understanding of legislation and play an important role in
assessing competing interpretations: R. Sullivan, Sullivan and Driedger on
the Construction of Statutes (4th ed. 2002), at p. 365. 

[26]                         
Professor Côté has described how these
presumptions may inform the legal context in which legislation is drafted.  He
put it this way:  “In some sense, presumptions of intent form part of the
enactment’s context, as they reflect ideas which can be assumed to have been both
present in the mind of the legislature and sufficiently current as to render
their explicit mention unnecessary”: P.-A. Côté, in collaboration with S.
Beaulac and M. Devinat, The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (4th
ed. 2011), at p. 470; see also R. Cross, Statutory Interpretation (3rd
ed. 1995), by J. Bell and G. Engle, at pp. 165-67, and K. Roach, “Common
Law Bills of Rights as Dialogue Between Courts and Legislatures” (2005), 55 U.T.L.J.
733. Parliament must be understood to know that this presumption will likely be
applied unless some contrary intention is evident in the legislation.

[27]                         
As for the role of the presumption of subjective
fault in assessing competing interpretations, it sets out an important value
underlying our criminal law. It has been aptly termed one of the “presumptive principles
of criminal justice”: R. v. Beatty, 2008 SCC 5, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, per
Charron J., at paras. 22-23. While the presumption must — and often does — give way to clear expressions of a
different legislative intent, it nonetheless incorporates an important value in
our criminal law, that the morally innocent should not be punished. This has
perhaps never been better expressed than it was by Dickson J. in Pappajohn,
at pp. 138-39:

There rests
now, at the foundation of our system of criminal justice, the precept that a
man cannot be adjudged guilty and subjected to punishment, unless the
commission of the crime was voluntarily directed by a willing mind. . . . 
Parliament can, of course, by express words, create criminal offences for which
a guilty intention is not an essential ingredient.  Equally, mens rea is
not requisite in a wide category of statutory offences which are concerned with
public welfare, health and safety.  Subject to these exceptions, mens rea,
consisting of some positive states of mind, such as evil intention, or
knowledge of the wrongfulness of the act, or reckless disregard of consequences,
must be proved by the prosecution.

[28]                         
Viewed in this way, the presumption of subjective fault is not an
outdated rule of construction which is at odds with the modern approach to
statutory interpretation repeatedly endorsed by the Court. On the contrary, the
presumption forms part of the context which the modern approach requires to be
considered. 

[29]                         
As I will explain, there is nothing in the text
or context of the child abandonment offence to suggest that Parliament intended
to depart from requiring subjective fault. In fact, the text, scheme and
purpose of the provision support the view that subjective fault is required. To
the extent that Parliament’s intent is unclear, the presumption of subjective
fault ought to have its full operation in this case. 

                    2.     Legislative Evolution

[30]                         
Legislative evolution and history may often be
important parts of the context within which to conduct the modern approach to
statutory interpretation: Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v.
Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 53, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 471, at para. 43.
The Crown has been diligent in providing us with a detailed picture of the
English origins and Canadian evolution of what is now s. 218 .  I will touch on
this only briefly, however, because as I see it, this information sheds little
real light on the issue at hand.

[31]                         
It seems that from the beginning, there were two
strands of prohibitions, one addressing abandoning or exposing a child to risk
to its life or health and the other in relation to the breach of a duty by people
in certain relationships to provide the necessaries of life. 

[32]                         
The origin of the abandonment offence appears to
be in the English The Offences against the Person Act, 1861, 24
& 25 Vict., c. 100, s. 27, which created the misdemeanor of unlawfully
abandoning or exposing any child under the age of two “whereby the life of such
child shall be endangered, or the health of such child shall have been or shall
be likely to be permanently injured”. The early case law is unclear as to
whether subjective or objective fault was required although there is some
support for the view that subjective fault is required:  see, e.g., R. v.
White (1871), L.R. 1 C.C.R. 311, per Bovill C.J., at p. 313, and per
Blackburn J., at p. 314. 

[33]                         
The necessaries offence appears to have its
origins in the English The Poor Law Amendment Act, 1868, 31 & 32
Vict., c. 122.  Section 37 of that Act made it an offence for any parent to
“wilfully neglect to provide adequate food, clothing, medical aid, or lodging
for his child, being in his custody, under the age of fourteen years, whereby
the health of such child shall have been or shall be likely to be seriously
injured”.  The fault element for this offence appears
to have been objective: R. v. Downes (1875), 1 Q.B.D. 25, per
Bramwell B., at p. 30.

[34]                         
The two offences appear to have come closer
together in England with the enactment of s. 1 of the Prevention of Cruelty
to, and Protection of, Children Act, 1889, 52 & 53 Vict., c. 44, a
provision that replaced s. 37 of The Poor Law Amendment Act, 1868.
(The latter provision was repealed by s. 18 of the 1889 Act.) Section 1 made it
a misdemeanor for anyone over 16 who had the custody, control, or charge of a
boy under 14 or a girl under 16 to “wilfully” ill-treat, neglect, abandon or
expose such child in a manner likely to cause such child unnecessary suffering
or injury to its health. Again, the fault element is not very clear. In R.
v. Senior, [1899] 1 Q.B. 283, the court approved jury instructions that
seemed to describe both an objective and a subjective requirement. 

[35]                         
In Canada, the abandonment offence and the
necessaries of life offence have been kept distinct. The child abandonment
offence was first enacted in 1869: An Act respecting Offences against the
Person, S.C. 1869, c. 20, s. 26.  The offence of failing to provide the
necessaries of life was found in s. 25 of the same Act, and applied to
individuals who were “legally liable” towards others.  From 1869 to 1892, the
child abandonment offence did not include any reference to duty: An Act
respecting Offences against the Person (1869), s. 26; An Act respecting
Offences against the Person, R.S.C. 1886, c. 162, s. 20. Thus, the
provision’s early legislative evolution shows clearly that it was not conceived
of as a duty-based offence, and suggests that a subjective intent was required.

[36]                         
In 1892, both offences were included in the
first Code  (The Criminal Code, 1892, S.C. 1892, c. 29).
The abandonment offence was found in s. 216 while the necessaries offence was
found in ss. 209 to 211. The abandonment offence was then similar to the
current provision.  It applied, however, only to children under two and
required actual danger to life or permanent injury to health as opposed to the
risk of those things occurring as under the current provision.  A
non-exhaustive definition of “abandon” and “expose” was added in 1892. For the
first time, a reference to duty was added, but only in the context of
omissions. The definition provided that “abandon” and “expose” included “a wilful
omission to take charge of the child on the part of a person legally bound to
do so”. 

[37]                         
The non-exhaustive definition added in 1892 also
included “any mode of dealing with [the child] calculated to leave it
exposed to risk without protection”.  While I would not attach much weight to
the use of the word “calculated”, I note that, if anything, it suggests a
subjective fault requirement.  This is consistent with the fact that the
English case of White, mentioned earlier, appears to have required
subjective fault for the English equivalent of the abandonment offence. In
1954, the words “calculated to” were replaced by “likely to” in the
non-exhaustive definition so that the provision read as it does today: Criminal
Code, S.C. 1953-54, c. 51, s. 185. I would not attach much weight to this
amendment. The Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed. 1989) suggests that,
particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, “calculated to” and “likely to”
could be used as synonyms. In any event, both “calculated to” and “likely to”
are consistent with legislative intent to require subjective fault, albeit
“calculated to” could be viewed as requiring specific intent, while “likely to”
suggests that general intent is required.

[38]                         
All things considered, my view is that the
legislative evolution of the child abandonment offence is, if anything, more
supportive than not of the view that subjective fault is required.

3.      Purpose
and Breadth of the Offence

[39]                         
There is no doubt that the purpose of the
abandonment offence is the protection of children from risk even when no harm
occurs.  Prior to the enactment of the offence of child abandonment in 1861,
the offence required actual harm: R. v. Renshaw (1847), 2 Cox C.C. 285; R.
v. Hogan (1851), 2 Den. 277. The new crime of child abandonment filled a
perceived gap by punishing those who placed children in positions of risk: R.
v. Falkingham (1870), L.R. 1 C.C.R. 222; White. 

[40]                         
It follows that the scope of potential liability
under s. 218  of the Code  is very broad, encompassing a wide range of
persons and conduct. Liability is not restricted to those who are related to
the child, or who have any duties in relation to the child or even to those who
are in charge of the child at the time. In addition, a very wide range of
conduct falls within the words “abandon” and “expose”. These are broad words
that are not exhaustively defined under the Code . 

[41]                         
Viewed in the light of the broad scope of
potential liability under s. 218  of the Code , the requirement for
subjective fault serves an important purpose of ensuring that the reach of the
criminal law does not extend too far.                    While the conduct and
people that fall within s. 218  of the Code  are broadly defined, the
requirement for subjective fault ensures that only those with a guilty mind are
punished.

D.     The Text of the Provisions

[42]                         
The text of the provisions is found in the
Appendix. There are three main points which emerge from a careful study of the
text and scheme of these provisions.  First, the words “abandon”, “expose” and
“wilful” suggest a subjective fault requirement.  Second, the use of the word
“likely” in this context does not suggest an objective fault requirement.
Third, what is absent from the text of s. 218   of the Code  and the
broader scheme in which it appears strongly suggest that subjective fault is
required.

                    1.     “Abandon”, “Expose” and “Wilful”
Suggest Subjective Fault

[43]                         
The words “abandon” and “expose” are not given an
exhaustive definition in s. 214  the Code  and therefore their ordinary
grammatical meanings remain relevant to their interpretation. Both words
suggest actions taken with knowledge of their consequences. The Oxford
Dictionary of English (2nd ed. rev. 2005), for example, defines
“abandon” as “cease to support or look after (someone);
desert”.

[44]                         
The same dictionary defines “expose” (in the
sense of “expose someone to”) as “cause someone to be vulnerable
or at risk” or “leave (a child) in the open to die”.

[45]                         
The definition of “desert” is also helpful: “[A]bandon (a person, cause, or organization) in a way considered
disloyal or treacherous . . . .” 

[46]                         
I agree with Richards J.A. that the words
“abandon” and “expose” on their face, and standing alone, are indicative of
subjective fault: C.A., at para. 59. They involve more than just leaving a
child alone or failing to take care of it: they denote awareness of the risk
involved. This view is also perfectly consistent with the statutory
non-exhaustive definition of “abandon” or “expose” in s. 214  of the Code  which,
as noted earlier, suggests a requirement for knowledge of the consequences
flowing from the prohibited acts of abandonment or exposure.  This is also
reflected in the jurisprudence.  As noted in L.M., abandon means
“leaving the child to its fate” which suggests an act accompanied by knowledge
of or recklessness as to the consequences: paras. 28 and 47; see also, e.g., R.
v. Boulden (1957), 41 Cr. App. R. 105 , at p. 110; Re Davis (1909),
18 O.L.R. 384, at p. 387.  This is one of the factors that led the court in Reedy
(No. 2), to imply a subjective fault requirement (p. 107). 

[47]                         
The Crown, in support of its position that the
fault element is objective, argued that the non-exhaustive definition of
“abandon” and “expose” included in the Code  in 1892 (now in s. 214 )
likely came from the English decisions of Falkingham and White.
While those cases may well be the origin of the Code  definition, this
does not advance the Crown’s position.  In both cases, there was evidence of
subjective fault. In White, there was clear evidence that the accused
intentionally and knowingly abandoned and exposed the child and was aware of
the risk. In Falkingham, there was evidence of at least recklessness or
wilful blindness: a mother, with the knowledge and connivance of another woman
who was also charged with child abandonment, had put her child in a hamper and
sent it by train to the child’s father without indicating to the railway
employees that a child was in the package.  The accused had been cautious in
“packaging” the child, the mother indicated to the railway clerk to be very
careful with it and wrote on the hamper “with care, to be delivered
immediately” (p. 223). This indicated awareness of the risk. 

[48]                         
What emerges from both the ordinary meaning and
the non-exhaustive statutory definition of the words “abandon” and “expose” is
the notion of awareness of or recklessness in relation to risk.

[49]                         
That brings me to the word “wilful” found in the
s. 214  definition of the terms “abandon” and “expose”.  Richards J.A. for the
majority of the Court of Appeal placed considerable weight on s. 214 ’s use of
the word “wilful” in concluding that subjective fault was required. The word
“wilful” is often (although not always) a strong indication that intention is
required: see, e.g., the discussion in R. v. Buzzanga (1979), 25 O.R.
(2d) 705 (C.A.), at pp. 715-17; R. v. L.B.,  2011 ONCA 153, 274
O.A.C. 365, at paras. 108-9, leave to appeal refused, [2011] 3 S.C.R. x;  Manning,
Mewett & Sankoff: Criminal Law, at pp. 149-50. While the word is used
here only in the non-exhaustive definition of the words “abandon” and “expose”
and only in relation to omissions, I agree with Richards J.A. that a wilful
omission is the antithesis of a crime involving a mere failure to act in accordance
with some minimum level of behaviour. If Parliament had meant to include in the
terms “abandon” and “expose” situations in which there is no more than a
failure to meet a standard of reasonable conduct, it would not make sense to
require that omissions to observe that standard would have to be “wilful”:  C.A.,
at paras. 66-67. 

2.      The
Word “Likely” Does Not Suggest Objective Fault 

[50]                         
Ottenbreit J.A., in deciding that only objective
fault was required, placed considerable weight on the use of the word “likely”
in the non-exhaustive definition of the terms “abandon” or “expose” in s. 214 :
para. (b) of definition —
that is, “dealing with a child in a manner that is likely to leave that child
exposed to risk”. As he put it, “[t]he terms ‘in a manner . . . likely . . .’ .
. .  speak of the societal rather than a personal standard of conduct” (para.
32). However, I do not think that the word “likely” in this context is an
indication of legislative intent to require only objective fault, for two
reasons.

[51]                         
The French version of the s. 214  definition uses
the terms “pouvant l’exposer” and the French version of the s. 218 
offence uses the terms “exposée à l’être”. The French wording suggests
that the focus is on the outcome of the conduct rather than on the standard of
care. This makes it clear that the English word “likely” serves the same
purpose. Moreover, as I have discussed, the purpose of the child abandonment
offence is to criminalize the creation of the risk of harm; it makes it an
offence to expose or abandon a child such that its life or health is put at
serious risk even if no harm actually results. This is consistent with the
well-established view that the criminal law may properly be aimed at preventing
the risk of serious harm: see, e.g., R. v. Keegstra, [1990]
3 S.C.R. 697, at p. 776; Lucas, at para. 83.  The word “likely”, as it
is used in both the s. 214  definition and in the offence provision itself (s.
218 ), is consistent with this preventive purpose. This purpose of criminalizing
the creation of a serious risk of harm is not at all inconsistent with a requirement
of subjective fault —
that is, actual knowledge of the risk of harm — as is clear from the Court’s decision in
Lucas. 

[52]                         
Lucas concerned
the fault element of publishing a defamatory libel under s. 300  of the Code .
A defamatory libel is defined in s. 298  to be a “matter published . . . that is
likely to injure the reputation of any person”.  The Court held that the fault
element of the offence requires proof that the accused knew that the published
material was defamatory, in other words, that it was “likely to injure the
reputation of any person”, per Cory J., at paras. 30 and 67-68. Thus,
the term “likely to injure the reputation” was found to require proof of
subjective fault, i.e. that the accused actually knew of the risk of injury to
reputation. 

[53]                         
I therefore conclude that the use of the word
“likely” in s. 214  (and s. 218 ) does not suggest an objective fault element; it
does not, as I see it, speak of a societal rather than a personal standard of
conduct.   As in Lucas, the use of the word “likely” is simply aimed at
criminalizing the creation of risk and, as in Lucas, the fault element
may require knowledge of that risk. 

                    3.      What Is Not
in the Text and the Scheme of the Code Suggest Subjective Fault

[54]                         
In my view, what is not in the text of
the provision and what surrounds it suggest that a subjective fault element
should be implied. 

                    (a)   What Is Not Found in the Text 

[55]                         
There is no doubt that Parliament can and does
create criminal offences that require objective rather than subjective fault.
How those provisions are drafted sheds some light on the sorts of language used
when that is the intent. As I see it, the text of the child abandonment
provision does not contain any of the language typically employed by Parliament
when it intends to create an offence of objective fault. 

[56]                         
I will briefly review five main types of
objective fault offences in the Code  in order to explain why, in my view,
a comparison of the way they are drafted with the text of s. 218  supports the
inference that the latter requires subjective fault. This will lead me to
explain why I reject the Crown’s position that penal negligence should apply to
the s. 218  offence because it applies to the s. 215  offence of failing to
provide the necessaries of life.

[57]                         
We come first to offences defined in terms of
dangerous conduct. In R. v. Hundal, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 867, the Court found
that the fault element of the offence of dangerous driving was a manner of
driving which constituted a “marked departure” from that expected of a
reasonable person in the same circumstances. (See also, more recently, Beatty
and R. v. Roy, 2012 SCC 26, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 60.) Several factors
justified adopting an objective rather than a subjective fault requirement:
driving is a regulated activity in which people choose to engage; driving is
automatic and reflexive in nature; and the text of the offence focuses on the
manner of driving, all of which suggest that the offence seeks to impose a
minimum uniform standard of care.  Cory J. noted, for example, that “[l]icensed
drivers choose to engage in the regulated activity of driving. They place
themselves in a position of responsibility to other members of the public
who use the roads”: Hundal, at p. 884 (emphasis added).  With respect to
the text of the provision, Cory J. observed that it creates an offence of
driving “in a manner that is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the
circumstances” and this suggests an objective standard: “The ‘manner of
driving’ can only be compared to a standard of reasonable conduct” (p. 885). So
in the case of dangerous driving both the text and nature of the provision, as
well as other factors, provided strong support for an objective fault element. 
None of those factors is present in the s. 218  offence.

[58]                         
Next, there are offences which are expressed in
terms of careless conduct, such as the careless storage of firearms.  In R.
v. Finlay, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 103, the Court concluded that the carelessness
targeted by the offence is not consistent with subjective fault.  The provision
required the Crown to establish that a firearm was used, carried, handled,
shipped or stored “in a careless manner or without reasonable precautions for
the safety of other persons”. The use of the word “careless” and the reference
to “reasonable precautions” were clear markers of objectively assessed fault (pp.
114-15). There is no similar language in s. 218 .

[59]                         
A third category relates to so-called predicate
offences. These are offences such as unlawful act manslaughter and unlawfully
causing bodily harm which require the commission of an underlying unlawful
act.  They have been found to require the mental element for the underlying
offence but only objective foresight of harm flowing from it:  see, e.g., R.
v. DeSousa, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944 (unlawfully causing bodily harm); R. v.
Creighton, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3 (unlawful act manslaughter).  Without
reiterating the detailed reasons given in those cases, I simply underline that
these offences are ones in which the commission of the predicate or underlying
offence has actual and serious consequences. As Sopinka J. said in DeSousa
(at p. 967) and McLachlin J. repeated in Creighton (at p. 55): “The
implicit rationale of the law in this area is that it is acceptable to
distinguish between criminal responsibility for equally reprehensible acts on
the basis of the harm that is actually caused.” This rationale has no
application to s. 218 ; there is neither a predicate offence nor any need to
show that actual harm resulted from the conduct in the child abandonment
offence.

[60]                         
On that point, I note that at the court of
appeal level, the Crown suggested that the word “unlawfully” in s. 218  was
intended to imply that a violation of s. 215  constituted a predicate offence to
child abandonment. I disagree. Rather, I agree with Richards J.A. that the word
“unlawfully” in s. 218  is mere surplusage that was left from the original text
in An Act respecting Offences against the Person (1869), s. 26: see, e.g., R. v. Chartrand, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 864, at pp. 886-87. 
The commission of a s. 215  offence, or any other offence, is not required for
purposes of a child abandonment conviction. Section 218  has a broader
application than s. 215 , which only applies to specific individuals. To hold
that a conviction under s. 218  is dependent upon a conviction under s. 215 
would overlook the words “[e]very one” in s. 218 , would void para. (b)
of the s. 214  definition of meaning, and would render s. 218  redundant, as it
would serve the exact same purpose as s. 215 . Section 218  does not provide for
a greater sentence and therefore it is not merely an enhanced form of s. 215 ,
in the way that, for example, unlawfully causing bodily harm (s. 269, maximum
sentence of 10 years) is an enhanced version of assault (s. 266, maximum
sentence of 5 years). 

[61]                         
I should also refer to the offences based on
criminal negligence:  see, e.g., ss. 219, 220 and 221. Criminal negligence is
defined as conduct that “shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or
safety of other persons” (s. 219).  The text of this provision has fueled much
debate about the required fault element.  The use of the word “negligence” in
the name of the offence suggests an objectively defined standard consistent
with the meaning of the word “negligence” in the common law of torts.  On the
other hand, the words “wanton and reckless disregard” could be taken as
describing actual knowledge of the risk created by the conduct and therefore a
subjective fault element: see R. v. Anderson, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 265, at pp.
269-70. Ultimately, the Court decided that proof of intention or actual
foresight of a prohibited consequence is not required. Rather, criminal
negligence requires a marked and substantial departure from the conduct of a
reasonably prudent person in circumstances in which the accused either
recognized and ran an obvious and serious risk or, alternatively, gave no
thought to that risk:  R. v. J.F., 2008 SCC 60, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 215, at paras.
7-11. 

[62]                         
This approach to the fault element in the
criminal negligence offences does not in my view suggest that a similar,
objective fault approach should be taken to the child abandonment provision
that concerns us in this case.   Unlike the criminal negligence offences, the
s. 218  offence is not described as being concerned with conduct that is
governed by a community standard rather than an individual appreciation of the
circumstances.

[63]                         
I turn to a fifth and final category, one
strongly relied on by the Crown in its submissions.  That category consists of
the duty-based offence in s. 215  of the Code . Consideration of this
category and of this submission requires a closer look at the scheme of the Code 
and the Court’s decision in R. v. Naglik, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 122.

                    (b)     The Scheme of the Code  

[64]                         
Various legal duties are set out in ss. 215, 216,
217 and 217.1, including duties to provide the necessaries of life and to use
reasonable knowledge, skill and care in administering surgical or medical
treatment.  However, s. 215 is the only provision that creates an offence, that
of failing to provide the necessaries of life.  The Court in Naglik held
that this offence is one of objective fault and the Crown appellant submits
that the same reasoning should apply to the abandonment offence under s. 218 .

[65]                         
Respectfully, this submission is not persuasive.
The s. 215 offence is structured entirely differently than the s. 218  offence
that concerns us here and the reasoning of Naglik is not applicable to
the s. 218  offence. That reasoning in fact supports the view that subjective
fault is required in s. 218 . Finally, the different purposes served by both
offences also support that view.

[66]                         
Consider first the differences in the text of
the two provisions. Unlike the s. 218  child abandonment offence, the s. 215
necessaries of life offence considered in Naglik is defined in terms of
failure to perform specified legal duties. What is more, these specified legal
duties arise out of specified relationships between the person owing the duty
and the person to whom the duty is owed.  (The text of s. 215 is found in the
Appendix.)

[67]                         
The essence of the s. 215 offence, then, is that
it imposes legal duties arising out of defined relationships.  It is clear that
the decision in Naglik was based on that premise. Lamer C.J. writes, in Naglik:

With respect to the wording of s. 215,
while there is no language in s. 215 such as “ought to have known” indicating
that Parliament intended an objective standard of fault, the language of s. 215
referring to the failure to perform a “duty” suggests that the accused’s
conduct in a particular circumstance is to be determined on an objective, or
community, standard.  The concept of a duty indicates a societal minimum which
has been established for conduct:  as in the law of civil negligence, a duty
would be meaningless if every individual defined its content for him- or
herself according to his or her subjective beliefs and priorities.  Therefore,
the conduct of the accused should be measured against an objective, societal
standard to give effect to the concept of “duty” employed by Parliament. [p.
141]

[68]                         
The Crown submits that this reasoning applies
equally to s. 218  because that offence, too, may be committed by a person who
fails in a legal duty to take charge of a child. I do not accept this
position.  While failure to perform a duty imposed by law on persons in
particular relationships is the essence of the offence created by s. 215, this
is not at all the case with respect to child abandonment under s. 218 .  This is
why the reasoning of Naglik cannot apply to s. 218 . The child
abandonment offence may be committed by “[e]very one”; it is not restricted to
persons in particular relationships or under specified, statutorily created
legal duties. The concept of duty in the child abandonment offence becomes
relevant only in relation to an omission and is found in the non-exhaustive
definition of “abandon” or “expose”.  Those terms include “a wilful omission to
take charge of a child by a person who is under a legal duty to do so”: para. (a)
of the s. 214  definition.  In my opinion, the reference to “legal duty” in
relation to omissions in this section simply gives effect to the common law
principle that criminal responsibility generally does not arise from an
omission unless there is a pre-existing legal duty to act: see, e.g., Roach
(2012), at p. 115; D. Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law: A Treatise (6th ed.
2011), at p. 95. Therefore, the effect of the reference to duty in para. (a)
of the s. 214  definition is to ensure that the offence applies to omissions by
those with a legal duty towards a child.  However, the child abandonment
offence does not impose any such duties and people with no duty may be liable,
but only for positive acts captured, for example, by the words “dealing with”
in para. (b) of the s. 214  definition. 

[69]                         
The brief comments about the child abandonment
offence in both Stuart, at p. 96, and Roach (2012), at p. 116, do not support
the view that the fault element of the offence is objective.  Rather they point
out, as I have just discussed, that the concept of duty appears in this offence
only in relation to omissions. As for the Manning and Sankoff treatise, it
expresses the view the s. 218  offence is “entirely superfluous” (p. 826) — a conclusion with which I
disagree for the reasons I have already set out.  I note that some of the case
law cited by Manning and Sankoff involved parents who were convicted of child
abandonment for having knowingly left their child in risky
circumstances: p. 827, notes 155-56; Christiansen, at para. 8; R. v.
Holzer (1988), 63 C.R. (3d) 301 (Alta. Q.B.), at p. 303.

[70]                         
 Further, it seems to me that the clearly
different structures of the text of s. 218  on one hand, and the duty-based
offence in s. 215 on the other, support the view that the s. 218  offence is
different. Where Parliament intended to base an offence on violation of a duty,
s. 215 shows that it could find the language to do so clearly.  None of this
sort of language appears in s. 218 .

[71]                         
The distinct structure and wording of the child
abandonment offence also counter any suggestion that its placement in the same
part of the Code  with the sections creating legal duties (i.e. ss. 215 
to 217.1 ) informs the nature of the required fault element. The placement of a
provision within the Code  or the elements of other offences in the same
part of the Code  do not often assist in determining the nature of its
fault requirement and are particularly unhelpful here: see, e.g., Pappajohn,
at p. 146. While the provision is placed under the heading “Duties Tending
to Preservation of Life”, the marginal note of s. 218 , “Abandoning child” is
the only one of the five sections under this heading which does not have
the word “duty” in its marginal note. If anything, this tends to underline that
it is different from the other provisions.

[72]                         
The child abandonment offence has the same range
of possible punishments as does the objective fault offence of failing to
provide necessaries in s. 215. However, the range of punishments says little
about the required fault element. To take a stark example, criminal negligence
causing death, with a possible punishment of life in prison, has an objective
fault element requirement. Theft under five thousand dollars, which may be
prosecuted by summary conviction, is an offence not only requiring subjective
fault but specific intent.  I do not find any help in defining the fault
requirement of the child abandonment offence that other offences which may be
punished with the same or even greater periods of imprisonment require only
objective fault.

(c)     Conclusion on the Text of the Provision and Scheme of the
Code 

[73]                         
To sum up, none of the considerations that
persuaded the Court to adopt an objective fault standard in the categories of offences
I have just reviewed is present in the child abandonment offence under s. 218 .
The prohibition applies to everyone, not just to a particular group engaged in
a regulated activity or standing in a particular, defined relationship with the
alleged victim.  Nothing in the text suggests an intention to impose a minimum
and uniform standard of care.  There are no references in the text to
“dangerous”, “careless” or “reasonable” conduct or any requirement to take
“reasonable precautions”.  There is no predicate offence and no actual harm is
required by the provision. The provision does not create, define or impose a
duty to do anything other than in the sense that all criminal offences could be
considered to create a duty not to commit them.  

[74]                         
I conclude that both what is present in s. 218 
of the Code  and its related provisions and what is absent from it
strongly support the view that a subjective fault element is required. 

E.      Conclusion

[75]                         
In my view, the text, context and purpose of s.
218  of the Code  show that subjective fault is required. It follows that
the trial judge did not err in acquitting the respondent on the basis that this
subjective fault requirement had not been proved. The Court of Appeal was
correct to uphold the acquittal. 

V.     Disposition

[76]                         
I would dismiss the appeal. 

                    The reasons of Rothstein and
Moldaver JJ. were delivered by

                    Moldaver J. — 

I.    Introduction

[77]                         
Section 218  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1985, c. C-46  (“Code ”), makes it an offence to abandon or expose a child
under the age of 10 so that the child’s life is or is likely to be endangered
or its health is or is likely to be permanently injured.  The question
presented in this appeal concerns the mental element, or mens rea, that
applies to the proscribed consequences of abandonment or exposure, namely, the
risk of death or permanent injury to the child’s health.  Specifically, is
fault to be judged subjectively, which is to say, focusing on whether the
accused actually knew that abandoning the child would put its life or health in
danger?  Or is it to be judged objectively, focusing on whether a reasonable
person in the same circumstances would have known that abandoning the child
would put its life or health in danger?  Notwithstanding this crime’s ancient
lineage — and the vital purpose it serves in protecting the most vulnerable
among us — it is a question about which this Court has not spoken.

[78]                         
The facts and judgments below have been set out
by Cromwell J. for the majority, whose reasons I have had the opportunity of
reading.  Like the majority, I too would uphold the respondent’s acquittal, but
for reasons that differ from those of Justice Cromwell. 

[79]                         
My colleague concludes that s. 218  requires
subjective foreseeability of the consequences that follow or are likely to
follow upon the child being abandoned or exposed.  Under this approach, to
sustain a conviction, the Crown would be required to prove, among other things,
that upon abandoning or exposing the child, the accused foresaw that his or her
conduct placed or was likely to place the child at risk of death or permanent
injury, and went ahead anyway, reckless as to the consequences.  

[80]                         
Respectfully, I do not read the provision as
requiring such a high degree of fault in respect of the proscribed
consequences.  Nor do I believe that such an interpretation reflects
Parliament’s will.  

[81]                         
In its essence, s. 218  is child protection
legislation.  It seeks to protect a limited class of people (children under the
age of 10) from two defined risks (death or permanent injury) that occur or are
likely to occur from abandoning or exposing the child.  And, as I will explain,
the section is aimed at three limited classes of people faced with a situation
where a child under 10 is or is likely to be at risk of death or permanent
injury:  (1) those who have a pre-existing and an ongoing legal duty to take
charge of the child; (2) those who choose to come to the aid of the child in
that situation; and (3) those who place the child in that situation.

[82]                         
Construed this way, as I believe s. 218  is meant
to be, penal negligence is sufficient to satisfy the fault component of the
provision as it relates to the consequences of abandoning or exposing a child. 
To prove penal negligence, the Crown must establish that a reasonable person
would have foreseen that his or her conduct placed, or was likely to place, the
child at risk of death or permanent injury and that the accused’s conduct
constituted a marked departure from that expected of a reasonable person in the
circumstances. 

[83]                         
The recognized tools of statutory interpretation
support the conclusion that penal negligence is the requisite fault element for
the proscribed consequences in s. 218  of the Code .  In what follows, I
propose to canvass the plain language of the provision, its legislative
history, relevant scholarly opinion, and this Court’s precedents in an attempt
to establish as much.  But I also propose to rely on some common sense. 
Indeed, when one steps back from the mechanistic and often result-driven
application of the seemingly endless and at times contradictory tools of
statutory interpretation, common sense may, and generally will, prove to be the
best guide to statutory interpretation.  It certainly is here, as I will explain.

II.     Analysis

A.     Understanding the Elements of the Offence of Child
Abandonment

[84]                         
As with all offences, to secure a conviction
under s. 218 , the Crown must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the conduct
of the accused satisfies every element of the offence.  For convenience, I set
out the provision in its entirety: 

218. [Abandoning child] Every one
who unlawfully abandons or exposes a child who is under the age of ten years,
so that its life is or is likely to be endangered or its health is or is likely
to be permanently injured,

(a)     is guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five
years; or

(b)     is
guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction and liable to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding eighteen months.

Section 214  of the Code 
defines the words “abandon” and “expose” for the purposes of s. 218 , and
reads as follows:

214. In this Part,  

 

“abandon” or “expose”
includes

 

(a)
a wilful omission to take charge of a child by a person who is under a legal
duty to do so, and

 

(b)
dealing with a child in a manner that is likely to leave that child exposed to
risk without protection;

[85]                         
It bears noting that the offence under s. 218  is
not concerned with an act of abandonment or exposure in the abstract, or even
the act of abandoning or exposing any child.  Rather, it is concerned with an
act of abandoning or exposing a child under 10 so that the child is subject to
certain risks.  There are thus three distinct elements, as follows:

1.         an act
of abandonment or exposure, 

2.         of a
child under the age of 10,

3.         so that
the child’s life is or is likely to be endangered or its health is or is
likely to be permanently injured.

[86]                         
These three elements have been termed “acts”, “circumstances” and
“consequences”.  See D. Ormerod, Smith and Hogan’s Criminal Law (13th
ed. 2011), at p. 56.  The act — here, abandonment or exposure — speaks to the
conduct that, on its own or because of its consequences, the law seeks to
punish.  The circumstances — here, a child under 10 — bring more specificity to
the conduct by identifying certain facts or conditions that must be present. 
Finally, the consequences — here, the risk to the child’s life or health — are
the result that the law seeks to prevent.  Breaking an offence down into its
various parts is important because, as Professor Ormerod observes, “the law may
require different mental elements for the various constituents” (p. 56).  This
is true with respect to s. 218  and, for reasons I will explain, care must thus
be taken to distinguish between the act, its circumstances and its consequences
in assessing the requisite mens rea for the offence.

[87]                         
The mens rea of an offence “does not
exist in the air or in the abstract but must be related to certain consequences
or circumstances” (K. Roach, Criminal Law (5th ed. 2012), at p. 164). 
As a general rule, a mental element, whether subjective or objective, will
accompany each physical element of a crime, be it the act, its circumstances or
its consequences.  For example, as the third element in s. 218  requires that
the child’s life or health is or is likely to be placed at risk, absent an
exception to the rule, there must be an accompanying mental element of some
kind, whether subjective or objective, that addresses the accused’s state of
mind in respect of the risk to the child.

[88]                         
Furthermore, it is worth recalling that a
particular offence may well have some mental elements that are assessed
subjectively and others that are assessed objectively.  In R. v.
Hinchey, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1128, at para. 80, L’Heureux-Dubé J., for
the majority, refused to accept that “an offence must be either subjective or
objective with no possible middle ground”.  In her view,

the mens rea of a particular
offence is composed of the totality of its component fault elements.  The mere
fact that most criminal offences require some subjective component does
not mean that every element of the offence requires such a state of mind. 
[Emphasis in original; para. 80.]

With that point in mind,
one must be careful not to speak of a crime as requiring simply subjective or
objective mens rea.  Such conclusions “tel[l] only part of the story”,
and a “more precise approach” requires identifying each mental element in
relation to its coordinate physical element (Roach, at p. 164).  Accordingly,
the task before us is to identify the mental element for each of the
three physical elements of the offence of child abandonment — the act, the
circumstances and the consequences.

[89]                         
That brings me to the presumption that
Parliament intends crimes to have a subjective fault element.  My colleague
does a thorough analysis of the subject and concludes that

the presumption of subjective fault is
not an outdated rule of construction which is at odds with the modern approach
to statutory interpretation repeatedly endorsed by the Court.  On the contrary,
the presumption forms part of the context which the modern approach requires to
be considered.  [para. 28]

[90]                         
I do not take issue with that observation.  Care
must be taken, however, to keep the presumption in its proper perspective.  As
Morris Manning and Peter Sankoff observe in their treatise:

While
generally correct, even [the presumption of subjective mens rea] runs
the possibility of being misinterpreted.  Although subjective fault is clearly
the preferred standard, this has not always extended to every element of the
offence, and it is particularly controversial in relation to the mental
foresight required for particular consequences. [Emphasis added.]

 

(Manning,
Mewett & Sankoff: Criminal Law (4th ed. 2009), at p. 153)

[91]                         
The authors’ caution is well founded.  A line of
decisions from this Court, beginning with R. v. DeSousa, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944, have made clear that criminal
law may justifiably “distinguish between criminal responsibility for equally
reprehensible acts on the basis of the harm that is actually caused” (p. 967). 
Thus, for so-called “predicate” offences, the law requires subjective mens
rea only for the underlying act, while accepting objective mens rea for
the consequences that flow from that act.  As McLachlin J. (as she then
was) aptly put it in R. v. Creighton, [1993] 3
S.C.R. 3, at p. 54,
“[c]onsequences can be important.”

[92]                         
More broadly, however, the adoption of objective
mens rea for the consequences of a particular act is not confined to
predicate offences.  Such a narrow approach would “not [be] consistent
with the way in which this Court has defined standards of fault” (Hinchey,
at para. 81).  In the end, “the question of which crimes can legitimately
possess objective fault elements . . . will often depend on the wording of a
particular section as well as its legislative purpose and context” (para. 83). 
Bearing that observation in mind, this Court has concluded in certain cases
other than those dealing with predicate offences that objective mens rea is
the appropriate standard with respect to the consequences of particular acts. 
See, e.g., R. v. Lohnes, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 167 (causing a
disturbance); R. v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606 (conspiracy to prevent or lessen competition
unduly); R. v. Naglik, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 122 (failing to provide the
necessaries of life). 

[93]                         
The same logic applies here.  For reasons I will
develop, the wording of s. 218 , its legislative purpose and its context lead to
the conclusion that objective mens rea is the standard against which the
third element of the offence — the consequences of abandoning or exposing a
child — is to be measured.

B.     Some Common Sense About Child Abandonment 

[94]                         
As Professor Don Stuart has observed, “[m]ore
ink has been spilt over the guilty mind concept than any other substantive
criminal law topic” (Canadian Criminal Law: A Treatise (6th ed. 2011),
at p. 167).  The cases and commentary are muddled by a “bewildering variety of
terminology” and “semantic acrobatics” (p. 167).  Regrettably, the case at hand
is no exception.  Before turning to the task of statutory interpretation, then,
I think it important to pause and reflect on the offence we are tasked with
interpreting.  

[95]                         
As mentioned, s. 218  is child protection
legislation.  It seeks to protect children under the age of 10 who cannot fend
for themselves and who, for that reason, are among society’s most vulnerable
members.  To be sure, abandoning or exposing a child under the age of 10 is a
risky matter.  No reasonable person would suggest otherwise.  Given the
inherent danger of abandoning or exposing a helpless child, Parliament has
chosen to criminalize such conduct, but only to the extent that it places or is
likely to place the child at risk of death or permanent injury.  To put the
matter somewhat differently, s. 218  reflects an effort by Parliament to require
certain individuals to take care of a young child in certain situations that
threaten its life or health.  In the interests of protecting the child, the
provision thus imposes a societal minimum standard of conduct.

[96]                         
Once it is accepted that in enacting s. 218 
Parliament intended to guard against dangerous conduct that any reasonable
person would foresee is likely to endanger a child’s life or expose it to
permanent injury, I fail to see why Parliament would turn around and provide
accused persons with a host of defences based on their individual
characteristics.  Doing so would effectively defeat the provision’s purpose of
imposing a societal minimum standard of conduct, since crimes of subjective
fault require an assessment of personal characteristics to the extent that they
tend to prove or disprove an element of the offence (Creighton, at p.
63).  Age, temperament, mental development, experience, sophistication and education
would all factor into the determination of whether a particular accused
appreciated the risk of harm resulting from the inherently dangerous conduct of
abandoning or exposing a helpless child.  Of particular concern, such an
approach would provide a defence to the errant parent or irresponsible
caregiver who, by virtue of intoxication, could not or did not foresee the
likely consequences of his or her dangerous conduct, whether it be locking a
child in a car on a hot summer’s day or exposing a child to the elements on a
cold winter’s night.

[97]                         
I do not accept that Parliament, in enacting s.
218 , contemplated such a self-defeating regime.  Common sense suggests that
Parliament would not treat the lives and safety of innocent children with such
indifference. 

[98]                         
These observations are neither new nor novel. 
One need only look back to the last time this Court addressed the fault
requirements of a child protection measure in the Criminal Code  to find
support for an objective standard in this context.  In Naglik, the Court
interpreted the fault requirements for s. 215  — a sister provision to s. 218 
that punishes a failure to provide the necessaries of life.  No member of the Naglik
Court questioned the need for an objective standard.  Indeed, every member
of the Court recognized that anything other than an objective standard would
undermine the provision’s purpose.  Even Lamer C.J., who would have allowed for
some personal characteristics, was unequivocal that a subjective standard was
untenable in this context:

Section 215 is aimed at establishing a
uniform minimum level of care to be provided for those to whom it applies, and this
can only be achieved if those under the duty are held to a societal, rather
than a personal, standard of conduct.  [Emphasis added; emphasis in
original deleted; p. 141.]

Justice McLachlin (as she
then was), speaking for the majority on this issue, went further, holding that
personal factors such as “youth, experience, [and] education” have no place in
adjudicating fault for this kind of offence (p. 148).  With respect, I believe
the same holds true for s. 218 .

C.     Section 218 Is a Duty-Based Offence

[99]                         
Turning then to the heart of the matter, in my
view, s. 218  is a duty-based offence — no less so than its sister provision s.
215.  Admittedly, the wording of s. 218  is not as explicit as the wording of s.
215 and more work is needed to uncover the true purpose of s. 218  and the
individuals it targets.  However, if s. 218  is duty-based, then the reasoning
that led this Court in Naglik to conclude that penal negligence
satisfies the fault element in s. 215 applies with equal force to s. 218  as a
matter of principle and precedent.  It is really as simple as that.

[100]                     
As indicated, I am satisfied that s. 218  targets
three limited classes of people faced with a situation where a child under 10
is or is likely to be at risk of death or permanent injury:  

1.         those
who have a pre-existing and an ongoing legal duty to take charge of the child;

2.         those
who choose to come to the aid of the child in that situation; and

3.         those
who place the child in that situation.

I explain my thinking in
what follows.

                 (1)     The Language of Sections 214  and 218 

[101]                     
Turning to the first group mentioned above,
while s. 218  of the Code  does not itself refer to persons who have a
legal duty to take charge of a child under the age of 10 years, s. 214 , which
provides a non-exhaustive definition of the terms “abandon” and “expose” as
used in s. 218 , incorporates such persons expressly.  Paragraph (a) of
the definition includes within the meaning of “abandon” or “expose” “a wilful
omission to take charge of a child by a person who is under a legal duty to
do so”. 

[102]                     
As a consequence of this language, s. 218 
plainly takes in a large swath of people who owe a legal duty to take
charge of a child under the age of 10 — including parents, foster parents and
guardians, the people most likely to run afoul of the provision by virtue of
being the central figures in a child’s life. Once that is accepted, as I think
it must be, I fail to see how or why the provision should not be characterized
as “duty-based”.

[103]                     
The recognition that s. 218  sweeps within its
ambit persons who are already duty-bound to protect a child leads to the
central difficulty with holding that s. 218  is, in its entirety, a subjective mens
rea offence.  Put simply, if the great bulk of people to whom the provision
applies have a pre-existing and ongoing legal duty to take charge of children
who fall below the age of 10, it hardly seems reasonable, or right, that they
should be judged against a subjective mens rea standard when the very
same people who run afoul of the duty-based provision next door (s. 215) are
judged on a penal negligence standard (see Naglik).  Self-evidently,
the result would be a double standard — an objective standard under s. 215 and
a subjective standard under s. 218  — for provisions that serve similar, if not
identical, purposes:  protecting the same children, imposing a duty on the same
people, guarding against the same consequences.

[104]                     
One might be inclined to justify such a double
standard on the basis of a key difference in s. 218 , namely that it applies to
people who have a pre-existing and ongoing legal duty to children under the age
of 10 and to those who do not have such a duty, by virtue of para.
(b) of the definition of “abandon” or “expose” in s. 214 .  That part of
the definition includes persons “dealing with a child in a manner that is
likely to leave that child exposed to risk without protection”, which at first
blush could be read as sweeping in a large number of people who have no
pre-existing duty to the child.[1] 


[105]                     
If one were inclined to argue that para. (b)
makes a critical difference, one might reason that Parliament picked the better
of only two options before it with respect to mens rea.  Parliament
could have identified an objective mens rea standard in s. 218  for those
with a pre-existing and ongoing duty (to achieve harmony with s. 215) and a
subjective mens rea standard for the others captured by para. (b)
(to restrict the scope of criminal liability).  However, this result — a single
crime that contemplates different mental standards for different persons
engaging in the same culpable acts — is entirely foreign to our criminal law. 
Surely, Parliament did not intend this.  The only remaining option, then, might
be to allow persons with a pre-existing and ongoing duty to reap the benefit of
the subjective higher standard, even if that created a double standard for
them.  Such a result, it might be argued, would ensure that those additional
individuals caught by para. (b) of the s. 214  definition are not
unjustly branded as criminals.  That is the approach the majority adopts.

[106]                     
Respectfully, I would prefer not to endorse such
a stark double standard — and, fortunately, I need not do so.  There is a third
option.  Section 218  can, and in my view should, be read purposefully and
harmoniously, such that it applies only to persons who are cloaked with a duty,
whether pre-existing and ongoing or situational, to protect a particular
child under the age of 10 from death or permanent injury, all of whom are
properly subject to an objective standard with respect to the consequences
element of s. 218 .  Let me explain.

[107]                     
Manifestly, the language of para. (b) of
the s. 214  definition is broad.  The plain language of the words “dealing with
a child” can connote much; the question is how much.  In my view, they are
meant to capture those people who take active steps to alleviate a situation or
who place a child in a situation that will, or is likely to, endanger the
child’s life or cause it permanent injury — the second and third groups to
which I referred above.  Such persons are cloaked with a situational duty
to take reasonable steps to preserve and protect the life and safety of the
child during the course of their limited involvement with the child.

[108]                     
The facts of the present case provide a fitting
example.  The store manager became duty-bound to the child, A.J.H., when he
removed him from the toilet.  Having taken active steps to come to the child’s
aid, he was cloaked with a duty to take reasonable steps to protect the child
from further harm.  No such duty attached to the assistant store manager or the
store patrons, however, as they did not choose to become directly involved with
the child.  Consequently, they did not “dea[l] with” the child within the
meaning of s. 214 . 

[109]                     
Situational duties of the kind I describe here
are far from foreign to the Code .  I gain comfort in the case at hand
from ss. 216 , 217  and 217.1  of the Code , each of which contemplate a
duty imposed by law on an individual who undertakes to do something by virtue
of positive actions.  Section 217 , for example, provides:

217.  Every one who undertakes to do an act is under a legal duty to do it
if an omission to do the act is or may be dangerous to life.

[110]                     
Much like the language in para. (b) of
the s. 214  definition of “abandon” or “expose”, the language of “undertak[ing]
to do an act” in s. 217  is capable of a sweeping definition.  But that is not
the path the criminal law has followed — and wisely so.  As Abella J.A. (as she
then was) observed in R. v. Browne (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 775 (C.A.) :

There is no doubt that the definition
embraces an interpretive continuum ranging from an assertion to a promise.  But
it seems to me that when we are deciding whether conduct is caught by the web
of criminal liability, the threshold definition we apply must justify penal
sanctions. . . . The word “undertaking” in s. 217  must be interpreted in this
context.  The threshold definition must be sufficiently high to justify such
serious penal consequences.  The mere expression of words indicating a
willingness to do an act cannot trigger the legal duty. There must be something
in the nature of a commitment, generally, though not necessarily, upon which
reliance can reasonably be said to have been placed.  [Emphasis added; pp.
779-80.]

[111]                     
In my view, Justice Abella’s conclusion with
respect to s. 217  points to the proper construction of para. (b) of the
s. 214  definition as cloaking with a duty to act reasonably only those people
who by active steps undertake to preserve and protect a child from death or
permanent injury (the second group mentioned above).  By the same token, it
does not require a leap of logic to conclude that “dealing with” a child within
the meaning of para. (b) of the s. 214  definition must similarly be
restricted in scope to those who actually place the child in a situation in
which it is put at risk of death or permanent injury (the third group).

[112]                     
When one steps back to look at the broader
picture, the understanding that one’s positive actions can give rise to a
situational duty is a principle well known to the common law.  As Professors
Colvin and Anand have noted, historically there have been “three reasonably
well-established categories of duty to act” (Principles of Criminal Law
(3rd ed. 2007), at p. 141).  The first is well known and concerns “general
relationships of care and protection”, such as those captured by para. (a)
of the s. 214  definition.  The second concerns “specific undertakings to act”
(see, e.g., R. v. Nicholls (1874), 13 Cox C.C. 75; R. v. Instan,
[1893] 1 Q.B. 450) and the third concerns duties arising from “causal
responsibility for dangerous situations” (see, e.g., R. v. Salmon (1880),
6 Q.B.D. 79; R. v. Coyne (1958), 124 C.C.C. 176 (N.B.S.C. (App. Div.)); R.
v. Miller, [1983] 1 All E.R. 978 (H.L.)).  See also Ormerod, at pp. 70-75
(including “[p]arents and other relations”, “[v]oluntary undertakings”, and
“[c]reating a dangerous situation” as categories).  These three categories map
precisely to the three groups of individuals who I conclude come within the
ambit of s. 218 .  While it is, of course, true that our criminal law does not
include common law offences, in my view, the wording of para. (b) of the
s. 214  definition reflects a specific statutory instantiation
of the second and third of these long-standing common law principles — much
like ss. 216 , 217  and 217.1  do — in this case with respect to young children.

[113]                     
Interpreting the scope of s. 218  in this way, as
I believe it was meant to be, goes a long way toward addressing concerns about
the broad scope of potential liability under the provision.  The spectre of
criminal liability under the offence is not overly broad.  Indeed, the
interpretation I favour may be narrower than that endorsed in the
majority position, which does not delineate the type of conduct that would
amount to “dealing with” a child.  All else being equal, I thus cannot accept
that the scope of this offence is a valid ground to require subjective
foresight of the consequences proscribed by s. 218 .

                    (2)     The Statutory Scheme 

[114]                     
I also note that s. 218  finds its place in Part
VIII of the Code  under the heading “Duties Tending to Preservation of
Life”.  It is one of two offences located under that heading — the other being
s. 215 .  In my view, this provides some indication that Parliament intended
that s. 218  be construed as a duty-based offence. 

[115]                     
In her text, Sullivan on the Construction of
Statutes (5th ed. 2008), Professor Ruth Sullivan, a leading authority on
the construction of statutes, observes that “headings are a valid indicator of
legislative meaning and may be taken into account in interpretation” (p. 394). 
See also R. v. Lucas, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 439, at para. 47.  Of particular
note, in discussing the relationship between provisions grouped under the same
heading, she writes:

        When
provisions are grouped together under a heading it is presumed that they are
related to one another in some particular way, that there is a shared
subject or object or a common feature to the provisions.  [Emphasis added; p.
396.]

[116]                     
While I do not place undue weight on it, I think
some significance can be attached to the fact that s. 218 is coupled with one
other offence, s. 215, which is clearly duty-based.  And as I have just noted,
s. 218 is grouped with other provisions (ss. 216 , 217  and 217.1 ) that speak to
the creation of legal duties in particular circumstances.  Manifestly, s. 218
is embedded in a number of provisions which have, as their common denominator,
the concept of “duty”.  That being so, it seems anomalous that Parliament
would, for no apparent reason, insert a non-duty-based offence into a thicket
of duty-related provisions.  The scenario becomes even more remarkable when one
appreciates that s. 218 is concerned with inherently dangerous conduct that is
or is likely to put the lives and safety of helpless young children at risk —
the very type of situation which, in my view, requires a societal minimum
standard of conduct and calls out for a standard of fault based on objective
foreseeability.

[117]                     
The reason, in my view, why the word “duty” is
not found in s. 218 is because s. 218 deals primarily with acts of commission,
whereas s. 215 deals with acts of omission.  We do not speak of parents failing
“not to abandon” their children or failing “not to expose” them to the risk of
death or permanent injury.  The gravamen of s. 218 lies not in the failure of
an accused to do that which he or she is legally obliged to do (although para. (a)
of the s. 214  definition accounts for such a situation) but rather, the doing
of something that is inherently dangerous — abandoning or exposing a helpless
child to the risk of death or permanent injury. 

                    (3)   Scholarly Opinion

[118]                     
Finally, I note that scholarly opinion on the
offence of abandoning or exposing a child under s. 218  of the Code  is
sparse, but that which there is suggests the offence is duty-based.

[119]                     
In his treatise, Professor Stuart indicates that
the offence of child abandonment is a duty-based offence, although not one
where the duty is stated within the offence.  He places it in the category of
“[o]ffences that extend to omissions but do not create a legal duty to act so a
legal duty outside the offence must be found” (p. 96).  According to Professor
Stuart, this category describes two types of offences, the first of which encompasses
child abandonment:

The first is
where the Code  offences refer to a duty without defining it.  Examples occur in
the case of the offences of permitting an escape by failing to perform “a legal
duty” (section 146 (a)), committing a common nuisance by failing to
discharge “a legal duty” (section 180 ), and abandoning a child by omitting
to take charge of it when under “a legal duty to do so” (sections 214  and
218 ). [Emphasis added; p. 96.]

[120]                     
As I have explained, narrowing the scope of the
offence under s. 218  exclusively to those who have a pre-existing and ongoing
duty cannot be supported by the plain text of the provision in light of para. (b)
of the s. 214  definition of “abandon” or “expose”.  Nonetheless, I would take
Professor Stuart as making the more modest point that s. 218  at least in part
looks to those with such pre-existing and ongoing duties and, as such, is
properly characterized as duty-based.

[121]                     
Likewise, Professor Roach, at pp. 115-16 of his
text, explains that although an omission will not generally constitute the actus
reus of an offence, a failure to act will suffice where an individual has a
“specific legal duty to act”.  He then includes child abandonment in his list
of duty-based offences:

There is a duty to use reasonable care when providing medical
treatment or other lawful acts that may endanger the life of others.  This duty
was breached by a person who donated blood that he knew was infected with HIV. 
It is also an offence not to use reasonable care in handling explosives; to
disobey a court order; to fail to assist a peace officer when requested; to
abandon a child; not to obtain assistance in child-birth; to fail to stop
when your vehicle is involved in an accident; to neglect animals; and to fail
to take steps to protect holes in ice or open excavations.  [Footnotes omitted;
emphasis added; p. 116.]

[122]                     
Finally, Manning and Sankoff, at p. 826 of their
treatise, take a glum view of s. 218 , calling it “entirely superfluous” on the
basis that “there does not appear to be a conceivable situation in which
abandonment would not also constitute a failure to provide the necessaries of
life [under s. 215]”.  Again, I note that this analysis neglects to take any
account of para. (b) of the s. 214  definition of “abandon” or “expose”
and I do not comment on their thesis that s. 218  is superfluous.  But setting
those matters aside, in saying that s. 218  is entirely subsumed by s. 215 —
which everyone agrees is a duty-based offence — these authors must be taken as
accepting that s. 218  is likewise a duty-based offence.

                    (4)     Conclusion on the Duty-Based Nature
of Section 218 

[123]                     
To sum up, the plain language of s. 218  —
supported by the place of situational duties in Canadian criminal law, the
offence’s placement among other duty-based provisions in the Code  and
the scholarship on s. 218  — leads to the conclusion that the offence of child
abandonment is duty-based.  It is targeted at three distinct groups faced with
a situation where a child under 10 is or is likely to be at risk of death or
permanent injury:  first, by virtue of para. (a) of the s. 214 
definition, those with a pre-existing and ongoing duty to take charge of the
child; second, by virtue of para. (b), those who “dea[l] with” the child
by undertaking positive steps to come to its aid in that situation; and third,
again by virtue of para. (b), those who “dea[l] with” the child by
placing it in that situation.

[124]                     
With this in mind, I turn again to the wording
of s. 218 , and particularly the language employed with respect to the
consequences, the mental element of which forms the crux of this case:

218. Every one who unlawfully
abandons or exposes a child who is under the age of ten years, so that its
life is or is likely to be endangered or its health is or is likely to be
permanently injured . . . .

[125]                     
This language, which we are tasked with
interpreting today, is strikingly similar to that which this Court explained in
the context of s. 215, the sister provision to s. 218  concerning a failure to
provide the necessaries of life.  As I have already mentioned, this Court held
in Naglik that the mens rea for s. 215 is in relevant part
satisfied on an objective basis.  In an opinion unanimous on this issue,
Lamer C.J., at p. 143, asked rhetorically, “What parts of the offence must be objectively
foreseeable?” and then identified the subparagraph in s. 215 that I emphasize
below:

(2)
Every one commits an offence who, being under a legal duty within the meaning
of subsection (1), fails without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies on him,
to perform that duty, if

 

(a)  with respect to a duty imposed . .
. 

 

(ii)
the failure to perform the duty endangers the life of the person to whom the
duty is owed, or causes or is likely to cause the health of that person to be endangered
permanently . . . .

[126]                     
As is apparent, the relevant language in both
provisions is strikingly similar.  If s. 218 is duty-based, as I have attempted
to show it is, then this should be the end of the matter — there is no basis
in principle or precedent for departing from the rule announced in Naglik. 
This Court’s reasoning with respect to s. 215 applies with equal force to s.
218, and it does not stand to reason that the mental element for the risk
element of child abandonment is anything other than objective.  But if that is
not enough, there is more.

D.     The Legislative History Confirms an Objective Standard for
the Proscribed Consequences 

[127]                     
The legislative history of s. 218 is traceable
to The Offences against the Person Act, 1861, 24 & 25 Vict.,
c. 100.  The forerunner to what is now s. 218 is found in s. 27 of that Act,
accompanied by the following marginal note:  “Exposing Children whereby Life
endangered”.  The provision, in its relevant part, reads as follows:

27.  Whosoever shall unlawfully abandon or expose any child, being under
the age of two years, whereby the life of such child shall be
endangered, or the health of such child shall have been or shall be likely to
be permanently injured, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .  

[128]                     
I have emphasized the word “whereby” which I
take to mean “in consequence of” — hardly words one normally associates with
subjective foresight.  To be sure, this was no oversight.  Words such as
“knowingly”, “maliciously” and “with intent”, commonly understood as indicating
a requirement of subjective mens rea, are used throughout the Act.

[129]                     
In 1869, Canada’s Parliament enacted An Act
respecting Offences against the Person, S.C. 1869, c. 20. 
Section 26 of that Act tracked the wording of s. 27 of the English statute in
all material respects:

26.  Whosoever unlawfully abandons or exposes any child being under the
age of two years, whereby the life of such child is endangered, or the
health of such child has been, or is likely to be permanently injured, is
guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .  

[130]                     
In 1893, Canada’s first Criminal Code 
came into force (The Criminal Code, 1892, S.C. 1892, c. 29).  Under the
heading “Duties Tending to the Preservation of Life”, Parliament created
several duty-based offences.  Embedded in them was s. 216 , accompanied by the
following marginal note:  “Abandoning children under two years of age”. 
Section 216  provided as follows:

216.  Every one is guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to three years’ imprisonment who unlawfully
abandons or exposes any child under the age of two years, whereby its life is
endangered, or its health is permanently injured.

 

2.  The words “abandon” and “expose” include a wilful omission to
take charge of the child on the part of a person legally bound to do so, and
any mode of dealing with it calculated to leave it exposed to risk without
protection.  

[131]                     
As is self-evident, the first part of the
provision essentially tracks the language of s. 26 of An Act respecting Offences
against the Person.  The second part is new and very much resembles what is
now paras. (a) and (b) of the s. 214  definition of “abandon” or
“expose” — with one notable exception.  The second half of s. 216(2) reads “any
mode of dealing with [the child] calculated to leave it exposed to risk
without protection”, whereas para. (b) of the s. 214  definition reads
“dealing with a child in a manner that is likely to leave that child
exposed to risk without protection”.  In short, the words “calculated to leave”
were replaced by the words “likely to leave”.  Though the change may appear
highly meaningful to modern eyes, care must be taken not to confuse obsolete
and current meanings of those words. As the majority observes, in the 18th and
19th centuries, “calculated to” and “likely to” were synonyms.[2]  This change occurred
with the adoption of a new Code  (Criminal Code, S.C. 1953-54, c.
51, s. 185) and thus is perhaps best explained as an attempt to update
language to reflect current usage.  As Professor Sullivan notes, such a statutory
revision can serve “to ensure the clarity, consistency and readability” of the
revised act, as a result of which “outdated terminology may be modernized” (pp.
653-54).  The wording of the provisions creating the offence of abandonment,
now ss. 214  and 218 , has not been amended since.

[132]                     
The plain language of the provision aside, early
judicial interpretations of the child abandonment provision can be helpful in
interpreting the modern-day s. 218.  In the leading English authority of R.
v. White (1871), L.R. 1 C.C.R. 311, a father failed to take custody of his
nine-month-old child.  The child was left on the road in front of the father’s
home by his estranged wife, who demanded that he take the child.  The father
was charged and convicted under s. 27 of The Offences against the Person
Act, 1861, and the conviction was upheld on appeal. 

[133]                     
The White decision makes no mention of
subjective mens rea as being required to make out the offence of
abandonment.  Indeed, it suggests the opposite, as evidenced by the following
passage from Chief Justice Bovill’s opinion, to which the remaining four
justices subscribed:

Instead of protecting and providing for
the child, as it was his duty to do, [the father] allowed it to remain lying,
first at his door, and afterwards in the road, insufficiently clothed, and at a
time of year when the result was likely to be the child’s death. 
[Emphasis added; p. 313.]

In my view, the language
used by Bovill C.J. is the language of objective foreseeability (death was the
likely result) and not the language of subjective foreseeability (he knew
that death was likely to result).  

[134]                     
I acknowledge that in a separate opinion written
by Blackburn J., language is used from which one might conclude that he viewed
the crime of abandonment as requiring subjective foresight:

. . . upon
[the father] there is a strict legal duty to protect the child.  And when the
child is left in a position of danger of which he knows, and from which he has
full power to remove it, and he neglects his duty of protection, and lets the
child remain in danger, I think this is an exposure and abandonment by him. [p.
314]

I do not read that
passage as indicating that subjective foresight is required to make out the
offence of abandonment.  Rather, on Justice Blackburn’s assessment of the
facts, the father clearly knew that the child’s life was imperilled and yet did
nothing about it.  I would not, and do not, suggest that a person who in fact
subjectively foresees a risk of death or permanent injury to the child cannot
be convicted under s. 218.  But that is different from holding that subjective
foreseeability is an essential ingredient of the crime.  Where an offence is
satisfied — at a minimum — on an objective standard, subjective proof will
obviously suffice to sustain a conviction.  See R. v. Beatty, 2008 SCC
5, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, at para. 47; R. v. Roy, 2012 SCC 26, [2012] 2
S.C.R. 60, at para. 38.

[135]                     
To conclude on this point, the fact that the
provision contains no words that can be read as requiring subjective foresight
of the proscribed consequences is significant.  As mentioned, the words
“calculated to leave” were removed in the 1953-54 Criminal Code  and
replaced by the words “likely to leave”.  At the same time, the age of
protected children was raised from two years to ten years and the word
“whereby” was replaced with the synonymous words “so that”.  If Parliament had
wanted to make it clear that subjective foreseeability was the requisite fault
element, it could have done so when revising the language of the provision by
using the words “knowing that” instead of “so that” in s. 218  and by changing
the words “calculated to leave” to “he knows is or is likely to leave” in para.
(b) of the s. 214  definition.  As Professor Sullivan notes,
“[i]t is presumed that in so far as possible legislatures will adopt a simple,
straightforward and concise way of expressing themselves” (p. 207).  But
instead of making what would have been a straightforward change, Parliament
preserved the original meaning of the provision which, as I have attempted to
show, was understood as requiring objective, not subjective, foreseeability of
the prohibited consequences.

E.   The Social Stigma and Gravity
of the Offence Support an Objective Standard for the Proscribed Consequences


[136]                     
I touch, finally, on two other factors that
support the conclusion that the fault element for s. 218 is penal negligence: 
the social stigma attached to the crime of child abandonment and the gravity of
the crime.  As McLachlin J., for the majority, observed in Creighton, at
p. 46, the mens rea of an offence should reflect the gravity of the
crime.  Both the social stigma associated with its commission and the penalty
provided by Parliament afford a measure of that gravity.

[137]                     
The social stigma associated with the offence of
child abandonment cannot — and in my view should not — be treated differently
than the social stigma associated with its sister provision s. 215  (failure to
provide necessaries) where penal negligence was found to be the requisite fault
element.  Indeed, as I noted earlier, in their treatise, at p. 826, Manning and
Sankoff write that the offence of child abandonment is “entirely superfluous”
given its overlap with the offence of failing to provide the necessaries of
life under s. 215  of the Code :

Given that the “necessaries of life”
include shelter and protection from harm, there does not appear to be a conceivable
situation in which abandonment would not also constitute a failure to provide
the necessaries of life.

[138]                     
Whether that statement is entirely accurate or
not, it leads me to conclude that ss. 215  and 218  should be ranked equally on
the social stigma scale.  They certainly rank equally in terms of their
gravity.  Both offences are punishable by a maximum penalty of five years’
imprisonment (if the Crown proceeds by way of indictment) and 18 months’
imprisonment (if the Crown proceeds by way of summary conviction).  

[139]                     
Put differently, if Parliament had intended to
build subjective foreseeability into s. 218, the degree of moral
blameworthiness would necessarily be higher than that required to sustain a
conviction under s. 215 , which requires only objective foreseeability.  If that
were the case, one could reasonably expect, in my view, that the higher level
of moral culpability would be reflected by a more severe punishment.  But this
is not so.[3] 
And that leads me to conclude that the two provisions encompass the same degree
of blameworthiness and thus require the same degree of mental fault.

[140]                     
Finally, without wishing to minimize the nature
and severity of the punishments available under ss. 215  and 218 , they are
significantly removed from other crimes which this Court has held to be crimes
involving objective foresight, including manslaughter and certain instances of
dangerous driving causing death — both of which attract maximum punishments of
life imprisonment.

F.      The Remaining Elements of the Offence

[141]                     
As explained earlier, there are three distinct
elements to the offence of child abandonment: the act (abandonment or
exposure), the circumstances (a child under 10), and the consequences (the risk
of harm to the child).  The focus of my analysis thus far has been the third
element.  I turn now to the first and second elements, taking each in turn.

                    (1)   “Abandon”
or “Expose” — And the “Wilful” Red Herring

[142]                     
Although there are no words of subjective intent
in s. 218, the word “wilful” is used in para. (a) of the s. 214 
definition of “abandon” or “expose” to modify the word “omission”.  Much of the
focus on the word, unfortunately, has served as a red herring, distracting from
its actual function in the language of s. 218.  Whatever meaning attaches to
“wilful”, it speaks to the interpretation to be given to the act in the first
element of the offence (abandoning or exposing).  It offers little, if any,
assistance in interpreting the third element (risk to the child).

[143]                     
As far back as 1898, in the case of R. v.
Senior, [1899] 1 Q.B. 283, Lord Russell of Killowen C.J. considered the
meaning of the word “wilfully” in s. 1 of the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children Act, 1894, 57 & 58 Vict., c. 41, which among other
things, made it an offence to “wilfully” assault, ill-treat, neglect, abandon
or expose a child under the age of 16 “in a manner likely to cause such child
unnecessary suffering, or injury to its health”.  At pp. 290-91, the Chief
Justice stated:

Whether the words in the statute,
“wilfully neglects,” are taken together, or, as the learned judge did in
directing the jury, are taken separately, the meaning is very clear.  “Wilfully”
means that the act is done deliberately and intentionally, not by accident or
inadvertence, but so that the mind of the person who does the act goes with it. 
[Emphasis added.]

[144]                     
Modern-day authorities have accepted that the
word “wilful” may be used to indicate a voluntary or deliberate act, one that
the mind “goes with”.  See, e.g., R. v. Buzzanga (1979), 25 O.R. (2d)
705 (C.A.), at pp. 715-17; R. v. L.B., 2011 ONCA 153, 274 O.A.C. 365, at
paras. 108-9, leave to appeal refused, [2011] 3 S.C.R. x; and Manning and
Sankoff, at pp. 149-50.

[145]                     
In my view, a fair reading of the provision
establishes that the word “wilful” in s. 214  does not connote an intention to
bring about the proscribed consequences identified in s. 218.  Rather, it
modifies “omission” in para. (a) of the definition of “abandon” or
“expose” and connotes, as Lord Russell C.J. described it, an act “done
deliberately and intentionally, not by accident or inadvertence”.  

[146]                     
To put the matter in more contemporary terms,
basic intent or voluntariness is all that is required to satisfy the minimum
mental element for the act of abandonment or exposure.  That conclusion sits
independently from — and is entirely harmonious with — the separate conclusion
that penal negligence is the proper mental standard for the third element in s.
218.  It would be a mistake to confuse the two. 

                    (2)     The Age of the Child

[147]                     
Lastly, I turn to the second element of the
offence, the age of the child.  This element was not an issue in this appeal,
as it was self-evident and undisputed that A.D.H.’s newborn baby was under the
age of 10.  Nevertheless, mindful that the age of the child is a question of
circumstances and not consequences of the offence, and absent any indicators
that Parliament intended an objective standard for this element, I would be
inclined to hold that this element should be established on the basis of
subjective fault.  However, as this matter is not before us, I need not say
more about it.

G.       Some Thoughts on Intoxication as a Defence

[148]                     
Earlier in these reasons, I voiced my concern
that an interpretation of s. 218 that requires subjective foresight of
consequences would provide a defence to the errant parent or irresponsible
caregiver who, by virtue of intoxication, could not or did not foresee the
likely consequences of his or her dangerous conduct.  While it is true that
none of the parties raised this point in their arguments, I believe that the
ramifications that flow from interpreting a statutory provision in one way or
another are a necessary part of the overall contextual analysis with which we
are engaged.  That context cannot — and should not — be overlooked on the basis
that a relevant issue does not arise on the facts of a particular case.  

[149]                     
The majority concludes that s. 218 is a “general
intent” offence (para. 16).  I would have thought, however, that this Court’s
decision in Hinchey has pointed us beyond the binary fiction of specific
versus general intent offences.[4] 
This case underscores the merit of that approach because the nub of the
difficulty is that s. 218, whether under the majority’s approach or mine, does
not — indeed, it cannot — fit neatly into either the general or specific intent
boxes.  To attempt to do so is to do what courts have for too long done —
broad-brush offences in a way that at once over-generalizes and
over-simplifies.  

[150]                     
The majority’s invocation of R. v. Daviault,
[1994] 3 S.C.R. 63, and s. 33.1  of the Code  is no answer to the concerns
I raise.  First, Daviault speaks only to the basic intent or voluntariness
needed to commit an intentional act — what Cory J. described as “the minimal
mental element required for a general intent offence” (p. 87 (emphasis
added)).  Our later decision in R. v. Daley, 2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3
S.C.R. 523, confirms that a so-called Daviault defence of “extreme
intoxication” relates only to intoxication which “negates voluntariness
and thus is a complete defence to criminal responsibility” (para. 43 (emphasis
added)).  Daviault thus says nothing about whether intoxication short of
automatism could raise a reasonable doubt about an accused’s subjective
foresight of consequences, as the majority requires of s. 218 .

[151]                     
Second, s. 33.1 of the Code , if it is
applicable to s. 218 , provides a statutory override of a Daviault defence
— but only to the extent that the accused “lacked the general intent or the
voluntariness required to commit the offence”.  Assuming for the sake of
argument that s. 33.1  does apply to s. 218 , it says nothing about
intoxication as a defence in relation to the subjective foresight of
consequences. As I have said, Daviault was only concerned with the basic
intent or voluntariness required for an intentional act.  Thus, whether s. 33.1 
does or does not apply to s. 218  is, in my respectful view, irrelevant.  

H.     Conclusion

[152]                     
Section 218 is child protection legislation.  It
targets three limited classes of people faced with a situation where a child
under 10 is or is likely to be at risk of death or permanent injury.  A review
of the provision’s language, its legislative evolution and history, the gravity
of the crime and the social stigma associated with it confirm that the offence
is duty-based and that penal negligence is the level of fault required to
establish guilt as regards the proscribed consequences.

[153]                     
Having so concluded, I hasten to point out that
penal negligence involves a very real level of fault.  This is emphatically not
a matter of punishing the “morally blameless”.  And while it may not reach the
level of subjective fault in respect of each and every element of a particular
crime, it does not punish people for acts of simple negligence.  As Charron J.
observed in Beatty, at para. 34:

If every departure from the civil norm
is to be criminalized, regardless of the degree, we risk casting the net too
widely and branding as criminals persons who are in reality not morally
blameworthy.

For that reason, an
objective test “requires proof of a marked departure from the standard
of care that a reasonable person would observe in all the circumstances”: ibid.,
at para. 36 (emphasis in original).  

[154]                     
Nor does an objective standard punish those who
act under an honest but mistaken belief that their conduct is not dangerous in
the circumstances — so long as the belief is reasonably held.  Justice Charron
put the matter succinctly in Beatty, at paras. 37-38:

However, because the accused’s
mental state is relevant in a criminal setting, the objective test must be
modified to give the accused the benefit of any reasonable doubt about whether
the reasonable person would have appreciated the risk or could and would have
done something to avoid creating the danger. . . . 

 

. .
. In the same vein, a reasonably held mistake of fact may provide a complete
defence if, based on the accused’s reasonable perception of the facts, the
conduct measured up to the requisite standard of care.

[155]                     
What the test does not do is take into account
the personal attributes of the accused, short of incapacity to appreciate the
risk.  Nor will it allow people who are drunk or high on drugs to escape
liability on the basis that they were not capable of foreseeing, or did not
foresee, the likely consequences of their actions.  That, with respect, is how
it should be.  And the circumstances of this case serve to exemplify how the
penal negligence standard works to spare the morally blameless from criminal
liability.

III.    Application to the Facts 

[156]                     
The trial judge found that the respondent,
A.D.H., honestly believed that her child was dead at birth.  In so concluding,
he accepted that the birth was precipitous and the baby was born premature.  He
also accepted that A.D.H. was confused and frightened at the time and that the
baby, after birth, was blue and motionless.  The trial judge found objective
support for A.D.H.’s belief in the evidence of Dr. Simpson and that of various
bystanders who likewise believed the child was dead (2009 SKQB 261, 335 Sask.
R. 173).

[157]                     
Based on the trial judge’s findings of fact,
Ottenbreit J.A. concluded that A.D.H. was entitled to be acquitted.  In his
view, her belief that the child was dead at birth “was not only honestly held
but reasonable in the context of the situation” (2011 SKCA 6, 366 Sask. R. 123,
at para. 38).  I agree.

[158]                     
In all the circumstances, A.D.H.’s conduct in
abandoning her child and leaving him exposed to the risk of death or permanent
injury was not morally blameworthy.  As such, she was entitled to be acquitted.


[159]                     
Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.

from that charge, and

 

                                    (ii) is unable to provide
himself with necessaries of life.

 

                              (2)
[Offence] Every one commits an offence who, being under a legal duty within the
meaning of subsection (1), fails without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies
on him, to perform that duty, if

 

                             (a) with respect to a duty
imposed by paragraph (1)(a) or (b),

 

                                    (i) the person to whom the duty
is owed is in destitute or necessitous circumstances, or

 

                                    (ii) the failure to perform the
duty endangers the life of the person to whom the duty is owed, or causes or is
likely to cause the health of that person to be endangered permanently; or

 

                             (b) with respect to a duty
imposed by paragraph (1)(c), the failure to perform the duty endangers
the life of the person to whom the duty is owed or causes or is likely to cause
the health of that person to be injured permanently.

 

                              (3)
[Punishment] Every one who commits an offence under subsection (2)

                             (a) is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years; or

93]

 

                             (b) evidence that a person has
in any way recognized a child as being his child is, in the absence of any
evidence to the contrary, proof that the child is his child;

 

                             (c) evidence that a person has
failed for a period of one month to make provision for the maintenance of any
child of theirs under the age of sixteen years is, in the absence of any
evidence to the contrary, proof that the person has failed without lawful
excuse to provide necessaries of life for the child; and

 

                             (d) the fact that a spouse or
common-law partner or child is receiving or has received necessaries of life
from another person who is not under a legal duty to provide them is not a
defence.

 

. . .

 

                              218. [Abandoning child] Every one who unlawfully abandons or
exposes a child who is under the age of ten years, so that its life is or is
likely to be endangered or its health is or is likely to be permanently
injured,

for a term not exceeding five years; or

 

                             (b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction and
liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding eighteen months.

An Act to amend the Criminal Code (protection of children and other vulnerable

More than three decades ago, dissenting in Leary v. The Queen, [1978] 1
S.C.R. 29, Dickson J. (as he then was) recognized that the specific-general
intent dichotomy has bewildered the bench and bar ever since it was brought to
our shores by this Court’s decision in R. v. George, [1960] S.C.R. 871. 
The difficulty, as Dickson J. put it, was that “there are not, and have never
been, any legally adequate criteria for distinguishing the one group of crimes
from the other” (p. 40).  In comments that I believe align well with Hinchey,
Dickson J. counseled moving beyond labels that are “neither meaningful nor
intelligible” to an analysis of the actual “mental element[s] which must be
established by the Crown” (pp. 42-43).",2013-05-17 00:00:00,CA Supreme Court

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

                    Criminal
law — Evidence — Operation of vehicle with blood alcohol level exceeding legal
limit — Section 258(1)(d.1) of Criminal Code providing that, absent evidence to
contrary, breathalyser reading above 80 mg of alcohol per 100 mL of blood is
proof that blood alcohol concentration exceeded legal limit at time of driving
— Evidence placing appellant’s blood alcohol concentration in range that
straddled legal limit at time of driving — Whether “straddle evidence” can

                    Held: 
The appeal should be allowed.

                    The
straddle evidence in this case was admissible and the trial judge committed no
error in finding that the statutory presumption had been rebutted.  Nor did the
trial judge commit any error in weighing the appellant’s other indicia of
impairment.

                    The following is the judgment
delivered by

[1]                             
The Court — In R. v. Gibson, 2008 SCC 16,
[2008] 1 S.C.R. 397, a majority of this Court — for the reasons of LeBel and
Deschamps JJ. — held that straddle evidence is admissible to rebut the
statutory presumption that the blood alcohol level of the accused exceeded the
legal limit at the time of driving, although there was disagreement on the
issue of the probative value of this evidence. In our view, a statement of a
legal principle that is accepted by a majority of the Court constitutes the
opinion of the Court with respect to that legal principle. This is so even if
some of the members of the Court who endorse that legal principle dissent from
the majority’s disposition of the appeal. Therefore, the straddle evidence in
this appeal was admissible.

[2]                             
With respect to the probative value of the
evidence, we would adopt the reasons of LeBel J. in Gibson as setting
out the appropriate test. 

[3]                             
Applying these principles, we would allow the
appeal.  LeBel J. in Gibson found that straddle evidence showing blood
alcohol content between 40 mg of alcohol per 100 mL of blood, assuming an
elimination rate of 20 mg per hour, and 82 mg, assuming an elimination rate of
10 mg, “may be capable of raising a reasonable doubt” as to whether the
accused’s blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit at the time of driving
(para. 72).  The straddle range in this case was almost identical to LeBel J.’s
example, placing the appellant’s blood alcohol content within a range of 57 mg,
assuming an elimination rate of 15 mg, and 83 mg, assuming a rate of 10 mg, at
the time of driving.  The trial judge who, in accordance with LeBel J.’s
reasons in Gibson, weighed this evidence in the light of all of the
evidence at trial, committed no legal error in finding that the statutory
presumption had been rebutted.  Nor did the trial judge commit any palpable or
overriding errors in weighing the appellant’s other indicia of impairment (2009
QCCQ 4279 (CanLII)).

[4]                             
Accordingly, we would allow the appeal and
reinstate the appellant’s acquittal at trial.

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

                    Criminal
law — Defences — Charge to jury — Defences that are incompatible in theory —
Accused charged with being party, together with her spouse, to murder of their
three children — Alternative defence that accused had abandoned common intention
to kill children — Whether it was appropriate to exclude defence of abandonment
from defences put to jury on basis that it was incompatible with defence’s
principal theory, absence of mens rea.

                    Criminal law — Defences — Abandonment —
Participation in crime — Accused charged with being party, together with her
spouse, to murder of their three children — Alternative defence that accused
had abandoned common intention to kill children — Essential elements of defence
of abandonment in context of forms of participation in crime provided for in
s. 21(1) and s. 21(2) of Criminal Code — Whether defence of
abandonment raised by accused met air of reality test.

                    G
was charged with being a party, together with her spouse, L, to the murder of
their three children at the dawn of the year 2009.  According to the Crown’s
theory, G was a party to the murder in planning it as part of a murder‑suicide
pact and in supplying the murder weapon.  She did not act to prevent the
children from being poisoned with drinks served by her spouse, which contained
Gravol and oxazepam.  Thus, she aided L to kill the children.  At her jury
trial, G submitted in her defence that she had not bought the medication to
poison her children, that she was in a dissociative state on December 31,
2008 when she wrote some incriminating documents, and that this state meant she
could not have formed the specific intent to commit the murders.  In the
alternative, should her argument based on the absence of mens rea be
rejected, she claimed to have abandoned the common purpose of killing the
children and to have clearly communicated her intention to do so to her
spouse.  The jury found G guilty of the first degree murder of her three
children.  The Court of Appeal upheld the guilty verdict, concluding that the
trial judge had not erred in refusing to put the defence of abandonment to the
jury, since it was incompatible with the defence’s principal theory.

                    Held
(Fish J. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.

                    Per LeBel, Abella,
Rothstein, Moldaver, Karakatsanis and Wagner JJ.: There is no
cardinal rule against putting to a jury an alternative defence that is at first
glance incompatible with the primary defence.  The issue is not whether
such a defence is compatible or incompatible with the primary defence, but
whether it meets the air of reality test.  In any case, the trial judge must
determine whether the alternative defence has a sufficient factual foundation,
that is, whether a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could accept the defence
if it believed the evidence to be true.

                    The
defence of abandonment must be submitted to the jury only if there is evidence
in the record that is reasonably capable of supporting the necessary inferences
in respect of each of the elements of this defence.  The defence can be raised
by an accused who is a party to an offence on the basis that he or she did or
omitted to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit the
offence, or abetted any person in committing it (s. 21(1)  of the Criminal Code ), or on the basis that he or she had formed with other persons an
intention to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein and
that an offence was committed in carrying out the common purpose (s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code ), if the evidence shows (1) that there was an intention to
abandon or withdraw from the unlawful purpose; (2) that there was timely
communication of this abandonment or withdrawal from the person in question to
those who wished to continue; (3) that the communication served
unequivocal notice upon those who wished to continue; and (4) that the
accused took, in a manner proportional to his or her participation in the
commission of the planned offence, reasonable steps in the circumstances either
to neutralize or otherwise cancel out the effects of his or her participation
or to prevent the commission of the offence.  There will be circumstances in
which timely and unequivocal communication by the accused of his or her
intention to abandon the unlawful purpose will be considered sufficient to
neutralize the effects of his or her participation in the crime.  But there
will be other circumstances, primarily where a person has aided in the
commission of the offence, in which it is hard to see how timely communication to
the principal offender of the person’s intention to withdraw from the unlawful
purpose will on its own be considered reasonable and sufficient.

                    In
this case, G’s evidence that she communicated her withdrawal from the deadly
plan and that her communication was timely and unequivocal is insufficient. 
The only relevant passage from her testimony is one in which she used the
plural pronoun “we” (using the French pronoun “on” as an equivalent for
the plural “nous”) in saying “I told Marc we couldn’t [do that]”.  But
even if it were assumed that this evidence would be sufficient for a jury to
reasonably conclude that G had communicated her intention to withdraw from the
plan and that her communication was timely and unequivocal, that communication
would not on its own have sufficed, in the circumstances of this case, for the
judge to put the defence of abandonment to the jury.  G did more than merely
promise to take part in the murder‑suicide pact.  She supplied her spouse
with the intoxicants he used to cause the children’s deaths.  She therefore had
to do more either to neutralize the effects of her participation or to prevent
the commission of the offence.  For example, she could have hidden or destroyed
the medication she had purchased, remained watchful and taken the children to a
safe place for the evening, insisted that her spouse give her verbal
confirmation of what he intended to do, or simply called the authorities.  The
record did not therefore contain evidence upon which a properly instructed jury
acting reasonably could have found that G had abandoned the common unlawful
purpose, and could accordingly have acquitted her, if it believed the evidence
to be true.  The defence of abandonment therefore did not meet the air of
reality test, and the trial judge was not required to put the defence to the
jury.

                    Per
Fish J. (dissenting):  Canadian courts have for more than 70 years
held that the defence of abandonment comprises only two essential elements:
(i) change of intention; and (ii) where practical and reasonable,
timely and unequivocal notice of withdrawal.  This test has been
repeatedly and consistently applied in prosecutions under s. 21(1)  and
s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code  alike.  The defence of abandonment
does not require that the accused take steps to neutralize prior participation
in the criminal enterprise or to prevent the commission of the offence.  While
such evidence may strengthen a defence of abandonment, failure to take
neutralizing or preventative steps is not fatal. 

                    In
light of the state of the law universally accepted in Canada at the time of G’s
trial, it would be fundamentally unfair at this stage to fault her for failing
to demonstrate anything more than a change of intention, plus timely and
unequivocal notice of withdrawal from the murder‑suicide pact.  Since G’s
testimony provided some evidence on these two essential elements, there was an
air of reality to the defence.  The trial judge therefore erred by withholding
the defence of abandonment from the jury.  Incompatibility between G’s defence
of abandonment and her primary defence should not be relied upon to deprive the
accused of a defence for which an air of reality has been established.

                    G
testified that she told L his plan did not make sense and he “could not do
it”.  She also told him that she did not want to be a part of it.  She
demonstrated her disapproval of the murder‑suicide pact by tearing up two
documents: a last will and testament written by her and a story of L’s life
containing references to the pact.  She was convinced by his facial expression
that the murder‑suicide pact was off.  This testimony provides some
evidence that G no longer intended to participate in the murder‑suicide
pact and that she provided timely and unequivocal notice of this change of
intention to the principal offender.  That the evidence could have left the
jury with a reasonable doubt as to G’s guilt is all that was required. It was
for the jury to determine whether G’s words and conduct were believable and
sufficient to demonstrate timely and unequivocal notice of withdrawal.  

                    G
is entitled to a fresh trial, where the jury will not be wrongly prevented from
considering on its merits her defence of abandonment, however weak and
unpromising this Court might believe it to be.

I.     Overview

[1]                             
Under Canadian law, individuals who intend to
commit crimes may change their minds and avoid criminal liability by abandoning
that intention.  This appeal concerns, first of all, the circumstances in which
a trial judge may put seemingly incompatible defences to a jury.  Another
question it raises is in what circumstances the trial judge must put the
defence of abandonment to the jury in the context of the form of participation
in a crime provided for in s. 21(1)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1985, c. C‑46 .

[2]                             
The appellant, Cathie Gauthier, was charged with
being a party, together with her spouse, to the murder of their three children
at the dawn of the year 2009.  On October 24 of that same year, upon
completion of a trial by judge and jury, she was convicted on all three counts
of first degree murder.  

[3]                             
She submits that the trial judge erred in
deciding not to put to the jury the defence of abandonment of the common
intention to kill the children.  For reasons that differ from those of the
Court of Appeal, I find that the judge did not err in doing so, and I would
dismiss the appeal.  

II.    Facts

[4]                             
The facts of this case reveal a set of
circumstances, as dramatic as they were tragic, that engendered the despair
that ultimately led to the murder of three young children.  

[5]                             
Before I discuss the questions of law raised by
this appeal, a brief review of the facts is therefore in order. 

[6]                             
The appellant met Marc Laliberté in 2000 and
decided to move in with him in Chibougamau with her daughter Joëlle from a
previous union.  The couple had two other children:  Marc‑Ange, born in
2001, and Louis‑Philippe, born in 2004.  They moved to Amos in 2002. 
Misfortune seemed to dog the family.  The appellant was sexually assaulted, and
this caused her considerable emotional distress as a result of which she was
unable to leave the family home for very long.  Marc Laliberté lost his mother
and fell into a deep depression.  Hoping for better luck, the family left Amos
for Saguenay, where Kathie Ouellet, a childhood friend of the appellant’s,
lived.  Marc Laliberté sold the family home and quit his job, and the family
settled into their new surroundings.  However, their new life got off to a
rough start.  

[7]                             
Once in Saguenay, Marc Laliberté had difficulty
finding a stable job and resigned himself to receiving employment insurance
benefits.  Meanwhile, the appellant was unable to hold on to the few short‑term
jobs she was able to find.  In short, the couple encountered ever greater
financial difficulties, and were forced to make an assignment in bankruptcy in
October 2008.

[8]                             
The holiday season was drawing near.  On
Christmas Eve, despite their bad luck, the couple decided to give the children
the chance to enjoy this “festive” period.  Marc Laliberté refused to pay the
rent for December, and used the money so saved to buy numerous gifts for the
children and for friends.  

[9]                             
On December 27, 2008, the appellant renewed
her and her spouse’s prescriptions for oxazepam, a soporific drug used to treat
anxiety attacks, giving false reasons for doing so early.  She told the
pharmacist that her spouse was going through a difficult period and that they
were about to go on a trip.  While at the drug store, she also purchased some
children’s Gravol.  That same day, the family went to Normandin to visit
members of Marc Laliberté’s family for a few hours.

[10]                         
On December 28, 2008, the appellant sent an
e‑mail message entitled [translation]
“a miracle, please” to the Fondation maman Dion in which, after
recounting the family’s difficulties, she asked for help.  She wrote:
“. . . I would like a miracle for Dec. 31, 2008”.  

[11]                         
The evening of December 29, she visited her
friend Kathie Ouellet and told her that she did not know what she would do with
her children if her spouse was not there.  The next day, the appellant gave her
nicest clothes to Ms. Ouellet.  

[12]                         
On December 31, according to the appellant,
her spouse spent the morning working on the computer, and he turned the screen
off every time she came near.  Around noon, he joined her in the kitchen.  He
told her that he had made a decision and that the whole family would be leaving
together.  He then dictated some documents to her that she wrote down like a
robot, she said, after which she had no memory of what was in them.  Marc
Laliberté then left the house.  According to the appellant, it was then that
she noticed some papers left on the kitchen counter, and after reading them,
she realized what was going on.  When her spouse returned in the afternoon, she
told him she did not agree with the murder‑suicide pact, and she tore up
the documents.  She claimed to have understood from the expression on her
spouse’s face that he had resigned himself to abandoning the dark plan.  

[13]                         
The appellant testified that the rest of the day
was uneventful.  That evening, as planned, the family sat down in front of the
television to watch a movie together.  Marc Laliberté prepared some drinks and
popcorn for all the family.  Shortly after that, the appellant noticed that one
of the boys had fallen asleep, and then she too fell asleep.  She said she
had not suspected that their drinks had been poisoned.  

[14]                         
The physical evidence that was filed included
two torn‑up documents that had been found in the garbage can:  a
handwritten joint will, in the appellant’s hand, and a document prepared on the
computer by Marc Laliberté in which he told his life’s story.  Another copy of
the will, typed out and signed by both spouses, was found on the kitchen
island.  Three handwritten letters from Cathie Gauthier to her friend Kathie
Ouellet, to her biological mother and to her last employer completed the
evidence.  All these letters mentioned that the couple had decided together to
end their and their children’s lives.  Some empty medicine bottles, as well as
the prescriptions for oxazepam and the drug store’s sales slip dated
December 27, 2008, were also found in the kitchen. 

[15]                         
During the evening of January 1, 2009, the
appellant called the emergency services number, asked for an ambulance and told
the operator that her left wrist was slit, saying that [translation] “it was a pact, my husband killed our three
children”, and adding that “we
told ourselves we wouldn’t start 2009, but . . .”.

[16]                         
When first responders arrived on the scene, they
found the appellant with an injured wrist and pronounced her spouse and their
three children dead.  The evidence shows that the children were poisoned with
Gravol and oxazepam.  Traces of oxazepam were also detected in the appellant,
whose left wrist had allegedly been slit by her spouse, Marc Laliberté.

III.    Trial by Judge and Jury

[17]                         
At her jury trial, the appellant submitted in
her defence that she had not bought the medication to poison her children, that
she was in a dissociative state on December 31, 2008 when she wrote the
incriminating documents, and that this state meant she could not have formed
the specific intent to commit the murders.  In the alternative, should her
argument based on the absence of mens rea be rejected, she claimed to
have abandoned the common purpose of killing the children and to have clearly
communicated her intention to do so to her spouse.  

[18]                         
The Crown’s theory was based on the proposition
that the appellant was a party, together with her spouse, to the murder of her
three children in that they planned it together as part of a murder‑suicide
pact and in that she supplied the murder weapon.  She did not act on
December 31, 2008 to prevent the children from being poisoned with the
drinks containing the medication.  Thus, she aided Marc Laliberté to kill the
children.  

[19]                         
In his final instructions, the trial judge told
the jury that three possible verdicts were open to it:  first degree murder,
second degree murder or acquittal.  On whether it was appropriate to put
the defence of abandonment of the common purpose to the jury, the judge pointed
out to counsel, in the jury’s absence, that when the defence of abandonment has
come before Canadian courts, it has been in the context of the form of
participation in a crime provided for in s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code ,
and he questioned the availability of this defence in the context of
s. 21(1) .  Although he mentioned the defence of abandonment in summarizing
the argument of counsel for the appellant for the jury, the judge did not put
this alternative defence to the jury.  After three days of deliberations, the
jury found the appellant guilty of the first degree murder of her three
children.  

[20]                         
Cathie Gauthier appealed that decision to the
Court of Appeal, which upheld the guilty verdict.  Bouchard J.A. concluded
that the trial judge had not erred in refusing to put the defence of
abandonment to the jury.  In his view, an alternative defence that is
incompatible with the defence’s principal theory cannot be put to the jury
(2011 QCCA 1395 (CanLII)). 

IV.    Relevant Provisions

[21]                         
Section 21  of the Criminal Code  reads
as follows:

           21. (1)
[Parties to offence] Every one is a party to an offence who

                              (a)   actually
commits it;

                              (b)   does
or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it; or

                              (c)   abets
any person in committing it.

           (2) [Common intention]
Where two or more persons form an intention in common to carry out an unlawful
purpose and to assist each other therein and any one of them, in carrying out
the common purpose, commits an offence, each of them who knew or ought to have
known that the commission of the offence would be a probable consequence of
carrying out the common purpose is a party to that offence.

V.     Issues

[22]                         
There are two main issues in this appeal. 
First, was it appropriate to exclude the defence of abandonment from the
defences put to the jury on the basis that it was incompatible with the
defence’s principal theory, the absence of mens rea?  If not, did the
defence of abandonment meet the air of reality test?  For the reasons that
follow, I find that the answer to both these questions is no.  

VI.  Analysis

A.    Was It Appropriate to Exclude
the Alternative Defence of Abandonment From the Defences Put to the Jury Solely
Because It Was Theoretically Incompatible With the Defence’s Principal Theory?

                    1.     When It Is
Appropriate to Put a Defence to the Jury

[23]                         
It is well established that any defence with an
air of reality should go to the jury (R. v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29, [2002]
2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 51).  This Court has held that a defence meets the
air of reality test if there is “(1) evidence (2) upon which a
properly instructed jury acting reasonably could acquit if it believed the
evidence to be true” (Cinous, at para. 82).  

[24]                         
The reason why the trial judge is required to
screen the defences that can be put to the jury should be borne in mind.  This
requirement is essentially rooted in a concern not to confuse jurors by putting
to them a defence that lacks an evidential foundation.  This premise gives rise
to two principles:  On the one hand, a trial judge must put to the jury all
defences that arise on the facts, regardless of whether they have been
specifically raised by the accused.  On the other hand, the judge must withhold
from the jury any defences that lack an air of reality.  

[25]                         
The burden on the accused is merely
evidential.  If the trial judge properly applies the relevant principles,
he or she must identify the evidence that is most favourable to the accused and
assume it to be true, regardless of whether it was adduced or mentioned by the
accused.  The judge must not enquire into whether the witnesses are credible or
assess the probative value of this evidence.  If each element of a defence is
supported by direct evidence or may reasonably be inferred from circumstantial
evidence, the judge must put this defence to the jury.  

         2.        Alternative
Defences That Are Incompatible With the Defence’s Principal Theory

[26]                         
The Court of Appeal concluded, on the basis that
the alternative defence of abandonment was incompatible with the appellant’s
principal theory, that the trial judge did not have to put this defence to the
jury: 

                           [translation]  In my opinion, the judge
was right not to draw the jury’s attention to this defence.  I note that,
according to the appellant, there was no suicide pact or planning, and she was
in a dissociative state when her spouse told her of his plan for all of them to
leave together.  She could not therefore be allowed, if she were not believed,
to change her story and maintain that she had pulled out of a plan whose
existence she had been denying from the start.  Taking part in a suicide
pact and then pulling out of it is in itself plausible.  However, that is not
what the appellant is arguing.  Rather, she is denying the very existence of
such a pact and then claiming that she can pull out of it if she is not
believed.  The judge did not have to put to the jury this alternative defence
that is incompatible with the appellant’s principal theory . . . . 
[para. 71]

[27]                         
The Crown takes a more nuanced position, arguing
that, because the effect of the appellant’s primary defence — which was
essentially based on a total absence of mens rea — was that the defence
of abandonment lacked any factual foundation and could not therefore apply,
this alternative defence did not meet the air of reality test:

                           [translation]  Refusing to take part in a
plan and abandoning a plan are defences that are logically incompatible with
one another.  If, throughout the trial, the appellant denies intending to kill
her children, how can she, if she is not believed in this regard, change her
position and say that she withdrew from a plan whose existence she has
previously denied?  The defence of abandonment of a common purpose necessarily
implies a recognition of having been a party to that common purpose, which the
appellant has always denied.  [R.F., at para. 57]

[28]                         
In this case, I agree with the Court of Appeal,
although for different reasons, that the defence of abandonment should not have
been put to the jury.  Let me explain this.  

[29]                         
In Wu v. The King, [1934] S.C.R. 609,
which was mentioned in R. v. Caron (1998), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 84 (Que.
C.A.), a case the Court of Appeal cited with approval, this Court stated that a
judge does not have a duty to put to the jury an alternative defence whose
factual foundation is incompatible with the defence’s principal theory.  In Wu,
the accused, after having raised only an alibi defence at trial, argued on
appeal that the trial judge had erred in not putting to the jury the
alternative defences of self‑defence and provocation.  Lamont J.
made the following comments: 

                    The rule, therefore, that an accused person at
trial is entitled to have the jury pass upon all his alternative defences is
limited to the defences of which a foundation of fact appears in the record. 
Even then the rule, in my opinion, is not without exception, and one exception
is, that it has no application where the accused, by the defence which he sets
up at the trial, has negatived the alternative defence for which he afterwards
seeks a new trial.

. . .

                         . . .
The defence that the accused was in Victoria at the time of the shooting was
not only inconsistent with, but it negatived the defence now sought to be set
up.  Under these circumstances I fail to see how any duty could rest on
the trial judge to instruct the jury to consider an alternative defence which
the accused, by the defence he did set up, declared had no foundation in fact.
[p. 617]

[30]                         
With respect, Wu does not stand for the
proposition that a judge does not have a duty to put to the jury an alternative
defence that is theoretically incompatible with the defence’s principal
theory.  Rather, it reaffirms the cardinal rule that the trial judge need not —
indeed must not — put to the jury a defence in respect of which there is no
evidence in the record that would be sufficient, if it existed and if it were
believed to be true, for a jury acting reasonably to accept the defence.  This
is clear from the comments of Lamont J. on this point, which read in full as
follows: 

                        There
is no doubt that in the trial court an accused person is ordinarily entitled to
rely upon all alternative defences for which a foundation of fact appears in
the record, and, in my opinion, it makes no difference whether the evidence
which forms that foundation has been given by the witnesses for the Crown or
for the accused, or otherwise.  What is essential is, that the record
contains evidence which, if accepted by the jury, would constitute a valid
defence to the charge laid.  Where such evidence appears it is the duty of
the trial judge to call the attention of the jury to that evidence and instruct
them in reference thereto.  The only evidence appearing in the record upon
which even an argument could be founded that the accused shot in self defence
is that of Irwin and Bodner that, prior to the shooting, the complainant was
running after the accused and his companion, waving his arms and shouting in
Oriental.  What he was saying we do not know.  If it were material to the
defence to prove that the words amounted to provocation, the onus was upon the
accused to prove what the words were.  On any event provocation, which
would reduce murder to manslaughter, is not a defence to the charge as laid. 
Shooting in self defence would constitute a valid defence provided the accused
brings himself within sections 53  and 54  of the Criminal Code .  It is
justifiable to repel an unprovoked attack if the force used by the accused is
not meant to cause death or grievous bodily harm and is not more than is
necessary for the purpose of self defence.  It is justified, even if it does
cause death or grievous bodily harm, if it is done under reasonable
apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm to himself, and if he believes,
on reasonable grounds, that it is necessary for his own preservation.  There
is no evidence in the record from which a jury could reasonably infer that the
accused when he shot the complainant did so under a reasonable apprehension of
death or bodily harm to himself, or that he reasonably believed that he could
not otherwise save himself from bodily injury.  [Emphasis added;
pp. 616‑17.]

[31]                         
The passage from Wu quoted in the Court
of Appeal’s reasons, at para. 71, in support of the proposition that the
trial judge is not required to put to the jury an alternative defence that is
incompatible with the primary defence is merely an obiter dictum that
could be a source of confusion and should not be relied on.  An accused might,
for example, raise an alibi defence and testify that he or she was not in the
city where the crime was committed at the relevant time, whereas certain Crown
witnesses say that the accused was at the scene of the crime but was highly
intoxicated.  Even though the defences of alibi and of self‑induced
intoxication are incompatible in theory, the trial judge should, in my view,
put both of them to the jury if they both meet the air of reality test.

[32]                         
More recently, in R. v. Graveline, 2006
SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, this Court clarified the principle that if two
defences are theoretically incompatible, they can nevertheless be put to the
jury so long as they both meet the air of reality test.  Although Fish J.
pointed out that it is dangerous to put theoretically incompatible defences to
a jury, he saw no error in the trial judge’s decision to put to the jury, in
addition to the primary defence of automatism, the alternative defence of self‑defence
the accused wished to raise.  Regarding the incompatibility of the two
defences, Fish J. wrote the following, at para. 10:

                         . . .
the particular defences in issue here — automatism and self‑defence —
are, as the Crown suggested on the hearing of this appeal, incompatible in
theory, though perhaps not always in practice.  That is because self‑defence
implies deliberate conduct that is at odds with the fundamental premise of
automatism, a state of dissociative, involuntary conduct.

[33]                         
Nevertheless, the Court had held in R. v. Faid, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 265, that the trial judge had not
erred in refusing to put the defence of provocation to the jury as an
alternative to the primary defence of self‑defence.  Although it is true
that these two defences are incompatible in theory —
self‑defence involves reasoned conduct, whereas provocation, on the
contrary, presupposes a temporary loss of self‑control — it is important
to point out that the refusal was not based on this incompatibility.  Rather,
the Court found that there was no evidence in the record to support the
argument that the accused had acted in the heat of passion.  That case was not
therefore one in which the effect of the primary defence was to deprive the
alternative defence of the support of evidence that was actually in the
record.  In Faid, the defence of provocation quite simply did not meet
the air of reality test, because there was no evidence related to its
elements.  Faid is one illustration of the principle that any defence
with an air of reality should be put to the jury.  

[34]                         
In conclusion, there is no cardinal rule against
putting to a jury an alternative defence that is at first glance incompatible
with the primary defence.  The issue is not whether such a defence is
compatible or incompatible with the primary defence, but whether it meets the
air of reality test.  In any case, the trial judge must determine whether the
alternative defence has a sufficient factual foundation, that is, whether a
properly instructed jury acting reasonably could accept the defence if it
believed the evidence to be true.

B.     If the Defence of
Abandonment Was Not Incompatible With the Principal Theory, Did It Meet the Air
of Reality Test?

                    1.      Essential
Elements of the Defence of Abandonment

[35]                         
The defence of abandonment had to be submitted
to the jury only if there was evidence in the record that was reasonably
capable of supporting the necessary inferences in respect of each of the
elements of this defence.  That being said, it is necessary to begin by
identifying the essential elements of the defence.  

[36]                         
In Canadian law, the defence of abandonment,
which has rarely been raised, was first referred to in R. v. Whitehouse (1940),
55 B.C.R. 420 (C.A.).  That case concerned the application of the defence in
the specific context of the offence of participation in a crime provided for in
s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code . 

[37]                         
In that context, the relevant test — which was
subsequently endorsed in Miller v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 680, Henderson
v. The King, [1948] S.C.R. 226, and R. v. Kirkness, [1990]
3 S.C.R. 74 — was laid down as follows in Whitehouse, at p. 425:

                    I
would not attempt to define too closely what must be done in criminal matters
involving participation in a common unlawful purpose to break the chain of
causation and responsibility.  That must depend upon the circumstances of each
case but it seems to me that one essential element ought to be established in a
case of this kind:  where practicable and reasonable there must be timely
communication of the intention to abandon the common purpose from those who
wish to dissociate themselves from the contemplated crime to those who desire
to continue in it.  What is “timely communication” must be determined by the
facts of each case but where practicable and reasonable it ought to be such
communication, verbal or otherwise, that will serve unequivocal notice upon the
other party to the common unlawful cause that if he proceeds upon it he does so
without the further aid and assistance of those who withdraw.  The unlawful
purpose of him who continues alone is then his own and not one in common with
those who are no longer parties to it nor liable to its full and final
consequences.  

[38]                         
Thus, it was held that a defence of abandonment
has three essential elements:  (1) there must be an intention to abandon
or withdraw from the unlawful purpose, (2) there must be timely
communication of this abandonment or withdrawal from the person in question to
those who wish to continue, and (3) the notice so communicated to those
who continue to participate in the common purpose must be unequivocal.  

[39]                         
This appeal raises the issue of the application
of the defence of abandonment in the context of the form of participation in a
crime provided for in s. 21(1)  of the Criminal Code . 

[40]                         
The reasons for recognizing the defence of
abandonment in Canadian law bear repeating.  There are two policy reasons in
criminal law for making this defence available to parties to offences.  First,
there is a need to ensure that only morally culpable persons are punished;
second, there is a benefit to society in encouraging individuals involved in
criminal activities to withdraw from those activities and report them.  

[41]                         
This Court implicitly acknowledged that the
defence of abandonment applies in the context of s. 21(1)  in R. v. Bird,
2009 SCC 60, [2009] 3 S.C.R.
638, in which it found that this defence did not meet the air of reality test
in the case of an accused who had aided in the commission of a crime (see also R.
v. Fournier, 2007 QCCA 1822 (CanLII)).  However, since the Court found that
the defence did not have an air of reality in that case, it did not on that
occasion rule on the content of the defence in the specific context of the form
of participation in a crime provided for in s. 21(1)  of the Criminal
Code .  

[42]                         
It is well established that the scope of the
defence of abandonment varies from case to case, depending on the circumstances
(see the above‑quoted passage from Whitehouse, at p. 425). 
In Kirkness, Wilson J. expressed the opinion that the content of
the defence of abandonment depends on the type of offence and on the degree and
form of participation of the accused.  She endorsed, at p. 115, the
following comment by Professor Manson:

                        Looking at the defence of abandoned
intention in respect of parties, the key issues relate to the quality of
withdrawal from the original plan and whether more is required to exculpate. 
These questions take on different significance depending on the form of
accomplice liability in issue and the particular circumstances of a given case.

(A. Manson,
“Re‑codifying Attempts, Parties, and
Abandoned Intentions” (1989), 14 Queen’s L.J. 85, at p. 95)

[43]                         
Wilson J. also noted that there is a
difference between the forms of participation in a crime provided for in
s. 21(1)  and s. 21(2) , respectively, of the Criminal Code :  

                    It is my view that since aiders and abettors
have been treated differently from common intenders by Parliament, some
difference between these two subsections must be recognized.

(Kirkness,
at p. 116)

[44]                         
Section 21(2)  of the Criminal Code 
provides that a person who forms an intention to carry out an unlawful purpose
in common with other persons is a party to an incidental offence committed by
one of those other persons to the same extent as the person who actually
committed it.  This result derives from the first person’s promise to devote
physical and intellectual resources to the achievement of the common unlawful
purpose.  The person’s liability in respect of the incidental offence therefore
stems from his or her decision to participate in carrying out the unlawful
purpose and to contribute resources needed to achieve it.  

[45]                         
In such a context, an intention to withdraw from
the common purpose will — if a timely and unequivocal communication of this
intention is addressed to the co‑conspirators who persist in carrying out
the unlawful purpose — be sufficient for the defence of abandonment to
succeed.  Communicating the intention to abandon the common purpose reduces the
resources available to carry out the unlawful purpose and in so doing cancels
out the effects of the participation of the withdrawing or abandoning person.  

[46]                         
The situation is very different in the context
of the form of participation in a crime provided for in s. 21(1)  of the Criminal
Code .  Aiders and abettors generally do much more than promise their
support in carrying out an unlawful purpose in the future.  They perform
concrete acts to aid the principal offender to commit the offence or to abet
him or her in committing it.  Their criminal liability and their moral culpability
are proportional to these acts and stem from the fact that they have performed
them.  Thus, merely communicating in unequivocal terms their intention to cease
participating in the commission of the offence will not be enough “to break the
chain of causation and responsibility”, to repeat the words of Sloan J.
from Whitehouse.  

[47]                         
Where a person’s
participation in a crime is more than a simple promise to carry out a common
unlawful purpose — where, for example, the person is a party to the offence
within the meaning of s. 21(1)  of the Criminal Code  — requiring an
unequivocal communication of the intention to cease
participating in the commission of the offence (the Whitehouse test)
means that the accused must show that he or she took reasonable steps to neutralize
the effects of his or her participation.  As one author explains, using a
colourful image to make his point, the intention to withdraw must be
accompanied by acts that are likely to cancel out the effects of the acts that
have already been performed to aid or abet the offender:

                    Once the arrow is in the air, it is no use
wishing to have never let it go — “Please God, let it miss!”  The archer is
guilty of homicide when the arrow gets the victim through the heart.  The
withdrawer, it is true, does not merely change his mind:  he withdraws — but
is that relevant if the withdrawal has no more effect on subsequent events
than the archer’s repentance?  [Emphasis added.] 

(J. C. Smith,
Commentary on R. v. Mitchell, [1999] Crim. L.R. 497)

[48]                         
In the Quebec Court of Appeal’s judgment in Fournier,
the accused was convicted of the first degree murder of her husband because she
had hired a contract killer to murder him, had promised and later paid
financial consideration to the killer, and had provided the killer with the
necessary details of time and place and with information needed to identify the
target.  Because of the numerous acts that had been performed to aid in the
commission of the murder, communicating an intention to withdraw by merely leaving the message [translation] “cancel” on the killer’s
answering device was found to be insufficient to exculpate
the accused.  The acts of abandonment were not proportional to the acts
performed in support of the commission of the offence.  

[49]                         
For all these reasons, I would reformulate as
follows the test already established in Whitehouse and Kirkness
for determining whether the defence of abandonment applies, in order to adapt
it specifically to the various degrees and forms of participation in crimes.  

[50]                         
One who is a party to an offence on the basis that
he or she did or omitted to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to
commit the offence, or abetted any person in committing it (s. 21(1)  of the Criminal Code ), or on the basis that he or she had formed with other persons an
intention to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein and
that an offence was committed in carrying out the common purpose (s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code ), may raise the defence of abandonment if the evidence shows 

(1)     that there
was an intention to abandon or withdraw from the unlawful purpose; 

(2)     that
there was timely communication of this abandonment or withdrawal from the
person in question to those who wished to continue;

(3)     that
the communication served unequivocal notice upon those who wished to continue;
and 

(4)     that the accused took, in a manner proportional to his or
her participation in the commission of the planned offence, reasonable steps in
the circumstances either to neutralize or otherwise cancel out the effects of
his or her participation or to prevent the commission of the offence. 

[51]                         
I recognize that there will be circumstances,
even where the accused is a party within the meaning of s. 21(1)  of the Criminal
Code , in which timely and unequivocal communication by the accused of his
or her intention to abandon the unlawful purpose will be considered sufficient
to neutralize the effects of his or her participation in the crime.  But there
will be other circumstances, primarily where a person has aided in the commission
of the offence, in which it is hard to see how timely communication to the principal offender of the
person’s intention to withdraw from the unlawful purpose will on its own be
considered reasonable, and sufficient to meet the test set out in the preceding
paragraph. 

[52]                         
In conclusion, and more specifically in the
context of s. 21(1)  of the Criminal Code , the defence of
abandonment should be put to the jury only if there is evidence in the record
that is capable of supporting a finding that a person who was initially a party
to the carrying out of an unlawful purpose subsequently took reasonable steps
in the circumstances either to neutralize the effects of his or her
participation or to prevent the commission of the offence.

                    2.     Application
to the Case at Bar

[53]                         
In the case at bar, the defence of abandonment
did not have an air of reality.  

[54]                         
The evidence showed that the appellant had
written several documents, including some incriminating letters that were
evidence of the couple’s intention to end their and their children’s lives. 
The couple explained in the letters how they planned to kill the children and
take their own lives:  by intoxication using a soporific drug.  It was the
appellant who purchased the medication that caused the children’s deaths.  

[55]                         
What evidence could therefore have justified the
trial judge’s putting the defence of abandonment to the jury? 

[56]                         
The evidence is incomplete, to say the least.  

[57]                         
The only evidence comes from the appellant’s
testimony that, in the afternoon of December 31, 2008, she had notified
her spouse that she had changed her mind and no longer intended to participate
in the common purpose:

                    [translation]  I noticed some papers he’d
left lying around.  I, I realized what was happening.  I didn’t want that. 
When Marc came back, I, I told him it was crazy, what he was telling me.  I
ripped up the papers.  [A.R., at p. 834]

On cross‑examination,
she made the following statement: 

                    [translation] 
When I saw the papers and looked at what was written on them, I said
that’s crazy.  And I told Marc we couldn’t . . .

. . .

                    I
told Marc he couldn’t do that, that I didn’t want to be part of it.  [Emphasis
added; A.R., at p. 910.]

[58]                         
The appellant also testified that the expression
on her spouse’s face had convinced her that he too had abandoned the sinister
plan:  

                    [translation]  But I gathered from his
face that he was getting the message, too, and that it was all right.  [A.R.,
at p. 913]

[59]                         
Counsel for the appellant argues that, in light
of this evidence, the trial judge had sufficient reasons to put the defence of
abandonment to the jury.  I find this argument wanting.  

[60]                         
In my view, the appellant’s evidence that she
communicated her withdrawal from the deadly plan and that her communication was
timely and unequivocal is insufficient for the purposes of the air of reality
test.  To meet that test, it is not enough to simply identify “some evidence”
or “any evidence”; the evidence must be “reasonably capable of supporting the
inferences required for the defence to succeed” (Cinous, at
paras. 82‑83).

[61]                         
The only relevant passage from the appellant’s
testimony is the one in which she used the plural pronoun “we” (using the
French pronoun “on” as an equivalent for the plural “nous”) in
saying “I told Marc we couldn’t [do that]”.  This passage stands alone
in the appellant’s principal narrative to the effect that she never agreed to
the murder‑suicide pact, that she wrote the incriminating letters while
in a dissociative state and that she told her spouse she disagreed with what he
was planning to do as soon as she realized what it was.  

[62]                         
Nevertheless, even if it were assumed that the
evidence the appellant relies upon would be sufficient for a jury to reasonably
conclude that she had communicated her intention to withdraw from the plan and
that her communication was timely and unequivocal, that communication would not
on its own have sufficed, in the circumstances of this case, for the judge to
put the defence of abandonment to the jury.  

[63]                         
The appellant did more than merely promise to
take part in the murder‑suicide pact.  She supplied her spouse with the
intoxicants he used to cause the children’s deaths.  She therefore had to do
more either to neutralize the effects of her participation or to prevent the
commission of the offence.  For example, she could have hidden or destroyed the
medication she had purchased, remained watchful and taken the children to a
safe place for the evening, insisted that her spouse give her verbal
confirmation of what he intended to do, or simply called the authorities.  

[64]                         
I conclude that the record did not contain
evidence upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could have
found that the appellant had abandoned the common unlawful purpose, and could
accordingly have acquitted her, if it believed the evidence to be true.  The
defence of abandonment therefore did not meet the air of reality test, and the
trial judge was not required to put the defence to the jury. 

VII.  Disposition

[65]                         
For these reasons, I would dismiss the
appeal. 

                    The following
are the reasons delivered by

                    Fish J. (dissenting) — 

I

[66]                         
Justice Wagner has set out with care and sensitivity the tragic and
desperate circumstances that culminated in the murder by the appellant’s
husband of their three children and his own virtually contemporaneous suicide. 

[67]                         
In the wake of that tragedy and despair, the appellant, Cathie Gauthier,
now stands convicted of first degree murder.  And she has been sentenced to
imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole for 25 years.  

[68]                         
The Crown’s case against Ms. Gauthier is that she and her husband
entered a murder-suicide pact that was executed with her help.  She testified
at trial that she had demonstrated her disapproval of the pact before the
children were murdered and had notified her husband of this unwillingness to go
through with the plan. 

[69]                         
Defence counsel urged the trial judge to leave open for the
jury’s consideration Ms. Gauthier’s defence of abandonment.  The trial judge
declined to do so.  The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge on the ground
that it was an [translation] “incompatible
. . . defence”: 2011 QCCA 1395 (CanLII).  Both
courts below erred in law in this regard.

[70]                         
The Court of Appeal did not consider whether the appellant’s defence of
abandonment had an “air of reality” ― that is to say, whether there was
any evidence upon which a properly instructed jury might entertain a reasonable
doubt on that issue.

[71]                         
On the law as it was then understood, the trial judge was bound to put
abandonment to the jury if there was evidence that the appellant (a) had
changed ― or “abandoned” ― her earlier intention to aid or abet the
murder of her children, and (b) had adequately communicated to her husband that
she had withdrawn from their pact.

[72]                         
This Court has repeatedly held that the defence of abandonment includes no
other essential elements.  And our attention has not been drawn to a single
Canadian decision to the contrary, at any level.

[73]                         
In my view, there was evidence at Ms. Gauthier’s trial upon which
a properly instructed jury might well have found that she had abandoned the
suicide pact in respect of which she was charged and convicted of murder.  Or
at least have been left with a reasonable doubt on this issue, which would of
course have sufficed to warrant Ms. Gauthier’s acquittal.

[74]                         
As a matter of law, the appellant is entitled, in my respectful view, to
a fresh trial, where the jury will not be wrongly prevented from considering on
its merits Ms. Gauthier’s defence of abandonment, however weak and unpromising
we might believe it to be.  I am aware of no legal principle that permits us to
deprive her of that right.  

[75]                         
In his thorough and thoughtful reasons, Justice Wagner proposes that we
now adopt additional requirements for a valid defence of abandonment where the
accused, as in this case, has done something to aid or abet the commission of
the offence before satisfying the two established elements of abandonment.  As
we shall see, there are strong reasons of policy and precedent for resisting
the proposed changes.

[76]                         
As we shall see as well, I am not persuaded that the modifications we
endorse should be made applicable on a retrial of the appellant.  But even if
we decide that they are, the appellant would at least be entitled to a fair
opportunity to satisfy those newly recognized requirements.  Her failure to do
so at her first trial ― prior to their recognition by this Court or, it
seems, by any Canadian court ― can hardly deprive Ms. Gauthier of
a proper opportunity to do so now. 

[77]                         
With respect for those who are of a different view, I would therefore
allow the appeal, set aside the appellant’s convictions and order a new trial. 

II

[78]                         
Canadian courts have for more than 70 years held that the defence of
abandonment comprises only two essential elements: (i) change of intention; and
(ii) where practical and reasonable, timely and unequivocal notice of
withdrawal.  

[79]                         
These requirements emanate from R. v. Whitehouse (1940),
55 B.C.R. 420 (C.A.), a decision that has been repeatedly approved and followed
by this Court, as I mentioned earlier, and has long been firmly entrenched in
Canadian law:  see Henderson v. The King, [1948] S.C.R. 226, at pp.
236-37; R. v. de Tonnancourt (1956), 115 C.C.C. 154 (Man. C.A.), at pp.
176 and 201-3; R. v. Merrifield, 1977 CarswellOnt 1806 (C.A.), at para.
3; Miller v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 680, at p. 708; R. v. Wagner
(1978), 8 B.C.L.R. 258 (C.A.), at pp. 260-61; R. v. Joyce (1978), 42
C.C.C. (2d) 141 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 150; R. v. Kirkness, [1990] 3 S.C.R.
74, at p. 89; R. v. Johanson (1995), 166 A.R. 60 (Prov. Ct.), at para.
23; R. v. Fournier, 2002 NBCA 71, 252 N.B.R. (2d) 256, at para. 22; R.
v. McKercher, [2002] O.J. No. 5859 (QL) (Ct. J.), at para. 77; R. v.
Forknall, 2003 BCCA 43, 176 B.C.A.C. 284, at paras. 51-53;
R. v. Lacoursière (2002), 7 C.R. (6th) 117 (Que. C.A.), at paras. 25-29;
R. v. P.K., 2006 ABCA 299, 397 A.R. 318, at para. 12; R. v. S.R.B.,
2009 ABCA 45, 448 A.R. 124, at paras. 10, 19-20 and 24-30, rev’d R. v. Bird,
2009 SCC 60, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 638, at para. 1; R. v. Ball, 2011 BCCA 11,
298 B.C.A.C. 166, at paras. 44-47; and R. v. Leslie,
2012 BCSC 683 (CanLII), at paras. 552-58. 

[80]                         
Justice Wagner does not suggest that the defence of abandonment,
as it stood at the time of Ms. Gauthier’s trial, required anything more than a
change of intention, accompanied by timely and unequivocal notice of
withdrawal.  Rather, my colleague proposes a new and different
test.  

[81]                         
To this end, my colleague distinguishes for present purposes between s.
21(1)  and s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .  The
former deals with liability for aiding or abetting another in the commission of
a specific offence; the latter, with liability for an offence committed by
another in carrying out a common unlawful purpose.

[82]                         
Justice Wagner would impose additional requirements on the defence of
abandonment, particularly with respect to liability under s. 21(1) , where the
accused would need to adduce evidence that he or she took steps to neutralize
any prior contribution to the commission of the offence or, in the alternative,
to prevent the commission of the offence.

[83]                         
With respect, this approach overlooks the fact that both s. 21(1)  and
s. 21(2)  can involve active participation by the accused: see for example Henderson
and Miller. 

[84]                         
Moreover, the Whitehouse test has been repeatedly and
consistently applied in prosecutions under s. 21(1)  and s. 21(2)  alike.

[85]                         
The application of the Whitehouse criteria to an aiding
and abetting case was endorsed very recently by this Court in 2009, and even
more recently by other Canadian courts: Bird (affirming Costigan J.A.’s
dissent); Ball, at paras. 44-47; and Leslie, at
paras. 552-58.

[86]                         
Indeed, Whitehouse itself involved parties to an offence who had
“aided and abetted in the commission of the crime”: p. 424.  They had
“performed part, at least, of the tasks assigned to them”: again, at p. 424. 

[87]                         
It was out of this factual context that the test for abandonment was
born.  And the court identified only two requirements:  the first, change of
intention; the second, timely and unequivocal notice of withdrawal ― that
is, the accused must clearly communicate to the principal “that if he proceeds
upon it he does so without the further aid and assistance of those who
withdraw”: Whitehouse, at p. 425 (emphasis added). 

[88]                         
As the language of this oft-cited passage
makes clear, the Whitehouse test for abandonment expressly
contemplates prior aid and assistance.    

[89]                         
Moreover, to suggest that an accused under either subsection of
s. 21  must neutralize prior involvement disregards an important rationale
of the defence of abandonment, namely, giving the principal offender the
opportunity to abandon the criminal objective.  As Allan Manson explains in
“Re-codifying Attempts, Parties, and Abandoned Intentions” (1989), 14 Queen’s
L.J. 85, at p. 101:

. . . the premise upon which Whitehouse
is based:  “Let it be known, if you go then you go alone.”  Unequivocal
withdrawal and the element of timeliness are sufficiently expansive to
accommodate abettors and aiders alike because, as in Becerra and Gundy,
the aim is to compel the principal to reconsider the objective in time to
abandon it.  This, after all, is the preventative rationale for party
responsibility.  Thus the defence of abandonment as structured in Whitehouse
can apply with equal fairness and effect to all parties including aiders by
interpreting timeliness in relation to the offence and the goal of ultimate
abandonment.

[90]                         
Even the most ardent proponents of a more stringent abandonment
defence recognize that to require neutralizing or preventative steps would
necessitate a change to Canadian law: see M. Campbell, “Turning Back the Clock:
Aiders and the Defence of Abandonment” (2010), 14 Can. Crim. L.R. 1, at pp. 16-17.

[91]                         
Courts in the United Kingdom, approving Whitehouse, have
concluded that neutralizing or preventative steps are not required to establish
abandonment.  In R. v. O’Flaherty, [2004] EWCA Crim 526, [2004] 2 Cr.
App. R. 20 (p. 315), at para. 60, the Court of Appeal acknowledged that whether
an accused has done enough “to demonstrate that he or she is withdrawing from
the joint enterprise . . . is ultimately a question of fact and degree for the jury”. 
The jury should account for “the nature of the assistance and encouragement
already given and how imminent the infliction of the fatal injury or injuries
is, as well as the nature of the action said to constitute withdrawal”.  And,
the court explicitly rejected the proposition that effective withdrawal
requires reasonable steps to prevent the crime:

In cases of assistance it has sometimes been suggested
that, for there to be an effective withdrawal, reasonable steps must have been
taken to prevent the crime.  It is clear, however, this is not necessary. [Para.
60; see also para. 61.]

See also R. v. Otway, [2011]
EWCA Crim 3 (BAILII), at para. 32, where the court held that efforts to prevent
the crime were relevant but not required for withdrawal.

[92]                         
Justice Wagner relies on R. v.
Fournier, 2007 QCCA 1822 (CanLII), to support his position that mere
communication of changed intention should henceforth be insufficient for
abandonment in s. 21(1)  cases (para. 48 of Justice Wagner’s reasons).  However,
in Fournier, unlike this case, the defence of abandonment was not
kept from the jury.  Indeed, the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge
properly instructed the jury that abandonment required timely and unequivocal
notice of withdrawal: Fournier, at paras. 18-20. 

[93]                         
I agree with my colleague that the
internally repentant archer cannot, having let the arrow fly, seek refuge in
the defence of abandonment (para. 47 of Justice Wagner’s reasons).  The defence
fails in Sir John Smith’s illustration not because preventative or neutralizing
steps are required, but rather because notice of withdrawal comes too late, or
not at all. 

[94]                         
These authorities all make clear that the defence of abandonment does
not require that the accused take steps to neutralize prior participation in
the criminal enterprise or to prevent the commission of the offence.  While
such evidence may strengthen a defence of abandonment, failure to take
neutralizing or preventative steps is not fatal.  Thus, for example, in R.
v. Edwards, 2001 BCSC 275 (CanLII), at para. 186, the accused’s efforts to
stop the commission of the offence were treated as evidence that the
Whitehouse requirements were met ― not as additional requirements of
the defence.

[95]                         
If we were to accept that the defence of abandonment now requires that
an accused take steps to neutralize previous assistance or to prevent the
commission of the crime, I am inclined to believe that this change should only
be given prospective effect ― at least in this case.  As Don Stuart
explains in Canadian Criminal Law: A Treatise (6th ed. 2011), at p. 9:
“It is almost universally accepted that the view that judges merely declare
existing law rather than create new law is outmoded and wrong.”  

[96]                         
But on any view of the matter, in light of the state of the law universally
accepted in Canada at the time of the appellant’s trial, it would be
fundamentally unfair at this stage to fault the appellant for failing to
demonstrate anything more than a change of intention, plus timely and
unequivocal notice of withdrawal from the murder-suicide pact.  Since the
appellant’s testimony provided some evidence on these two essential elements,
there was an air of reality to the defence.  The trial judge therefore erred by
withholding the defence of abandonment from the jury.

III

[97]                         
I agree with Justice Wagner that the “incompatibility” between Ms.
Gauthier’s defence of abandonment and her primary defence did not justify the
trial judge’s decision to prevent the jury from considering them both.  And I
am therefore content to add only these brief comments on the issue of
incompatibility.

[98]                         
Incompatibility should not be relied upon to deprive the accused of a
defence for which an air of reality has been established, particularly where
― as in this case ― defence counsel has requested that it be
included in the judge’s charge: A.R., at pp. 1018 and 1037-38.

[99]                         
As Kellock J. stated in Henderson: “It is a paramount principle
of law that when a defence, however weak it may be, is raised by a person
charged, it should be fairly put before the jury”: p. 241.  Taschereau J.
likewise emphasized the accused’s “fundamental right . . . to have all the
features of [the] defence adequately put to the jury”: Henderson, at p.
237. 

IV

[100]                     
For abandonment to be left for the jury, there must be some evidence
upon which a properly instructed jury could form a reasonable doubt on the two
essential elements of the defence: R. v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2
S.C.R. 3, at paras. 2, 49, 52-54 and 83.  In my view, the appellant’s testimony
satisfied this modest evidentiary threshold.

[101]                     
Indeed, there was no suggestion at trial by the Crown― nor finding
by the trial judge or the Court of Appeal ― that the defence of
abandonment lacked an air of reality.  

[102]                     
The appellant testified that she told Marc Laliberté his plan did not make
sense and he [translation] “could
not do it” (“pouvait pas faire ça”).  She also told him that she did not
want to be a part of it.  She demonstrated her disapproval of the
murder-suicide pact by tearing up two documents: a last will and testament written
by the appellant and a story of Marc Laliberté’s life containing references to
the pact.  She was convinced by his facial expression that the murder-suicide
pact was off: A.R., at pp. 834-35 and 910-11. 

[103]                     
This testimony provides some evidence that the appellant
no longer intended to participate in the murder-suicide pact and that she
provided timely and unequivocal notice of this change of intention to the
principal offender.  That the evidence could have left the jury with a
reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt is all that was required. 

[104]                     
Whether the appellant ultimately “did enough” to communicate
timely and unequivocal withdrawal was a question of fact that should have been
left for the jury to decide: P.K., at para. 11; O’Flaherty,
at para. 60; Cinous, at paras. 52 and 54.  

[105]                     
In short, it was for the jury to determine whether the appellant’s words
and conduct were believable and sufficient to demonstrate timely and
unequivocal notice of withdrawal.  As Taschereau J. stated, again in Henderson,
at p. 237:  “The question whether the agreement has been put to an end, must be
judged in view of all the circumstances revealed by the evidence, and I have no
doubt that it is a question for the jury.”  

[106]                     
With respect, I feel bound to conclude that the trial judge, by
declining to instruct on the defence of abandonment, encroached “on the jury’s
traditional function as arbiter of fact”: Cinous, at para. 56.

V

[107]                     
For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the
appellant’s convictions, and order a new trial.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

                    Criminal law — Evidence — Admissibility —
Hearsay — Drug purchase call — Implied Assertions — Implied assertion tendered
for the truth of its contents — Applicability of hearsay rule — Purposive approach — Principled analysis of its
necessity and reliability.

                    After
B was arrested, a caller telephoned B’s cell phone to arrange for a drug
delivery.  A police officer answered B’s cell phone and agreed to deliver the
drugs at the price that B usually charged.  The caller gave his address.  No
effort was made to find and interview him and he was not called as a witness.  The
trial judge concluded that the police officer’s testimony was not hearsay and
admitted the contents of the call.  B was convicted of possessing marijuana and
cocaine for the purposes of trafficking.  A majority of the Court of Appeal allowed
the appeal, ordered a new trial, and held that the evidence should not have
been admitted.

                    Held:
 The appeal should be dismissed and a new trial ordered.

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Fish, Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell, Karakatsanis
and Wagner JJ.:  The hearsay rule reflects the value our criminal justice
system places on live, in‑court testimony.  The defining features of
hearsay are (1) the fact that the statement is adduced to prove the truth
of its contents and (2) the absence of a contemporaneous opportunity to
cross‑examine the declarant.  Hearsay evidence is presumptively
inadmissible as a matter of law.  The issue here is whether this exclusionary rule
applies to express hearsay only, or to implied hearsay as well.  An implied
assertion tendered for the truth of its contents does not stand on a different
footing, with respect to the hearsay rule, than an explicit assertion to the
same effect.  The principled reasons for their presumptive inadmissibility
apply equally to both.  There is no principled reason, in determining their
admissibility, to distinguish between express and implied assertions adduced
for the truth of their content. 

                    Hearsay
evidence is presumptively inadmissible unless it falls under a traditional exception
to the hearsay rule.  If hearsay evidence does not fall under a hearsay exception,
it may still be admitted if, pursuant to the principled analysis, sufficient indicia
of reliability and necessity are established on a voir dire.  Hearsay
evidence is presumptively inadmissible because of the difficulties inherent in
testing the reliability of the declarant’s assertion.  The need for a
functional approach to implied assertions is readily apparent, bearing in mind
the core hearsay dangers of the declarant’s perception, memory, narration and
sincerity. 

                    Here,
no traditional exception applies and the impugned evidence withers on a
principled analysis.  This was a single drug purchase call of uncertain
reliability.  No effort was made to find and interview the caller, still less
to call him as a witness — where the assertion imputed to him could have been
evaluated by the trier of fact in the light of cross‑examination and the
benefit of observing his demeanour.  Although this drug purchase call does not
withstand scrutiny under the principled approach, this need not always be the
case with drug purchase calls.

                    Finally,
the curative proviso of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code 
can have no application in this case, since it cannot be said that there is no
reasonable possibility the verdict would have been different had the telephone
call not been admitted.

                    Per Moldaver J.:
 An implied assertion of a factual proposition is part of the “contents” of a
statement for purposes of the hearsay rule.  Accordingly, the evidence of the
drug purchase call was hearsay because it was introduced to prove that B was in
fact a drug trafficker.  In such cases, however, the real concern under the
principled approach is reliability and it should be the focus of the inquiry.  The
necessity criterion has its purpose, but it is not meant to stifle the
admission of reliable evidence.  Rather, it is founded on society’s interest in
getting at the truth.  For that reason, in cases such as this one — where the
prospect of locating, identifying, and receiving accurate information from a
forthcoming and cooperative caller is remote — if the evidence is reliable, it
should be admitted because its reception into evidence will be necessary in
order to get closer to the truth.  If the evidence is not reliable, it should
be excluded.

                    The
starting point is that a long line of cases have admitted evidence similar to
that at issue here on the basis that it was non-hearsay.  Because judges are
not in the habit of admitting evidence they deem unreliable, these earlier
cases appear to rest on the conclusion that drug purchase calls are reliable
more often than not and, thus, can safely be categorized as non-hearsay.  Even
where such evidence was excluded, the concern was reliability.  The common
thread in these cases is that the evidence’s reliability dictated the answer
with respect to admissibility — and that is the assessment courts should focus
on.

                    The
majority’s analogy to an earlier decision of this Court to support its
conclusion that the police should have tried to find and interview the caller
breaks down upon scrutiny.  There, the police were dealing with a known
declarant who was fully cooperative and forthcoming.  Here, the declarant was
unknown.  Apart from officer safety concerns, the likelihood of the police
finding the declarant would seem slim.  And the prospect of the declarant being
forthcoming and cooperative, if found, would seem even slimmer.  The necessity
criterion was thus met.

                    Although
it is perfectly consistent with the principled approach that even a single drug
purchase call may meet the threshold test for reliability, the Crown failed in
this case to establish that the call meets the test justifying its admission as
substantive evidence that B was engaged in drug trafficking.  Even if the
caller was entirely sincere in his belief that B was a drug dealer, that does
not address why the caller believed what he believed — and whether his belief
was in fact true or not.  This is not a case of multiple calls, where common
sense tells us that the probability of numerous callers all being mistaken is
unlikely.  Nor do we have sufficient indicia of reliability, either within the
statement or in the form of confirmatory evidence outside the statement.  Had
the circumstances been somewhat different, there may well have been a
satisfactory basis for evaluating whether the caller believed B was a drug
dealer and whether that belief was in fact true.  That is what threshold
reliability requires.

                    The
judgment of McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Fish, Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell,
Karakatsanis and Wagner JJ. was delivered by

                    Fish J. — 

I

[1]                             
An out-of-court statement by a person not called
as a witness in the proceedings is properly characterized as hearsay where it
is tendered in evidence to make proof of the truth of its contents.

[2]                             
It is undisputed on this appeal that hearsay
evidence is presumptively inadmissible as a matter of law.

[3]                             
The sole issue is whether this exclusionary rule
applies to “express hearsay” only, or to “implied hearsay” as well.  As a
matter of logic and of principle, I am satisfied that it does.  

[4]                             
In both instances, the relevance of the
out-of-court statement is not that the statement was made, but rather what
the content of the statement purports to prove.  And, in both instances,
what the statement purports to prove is the truth of what the person not called
as a witness is alleged to have asserted ― expressly or by implication.  

[5]                             
With respect to their logical relevance, there
is thus no substantive distinction between express and implied hearsay.  The
principled reasons for their presumptive inadmissibility apply equally to both.

[6]                             
For these reasons and the reasons that follow, I
agree with the majority in the Court of Appeal that the impugned out-of-court
statement in issue here ought to have been excluded by the trial judge.  It
falls within no traditional exception to the hearsay rule and lacks the indicia
of necessity and reliability that might otherwise render it admissible.

[7]                             
Accordingly, I would dismiss the Crown’s appeal
to this Court against the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

II

[8]                             
The respondent was convicted at his trial before
judge alone of possessing marijuana and cocaine for the purposes of
trafficking, contrary to s. 5(2)  of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act,
S.C. 1996, c. 19 .  

[9]                             
His appeal was allowed by a majority of the
Ontario Court of Appeal and a new trial ordered.  The Crown appeals to this
Court as of right, pursuant to s. 693(1) (a) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , on the questions of law on which the dissent of Watt J.A.
was based.

[10]                         
Since I agree with the Court of Appeal that a
new trial is warranted, I shall refer to the facts only to the extent necessary
to dispose of this appeal.

[11]                         
On May 11, 2006, Cornwall police officers
Sergeant Shawn Martelle and Constable Robert Ouellette responded to a suspected
break-in at the apartment of a certain Eric Lepage.  They knocked on the door
and a man, who identified himself as Chris Baldree, allowed them in.  The
officers entered and immediately detected an odour of marijuana, and discovered
marijuana “joints” and small marijuana buds in an ashtray.

[12]                         
In the closet of the spare bedroom, Sgt.
Martelle found an open safe containing a sandwich bag filled with 90 grams of
cocaine ― and, beside the safe, a large cardboard box with one ziplock
bag containing 511 grams of marijuana.

[13]                         
Mr. Baldree was arrested along with three other
people found in the apartment.  The police seized from him a cellular telephone
and some cash found in his possession.

[14]                         
At the police station, Mr. Baldree’s phone was
ringing.  Sgt. Martelle answered.  At trial, he described the call as follows:

A.  A
male voice on the other end of the, of the phone advised that he was at 327 Guy
Street and that he was a friend of Megan and asked for Chris.  Knowing that there
were two Chris that I had just arrested, I asked, “Chris who?” the male
advised, “Baldree” and requested one ounce of weed.  I then stated that I was
now running the, the show here and that Mr. Baldree was not here and I was
gonna take his . . . .

 

THE
COURT: All right, sorry, asked for Chris.

 

A.  Yes,
I’m sorry Your Honour.

 

THE
COURT: Yes.

 

A.  And
I questioned him, I asked him, “Chris who?” and he answered, “Baldree”.

 

THE
COURT: Yes.

 

A.  He
asked for one ounce of weed.  I then asked him how much Chris charges him, he
says he pays $150.  I then advised him I would deliver same, 327 Guy, and that
was the end of the conversation. [A.R., vol. II, at p. 76]

The police made no effort
at all to contact the caller at the address he provided.

[15]                         
Counsel for the accused promptly objected to
this testimony on the ground that it was inadmissible hearsay.  The trial judge
disagreed.  He found the evidence to be “non-hearsay”, a convenient term I
shall adopt throughout, on the basis of R. v. Ly, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 698,
and R. v. Edwards (1994), 91 C.C.C. (3d) 123 (Ont. C.A.), aff’d on other
grounds, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128.  

[16]                         
In the judge’s view:

Whether these calls can be referred to
as admissible hearsay or simply statements of state of mind, the law holds that
they are admissible as circumstantial evidence to indicate a person engaged in
drug trafficking.  They are not tendered in evidence for the truth of the fact
that the individual phoning is in fact the individual whom the individual
states to be or that the individual in fact will carry out the trafficking of
the drugs.  As stated, it is circumstantial evidence of an individual engaged
in the trafficking of drugs. [A.R., vol. I, at pp. 22-23]

[17]                         
Having concluded that Sgt. Martelle’s testimony
was not hearsay, the trial judge found it unnecessary to weigh its probative
value against its prejudicial effect.

III

[18]                         
All three justices in the Ontario Court of
Appeal wrote separate reasons.  Feldman and Blair JJ.A. allowed the appeal and
ordered a new trial; Watt J.A., dissenting, would have dismissed the appeal.

[19]                         
Feldman J.A. disagreed with the trial judge’s
characterization of the phone call as circumstantial evidence indicating that
Mr. Baldree was engaged in drug trafficking.  On the contrary, in her view,
“admitting the contents of [the] call into evidence is admitting that evidence
for a hearsay purpose.  It is the implied assertion of the caller, untested by
cross-examination, that the accused is a drug dealer” (para. 140).  

[20]                         
Feldman J.A. found that the trial judge thus
erred by focusing “on the truth of whether the caller really wanted to purchase
drugs, which was of course irrelevant, and not on the implied assertion in the
request” (para. 144).

[21]                         
Citing the reasons of the majority of the House
of Lords in R. v. Kearley, [1992] 2 All E.R. 345, and the opinion of
McMurtry C.J.O. in R. v. Wilson (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A.), Feldman
J.A. concluded that the hearsay analysis should not hinge on whether the
assertion is express or implied (para. 140).

[22]                         
She found that the telephone call was hearsay
and should not have been admitted as evidence against Mr. Baldree because it
could not withstand scrutiny under the principled approach to the hearsay
rule.  Regarding necessity, the police had the caller’s address, yet made no
effort to contact him; as to reliability, there was simply no basis to test the
caller’s belief without subjecting him to cross-examination (para. 146).  

[23]                         
Feldman J.A. also concluded that the evidence
was inadmissible because its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial
effect (para. 147).

[24]                         
Feldman J.A. declined to apply the curative
proviso of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  and
therefore held that the trial judge’s error required a new trial.  Particularly
in light of Crown counsel’s characterization of the drug purchase call as the
strongest piece of evidence against the accused, Feldman J.A. could not
conclude that the improper admission of Sgt. Martelle’s testimony had no effect
on the verdict (para. 149).

[25]                         
In separate but concurring reasons, Blair J.A.
was uncertain whether the impugned evidence constituted hearsay.   In any
event, he considered it preferable “for jurists to spend less time focusing on
the characterization of evidence into ‘hearsay’ or ‘non-hearsay’ categories in
these types of close-call scenarios and to spend more effort focusing on the
principled criteria of necessity/reliability and prejudice vs. probative value”
(para. 155).

[26]                         
Accordingly, Blair J.A. found it unnecessary to
“cut the ‘hearsay’ Gordian knot to resolve this appeal” because the impugned
evidence failed on both an assessment of its necessity and reliability and on
weighing its probative value against its prejudicial effect (para. 156).

[27]                         
In his dissenting reasons, Watt J.A. agreed with
the trial judge that this Court’s decision in Ly held that evidence of a
single drug purchase call is admissible as non-hearsay (para. 73).

[28]                         
According to Watt J.A., a principled analysis
was unnecessary on these facts because the impugned evidence was not hearsay. 
He disagreed with his colleagues that the evidence should have been excluded on
the basis that its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value (paras.
95-98).

[29]                         
In the alternative, Watt J.A. was of the view
that even if the drug purchase call was improperly admitted at trial, the
conviction should nevertheless stand pursuant to the curative proviso (para.
99).

IV

[30]                         
The defining features of hearsay are (1) the
fact that the statement is adduced to prove the truth of its contents and (2)
the absence of a contemporaneous opportunity to cross-examine the declarant:  R.
v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at para. 56.  As Justice
Charron explained in Khelawon, at para. 35, the hearsay rule
reflects the value our criminal justice system places on live, in-court testimony:

Our adversary system puts a premium on
the calling of witnesses, who testify under oath or solemn affirmation, whose
demeanour can be observed by the trier of fact, and whose testimony can be
tested by cross-examination.  We regard this process as the optimal way of
testing testimonial evidence.  Because hearsay evidence comes in a different
form, it raises particular concerns.  The general exclusionary rule is a
recognition of the difficulty for a trier of fact to assess what weight, if
any, is to be given to a statement made by a person who has not been seen or
heard, and who has not been subject to the test of cross-examination.  The fear
is that untested hearsay evidence may be afforded more weight than it
deserves.  

[31]                         
In short, hearsay evidence is presumptively
inadmissible because of the difficulties inherent in testing the reliability of
the declarant’s assertion.  Apart from the inability of the trier of fact to
assess the declarant’s demeanour in making the assertion, courts and commentators
have identified four specific concerns.  They relate to the declarant’s
perception, memory, narration, and sincerity: Khelawon, at para. 2; R.
v. Starr, 2000 SCC 40, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, at para. 159.  

[32]                         
First, the declarant may have misperceived
the facts to which the hearsay statement relates; second, even if correctly
perceived, the relevant facts may have been wrongly remembered; third,
the declarant may have narrated the relevant facts in an unintentionally
misleading manner; and finally, the declarant may have knowingly
made a false assertion.  The opportunity to fully probe these potential
sources of error arises only if the declarant is present in court and subject
to cross-examination.

[33]                         
Over the years, a number of common law
exceptions were recognized, based on the belief that an overly rigid
application of the exclusionary rule would impede the truth-finding process. 
As J. H. Wigmore explains:

The theory of the Hearsay rule
. . . is that the many possible sources of inaccuracy and untrustworthiness
which may lie underneath the bare untested assertion of a witness can best be
brought to light and exposed, if they exist, by the test of cross-examination. 
But this test or security may in a given instance be superfluous; it may be
sufficiently clear, in that instance, that the statement offered is free from
the risk of inaccuracy and untrustworthiness, so that the test of
cross-examination would be a work of supererogation.  Moreover, the test may be
impossible of employment — for example, by reason of the death of the declarant
—, so that, if his testimony is to be used at all, there is a necessity for
taking it in the untested shape.  

 

(Wigmore on
Evidence (2nd ed. 1923), vol. III, at §1420, quoted with approval in R.
v. Smith, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915, at p. 929.) 

[34]                         
Beginning with R. v. Khan, [1990] 2
S.C.R. 531, the Court has moved away from a set of judicially created
exceptions to the hearsay rule, and instead mandated a purposive approach,
governed by a principled framework set out this way by McLachlin C.J. in R.
v. Mapara, 2005 SCC 23, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 358, at para. 15:

(a)   Hearsay evidence is presumptively inadmissible unless it falls
under an exception to the hearsay rule.  The traditional exceptions to the
hearsay rule remain presumptively in place.

 

(b)   A hearsay exception can be challenged to determine whether it
is supported by indicia of necessity and reliability, required by the
principled approach.  The exception can be modified as necessary to bring it
into compliance.

 

(c)   In “rare cases”, evidence falling within an existing exception
may be excluded because the indicia of necessity and reliability are lacking in
the particular circumstances of the case.

 

(d)   If hearsay evidence does not fall under a hearsay exception,
it may still be admitted if indicia of reliability and necessity are
established on a voir dire.

[35]                         
The hearsay rule, like many others, is easier to
state than to apply.  

[36]                         
No evidence is hearsay on its face.  As
mentioned at the outset, its admissibility depends on the purpose for which
it is sought to be admitted.  Evidence is hearsay — and presumptively
inadmissible — if it is tendered to make proof of the truth of its contents.

V

[37]                         
Plainly, in this case, the Crown adduced Sgt.
Martelle’s evidence as proof of the truth of its contents.  Since the declarant
was not called to testify, Sgt. Martelle’s testimony constituted hearsay and
was therefore presumptively inadmissible.  Accordingly, in my view, the trial
judge erred in failing to subject the evidence to a principled analysis.

[38]                         
Sergeant Martelle testified, it will be
recalled, that someone claiming to be a resident of 327 Guy Street called the
cell phone which Sgt. Martelle had seized from Chris Baldree, asked for Mr.
Baldree, and requested an ounce of marijuana for the price of $150.  

[39]                         
I agree with Feldman J.A. that the Crown did not
offer this testimony as circumstantial evidence that the respondent was engaged
in drug trafficking.  Rather, the Crown asked the trier of fact to conclude,
based on Sgt. Martelle’s testimony, that the unknown caller intended to
purchase marijuana from the respondent because he believed the respondent to
be a drug dealer.  The relevance of the statement thus hinges on the truth
of the declarant’s underlying belief.  Any inference that can be drawn from the
statement necessarily assumes its veracity.

[40]                         
Had the caller stated that he wanted to buy
drugs from Mr. Baldree because Mr. Baldree sells drugs, this
would have amounted to an express assertion that Mr. Baldree is a drug dealer. 
Thus framed, the caller’s assertion would doubtless have constituted hearsay.  

[41]                         
But the caller stated instead that he was
calling because he wished to purchase drugs from Mr. Baldree.  His
assertion that Mr. Baldree is a drug dealer was no less manifest in substance,
though implicit rather than explicit in form.  In the Crown’s submission,
implied assertions are not caught by the hearsay rule and the telephone
conversation was presumptively admissible for that reason.

[42]                         
In my view, the hearsay nature of this evidence
cannot be made to depend on how the declarant framed his request.  Such a
formalistic analysis disregards the purposive approach to the hearsay rule
adopted by this Court.  Indeed, “it seems absurd that anything should turn on
the grammatical form of the declarant’s assertions”:  L. Dufraimont, Annotation
to R. v. Baldree (2012), 92 C.R. (6th) 331, at p. 334.  

[43]                         
There is no principled or meaningful distinction
between (a) “I am calling Mr. Baldree because I want to purchase drugs from
him” and (b) “I am calling Mr. Baldree because he sells drugs”. In either form,
this out-of-court statement is being offered for an identical purpose:  to
prove the truth of the declarant’s assertion that Mr. Baldree sells drugs.  No
trier of fact would need to be a grammarian in order to understand the import
of this evidence. 

[44]                         
The need for a functional approach to implied
assertions is readily apparent, bearing in mind the core hearsay dangers of
perception, memory, narration, and sincerity.

[45]                         
It has been argued that the danger of lack of
sincerity is sometimes diminished for implied assertions.  This is because
“[i]f a declarant possesses no intention of asserting anything, it would seem
to follow that he also possesses no intention of misrepresenting anything”: P.
R. Rice, “Should Unintended Implications of Speech be Considered Nonhearsay?
The Assertive/Nonassertive Distinction Under Rule 801(a) of the Federal Rules
of Evidence” (1992), 65 Temp. L. Rev. 529, at p. 531.  

[46]                         
But the other hearsay dangers clearly remain
operative, and may in fact increase when an individual “states” something by
implication:

Looked at from the point of
view of the four hearsay dangers, there is a much reduced risk of lies if the
declarant did not intend to convey that which his statement is relied upon to
prove, particularly if he it [sic] was not his purpose to make a
representation of fact at all.  But the other hearsay dangers remain, that is,
the risk of misperception, false memory (unless the implied assertion concerns
the declarant’s own state of mind) and ambiguity.  Indeed the last danger may
be magnified.  When X says:  “Is Z in there?” does this imply that Z is not
with X and nothing more, or that Z is not with X and X wants Z, or Z is in
danger, or X wants to know where Z is?  The upshot is that in many situations
implied assertions depend for their value on the reliability of the declarant
just as much as express assertions. [Emphasis added.]

 

(H. M. Malek et al.,
eds., Phipson on Evidence (17th
ed. 2010), at p. 889)

Moreover, even
insincerity remains a concern with implied assertions:

         If the justification for the
assertive/nonassertive distinction is the absence of the insincerity problem,
and through that guarantee of sincerity a reduced level of perception, memory,
and ambiguity problems, this justification cannot be applied to implied
statements from speech.  Speech is a mechanism of communication; it is
virtually always used for the purpose of communicating something to someone. 
It is illogical to conclude that the question of sincerity is eliminated and
that the problem of unreliability is reduced for unintended implications of
speech if that speech might have been insincere in the first instance, relative
to the direct message intentionally communicated.  If potential insincerity is
injected into the utterance of words that form the basis for the implied
communication, the implication from the speech is as untrustworthy as the
utterance upon which it is based.  [Rice, at p. 534]

[47]                         
In short, “if the standard for comparing express
and implied assertions is the quantity of dangers each entails, they are
indistinguishable”: T. Finman,
“Implied Assertions as Hearsay: Some Criticisms of the Uniform Rules of
Evidence” (1962), 14 Stan. L. Rev. 682, at p.
689.  

[48]                         
Accordingly, there is no principled reason, in
determining their admissibility, to distinguish between express and implied
assertions adduced for the truth of their contents.  Both function in precisely
the same way.  And the benefits of cross-examining the declarant are not
appreciably different when dealing with one form of testimony than the other. 
If an out-of-court statement implicates the traditional hearsay dangers, it
constitutes hearsay and must be dealt with accordingly.

[49]                         
In the present matter, the trial judge and the
dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal both found that this Court had decided
otherwise in Ly.  With respect, I disagree.  

[50]                         
Ly concerned the
admissibility of a telephone conversation between a police officer who had
called a suspected “dial-a-dope” operation and the person who answered his
call.  The officer had called to arrange for the purchase and delivery of
drugs.  And the appellant, drugs in hand, later showed up at the agreed-upon
time and place — where he was promptly arrested and charged with possession of
drugs for the purpose of trafficking. 

[51]                         
The trial judge characterized as hearsay, and
excluded for that reason, evidence of the police officer’s conversation with
the person who had answered his call.  On an appeal by the Crown, the Alberta
Court of Appeal disagreed.  It found that the impugned conversation was
admissible as “part of the narrative”, since “[i]t was impossible to understand
the development of the later events without the evidence of the telephone
conversation which preceded them” ((1996), 193 A.R. 149, at para. 3). 

[52]                         
In brief oral reasons, this Court agreed with
the Court of Appeal that evidence of the conversation was improperly excluded
at trial.  The Court noted that the conversation was tendered to explain why
the appellant appeared at the designated time and place in possession of the
drugs — and not, as in the case that concerns us here, for the truth of its
contents:  Ly, at para. 3.  

[53]                         
I see nothing in Ly to suggest — let
alone decide — that an implied assertion tendered for the truth of its contents
stands on a different footing, with respect to the hearsay rule, than an
explicit assertion to the same effect.  Unlike Ly, that is the issue
here.

[54]                         
And the issue now comes before us for the first
time, though it has for at least half a century divided lower courts in several
provinces:  see, for example, R. v. Fialkow, [1963] 2 C.C.C. 42 (Ont.
C.A.); Edwards; Wilson; R. v. Lucia, 2010 ONCA 533 (CanLII);
R. v. Cook (1978), 10 B.C.L.R. 84 (C.A.); R. v. Nguyen, 2003 BCCA
556, 188 B.C.A.C. 218; R. v. Parchment, 2004 BCSC 1806 (CanLII); R.
v. Williams, 2009 BCCA 284, 273 B.C.A.C. 86; R. v. Graham, 2013 BCCA
75 (CanLII); R. v. Ramsum, 2003 ABQB 45, 329 A.R. 370.

VI

[55]                         
The highest courts of England and Wales, and
Australia, have likewise concluded that the hearsay rule governs implied
assertions, only to have these decisions reversed by statute: see Kearley;
R. v. Bannon (1995), 132 A.L.R. 87 (H.C.); Criminal Justice Act 2003
(U.K.), 2003, c. 44, s. 115; Evidence Act 1995 (Aust.), No. 2, s.
59(1).  

[56]                         
In Canada, Parliament has not found it necessary
or appropriate to adopt legislation classifying implied assertions as
non-hearsay.  This is, of course, entirely understandable in view of our
principled and more flexible approach to exclusion.

[57]                         
As noted by Feldman J.A., the facts in Kearley,
the leading British decision, were similar to the facts in this case.  In Kearley,
the police raided the home of the accused on suspicion that he was selling
drugs.  Drugs were found, but in insufficient quantities to support an
inference of drug trafficking.  While the police were present at the accused’s
residence, they intercepted ten telephone calls from callers asking to purchase
drugs from him.  Seven people also came to the apartment seeking to buy
narcotics.  

[58]                         
The majority of the House of Lords concluded
that the drug purchase calls and the in-person statements were inadmissible
hearsay.  Because they were phrased as requests for drugs, the statements did
not directly assert but instead implied that the accused was a drug dealer. 
However, whether stated expressly or impliedly, their Lordships found the
information communicated to be the same.  In Lord Ackner’s words:

                           .
. . if the inquirer had said in the course of making his request, “I would like
my usual supply of amphetamine at the price which I paid you last week” . . ., the
hearsay rule prevents the prosecution from calling police officers to recount
the conversation which I have described. . . . 

 

                           If
[however] the simple request or requests for drugs to be supplied by the appellant,
as recounted by the police, contains in substance, but only by implication, the
same assertion, then I can find neither authority nor principle to suggest that
the hearsay rule should not be equally applicable and exclude such evidence. 
What is sought to be done is to use the oral assertion, even though it may be
an implied assertion, as evidence of the truth of the proposition asserted. 
That the proposition is asserted by way of necessary implication rather than
expressly cannot, to my mind, make any difference. [pp. 363-64]

[59]                         
Two main reasons have been urged against
applying the hearsay rule to implied assertions.  

[60]                         
First, as Watt. J.A. states (at para. 83) and as
the Crown argues, excluding implied assertions as hearsay has the potential of
broadening the exclusionary rule, given that “[v]irtually every human action is
based on some set of assumptions implicitly accepted and, on this approach,
‘asserted’ by the actor” (A.F., at para. 62, quoting McWilliams’ Canadian
Criminal Evidence (4th ed. (loose-leaf)), at p. 7-21).  

[61]                         
Second, as critics of Kearley have
pointed out, applying the hearsay rule to implied assertions such as drug
purchase calls has the potential to deprive the trier of fact of reliable
evidence and thereby impede the truth-finding process:  see, for example, D.
Birch, “Criminal Justice Act 2003 (4) Hearsay:  Same Old Story, Same Old
Song?”, [2004] Crim. L.R. 556, at pp. 564-65.

[62]                         
The short answer to the first argument is that
we are not concerned on this appeal with the application of the hearsay rule to
assertions implied through non-verbal conduct.  Our concern, rather, is with a
quintessentially verbal statement. 

[63]                         
The issue of the applicability of the hearsay
rule to inferences that can be drawn from non-verbal conduct is best left for
another day.  For present purposes, I find it sufficient to say that “one can
engage in conduct without ever intending to communicate anything to anyone
[but] the same is not true of speech or a combination of speech and conduct
(for example, placing a bet) because the sole purpose of speech is
communication”:  Rice, at p. 536 (emphasis in original).

[64]                         
The second concern mentioned above is greatly
attenuated, I again emphasize, by Canada’s principled approach to hearsay.  

[65]                         
In Kearley, having found the evidence in
that case to be hearsay, it was automatically excluded because it did not fall
within a traditional exception to the hearsay rule.  

[66]                         
The Canadian approach suffers from no such
inflexibility.  Under our law, hearsay evidence that is not admissible under a
traditional exception may nonetheless be admitted pursuant to a principled
analysis of its necessity and reliability.  This “sensible scheme” recognizes
that “some implied assertions, like some express assertions, will be highly
reliable even in the absence of cross-examination”:  Finman, at p. 693. 
Pursuant to its terms, implied assertions that are necessary and reliable may
be admitted while those that are unreliable or unnecessary will be excluded.

VII

[67]                         
On the facts of this case, no traditional exception
applies and the impugned evidence withers on a principled analysis.  It
satisfies neither the requirement of necessity nor the requirement of
reliability. 

[68]                         
In Khelawon, necessity was conceded. 
Justice Charron nonetheless took care to note that

in an appropriate case, the court in
deciding the question of necessity may well question whether the proponent of
the evidence made all reasonable efforts to secure the evidence of the
declarant in a manner that also preserves the rights of the other party. 
[para. 104]

This is the kind of “appropriate
case” contemplated by Khelawon.  And the answer is that the police made
no effort at all to secure the evidence of the declarant: they never sought
to interview or even find him, though he gave them his address. 
Moreover, there was no explanation offered as to why no efforts were made to
locate the declarant.

[69]                         
Nor is the single telephone call in this case
sufficiently reliable.  As Feldman J.A. found in the court below, “[t]here was
no basis to say that the caller’s belief was reliable without testing the basis
for that belief by cross-examination” (para. 146).  Indeed, this is not a
situation “in which it can be easily seen that such a required test [i.e.,
cross-examination] would add little as a security, because its purposes had
been already substantially accomplished”:  Khelawon, at para. 62,
quoting Wigmore on Evidence, at §1420. 

[70]                         
In concluding as I have, I take care not to be
understood to have proposed a categorical rule for drug purchase calls. 
Although the call at issue here does not withstand scrutiny under the
principled approach, this need not always be the case.  

[71]                         
For example, where the police intercept not one
but several drug purchase calls, the quantity of the calls might well suffice
in some circumstances to establish reliability — indeed, while “[o]ne or two
might [be] mistaken, or might even have conspired to frame the defendant as a
dealer”, it would “def[y] belief that all the callers had made the same error
or were all party to the same conspiracy”: I. H. Dennis, The Law of Evidence
(4th ed. 2010), at p. 708. 

[72]                         
Moreover, the number of callers could also
inform necessity.  The Crown cannot be expected, where there are numerous
declarants, to locate and convince most or all to testify at trial, even in the
unlikely event that they have supplied their addresses — as in this case.  And
it is important to remember that the criteria of necessity and reliability work
in tandem:  if the reliability of the evidence is sufficiently established, the
necessity requirement can be relaxed:  see Khelawon, at para. 86, citing
R. v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740, and R. v. U. (F.J.), [1995]
3 S.C.R. 764.

[73]                         
Here, we are presented with a single drug
purchase call of uncertain reliability.  The caller gave his address.  No
effort was made to find and interview him, still less to call him as a witness
— where the assertion imputed to him could have been evaluated by the trier of
fact in the light of cross-examination and the benefit of observing his
demeanour. 

VIII

[74]                         
Manifestly, the curative proviso of s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  can have no application in this case, since it
cannot be said that there is no reasonable possibility that the verdict would
have been different had the impugned telephone call not been admitted:  R.
v. Bevan, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599, at p. 617.  

[75]                         
Indeed, in summing up, Crown counsel described
the impugned telephone call as the strongest piece of evidence in the case
(A.R., vol. IV, at p. 127).  In counsel’s words, “the cell phone call placing
the order seals the story as far as I’m concerned” (p. 138).  Moreover, the
trial judge referred to the phone call in his reasons for judgment and took it
into account when assessing Mr. Baldree’s credibility (A.R., vol. I, at p.
29).  

[76]                         
In this light, it can hardly be stated that the
improper admission of this evidence could not have affected the result at trial.

IX

[77]                         
For all of these reasons, I would dismiss this
appeal, affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal, set aside the respondent’s
conviction, and order a new trial. 

                    The
following are the reasons delivered by

                    Moldaver J. — 

I.       Overview

[78]                         
I join my colleague Fish J. in rejecting this
drug purchase call under the principled approach to hearsay, and I agree in
the main with his opinion.  In particular, I agree that an implied assertion of
a factual proposition is part of the “contents” of a statement for purposes of
the hearsay rule.  Indeed, while the parties disagree, the intervener Attorney
General of Ontario advances that very view.  

[79]                         
I write separately, however, to underscore my
reservations with Part VII of my colleague’s reasons, which deal with the
criteria of necessity and reliability under the principled approach.  In
particular, I am concerned by my colleague’s approach to necessity.  That
criterion has its purpose, but we ought not to approach it as a box that must
invariably be checked off before drug purchase calls like this one can be
admitted.  In such cases, the real concern is reliability — and that, in my
respectful view, should be the focus of our inquiry.

[80]                         
The starting point is the recognition that we
are today characterizing as hearsay — and thus presumptively inadmissible —
evidence which has long been received by the courts as circumstantial
evidence.  It is not a step to be undertaken lightly.  Nonetheless, I believe
it is the right one.  As my colleague observes, the characterization of a particular
piece of evidence as hearsay should not hinge on the declarant’s particular
choice of words (paras. 42-43).  Rather, the focus should be on the existence
(or non-existence) of the hearsay dangers having regard to the purpose for
which the out-of-court statement is being tendered.

[81]                         
Thus, I agree that judges must satisfy
themselves of the reliability of drug purchase calls on a case-by-case basis. 
If the evidence is reliable, it should be admitted because its reception
will be necessary in order to get closer to the truth.  If it is not
reliable, the evidence should stay out.  The only difference between yesterday
and today should be that in characterizing implied assertions as hearsay, we
avoid the thorny debate about what the declarant did or did not intend to
assert and, instead, put the focus on what truly matters in cases such as this
one:  “. . . whether the evidence is sufficiently reliable to warrant its
reception” (A. W. Bryant, S. N. Lederman and M. K. Fuerst, The Law
of Evidence in Canada (3rd ed. 2009), at p. 244).  

[82]                         
Here, for reasons I will explain, this call
cannot be said to be sufficiently reliable.  Accordingly, I agree that it
should have been excluded.

II.       Analysis

A.     The Concern Is Threshold Reliability

[83]                         
It is important to set the stage for the
following discussion by clarifying what is actually at issue.  Here, I am
speaking only of threshold reliability, not ultimate
reliability.  At this point, a court is concerned only with whether the call
exhibits sufficient indicia of reliability so as to afford the trier of fact “a
satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the statement” (R. v. Hawkins,
[1996] 3 S.C.R. 1043, at para. 75).  Threshold reliability exists because of a
“fear . . . that untested hearsay evidence may be afforded more weight than it
deserves” (R. v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at para.
35).

[84]                         
But once threshold reliability is established,
ultimate reliability — including what weight, if any, to attach to the evidence
— is a matter for the trier of fact.  As Charron J. observed in Khelawon, at para. 50:

Whether the hearsay statement will or
will not be ultimately relied upon in deciding the issues in the case is a
matter for the trier of fact to determine at the conclusion of the trial based
on a consideration of the statement in the context of the entirety of the
evidence.

B.     The Historical Treatment of Drug Purchase Calls

[85]                         
As Watt J.A. observed in his dissenting reasons
at the Court of Appeal, the question about drug purchase calls — in particular,
whether they may contain an implied assertion — “has played little or no role”
in the jurisprudence to date (2012 ONCA 138, 109 O.R. (3d) 721, at para. 53). 
Nonetheless, as my colleague Fish J. points out, a long line of cases have
admitted evidence similar to the evidence under consideration here on the basis
that it was non-hearsay (para. 54).  See, e.g., R. v. Owad (1951), 102
C.C.C. 155 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Fialkow, [1963] 2 C.C.C. 42 (Ont. C.A.); R.
v. Cook (1978), 46 C.C.C. (2d) 318 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. Edwards (1994),
19 O.R. (3d) 239 (C.A.); R. v. Nguyen, 2003 BCCA 556, 188 B.C.A.C. 218; R.
v. Williams, 2009 BCCA 284, 273 B.C.A.C. 86; R. v. Lucia, 2010 ONCA
533 (CanLII); R. v. Graham, 2013 BCCA 75 (CanLII).  

[86]                         
These decisions give me pause.  Can we have been
wrong for so long?

[87]                         
Because I think it safe to conclude that judges
are not in the habit of admitting evidence they deem unreliable, I am led to
believe that these earlier cases rest on the conclusion — often unstated, but
sometimes explicit — that drug purchase calls are inherently reliable.  It may
be that these decisions reflect an implicit judicial consensus, emerging from
multiple decisions over multiple decades, that because such evidence is
reliable more often than not, it can safely be categorized as non-hearsay. 
Feldman J.A. made a similar point in her reasons (para. 131).

[88]                         
The case of Edwards offers a helpful
example of an explicit conclusion as to the reliability of these calls.  In
that case, the issue was whether “a number of calls [to the accused’s phone]
from people ordering small amounts of crack cocaine” were admissible to prove
the accused was a drug dealer (p. 243).  Although McKinlay J.A. concluded that
the evidence was not being introduced to prove the truth of its contents and
thus was not hearsay, in the alternative, she held that the evidence was
admissible under the principled approach:

In my view, the evidence in issue
fulfils these criteria. It was necessary to prove the nature of the appellant’s
drug activities, and they could not have been proven in this case in any other
way that was available to the police. They did not know the identity of the
callers, and, in any event, it is unlikely the callers would have testified if
their identity had been known. The evidence is reliable, because it was made
under circumstances which negate the possibility that the requests were
spurious ones. The callers were led to believe that the persons to whom they
were speaking (the police) were speaking on behalf of the appellant.
[Emphasis added; p. 249.]

[89]                         
To the extent the other cases reflect McKinlay
J.A.’s view about the reliability of such calls, they align with explicit
conclusions to the same effect made by regulation or statute in other
jurisdictions.  See, e.g., Federal Rules of Evidence (U.S.), Rule 801; Criminal
Justice Act 2003 (U.K.), 2003, c. 44, s. 115.  As one leading treatise on
the U.S. Federal Rules of Evidence observed in explaining the Rules’
blanket exclusion of implied assertions from the definition of hearsay:

. . . when a person acts in a
way consistent with a belief but without intending by his act to communicate
that belief, one of the principal reasons for the hearsay rule — to
exclude declarations whose veracity cannot be tested by cross-examination —
does not apply, because the declarant’s sincerity is not then involved.
[Emphasis added.]

 

(J. B.
Weinstein and M. A. Berger, Weinstein’s Evidence: Commentary on Rules of
Evidence for the United States Courts and for State Courts (loose-leaf),
vol. 4, at § 801(a)(01))

See also McCormick on
Evidence (7th ed. 2013), vol. 2 (arguing the Rule 801 definition is “a
compromise between theory and the need for a relatively simple and workable
definition in situations where hearsay dangers are generally reduced”, at pp.
208-9); I. H. Dennis, The Law of Evidence (4th ed. 2010) (arguing that
because “hearsay dangers are often significantly reduced in cases of implied
assertions, there is no compelling systemic reason for applying the hearsay
rule to them”, at p. 710).

[90]                         
Indeed, the Law Reform Commission of Canada’s
proposed Evidence Code of 1975 proceeded on the same basis.  Its
definition of hearsay thus excluded implied assertions, whether verbal or
non-verbal.  See Evidence Code, s. 27(2)(b) in Report on
Evidence (1975).  The commissioners — including Antonio Lamer, who would go
on to become a principal architect of the principled approach to hearsay —
concluded:

Under the definition, . . . a person’s
words or conduct are not hearsay if he did not intend them to be assertive. In
assessing the reliability of such evidence account may have to be taken of the
dangers of hearsay evidence. . . . [U]nlike conscious assertions, a person
is seldom likely to be deliberately misleading when he engaged in non-assertive
activity, which is the most important danger associated with hearsay. In
defining hearsay to exclude non-assertive conduct the Code follows the better
view of the present law. [Emphasis added; p. 69.]

[91]                         
The above reasoning, however, suffers from one
important drawback.  That is because when we speak about hearsay in a case such
as this one, a distinction must be drawn between the fact that something
is true and the declarant’s belief that it is true.  As Professor
McCormick observed:

It is only where the statement
is offered as the basis for the inferences, first, that the declarant believed
it, and, second, that the facts were in accordance with his belief, that the
evidence is hearsay. [Emphasis in original.]

 

(C. T.
McCormick, “The Borderland of Hearsay” (1930), 39 Yale L.J. 489, at p. 490)

[92]                         
Our concerns with respect to the reliability of
the hearsay statement are thus two-fold.  First, there is the concern that the
declarant may not believe what she is saying and thus may be consciously
lying (the sincerity hearsay danger).  Second, even though she may believe what
she says, she may be mistaken about the facts of what she is saying (the
perception, memory, and narration dangers).  As some scholars have observed, it
is this second concern that has at times been overlooked.  See, e.g., S.
Schiff, “Evidence — Hearsay and the Hearsay Rule: A Functional View” (1978), 56
Can. Bar Rev. 674, at p. 683, fn. 33 (criticizing the Evidence Code
definition for “ignor[ing] every reason for the hearsay rule except the danger
that the declarant may have been insincere”). 

[93]                         
It seems to me that this second ground of
concern is what led to the decision in R. v. Wilson (1996), 29 O.R. (3d)
97 (C.A.).  In that case, the Crown sought to tender evidence that while the
police were at the accused’s home, “a man came to the door asking for ‘Rob’ and
seeking to buy drugs” (p. 104).  The accused’s name was Robert Wilson.  The
trial judge admitted the evidence on the strength of Edwards, but the
Court of Appeal reversed.  McMurtry C.J.O. reasoned that it was “dangerous” and
“unsafe” to draw an inference that the accused was a drug dealer from a single
visit (pp. 104-5).  

[94]                         
Significantly, however, McMurtry C.J.O. was
untroubled by the result in Edwards.  In his view, the evidence of “ten
separate calls” in that case permitted an “irresistible inference” about
the nature of that accused’s activities (p. 104).  Thus, while it is possible
that one individual could be mistaken in believing that the person he called (or
called on) was a drug dealer, one would be hard-pressed to conclude that ten
such people could all be mistaken.  See D. M. Paciocco and L.
Stuesser, The Law of Evidence (6th ed. 2011), at pp. 111-12; Dennis, at
pp. 707-9.

[95]                         
In other words, the distinction between Edwards
and Wilson is that the evidence in one case was judged to be reliable
and the evidence in the other was not.  It was that assessment that dictated
the answer with respect to admissibility — and that, as I see it, is the
assessment we should be focusing on.

C.        What Is the Role of
Necessity?

[96]                         
I turn then to the question of necessity.  It bears recalling
that “the central reason for the presumptive exclusion
of hearsay statements is the general inability to test their reliability” (Khelawon,
at para. 2 (emphasis added)).  That, of course, is not to suggest that we have
ousted necessity as a prerequisite to the admission of hearsay evidence.  We
have not.  But what we have said is that “necessity and reliability should not
be considered in isolation” because “[o]ne criterion may have an impact on the
other” (para. 77).  Indeed, we have recognized that “[i]n the interest of
seeking the truth, the very high reliability of [a] statement [can render]
its substantive admission necessary” (para. 86 (emphasis added), citing R.
v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740, and R. v. U. (F.J.),
[1995] 3 S.C.R. 764).  That is the principle I would apply here.

[97]                         
My colleague, however, sees a broader role for
necessity in cases such as this one.  He quotes Charron J. in Khelawon,
at para. 104, for the proposition that “in an appropriate case, the
court in deciding the question of necessity may well question whether the
proponent of the evidence made all reasonable efforts to secure the
evidence of the declarant in a manner that also preserves the rights of the
other party” (emphasis added).  On that basis, he concludes, at para. 68:

This is the kind of “appropriate
case” contemplated by Khelawon.  And the
answer is that the police made no effort at all to secure the evidence
of the declarant: they never sought to interview or even find him, though he
gave them his address.  [Italics in original; underlining added.]

[98]                         
With respect, I am not at all sure that this is
the kind of “appropriate case” Charron J. had in mind when she said what she
said in Khelawon.

[99]                         
The declarant in Khelawon was a frail
81-year-old who was living in a retirement home after having suffered a
stroke.  He died before trial and thus could not be called to testify, but the
Crown sought to introduce, under the principled approach, an unsworn videotaped
statement he made to the police during the course of their investigation.  It
was in that context that Charron J. observed, at para. 104:

Although Mr. Skupien was elderly and
frail at the time he made the allegations, there is no evidence that the Crown
attempted to preserve his evidence by application under ss. 709  to 714  of the Criminal
Code . He did not testify at the preliminary
hearing. The record does not disclose if he had died by that time. In making
these comments, I do not question the fact that it was necessary for the Crown
to resort to Mr. Skupien’s evidence in hearsay form. Necessity is conceded. However,
in an appropriate case, the court in deciding the question of necessity may
well question whether the proponent of the evidence made all reasonable efforts
to secure the evidence of the declarant in a manner that also preserves the
rights of the other party. That issue is not raised here. [Emphasis added.]

[100]                     
It seems to me that Charron J. was making the
point that even though the police should reasonably have anticipated that the
declarant might not be able to attend the trial — “Mr. Skupien was elderly and
frail” — they did nothing to secure his evidence in a better form even though
they knew he was likely to be cooperative and forthcoming.  As Charron J.
noted, ss. 709  to 714  of the Criminal Code  “expressly contemplate
this eventuality and provide a procedure for the taking of the evidence
before a commissioner in the presence of the accused or his counsel thereby
preserving both the evidence and the rights of the accused” (para. 7 (emphasis
added)).

[101]                     
The facts in Khelawon are thus a far cry
from the facts in the case at hand — and because of that, care should be taken
before we start accepting that a perfectly reasonable request of the police in
one set of circumstances will necessarily translate into an equally reasonable
request in other circumstances.

[102]                     
And that, in my respectful view, is where the
analogy to Khelawon breaks down.  In Khelawon, the police were
dealing with a known declarant who was fully cooperative and forthcoming. 
Here, the declarant was unknown and even if the police had been able to find
him — a big “if” — there is no reason to believe that he would have been
forthcoming and cooperative.  Indeed, the opposite is more likely to be true.  

[103]                     
With that in mind, it bears recalling that, as
Charron J. herself observed shortly after Khelawon, the test for
necessity is not whether the hearsay statement is the best form of the evidence
(for that will always be live testimony), but whether it is the “best available
form” in the circumstances (R. v. Couture, 2007 SCC 28, [2007] 2 S.C.R.
517, at para. 79 (emphasis added)).

[104]                     
The question that arises then is:  Should we be
requiring the police, in the name of necessity, to track down unknown and often
unknowable declarants, who are unlikely to be found and unlikely to be
forthcoming and cooperative in the event they are found?

[105]                     
The answer, I believe, is found in Edwards,
where McKinlay J.A. observed:

[The police] did not know the identity
of the callers, and, in any event, it is unlikely the callers would have
testified if their identity had been known. [p. 249]

In my respectful view,
McKinlay J.A.’s logic remains sound, even on the facts here.

[106]                     
Although it is true the police in this case had
the benefit of the caller’s address, the caller’s identity was still unknown. 
Surely, the police were not going to show up at 327 Guy St. and ask who there
was looking to buy drugs from Chris Baldree.  Apart from officer safety
concerns, the likelihood of the police finding the declarant would seem slim. 
And the prospect of the declarant being forthcoming and cooperative, if found,
would seem even slimmer.  An undercover drug buy would be even more
problematic, given the number of officers who would be needed to see it through
and the obvious risks to the officer safety inherent in such an operation.  

[107]                     
Under either option, the game would hardly be
worth the candle.  And that, in my view, provides a full answer to the concern
that the police offered no explanation as to why they made no efforts to locate
the declarant.  With respect, no explanation was necessary — common sense
provides one.  If there is little chance of finding the declarant, and little
chance that, if found, he or she will be forthcoming and provide the police
with evidence in a better form than the call itself (such as a B. (K.G.)
statement or testimony in court), the necessity criterion will have been met.

[108]                     
Equally problematic is the suggestion by my
colleague that even where there are multiple callers, the police could
be expected to go out and seek to persuade at least some of them to
testify (para. 72).  With respect, absent evidence of collusion, I see that as
being wasteful.  It amounts to little more than tipping our hat to necessity
for necessity’s sake.  That has not been, and should not be, what the test for
necessity requires.

[109]                     
At bottom, the point is that the necessity
criterion is not meant to stifle the admission of reliable evidence.  Rather,
it is “founded on society’s interest in getting at the truth” (Khelawon,
at para. 49).  Necessity should be viewed as a servant of the truth, not its
master.  For that reason, in cases such as this one — where the prospect of
locating, identifying, and receiving accurate information from a forthcoming
and cooperative caller is remote — if the evidence is reliable, it should be
admitted because its reception into evidence will be necessary in order to get
closer to the truth.  If the evidence is not reliable, it should be excluded. 
Either way, in my view, the focus should be reliability.

D.     Was This Call Reliable?

[110]                     
The reliability of a particular hearsay
statement can be tested by looking at, among other things, the circumstances in
which the statement came about.  One may look for indicia of reliability within
the four corners of the statement.  The law also provides that indicia of
reliability may be found outside the statement in the form of confirmatory
evidence (Khelawon, at para. 100).

[111]                     
The Crown maintains that this call was
sufficiently reliable to warrant its reception.  In particular, the Crown
relies on the absence of any evidence that “the caller was motivated by
anything other than a desire to purchase drugs” and the argument that the
“spontaneity of the conversation was made under circumstances where an
intentional lie was remote” (A.F., at para. 82).  

[112]                     
This argument has something to it.  As I
indicated above, there is good reason to believe that the sincerity hearsay
danger is reduced in cases such as this one.  That said, Mr. Baldree argues
that the circumstances in which this call came about are sufficient to warrant
concern that this call may have been “made to throw suspicion” on him (R.F., at
para. 85).  

[113]                     
As the record reveals, there was initially some
uncertainty about the respective roles of Mr. Baldree and the other Chris in
this case, Christopher Anderson, as to the drugs found in the apartment.  Sgt.
Martelle testified that Mr. Anderson was known to be “deal[ing] in . . . those
types of drugs” (A.R., vol. II, at p. 106).  He was apparently a man of some
repute, known “on the streets” as “the Mexican” (p. 59).

[114]                     
On its own, Mr. Baldree’s argument is
insufficient to impugn the reliability of this call.  He has not suggested, for
example, how Mr. Anderson or anyone else could have arranged for a fabricated
call when the police seized all cell phones at the time of the arrests and no
persons were released by the police until after the call was received. 
Had either of Mr. Anderson’s two associates been released by the police before
the call was received on Mr. Baldree’s phone, it would have been a
different matter.  But those are not our facts.

[115]                     
I caution thus against inferring suspicious
circumstances in these types of cases absent any evidence suggesting as much. 
If that were our approach, many of our time-tested hearsay exceptions would
unravel.  To state the obvious, a dying man does not lose his ability to lie. 
And yet, in the case of dying declarations, we do not indulge in speculation
about potential fabrication.  Instead, the law recognizes that a motive to lie
in such circumstances is at best remote (R. v. Woodcock (1789), 1 Leach
500, 168 E.R. 352 (K.B.), at p. 353).  In other words, we recognize a norm of
human behaviour for what it is — a norm.

[116]                     
In sum, because our rules are not designed
around theoretical possibilities but practical realities, a drug purchase call
by mere dint of being a drug purchase call should not raise suspicions of
fabrication.  While the onus remains on the proponent of the evidence to
establish that the evidence is sufficiently reliable to warrant its reception,
I would suggest that “it falls to the person opposing the evidence to show
circumstances of suspicion” (R. v. Starr, 2000 SCC 40, [2000] 2 S.C.R.
144, at para. 8, per McLachlin C.J.).  Here, the record does not reveal
a sufficient basis to worry about the circumstances in which the call to Mr.
Baldree’s phone came about.

[117]                     
Examining the sincerity of this caller’s belief,
however, does not end the matter — and ultimately this is where the Crown’s
argument in this case falls short.  

[118]                     
Here, the Crown sought to introduce the drug
purchase call to establish not merely that the caller believed that Mr.
Baldree was a drug trafficker (evidence of limited value to the Crown’s case),
but that Mr. Baldree was in fact a drug trafficker (evidence of
significant value).  Indeed, though he characterized it as circumstantial
evidence, the trial judge here correctly recognized that the evidence was being
used to establish that Mr. Baldree was “engaged in the trafficking of
drugs” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 23 (emphasis added)).  It was on the basis of that
fact that the Crown sought an inference that Mr. Baldree was in possession
of the cocaine and marijuana found in the apartment.

[119]                     
The problem with the Crown’s argument is that it
says little about the reliability of the assertion that Mr. Baldree is in fact
a drug trafficker.  The argument is more successful with respect to the fact
that the caller intended to purchase drugs.  Accordingly, the
statement would have been admissible as a statement of present intention if the
Crown had sought to introduce it for that purpose (see, e.g., R.
v. Ly, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 698).  But, as Feldman J.A. observed, that is not
why the Crown sought to introduce this evidence (para. 144).

[120]                     
Put another way, the problem with the Crown’s
argument is that even if the caller was entirely sincere in his belief that Mr.
Baldree was a drug dealer, that does not address why the caller believed
what he believed — and whether his belief was in fact true or not. 
This is not a case of multiple calls, where common sense tells us that the
probability of numerous callers all being mistaken is unlikely.  Nor do we have
sufficient indicia of reliability, either within the statement or in the form
of confirmatory evidence outside the statement.

[121]                     
Accordingly, and absent more, it thus seems to
me a bridge too far to accept the Crown’s argument that this call meets
threshold reliability thereby justifying its admission as substantive evidence
that Mr. Baldree was engaged in drug trafficking.

E.      Can a Single Call Ever Be Reliable?

[122]                     
Just because the single call here did not meet
the threshold test for admissibility, it does not follow that multiple calls
are required to establish as much.  Indeed, it is perfectly consistent
with the principled approach that even a single drug purchase call may
meet that threshold.  I will attempt to explain why using the facts of this
call as an example.

[123]                     
As I mentioned earlier, what is missing in this
call is some assurance that Mr. Baldree was in fact a drug dealer. 
There are insufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness within the
call itself and little or no external confirmatory evidence.  However, if the
caller had declined the offer of delivery and instead asked “if I can drop by
Eric’s apartment to pick up the drugs”, that may have been sufficient because
it would have indicated greater familiarity with Mr. Baldree and his
activities, including contemporary knowledge of his recent move to Mr. Lepage’s
apartment.  A debt list at Mr. Lepage’s apartment with Mr. Baldree’s
fingerprints on it may also have done the trick because it would have served as
confirmatory evidence of Mr. Baldree’s involvement in drug trafficking.  One
can imagine other scenarios.

[124]                     
My point is simply that had the circumstances
been somewhat different, there may well have been a satisfactory basis for
evaluating whether the caller believed Mr. Baldree was a drug dealer and
whether that belief was in fact true.  That is what threshold
reliability requires.  Setting aside the facts of this case, we do not know
what the circumstances of some future call might be.  I would thus caution against
the notion that only multiple calls can be reliable.

on appeal from the court of appeal for alberta

                    Criminal law — Judgments and orders — Sufficiency of
reasons — Burden of proof — Accused convicted of sexual assault and unlawful
touching for sexual purpose involving four complainants — Whether trial judge’s
reasons for judgment sufficient — Whether trial judge properly applied burden
of proof.

                    The
issues in this appeal are whether the trial judge’s reasons for judgment were
sufficient and whether the trial judge properly applied the burden of proof in
a criminal case.

                    Held: 
The appeal should be dismissed.

                    The
core question in determining whether the trial judge’s reasons are sufficient
is whether the reasons, read in context, show why the judge decided as he did. 
The trial judge’s reasons satisfy this threshold.  The reasons allow for
meaningful appellate review because they tell the accused why the trial judge
decided as he did.  The trial judge found the complainant’s evidence
compelling, the problems in her evidence inconsequential, and the accused’s
concoction theories speculative.  The reasons reveal that the trial judge
accepted the complainant’s evidence where it conflicted with the accused’s
evidence.  No further explanation for rejecting the accused’s evidence was
required.

                    The
trial judge also properly applied the burden of proof.  Although a trial judge
is not required to outline the W.(D.) steps, the trial judge here
referred to W.(D.) and the dangers that it addressed:  the potential for
simply comparing stories and for shifting the onus to the accused.  The trial
judge’s reasons for finding the accused guilty on counts 1 and 2, read in the
context of the reasons as a whole, do not reveal an incorrect application of
the relevant principles.  Here, the accused was not believed.  The Crown’s case
was considered with the accused’s denial in mind, and the trial judge
concluded, as he was entitled to do, that his denial did not raise a reasonable
doubt.

                    The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

                    Karakatsanis J. — 

I.       Introduction

[1]                             
The issues in this appeal are whether the trial
judge’s reasons for judgment were sufficient and whether the trial judge
properly applied the burden of proof in a criminal case.

[2]                             
The appellant was charged with four counts of
sexual assault and one count of unlawful touching of a person under the age of
14 for a sexual purpose.  The charges involved three child complainants and one
adult complainant.  At trial, the appellant was found guilty of all charges. 
The majority of the Court of Appeal set aside three convictions and ordered a
new trial because similar fact evidence was wrongly admitted.  The dissenting
judge at the Court of Appeal would have set aside all of the convictions and
ordered a new trial:  2011 ABCA 280, 515 A.R. 25.  At issue, therefore, are the
two counts relating to the youngest complainant (counts 1 and 2).

[3]                             
This is an appeal as of right limited to
questions of law on which a judge of the Court of Appeal dissented.  The
appellant relies on two such issues: whether the trial judge’s reasons are
sufficient and whether the trial judge correctly applied the burden of proof. 
The trial judge’s ruling with respect to similar fact evidence is not before
us.

[4]                             
The trial judge’s reasons are sparse and do not
directly address the appellant’s evidence.  For the reasons that follow,
however, I agree with the majority in the Court of Appeal that the trial
judge’s reasons were sufficient and that the trial judge did not err in his
application of the burden of proof.

II.     Background

[5]                             
The trial judge found the youngest complainant’s
evidence “compelling”, noting a “particularly poignant exchange” between the
complainant and the investigating police officer that had “the ring of truth”. 
The trial judge stated that (a) the complainant was not shaken on cross-examination;
(b) the inconsistencies in her evidence were minor and to be expected
(particularly from a child witness); (c) the appellant’s arguments with respect
to the physical impossibility of the incidents as described by the complainant
were “merely conjecture”; and (d) although the police officer who interviewed
the complainant posed leading questions, they did not pertain to the “essential
features” of the circumstances leading to the offences.  Further, the trial
judge characterized the appellant’s suggestion that the complainant concocted
the allegations as speculative.

[6]                             
With respect to the appellant’s evidence, the
trial judge noted that the appellant “simply denied all of the allegations”. 
Shortly after repeating his finding that the complainant’s evidence was
compelling, the trial judge stated his conclusion on counts 1 and 2:  “In the
end, notwithstanding [the appellant’s] denial, I have no reasonable doubt that
the [appellant] did commit the acts which [the complainant] described”.

[7]                             
The majority of the Court of Appeal, represented
by McDonald J.A. with respect to the issues before this Court, found that the
trial judge provided an accurate distillation of the law on the burden of proof
in criminal cases and gave reasons that were sufficient because they met “the Sheppard
requirements and made it clear to the appellant why he had been convicted
at trial” (para. 66). Relying on this Court’s decision in R. v. R.E.M.,
2008 SCC 51, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3, McDonald J.A. concluded that the reasons
generally demonstrated that where the complainant’s evidence and the accused’s
evidence conflicted, the trial judge had accepted the evidence of the
complainant.

[8]                             
Côté J.A., dissenting, found that the trial
judge misapplied the burden of proof and that his reasons were inadequate. 
With respect to the burden of proof, the verdicts of guilt relating to the
youngest complainant were “at best . . . an unexplained conclusion” because the
trial judge did not mention the appellant’s evidence in relation to these counts
(para. 100).  As for the sufficiency of the reasons, the trial judge did not
adequately address the problems with the complainant’s evidence.  The reasons
also did not explain why the appellant’s evidence was rejected or failed to
raise a reasonable doubt and did not permit an appellate court to determine
whether he misapplied the principles in R. v. W.(D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R.
742.

III.    Were the Trial Judge’s Reasons Sufficient?

[9]                             
Counsel for the appellant candidly submitted
that he was not asking the court to make any new law.  Rather, he submitted
that the reasons of the trial judge did not explain why the trial judge
accepted the evidence of the complainant, despite live credibility issues, and
did not address the appellant’s evidence or explain why it was rejected. The
reasons did not allow an appellate court to determine whether there was a legal
error in the application of W.(D.).

[10]                         
An appellate court tasked with determining
whether a trial judge gave sufficient reasons must follow a functional approach: 
R. v. Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, at para. 55.  An
appeal based on insufficient reasons “will only be allowed where the trial
judge’s reasons are so deficient that they foreclose meaningful appellate
review”:  R. v. Dinardo, 2008 SCC 24, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 788, at para. 25.

[11]                         
Here, the key issue at trial was credibility.
Credibility determinations by a trial judge attract a high degree of
deference.  In Dinardo, Charron J. explained:

Where a case turns largely on
determinations of credibility, the sufficiency of the reasons should be
considered in light of the deference afforded to trial judges on credibility
findings.  Rarely will the deficiencies in the trial judge’s credibility
analysis, as expressed in the reasons for judgment, merit intervention on
appeal.  Nevertheless, a failure to sufficiently articulate how credibility
concerns were resolved may constitute reversible error (see R. v. Braich,
[2002] 1 S.C.R. 903, 2002 SCC 27, at para. 23).  As this Court noted in R.
v. Gagnon, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 621, 2006 SCC 17, the accused is entitled to
know “why the trial judge is left with no reasonable doubt” . . . .  [para. 26]

[12]                         
Ultimately, appellate courts considering the
sufficiency of reasons “should read them as a whole, in the context of the
evidence, the arguments and the trial, with an appreciation of the purposes or
functions for which they are delivered”: R.E.M., at para. 16.  These
purposes “are fulfilled if the reasons, read in context, show why the judge
decided as he or she did” (para. 17).

[13]                         
In R.E.M., this Court also explained that
a trial judge’s failure to explain why he rejected an accused’s plausible
denial of the charges does not mean the reasons are deficient as long as the
reasons generally demonstrate that, where the complainant’s evidence and the
accused’s evidence conflicted, the trial judge accepted the complainant’s
evidence.  No further explanation for rejecting the accused’s evidence is
required as the convictions themselves raise a reasonable inference that the
accused’s denial failed to raise a reasonable doubt (see para. 66).

[14]                         
The appellant submits that the reasons do not
disclose why the trial judge decided as he did. Before accepting the
complainant’s evidence the trial judge failed to address live issues relating
to the credibility of the complainant.  A number of the live issues, listed in
detail by the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal, went unmentioned by the
trial judge or, if mentioned, were followed by a bald conclusion.  Although a
trial judge’s credibility findings relating to witnesses should not be lightly
disturbed, the trial judge’s reasons do not adequately explain why he accepted
the complainant’s evidence and why the appellant’s evidence did not raise a
reasonable doubt.

[15]                         
The core question in determining whether the
trial judge’s reasons are sufficient is the following: Do the reasons, read in
context, show why the judge decided as he did on the counts relating to the
complainant? In this case, the trial judge’s reasons satisfy this threshold.

[16]                         
First, the trial judge found the evidence of the
complainant compelling — that is, credible and reliable.  He explained why,
noting an exchange between the complainant and the investigating police officer
to whom she expressed worry about being considered a bad girl because she may
have liked what the appellant had done to her.  The trial judge stated that
this “had the ring of truth”.

[17]                         
Second, the trial judge recognized the live
issues relating to the complainant’s credibility.  He was not obliged to
discuss all of the evidence on any given point or answer each and every
argument of counsel:  R.E.M., at paras. 32 and 64; and Dinardo,
at para. 30.  Here, he noted the problems in her evidence — the lack of a
hymen, inconsistency as to the number of incidents, the physical impossibility
of some allegations, and leading questions by the police officer who took her
statement.  He addressed each of them, albeit briefly, ultimately finding that
they were inconsequential to his conclusion.  He characterized the appellant’s
suggestion of concoction as speculative.

[18]                         
Third, the trial judge considered the
appellant’s denial of the allegations. He acknowledged that the appellant’s
evidence may have been more fulsome if his command of the English language were
better.  Read in context, the trial judge’s reasons reveal that he rejected the
appellant’s denial.  Later in his reasons, in relation to the other counts, the
trial judge stated that the denial was not truthful and did not raise a doubt.

[19]                         
I conclude that the reasons were sufficient —
they allow for meaningful appellate review because they tell the appellant why
the trial judge decided as he did. The trial judge found the complainant’s
evidence compelling, the problems in her evidence inconsequential, and the
appellant’s concoction theories speculative.  The reasons reveal that the trial
judge accepted the complainant’s evidence where it conflicted with the
appellant’s evidence.  No further explanation for rejecting the appellant’s
evidence was required.

IV.    Did the Trial Judge Err in His Application of the Burden
of Proof?

[20]                         
The appellant submits that the trial judge
misapplied the burden of proof in a criminal case by not following the test in W.(D.)
and thereby failing to properly assess the appellant’s evidence.

[21]                         
The paramount question in a criminal case is
whether, on the whole of the evidence, the trier of fact is left with a
reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused:  W.(D.), at p.
758.   The order in which a trial judge makes credibility findings of witnesses
is inconsequential as long as the principle of reasonable doubt remains the
central consideration.  A verdict of guilt must not be based on a choice
between the accused’s evidence and the Crown’s evidence:  R. v.
C.L.Y., 2008 SCC 2, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 5, at paras. 6-8.  However,
trial judges are not required to explain in detail the process they followed to
reach a verdict:  see R. v. Boucher, 2005 SCC 72, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 499,
at para. 29.

 

[22]                         
The trial judge adverted to the principles of W.(D.)
at the outset of his reasons:

W.(D.) requires me to attend to the evidence of the accused in a particular
way.  That does not mean, however, that the accused’s evidence is considered in
a vacuum.  The dangers that W.(D.) addresses are the potential for
simply comparing stories and for shifting the onus to the accused.  However,
the accused’s evidence is part of a body of evidence, all of which bears upon
the credit that may be given to any portion of that evidence.

 

One cannot determine whether
the accused’s evidence is true or at least raises a reasonable doubt by simply
considering his evidence and the way he gave it.  Doing so ignores one of the
fundamental [tenets] of fact-finding.  It is not just internal consistency
which lends credence to testimony.  External consistency is also part of the
analysis.  Evidence inconsistent with found or admitted fact, may be
discounted, no matter what its source.  [Emphasis added.]

 

[23]                         
Immediately following these paragraphs, the
trial judge assessed the complainant’s credibility, starting with the statement: 
“In this case, [the complainant’s] evidence was compelling.”

[24]                         
The appellant argues that in the absence of any
reasons why his evidence was rejected or did not raise a reasonable doubt, the
reasons suggest that the trial judge first found the complainant credible, and
then used that finding — or “found fact” to use the trial judge’s words — to
later reject the evidence of the appellant, effectively choosing the Crown’s
evidence over that of the defence.

[25]                         
In my view, the trial judge was merely articulating
general principles of law that may be used in assessing the evidence of
the accused.  Further, in assessing the Crown’s case, the trial judge referred
explicitly to the appellant’s denial:  “. . . notwithstanding [the appellant’s]
denial, I have no reasonable doubt that the [appellant] did commit the acts
which [the complainant] described”.

[26]                         
I conclude, therefore, that the trial judge
properly applied the burden of proof.  Although a trial judge is not required
to outline the W.(D.) steps, the trial judge here referred to W.(D.)
and the dangers that it addresses:  “. . . the potential for simply comparing
stories and for shifting the onus to the accused”.  In my view, the trial
judge’s reasons for finding the appellant guilty on counts 1 and 2, read in the
context of the reasons as a whole, do not reveal an incorrect application of
the principles outlined in that decision.

[27]                         
In the result, the trial judge rejected the
appellant’s testimony.  In Boucher, Charron J. (dissenting in part)
stated that when a trial judge rejects an accused’s testimony, “it can
generally be concluded that the testimony failed to raise a reasonable doubt in
the judge’s mind” (para. 59). Similarly, in R.E.M., McLachlin C.J.
stated that “the convictions themselves raise a reasonable inference that the
accused’s denial of the charges failed to raise a reasonable doubt” (para. 66).

[28]                         
Here, the appellant was not believed.  The
Crown’s case was considered with the appellant’s denial in mind, and the trial
judge concluded, as he was entitled to do, that his denial did not raise a
reasonable doubt.

V.  Conclusion

[29]                         
For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

                    Criminal
law — Evidence — Admissibility — Hearsay — Murder trial — Co-accused witness recanting previous statement implicating accused in murder — Trial judge
finding prior inconsistent statement not meeting threshold reliability test —
Whether prior inconsistent statement was sufficiently reliable to be considered
by jury for truth of its contents.  

                    The
accused, Y, and D.S., the co-accused shooter, were charged with first degree
murder after a failed drug deal.  D.S. was tried separately as a young
offender.  He pleaded guilty to second degree murder.  As
part of his plea agreement, D.S. signed a written Agreed Statement of Facts
(ASF) drafted by Crown counsel, with input from defence counsel.  The ASF directly
implicated Y in the murder.  At the time of his plea, D.S. acknowledged the
accuracy of the ASF.  The ASF was neither videotaped nor preceded by sworn oath
or affirmation.  

                    During
Y’s trial, the Crown asked D.S. to adopt the ASF.  D.S. testified that he could
not remember signing the document, but acknowledged that it bore his
signature.  D.S. further denied the facts in the ASF implicating Y.  In
response to D.S.’s denials, the Crown sought to adduce the ASF for the truth of
its contents.  Following a voir dire, the trial judge found insufficient
means for the jury to assess the reliability of the ASF as a prior inconsistent
statement and ruled the signed ASF did not meet the threshold reliability
required for it to be admissible as evidence for the truth of its contents.  When
D.S. asserted solicitor-client privilege, the ability to cross-examine was
curtailed and the trial judge found the opportunity for an effective
cross-examination at trial was to a large extent illusory.  The trial judge granted
the defence’s application for a directed order acquitting Y.  The Court of
Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial.

                    Held
(Rothstein and Wagner JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed and
the acquittal restored.

                    Per McLachlin C.J.
and Fish, Abella, Cromwell and Karakatsanis JJ.:  A prior inconsistent
statement of a non-accused witness may be admitted for the truth of its
contents if the following reliability indicia are met:  (1) the statement
is made under oath or solemn affirmation after a warning as to possible
sanctions if the person is untruthful; (2) the statement is videotaped or
recorded in its entirety; and (3) the opposing party has a full
opportunity to cross-examine the witness on the statement.  The prior inconsistent
statement’s threshold reliability may also be established by:  (1) the
presence of adequate substitutes for testing truth and accuracy (procedural
reliability); and (2) sufficient circumstantial guarantees of reliability
or an inherent trustworthiness (substantive reliability).  A trial judge is well-placed
to assess the hearsay dangers in a particular case and the effectiveness of any
safeguards to assist in overcoming them.  Thus, absent an error in principle,
the trial judge’s determination of threshold reliability is entitled to
deference.  

                    In
this case, the trial judge did not err in finding that there were insufficient
safeguards to establish threshold reliability to admit the ASF as evidence for
the truth of its contents.  Only a full and complete opportunity to cross-examine
would have provided a genuine basis on which to assess the reliability of D.S.’s
statements.  D.S.’s invocation of solicitor-client privilege, however, curtailed
significantly the cross-examination available to assess the threshold
reliability of the prior inconsistent statement.  The Crown could not have
probed the conversations between D.S. and his counsel about legal advice in
connection with his decision to plead guilty or to accept the ASF.  The trial
judge may have overstated the scope of solicitor-client privilege and its
consequences for the cross-examination of D.S.; however, any overstatement would
not have had a material impact on the conclusion that cross-examination was
not, in this case, a sufficient means to satisfy threshold reliability. 

                    The
Crown cannot ask for a new trial on the basis that the prosecution should have
been conducted differently.  The trial judge did not preclude the Crown from
conducting a more probing cross-examination of the witness or from calling
other witnesses about the creation of the ASF.  The trial judge made no
comments suggesting that there should be no further cross-examination of the
witness on the voir dire.  The judge was not asked for a ruling on this
issue.  Had Crown counsel wished to call further evidence, he could have sought
direction.  Since this was the same Crown counsel who had prosecuted D.S. at
his separate youth trial, and who negotiated the plea bargain and drafted the ASF,
he knew what D.S. or his lawyers could say about those matters, outside the
scope of solicitor-client privilege.  

                    The
trial judge did not err in finding that the circumstances surrounding the making
of the prior inconsistent statement did not provide sufficient guarantees of
substantive reliability.  The circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness
asserted by the Crown — the thorough process in creating the ASF, the involvement
of counsel, and the solemnity of the guilty plea proceeding — do not establish
threshold reliability for the statements from which D.S. recanted, which served
to minimize his involvement in the murder and shift responsibility to Y.  In
the circumstances of this case, the formality of the process and the
involvement of counsel only provide comfort in respect of D.S.’s statements
admitting his own culpability for the murder.  The administration of justice
would not be enhanced in permitting admissions made by a co-accused in his own
interest, as part of a plea bargain for a conviction of a lesser crime and
favourable sentence, to be used against a co-accused, in circumstances where
the reliability of the statements cannot be adequately tested.

                    Per Rothstein and Wagner JJ.
(dissenting):  Threshold reliability should be generously interpreted in the
admissibility inquiry.  As a general rule, if a statement is accepted for its
truth by the courts, and used to balance the liberty interests of the accused
with societal considerations such as deterrence and retribution, then that
statement provides a level of implicit reliability that warrants consideration
in the admissibility inquiry in a subsequent third-party trial.  That is not to
say that a statement’s use and judicial acceptance at a prior proceeding is
sufficient in and of itself to meet the reliability requirement of the
principled approach.  Rather, it is merely a factor that must be considered in
the admissibility inquiry, a factor that goes towards meeting the threshold
reliability standard.  Each case will have to be examined on its particular
circumstances when determining threshold reliability, but consideration should
certainly be given to the general acceptance of and reliance on statements read
in as part of a guilty plea.  Limits on cross-examination should not be applied
rigidly and absolutely where solicitor-client privilege is asserted.  Rather,
issues of privilege should be addressed as they arise on cross-examination. 
This way, relevant information that may not be prohibited by the assertion of
privilege may still be elicited, furthering the underlying truth-seeking
function of the proceedings. 

                    The
question of admissibility in this case must be redetermined in a new trial where
threshold reliability can be properly assessed.  The trial judge erred in his
determination that the ASF did not meet the standard of threshold reliability. 
He failed to adequately assess the available indicia of reliability and
erroneously found the opportunity to cross-examine D.S. to be illusory.  That
is not to say that the circumstances in this case provide sufficient evidence
to conclusively determine that the ASF should be admitted.  Rather, the
admissibility inquiry was incomplete and did not provide a proper basis for the
trial judge to exclude the relevant evidence.  The opportunity to cross-examine
D.S. was not entirely closed and the trial judge misapprehended the scope and
impact of solicitor-client privilege on the opportunity for cross-examination. 
Had the trial judge permitted the cross-examination to proceed and addressed
issues involving solicitor-client privilege as they arose, information
sufficient to meet the threshold reliability standard may have been brought
forward.  D.S. was available for cross-examination, he recalled having made
many of the statements within the ASF, he did not dispute understanding the key
facts in the ASF which he subsequently denied at Y’s trial, and he recalled the
ASF being read in at his guilty plea proceeding.  

                    Other
factors were available in this case that could have satisfied the trial judge that
the circumstances surrounding the drafting and reading in of the ASF provided
assurances of reliability equivalent to an oath and presence.  If these indicia
had been considered and cross-examination had been permitted, it is possible
that threshold reliability would have been met.  Perhaps the most persuasive
indicia of reliability are the nature of the statement and how it was
constructed.  The ASF tendered as evidence in D.S.’s guilty plea proceeding
provides just such a record.  Having been reduced to writing, signed not only by
D.S. but by both Crown and defence counsel, and having been read in to the
record in the context of D.S.’s guilty plea, the source of the document cannot
be disputed.  This was not a statement that was unilaterally drafted and forced
upon D.S. to adopt.  Rather, the drafting of the ASF was a collaborative effort
where there is evidence that at least one crucial component to the Crown’s case
against Y was supplied by defence counsel — namely the statement that Y
supplied D.S. with the gun.  Moreover, D.S. had the opportunity to review the
ASF with his counsel prior to signing it and adopting it.  This is an important
aspect as it refutes any negative inferences that could be drawn against the
ASF on the grounds that it was not captured in D.S.’s own words or that D.S.
did not understand its contents.  Perhaps most importantly, D.S. testified that
he understood the three crucial components of the ASF, namely that Y gave D.S.
the gun, Y told D.S. to shoot the victim, and demanded that D.S. return the
gun.  Without more persuasive evidence to the contrary, this essentially
forecloses any argument that D.S. lacked understanding of the ASF’s contents.  Looking
beyond the construction of the ASF, the context of the proceedings under which
it was read in to court and the contents of the ASF itself provide additional
indicia supporting threshold reliability.

I.    Introduction

[1]                             
The issue in this appeal
is whether a co-accused’s prior inconsistent statement, implicating the
appellant in a murder, was sufficiently reliable to be considered by a jury for
the truth of its contents.

[2]                             
The Crown’s theory was
that the appellant planned the murder and provided the murder weapon to the co-accused
shooter.  The shooter, in a separate proceeding in youth court, pleaded guilty
to second degree murder.  In doing so, he adopted a written Agreed Statement of
Facts (ASF) in which he shifted responsibility for planning the murder and for
obtaining the murder weapon to the appellant.

[3]                             
As a witness in the appellant’s murder trial,
the shooter resiled from those facts inculpating the appellant and refused to
adopt the prior statement.  The Crown’s case against the appellant collapsed
when the trial judge found that the ASF did not meet the threshold reliability
required to be admitted for the truth of its contents.

[4]                             
The question before us
is whether the trial judge erred in finding that the ASF did not meet threshold
reliability to be put before the jury.

[5]                             
The Court of Appeal concluded that the trial
judge erred.  However, for the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal
and reinstate the acquittal.

II.     Background

[6]                             
Yousanthan Youvarajah, the appellant, and D.S.,
a minor, were charged with first degree murder after a failed drug deal.  On
the Crown’s theory, Youvarajah planned the murder and provided the murder
weapon for D.S. to shoot the victim.

[7]                             
D.S. was tried separately as a young offender.  He pleaded guilty to second degree murder and
was sentenced as a youth.  As part of his plea agreement, D.S. signed the ASF
drafted by Crown counsel, with input from defence counsel.  In it, D.S.
directly implicated the appellant in the murder:  the appellant gave D.S. the
handgun that was used in the shooting; he ordered D.S. to shoot the victim; and
he demanded the return of the handgun after the shooting.

[8]                             
At the time of his plea,
D.S. acknowledged the accuracy of the ASF.  At the appellant’s trial, he
testified that he did not understand the words “acknowledged” or “accurate” as
used by his counsel at the guilty plea proceedings.

[9]                             
The ASF was neither
videotaped nor preceded by sworn oath or affirmation.  D.S. was told that, for
endorsing the agreed statement, no further statement regarding the murder would
be required from him.  During his testimony at the appellant’s trial, he said
that was one of the reasons that motivated him to plead guilty.

[10]                         
During examination-in-chief,
the Crown asked D.S. to adopt the ASF.  D.S. testified that he could not
remember signing the document, but acknowledged that it bore his signature. 
D.S. further denied the facts in the statement implicating the appellant. 
Instead, D.S. testified that the gun was his own; he shot the victim because of
the way he was talking; and he threw the gun into the river after the shooting.

[11]                         
In response to D.S.’s denials, the Crown sought
to adduce the ASF for the truth of its contents.  The trial judge rejected the
Crown’s application.  At the close of the Crown’s case, the trial judge granted
the defence’s application for a directed order acquitting the appellant.

III.    Decisions Below

[12]                         
Following a voir dire, Flynn J. ruled
that the signed ASF — hearsay evidence by virtue of being an out-of-court
statement adduced for the truth of its contents — did not meet the threshold
reliability required for it to be admissible as evidence.  None of the
safeguards identified in this Court’s decision in R. v. B. (K.G.),
[1993] 1 S.C.R. 740 (K.G.B.), for reducing the dangers associated with
hearsay had been undertaken.  The statement was not videotaped; there had been
no recital of an oath or affirmation; and the transcript of the guilty plea
proceedings was not a suitable substitute to assess D.S.’s demeanour and
credibility at the time the statement was made.  Furthermore, the statement had
been drafted by counsel; it was not offered spontaneously and was not in D.S.’s
own words.

[13]                         
Referring to R. v. Conway (1997), 36 O.R.
(3d) 579 (C.A.), Flynn J. noted that the opportunity for an effective
cross-examination at trial would be “to a large extent illusory” where the
declarant experiences significant memory lapses or where he recants (A.R., vol.
I, at p. 61).  D.S.’s refusal to waive solicitor-client privilege precluded
questions to D.S. or his counsel about how D.S. came to implicate the appellant
(A.R., vol. I, at p. 59).

[14]                         
 Flynn J. found insufficient means for the jury
to assess the reliability of the ASF as a prior inconsistent statement and held
that it was not admissible as evidence for the truth of its contents.

[15]                         
The Ontario Court of
Appeal concluded that the trial judge erred in his understanding of the scope
of solicitor-client privilege.  Solicitor-client privilege would not have
precluded all questioning of D.S. or his counsel regarding the ASF or his
choice to implicate the appellant.  The Court of Appeal also held that the
trial judge further erred in strictly focussing on the K.G.B.
requirements for establishing reliability and in failing to consider other
factors, such as the solemnity of the occasion upon which D.S. adopted the ASF
and the involvement of counsel in preparing it.

[16]                         
Satisfied that without such errors the trial
judge might have admitted the ASF into evidence, the Ontario Court of Appeal
allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittal, and ordered a new trial.

IV.    Issues

[17]                         
The question in this
appeal is whether the trial judge erred in finding that there were insufficient
safeguards to establish threshold reliability to admit the ASF as evidence and,
if he did, whether the error had a material bearing on the result.  Answering
this question requires the consideration of two issues:

(a)        Did the trial judge err in finding that cross-examination
did not provide a sufficient basis for the jury to assess the truthfulness of
the prior inconsistent statement?

(b)        Did the trial judge err in finding that the circumstances
surrounding the making of the prior inconsistent statement did not provide
sufficient guarantees of substantive reliability?

V.     Legal Principles

A.     Hearsay and Threshold Reliability

[18]                         
Hearsay evidence — an out-of-court statement
tendered for the truth of its contents — is presumptively inadmissible.  This
is because the dangers associated with hearsay evidence may undermine the
truth-seeking function of a trial or its fairness.  These dangers typically
include an inability to test and assess a declarant’s perception, memory,
narration, or sincerity:  R. v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R.
787, at para. 2.

[19]                         
The law has conventionally favoured the evidence
of witnesses who give evidence in court because they can be observed, under
oath or affirmation, and their credibility and reliability can be tested
by cross-examination.  These elements help the trier of fact assess the
credibility of the declarant or witness, the reliability of the evidence, and
the degree of probative force it carries.  When these elements are absent, as
is the case with a statement made outside of the court, it is more difficult
for the trier of fact to make these assessments.

[20]                         
Over time, however, the
law has recognized that in certain circumstances, it may be safe to rely on
out-of-court statements for the truth of their contents.  Exceptions to the
hearsay rule developed for statements carrying certain guarantees of inherent
trustworthiness, often because of the circumstances in which they were made
(for example, dying declarations and declarations that are adverse in
interest).

[21]                         
In addition to the
traditional exceptions, however, this Court developed a principled approach
that permits trial judges to admit hearsay evidence if it meets the twin
threshold requirements of necessity and reliability.  This is a flexible
case-by-case examination.  See especially R. v. Khan, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
531; R. v. Smith, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915; K.G.B.; R. v. U. (F.J.),
[1995] 3 S.C.R. 764; and R. v. Blackman, 2008 SCC 37, [2008] 2 S.C.R.
298, at para. 38.  With the increased flexibility provided by the principled approach,
however, the gatekeeper function of the trial judge becomes more complex and
nuanced.

[22]                         
Where a witness recants from a prior statement,
necessity is established: Khelawon, at para. 78.  The focus in this case
is on whether the prior inconsistent statement meets threshold reliability.

[23]                         
The trial judge, as the evidentiary gatekeeper,
assesses the threshold reliability of the hearsay statement.  The
decision as to the ultimate reliability of the statement is left to the
trier of fact:  Khelawon, at para. 2. Even if the necessity and
reliability of the hearsay evidence are proven, the trial judge maintains
discretion to exclude the evidence where the “prejudicial effect is out of
proportion to its probative value”:  Khelawon, at para. 3.

[24]                         
Why not simply let the trier of fact determine
both threshold and ultimate reliability?  Professors D. M. Paciocco and L.
Stuesser provide the following explanation, with which I agree:

In considering “reliability”,
a distinction is made between “threshold” and “ultimate” reliability.  This
distinction reflects the important difference between admission and reliance. 
Threshold reliability is for the trial judge and concerns the admissibility of
the statement.  The trial judge acts as a gatekeeper whose function “is limited
to determining whether the particular hearsay statement exhibits sufficient indicia
of reliability so as to afford the trier of fact a satisfactory basis for
evaluating the truth of the statement.”  So long as it can be assessed and
accepted by a reasonable trier of fact, then the evidence should be admitted. 
Once admitted, the jury remains the ultimate arbiter of what to do with the
evidence and deciding whether or not the statement is true.

 

(The Law of Evidence (6th ed. 2011), at pp. 122-23)

 

See R.
v. Hawkins, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1043, at para. 75; and Khelawon, at
paras. 50-52.

[25]                         
Threshold reliability serves an important
function.  Rules of evidence and principles governing the admissibility of
evidence exist in the first place because experience teaches that certain types
of evidence can be presumptively unreliable (or prejudicial) and can undermine
the truth-seeking function of a trial.  Rules of admissibility of evidence
address trial fairness and provide predictability.  They also provide the means
to maintain control over the scope of criminal trials to keep them manageable
and focussed on probative and relevant evidence.

B.     Admissibility of Prior Inconsistent Statements

[26]                         
Historically, an out-of-court prior inconsistent
statement of a non-accused witness was admissible only to impeach the
credibility of the witness.  A prior inconsistent statement — hearsay evidence
— was not admissible for the truth of its contents unless the witness adopted
the prior statement in court.  Otherwise, the jury was limited to rejecting the
viva voce evidence of the recanting witness; the jury could not
substitute the contents of the out-of-court statement.

[27]                         
This traditional rule
excluding prior inconsistent statements was altered in K.G.B. to conform
with the evolving principled approach to hearsay.  On an exceptional basis, a
prior inconsistent statement is admissible for the truth of its contents,
provided the threshold criteria of necessity and reliability are established.

[28]                         
In K.G.B., at p. 787, Lamer C.J. stated that the focus of the
reliability inquiry, when dealing with prior inconsistent statements, “is on
the comparative reliability of the prior statement and the testimony offered at
trial, and so additional indicia and guarantees of reliability . . . must be
secured in order to bring the prior statement to a comparable standard of
reliability before such statements are admitted as substantive evidence”.

[29]                         
Accordingly, Lamer C.J.
held, at pp. 795-96, that a prior inconsistent statement of a non-accused
witness may be admitted for the truth of its contents if the so-called K.G.B.
reliability indicia are met:  (1) the statement is made under oath or solemn
affirmation after a warning as to possible sanctions if the person is
untruthful; (2) the statement is videotaped or recorded in its entirety; and
(3) the opposing party has a full opportunity to cross-examine the witness on
the statement.  Such K.G.B. statements have become prevalent, especially
in murder investigations.

[30]                         
However, the K.G.B. indicia are not the
only means of establishing threshold reliability.  The prior inconsistent
statement’s threshold reliability may be established by:  (1) the presence of
adequate substitutes for testing truth and accuracy (procedural reliability);
and (2) sufficient circumstantial guarantees of reliability or an inherent
trustworthiness (substantive reliability):  Khelawon, at paras. 61-63.
These two principal ways of showing threshold reliability are not mutually
exclusive:  R. v. Devine, 2008 SCC 36, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 283, at para. 22.

[31]                         
The admissibility of
hearsay evidence, such as the prior inconsistent statement in this case, is a
question of law.  Of course, the factual findings that go into that
determination are entitled to deference and are not challenged in this case. 
As well, a trial judge is well placed to assess the hearsay dangers in a
particular case and the effectiveness of any safeguards to assist in overcoming
them.  Thus, absent an error in principle, the trial judge’s determination of threshold
reliability is entitled to deference:  R. v. Couture, 2007 SCC 28,
[2007] 2 S.C.R. 517, at para. 81.

[32]                         
To obtain a new trial
following an acquittal, the Crown must show that the trial judge erred and that
this error “might reasonably be thought . . . to have had a material bearing on
the acquittal”:  R. v. Graveline, 2006 SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, at
para. 14.  The Crown is not required to establish “that the verdict would
necessarily have been different”:  Graveline, at para. 14.  This is
still, however, a “heavy onus” for the Crown:  R. v. Briscoe, 2010 SCC
13, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 411, at para. 26.

VI.     Application

[33]                         
 In light of the trial
judge’s obligation to act as evidentiary gatekeeper, I turn first to the
specific hearsay dangers posed by the prior inconsistent statement in this case
as noted by the trial judge.  In the context of the plea bargain, D.S. had a
strong incentive to minimize his role in the crime and to shift responsibility
to the appellant, a co-accused, in order to obtain a favourable outcome.  There
was no opportunity to observe the demeanour of D.S. or his own choice of words,
as the ASF was drafted by counsel and was not spontaneous.  When D.S. asserted
solicitor-client privilege, the ability to cross-examine was curtailed.

[34]                         
The trial judge therefore considered whether
cross-examination of D.S. at the appellant’s trial would provide an adequate
procedural basis to permit the jury to assess the veracity of the prior
statement and whether there were other circumstances that provided circumstantial
assurances of trustworthiness.

A.     Procedural Substitutes:  The Opportunity to Cross-Examine
the Recanting Witness

[35]                         
The most important
factor supporting the admissibility of a prior inconsistent statement of a
non-accused witness for the truth of its contents is the availability of the
non-accused witness for cross-examination.  In Couture, Charron J. held
that “the availability of the declarant for cross-examination goes a
long way to satisfying the requirement for adequate substitutes” for testing
the evidence (at para. 92) and that “the opportunity to cross-examine is the
most powerful factor favouring admissibility” (para. 95).

[36]                         
In assessing the means by which a jury could
rationally evaluate the truthfulness and accuracy of the statement, the trial
judge correctly noted the importance of cross-examination.  He stated that it
was an important means for the jury to determine whether a previous statement
from a witness was ultimately reliable.  However, referring to Conway,
the trial judge noted that the opportunity for an effective cross-examination
of D.S. at the appellant’s trial would be “to a large extent illusory” due to
D.S.’s memory lapses with respect to the ASF and his invocation of
solicitor-client privilege.

[37]                         
With respect to
solicitor-client privilege, the trial judge concluded: 

Solicitor/client privilege precluded
questions to or from [D.S.] or indeed of his counsel about how it came to be
that this confession from [D.S.] as the shooter and his implication of the
accused as the person who provided him with the gun and directed him to do the
shooting was made on the day of his guilty plea almost two years after his
arrest when he had never confessed or implicated Yousanthan Youvarajah in all
that time. [A.R., vol. I, at p. 59]

[38]                         
The respondent agrees
with the Ontario Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred in overstating the
scope of solicitor-client privilege and failed to recognize that there would be
significant areas of cross-examination open to counsel at trial.  The Court of
Appeal found that the trial judge erred in relying on Conway to conclude
that cross-examination of D.S. would be “to a large extent illusory”.  As a result,
the court concluded that the trial judge may have admitted the ASF if he had
appreciated the broader scope of cross-examination available to test its
reliability.

[39]                         
The Court of Appeal
concluded that both counsel and the trial judge appeared “to have been of the
mistaken view” that solicitor-client privilege would preclude certain questions
being asked of D.S. with respect to the ASF (2011 ONCA 654, 107 O.R. (3d) 401,
at para. 93).  Further, at para. 95, the Court of Appeal cited the trial
judge’s statement that “no legal witnesses that have [ever] spoken to [D.S.]”
should be called (A.R., vol. II, at p. 132).

B.  Solicitor-Client Privilege

[40]                         
On a strict reading of the passage quoted above,
I agree that the trial judge overstated the scope of solicitor-client
privilege.  It would have been more accurate for the trial judge to say that it
precluded many questions about his decision to accept the plea bargain
and his reasons for implicating the appellant. Simmons J.A., for the unanimous
panel of the Court of Appeal, outlined a number of areas of questioning that
remained available to the Crown (see para. 84).

[41]                         
However, for the reasons that follow, on my
reading of the reasons and the voir dire record, I am not persuaded that
the trial judge erred in concluding that cross-examination was “to a large
extent illusory” and insufficient to overcome the hearsay dangers in this
particular case.  Further, I do not agree that the trial judge precluded the
Crown from conducting a more probing cross-examination of the witness or from
calling other witnesses about the creation of the ASF.  Finally, I am not
persuaded that any overstatement of the scope of solicitor-client privilege
would have had a material impact on the conclusion that cross-examination was
not, in this case, a sufficient means to satisfy threshold reliability.

[42]                         
Once D.S. confirmed that
he would not waive solicitor-client privilege, the Crown chose to circumscribe
its cross-examination and had no further questions of the witness.  The trial
judge made no comments suggesting that there should be no further
cross-examination of the witness on the voir dire.

[43]                         
The following exchange
between Crown counsel and the trial judge occurred after independent counsel
confirmed that D.S. would not waive solicitor-client privilege (A.R., vol. II, at
p. 132):

[CROWN COUNSEL]:  And I don’t
anticipate even now given the comments of [D.S.’s independent counsel] Mr.
Marentette I don’t anticipate needing to call further witnesses.

THE COURT:  Well, no legal
witnesses that have ever spoken to this man anyway.

[CROWN COUNSEL]:  Right.

THE COURT:  Right.  I mean
we’re going to take Mr. Marentette’s word as the final word on that.

[CROWN COUNSEL]:  Right.

[44]                         
This exchange between
the trial judge and Crown counsel must be read in context.  It does not amount
to a direction or a ruling not to call other witnesses.  The trial judge merely
affirmed Crown counsel’s statement that he would not be calling any “legal
witnesses that have ever spoken to” the witness (emphasis added).  The
judge was not asked for a ruling.  Had Crown counsel wished to call further
evidence, he could have sought direction.  The judge would no doubt have sought
submissions and considered the extent of the restrictions imposed by
solicitor-client privilege before making a ruling.

[45]                         
Since this was the same
Crown who had prosecuted D.S. at his separate youth trial, and who negotiated
the plea bargain and drafted the ASF, he knew what D.S. or his lawyers could
say about those matters, outside the scope of solicitor-client privilege. 
Thus, I reject the submission that the trial judge curtailed the scope of
evidence on the voir dire.

[46]                         
I conclude that the voir dire unfolded as
it did primarily due to the Crown’s prosecutorial decisions.  Crown counsel was
not precluded by the trial judge from calling further witnesses or from posing
further questions to D.S.  The Crown cannot ask for a new trial on the basis
that the prosecution should have been conducted differently.

[47]                         
Further, it should not be inferred from this
exchange that the trial judge did not correctly understand the scope of
solicitor-client privilege when he made his ruling on the voir dire. 
Trial judges are presumed to know the law.  Further, given the context of this
informal exchange, I am not persuaded that it provides a basis to conclude that
the trial judge did not understand the scope of solicitor-client privilege.  He
was neither stating a legal principle nor making a ruling.

[48]                         
Finally, notwithstanding
the aspects of cross-examination that would have remained available, the
reality is that solicitor-client privilege would curtail significantly the
cross-examination available to assess the threshold reliability of the prior
inconsistent statement.  The Crown could not have probed the conversations
between D.S. and his counsel about legal advice in connection with his decision
to plead guilty or to accept the ASF.

[49]                         
Simply put, D.S. recanted the portions of the ASF that implicated the
appellant and replaced them with assertions that exonerated the appellant. 
Cross-examination of D.S. did not elicit an explanation for his about-face from
the assertions that tied the appellant to the murder.  This Court stated in
U. (F.J.), at para. 46, that if the witness “provides an explanation for
changing his or her story, the trier of fact will be able to assess both
versions of the story, as well as the explanation”.  Paciocco and Stuesser
similarly state that “[a] testing of the witness’s recantation is only possible
when the witness admits making the earlier statement and provides a story
for his or her recantation” (p. 131 (emphasis added)).  See also Khelawon,
at para. 76.

[50]                         
In this case, solicitor-client privilege would
hinder the fact finder’s opportunity to fully explore any explanation offered. 
The jurisprudence emphasizes the presence of a “full opportunity to
cross-examine the witness [at trial] respecting the statement”:  K.G.B.,
at p. 796 (emphasis added).  In Devine, Charron J. held:

It is
important to note that the availability of the declarant to be cross-examined
will not necessarily tip the scales in favour of admissibility.  In order for
this factor to weigh in favour of admission, there must be a “full opportunity
to cross-examine the witness” at trial (K.G.B., at p. 796). [para. 26]

[51]                         
The trial judge referred
to Conway, a case in which the witness could not recall making the prior
statement and in which cross-examination therefore would not assist in
determining which version was true.  Unlike Conway, two versions of the
events were before the trial judge in this case that could have been the
subject of cross-examination (i.e., the ASF and D.S.’s testimony at the
appellant’s trial).

[52]                         
The trial judge noted in this case that there
were significant memory lapses in addition to D.S.’s recantation and direct
contradiction.  I am not satisfied that a fair reading of the trial judge’s
reasons suggests that he misunderstood the law.  While he quoted from Conway,
and the circumstances in that case were somewhat dissimilar, the words he
quoted were apt.

[53]                         
As noted above,
solicitor-client privilege would have significantly limited the effectiveness
of the cross-examination.  Thus, even if the trial judge had erred in
overstating the scope of solicitor-client privilege or the analogy to Conway,
I am not persuaded that it would have materially affected the outcome in these
circumstances.

[54]                         
Given the nature of the
hearsay dangers in this particular case, the trial judge did not err in
concluding that nothing short of full cross-examination could overcome them. 
Here, the cross-examination at trial would be significantly limited by the
claim of solicitor-client privilege.  The statement was not videotaped.  There
had been no oath or affirmation when the statement was made.  The transcript of
the guilty plea proceedings established the words of the prior statements but
was not a suitable substitute to assess D.S.’s demeanour and credibility at the
time the statement was made.  Lastly, the ASF was not spontaneous and was not
in D.S.’s own words.  Under the circumstances, I cannot conclude that the trial
judge erred in finding that there were inadequate substitutes to test and
assess the truth of the evidence.

C.     Inherent Trustworthiness:  The Circumstances Surrounding
the Preparation and Presentation of the ASF

[55]                         
If the circumstances in
which the out-of-court statement came about do not give rise to a concern over
whether the statement is true or not, the statement possesses an inherent
trustworthiness or substantive reliability.

[56]                         
The Ontario Court of Appeal concluded that the
trial judge erred in failing to consider whether the circumstances surrounding
the preparation and presentation of the ASF provided an inherent
trustworthiness to establish threshold reliability.

[57]                         
In my view, the circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness asserted by the respondent — the
thorough process in creating the ASF, the involvement of counsel, and the
solemnity of the guilty plea proceeding — do not establish threshold
reliability for the statements from which D.S. recanted, which served to
minimize his involvement in the murder and shift responsibility to the
appellant.  In the circumstances of this case, the formality of the process and
the involvement of counsel only provide comfort in respect of D.S.’s statements
admitting his own culpability for the murder.

[58]                         
D.S.’s guilty plea was,
indeed, a solemn occasion.  The ASF was drafted by the Crown and defence
counsel.  It was signed and acknowledged in open court by both D.S. and his
defence counsel at the time D.S. pleaded guilty to second degree murder.  D.S.
was represented by counsel when he endorsed the ASF and it formed the basis
upon which the judge entered a conviction for second degree murder and
fashioned his sentence.

[59]                         
To the extent that the ASF incriminated D.S.,
was against his interests, and admitted his own culpability in court, these
circumstances provide a compelling inference that those statements were in fact
reliable in establishing D.S.’s criminal conduct.  However, the underlying
rationale for the admissibility of admissions as against the party making them
falls away when they are sought to be used against a third party.

[60]                         
Here, the portions of the ASF that the Crown
sought to rely upon at the appellant’s trial are statements that shifted
responsibility for the murder from D.S., the shooter, to his co-accused, the
appellant.  They were elements that would support a plea to the lesser offence
of second degree murder as well as support a more advantageous sentence.

[61]                         
Furthermore, the
involvement of defence counsel provides no meaningful check on the danger of an
accused acknowledging false allegations against a third party in order to
obtain a favourable plea bargain.  Counsel have an ethical duty to not
knowingly mislead the court.  However, it does not require them to verify or
investigate the truth of information they present; and the duty is triggered
only where counsel has information leading to the “irresistible conclusion”
that something is false.  See M. Proulx and D. Layton, Ethics and Canadian
Criminal Law (2001), at pp. 40-47 and 460.

[62]                         
The suggestion that the solemnity of the
occasion or the involvement of counsel increases the inherent trustworthiness
of the statement does not resonate to the extent that it incriminates a third
party — in this case a co-accused.  Criminal law is generally and rightfully
suspicious of allegations made by a person against an accomplice.  It has long
been recognized that evidence of one accomplice against another may be
motivated by self-interest and that it is dangerous to rely on such evidence
absent other evidence which tends to confirm it.  The fact that such statements
are contained in an ASF does not provide any reassurance of reliability.  Indeed,
statements by a co-accused or accomplice are recognized as inherently
unreliable.

[63]                         
Vetrovec warnings issued by trial judges, for example, provide jurors with direction
to consider “all of the factors that might impair [the] credibility [of the
testimony of co-accused or accomplices]”:  R. v. Khela, 2009 SCC 4,
[2009] 1 S.C.R. 104, at para. 31.  Triers of fact, under such conditions, are
able to determine whether the “evidence properly weighed [overcomes] its
suspicious roots”: R. v. Brooks, 2000 SCC 11, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 237, at
para. 69.

[64]                         
The administration of justice would not be
enhanced in permitting admissions made by a co-accused in his own interest, as
part of a plea bargain for a conviction of a lesser crime and favourable
sentence, to be used against a co-accused, in circumstances where the
reliability of the statements cannot be adequately tested.

[65]                         
In this case, the trial judge was alive to the circumstances surrounding the preparation and
presentation of the ASF.  He described the circumstances in some detail,
including those that weighed in favour of and against reliability.  He
considered whether the solemnity of D.S.’s guilty plea proceeding demonstrated
the trustworthiness of the ASF.  He appreciated that defence counsel assisted
Crown counsel in the drafting of the statement and that, according to testimony
during the voir dire, the information about the source of the gun came
from the defence.  He also noted the evidence from D.S. that he did not
understand all of the words in the ASF and that the assurance he would not have
to give any further statement to the police was one of the reasons he agreed to
the plea bargain.

[66]                         
The trial judge identified D.S.’s incentive to minimize his own involvement in order to obtain
a youth sentence for second degree murder.  Indeed, D.S. testified that he
agreed to facts outside of his knowledge or which he knew to be wrong in order
to secure his plea bargain. In the context of this plea bargain, D.S. was
motivated to minimize his own conduct and maximize that of the co-accused.

[67]                         
In the circumstances of this case, I cannot
conclude that the trial judge erred by failing to consider whether the
solemnity of the occasion or the involvement of counsel provided circumstantial
guarantees of substantive reliability.

VII.  Summary and Conclusion

[68]                         
The trial judge may have
overstated the scope of solicitor-client privilege and its consequences for the
cross-examination of D.S.  However, I am not persuaded that the Crown has
satisfied its burden to show that any errors would have materially affected the
conclusion reached by the trial judge.

[69]                         
The circumstances
identified by the trial judge raise significant concerns about the threshold
reliability of the portions of the ASF upon which the Crown sought to rely at
the appellant’s trial, all of which minimized D.S.’s involvement in the murder.
 D.S. endorsed the ASF as part of a plea bargain for second degree murder and a
sentence in youth court. In these circumstances, there was motivation to shift
responsibility to his co-accused.  D.S. was also assured that he would not have
to make any further statements to police and he testified at the appellant’s
trial that this was one of the reasons that he had accepted the plea
agreement.   D.S. further testified that he agreed to some facts in the ASF
that he said he did not or could not know and that he did not understand
everything that he read before agreeing to the statement’s contents.  Those
portions of the ASF that shifted responsibility for the murder to the appellant
are inherently unreliable.

[70]                         
Further, the trial judge identified the following factors that made it difficult to
assess the veracity of the prior inconsistent statement.  The statement was not
videotaped or taken under oath.  There was no opportunity to assess D.S.’s
demeanour or rely upon any spontaneous choice of words.  The police and Crown
counsel chose not to videotape, under oath, as is routinely available,
especially in homicide cases.

[71]                         
In light of these
difficulties, only a full and complete opportunity to cross-examine would have
provided a genuine basis on which to assess the reliability of D.S.’s
statements.  His invocation of solicitor-client privilege, however, would
preclude a full opportunity to cross-examine him.

[72]                         
The trial judge did not
err in finding that the jury would not have the tools to assess or test the
truthfulness of the exculpatory portions of the ASF.  I would allow the appeal and restore the acquittal.

                     The
reasons of Rothstein and Wagner JJ. were delivered by

                    Wagner J. (dissenting) — 

I.       Background

[73]                         
At its core, this case deals with the
admissibility of hearsay statements under the principled approach to hearsay
rooted in necessity and reliability.  The hearsay evidence in question is a
prior statement which was inconsistent with the testimony of a witness (also
the co-accused) at the trial of the accused.  The prior inconsistent statement
was an Agreed Statement of Facts (“ASF”) which was read in as part of the
guilty plea of the co-accused who was being tried separately as a youth.  

[74]                         
While there is a great deal of case law that has
dealt with prior inconsistent statements under the principled approach, there
are two wrinkles which make its application to this case unique.  First, unlike
the police and out-of-court statements that are dealt with in much of the
existing jurisprudence, the ASF at issue was accepted by the courts as part of
a guilty plea and sentencing relating to the co-accused’s participation in the
crime in question.  Second, the analysis under the principled approach was
fraught with procedural errors stemming from the conduct of the trial judge as
well as both Crown and defence counsel.  With these two differences in mind and
for the reasons that follow, I believe that the question of admissibility must
be redetermined in a new trial.  

II.     Background

[75]                         
The appellant, Yousanthan Youvarajah, stands
accused of the first degree murder of Andrew Freake who was shot and killed
during a drug deal that went wrong on October 11, 2007.  While Youvarajah did
not pull the trigger, the Crown contends that the appellant orchestrated the
shooting of Freake as retribution for being short-changed during two earlier
sales of cocaine.

[76]                         
The events leading to
the fatal shooting were initiated when Youvarajah called Freake to arrange for
the purchase of one and a half pounds of marijuana.  After a series of delays,
including an initial meeting in an apartment building and two changes of venue
for the exchange due to excessive crowds, the parties met in Clyde Park to
complete the transaction.  Freake, who was accompanied by two friends, followed
the appellant into the park.

[77]                         
Youvarajah was accompanied by a young person,
D.S., and two other acquaintances, Abhishaik Shinde and Raibeen Mohammad.  They
went to the meeting place in an SUV driven by Shinde.  D.S. sat in the front
passenger seat with the appellant sitting directly behind him.  Mohammad sat in
the back seat behind Shinde.

[78]                         
Once inside the park,
Shinde drove the SUV onto a grassy area and Freake stopped in a nearby parking
lot.  Freake and one of his acquaintances approached the SUV by foot carrying
three bags of marijuana.  Two bags of marijuana were passed into the car to be
tested.  When Freake refused to pass the third bag, D.S. pulled out a handgun
and shot Freake in the chest.

[79]                         
Within days of the
shooting, both D.S. and Youvarajah were arrested and charged with first degree
murder.  The charges against D.S. related to his role as the shooter while
charges against Youvarajah were for planning and orchestrating the shooting.
Since D.S. was a youth, his trial proceeded separately.  He pleaded guilty to
second degree murder with the consent of the Crown.  As part of his guilty plea
proceeding, an ASF which was signed by D.S., his two trial counsel, and the
Crown, was read in and filed.  

[80]                         
In the ASF, D.S. claimed that the appellant (1)
gave D.S. the handgun used in the shooting; (2) told D.S. to shoot Freake at
some point during the drug deal; and (3) demanded that D.S. return the handgun
to him after the shooting.  These three elements of the ASF were crucial components
of the Crown’s case against Youvarajah.

[81]                         
At the appellant’s trial,
D.S. was called to testify about Youvarajah’s alleged involvement in planning
the shooting.  While D.S. confirmed that he was the shooter, his testimony
regarding the appellant’s involvement contradicted portions of the ASF, namely
the three elements previously outlined.  Once on the stand, D.S. claimed that
(1) he obtained the handgun from a prior break and enter; (2) he did not shoot
Freake on Youvarajah’s instructions but rather because Freake was being
disrespectful; and (3) he threw the murder weapon into a river after the
shooting.

[82]                         
In light of D.S.’s testimony, the Crown applied to have the ASF admitted for the truth of its
contents.  The trial judge dismissed the Crown’s application, finding that the
ASF did not meet the standard of threshold reliability that is necessary for
evidence to be admitted under the principled approach to hearsay evidence. 
Without the relevant evidence implicating the accused, the trial judge granted Youvarajah’s
application for a directed verdict of acquittal.  

[83]                         
In reaching his conclusions, the trial judge focused on the three indicia of reliability
outlined in R. v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740 (“B. (K.G.)”). 
After noting that D.S. did not take an oath, he found that the jury would not
have the opportunity to assess the witness’ demeanour since the guilty plea was
not videotaped.  Accordingly, the trial judge’s reliability analysis hinged on
the opportunity of cross-examining D.S. 

[84]                         
During the trial proceedings, defence counsel suggested that the examination of D.S. regarding
the ASF could be restricted by solicitor-client privilege.  D.S. was granted
the opportunity to obtain independent legal advice.  After consulting with
independent counsel, Mr. Marentette, D.S. informed the court that he would not
waive solicitor-client privilege in any way.  In light of D.S.’s assertion of
solicitor-client privilege, the trial judge found that the opportunity to
cross-examine D.S. about the ASF was illusory.  

[85]                         
In his reasons, the trial judge also noted that the ASF lacked additional indicia of
reliability beyond the three markers laid out in B. (K.G.).  Namely, the
ASF was not spontaneous, it was not crafted in D.S.’s own words, and the
circumstances of the ASF allowed the court to infer a motive to lie in order to
secure a lesser sentence as part of the guilty plea.  The trial judge further
noted that D.S. was never warned of the potential penal consequences of later
recanting.  

[86]                         
The Crown appealed the decision to the Ontario Court of Appeal where the acquittal was set aside
and a new trial ordered.  In her reasons, Simmons J.A. addressed three issues. 
First, she held that the trial judge erred in finding that the opportunity to
cross-examine D.S. was illusory.  Specifically, Simmons J.A. found that the
trial judge “put his stamp of approval” on the position of both defence and
Crown counsel that a cross-examination of D.S. or D.S.’s counsel about the
circumstances giving rise to the ASF was precluded due to D.S.’s assertion of
privilege (2011 ONCA 654, 107 O.R. (3d) 401, at para. 95).  Simmons J.A. also
distinguished the instant case from R. v. Conway (1997), 36 O.R. (3d)
579, where the Ontario Court of Appeal found the possibility of cross-examining
a recanting witness to be illusory since he could not recall the prior
statement.  Simmons J.A. found that D.S. could recall portions of the ASF and,
in fact, the three elements crucial to the Crown’s case against Youvarajah.

[87]                         
Second, Simmons J.A. found that the trial judge
erred by unduly focusing on the B. (K.G.) recommended safeguards while
failing to consider other factors relevant to the reliability analysis.  She
found that the lack of “presence” at the time of the prior statement, such as
in the form of a video, was irrelevant due to D.S.’s minimal involvement in the
proceeding and that the solemn circumstances of D.S.’s guilty plea added to the
reliability of the statement.  Simmons J.A. also held that it could be inferred
that D.S. was warned about the penal consequences of recanting since
experienced defence counsel was involved in the preparation and presentation of
the ASF.  

[88]                         
Third, Simmons J.A. briefly addressed the issue
of inherent motive for D.S. to lie in the ASF.  She found that this was an
issue for the trial judge to address at the new trial if the other indicia
considered were not sufficient to meet the standard of threshold reliability.

III.  Issues

[89]                         
The issue before this
Court is simply whether the ASF was sufficiently reliable to be admitted into
evidence for the truth of its contents under the principled approach to hearsay
based on necessity and reliability.  Since necessity is not at issue, the focus
of the analysis that follows will be on the reliability of the ASF.  The
reliability analysis raises a series of sub-issues on the facts before this
Court:

1.         Did the trial judge err in
holding that the opportunity to cross-examine D.S. was illusory as a result of
his invoking solicitor-client privilege?

 

2.         Did the nature of the ASF and the
circumstances under which it was prepared and presented provide sufficient
indicia of reliability?

IV.    Analysis

A.     Overview of Admissibility of Prior Inconsistent Statements
Under the Principled Approach

[90]                         
The principled approach to the admissibility of
hearsay evidence was adopted by this Court in B. (K.G.). Prior to B.
(K.G.), the use of prior inconsistent statements, or any form of hearsay
evidence, was restricted to impeaching witness credibility.  This restriction
was to ensure that untested and unreliable evidence that could lead to an
unfair verdict was excluded and that litigants were provided with the
opportunity to confront witnesses who were adverse to their position.  

[91]                         
In certain circumstances,
hearsay evidence presents minimal dangers to trial fairness.  In those
situations, its exclusion would be more detrimental to the fact-finding
function of the court than its admission.  By endorsing the principled approach
in B. (K.G.), this Court sought to strike a better balance between trial
fairness and the truth-seeking function of the judicial process.  Under the
principled approach, hearsay statements remain presumptively inadmissible, but
may be admitted where necessity and reliability are sufficiently demonstrated.

[92]                         
Necessity arises from the fact that important
evidence leading to the truth would otherwise be lost when a witness recants. 
This aspect of the principled approach requires no further analysis on these
facts.

[93]                         
The reliability requirement is aimed at identifying cases where the dangers of hearsay evidence
may be overcome.  Indeed, in R. v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2
S.C.R. 787, at paras. 62-63, Charron J. indicated that the reliability
requirement will generally be met either (1) by showing that there is no real
concern about a statement’s truth owing to the circumstances in which it arose;
or (2) by showing that there is no real danger that the statement is made in
hearsay form since, in the circumstances, its reliability can be sufficiently
tested by means other than contemporaneous cross-examination and presence. 
These categories are not mutually exclusive and merely provide guidance in
identifying the factors to be considered in an admissibility inquiry.

[94]                         
In B. (K.G.), this Court addressed the presence of adequate substitutes for traditional
safeguards relied upon to test hearsay evidence. The admissibility question in B.
(K.G.) dealt with the prior inconsistent statements made by the accused’s
friends in which they told police that he was responsible for stabbing and
killing the victim.  The three friends recanted at trial and the Crown sought
to have their prior statements admitted for their truth.  While a new trial was
ordered to determine the admissibility of the prior inconsistent statements,
this Court outlined the principled approach to be used in the analysis.

[95]                         
Lamer C.J. indicated that sufficient
circumstantial guarantees of reliability could be found where three indicia
were satisfied: if (1) the statement was made under oath, solemn affirmation or
solemn declaration following an explicit warning as to the criminal
consequences of making false statements; (2) the entire statement was
videotaped; and (3) the opposing party has an opportunity to cross-examine the
witness at trial.

[96]                         
Importantly, Lamer C.J. left the door open for
alternative indicia of reliability, stating, at p. 796:

Alternatively, other circumstantial
guarantees of reliability may suffice to render such statements substantively
admissible, provided that the judge is satisfied that the circumstances provide
adequate assurances of reliability in place of those which the hearsay rule
traditionally requires.

[97]                         
Indeed, subsequent cases
have found hearsay evidence to be admissible even when all three of the indicia
from B. (K.G.) are not present.  R. v. U. (F.J.), [1995] 3 S.C.R.
764, was such a case.  In that case, the accused was arrested for reported
sexual activity with his 13-year-old daughter.  During separate police
interviews, both the accused and his daughter provided matching and specific
details of the same sexual activities and occurrences, including having had
intercourse the previous night.  The issue on appeal was whether the trial
judge erred in allowing the jury to compare the accused’s unadopted statement with
his daughter’s unadopted prior inconsistent statement.  Despite the absence of
an oath and videotaped statement, this Court found that the reliability
threshold was met.  In addition to the ability to cross-examine the accused,
the Court found reliability in the “strikingly similar” statements provided by
the accused and his daughter.

[98]                         
In Khelawon, this Court further clarified
that B. (K.G.) was never intended to create categorical exceptions. 
Rather, admissibility was to be determined using the principled approach on a
case-by-case basis, allowing the indicia of oath, presence (or video), and
cross-examination to provide guidance in the reliability assessment as opposed
to rigid requirements.

[99]                         
Regardless of the circumstances of a particular case and the indicia that may be available for the
reliability analysis, it is crucial not to lose sight of the truth-seeking
function of an admissibility inquiry under the principled approach.  In the
instance of a prior inconsistent statement, the purpose of the admissibility
inquiry is not to make an absolute determination of the reliability of the
hearsay statement as compared with the subsequent testimony.  Rather, the
inquiry is intended to ensure that the statement is sufficiently reliable in
order for the trier of fact to assign the appropriate weight to the evidence.
As Charron J. states in Khelawon, the “general exclusionary rule is a
recognition of the difficulty for a trier of fact to assess what weight, if
any, is to be given to a statement made by a person who has not been seen or
heard, and who has not been subject to the test of cross-examination” (para.
35).

[100]                     
This principle is articulated in B. (K.G.) where this Court draws the distinction between
threshold reliability and ultimate reliability, stating:

The ultimate reliability of the
statement and the weight to be attached to it remain, as with all evidence,
determinations for the trier of fact.  What the reliability component of the
principled approach to hearsay exceptions addresses is a threshold of reliability,
rather than ultimate or certain reliability. [p. 787]

[101]                     
As Charron J. stresses
in Khelawon, at paras. 92-93, this distinction does not mean that
relevant factors should be categorized in terms of threshold and ultimate
reliability.  Rather, a more functional approach should be adopted by which the
context will determine whether certain factors go to threshold reliability. 
The focus of the inquiry should be on the dangers of hearsay evidence and the
circumstances relied upon to overcome those dangers.  However, “it is crucial
to the integrity of the fact-finding process that the question of ultimate
reliability not be pre-determined on the admissibility voir dire” (para.
93).

[102]                     
Given the truth-seeking function of the judicial
process, I am of the view that threshold reliability should be generously
interpreted in the admissibility inquiry.  Trial fairness and protection
against the dangers of hearsay are not sacrificed where the trier of fact is
ultimately able to make reasonable determinations of the weight to be accorded
to evidence before the court.  The reliability inquiry does not need to ensure
absolute reliability.  Rather, the circumstances surrounding the hearsay
evidence must provide a sufficient basis for the trier of fact to assess and
assign the appropriate weight and eventually determine ultimate reliability.

B.     Application to the Case at Hand

[103]                     
As the following
analysis will disclose, the trial judge erred in his determination that the ASF
did not meet the standard of threshold reliability.  That is not to say that
the circumstances in this case provide sufficient evidence to conclusively
determine that the ASF should be admitted. Rather, the admissibility inquiry
was incomplete and did not provide a proper basis for the trial judge to exclude
the relevant evidence.  As articulated by the Ontario Court of Appeal, the
issue of admissibility should be addressed at a new trial where threshold
reliability can be properly assessed.

                    (1)     The Nature of the
Hearsay Evidence in Question

[104]                     
Not all out-of-court statements are created
equal.  Indeed, this idea is captured by the principle from Khelawon that
hearsay evidence will generally be admissible under the principled approach
where there is either inherent reliability or circumstances that allow
reliability to be tested by the trier of fact.   While much of this analysis
hinges on the factors that can reduce the dangers of hearsay, the nature of the
hearsay statement before this Court cannot be ignored.

[105]                     
Much of the jurisprudence pertaining to the admission of prior inconsistent statements deals
with statements made to police (see Khelawon; B. (K.G.); U.
(F.J.); R. v. Couture, 2007 SCC 28, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 517; R. v.
Trieu (2005), 195 C.C.C. (3d) 373 (Ont. C.A.)) and to a lesser degree with
out-of-court conversations (see R. v. Blackman, 2008 SCC 37, [2008] 2
S.C.R. 298) or statements made at preliminary hearings for the trial where
admissibility is in question (see R. v. Hawkins, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1043). 


[106]                     
The hearsay statement at issue in this case is
an ASF which was drafted with the contribution and approval of Crown counsel,
defence counsel and the accused.  More importantly, it was accepted by a court
in the sentencing of a youth for the very serious crime of second degree
murder. While the ASF and guilty plea proceedings did not include an explicit
indication by the Crown that it consented to a lesser charge against D.S.
because of his anticipated subsequent cooperation in proceedings against
Youvarajah, it is certainly implicit in the nature of the plea agreement and
the facts therein.  Accordingly, the ASF was used in some capacity to reduce
the sentence of D.S. for a very serious crime.  

[107]                     
The characteristics of
the ASF in this case are somewhat unique when compared to other statements in
previous case law. Statements to police and out-of-court conversations are not
generally admitted as evidence in proceedings that may limit another
individual’s freedom through sentencing, or that impact on society’s interest
in deterrence, rehabilitation and retribution, not to mention public protection
from dangerous offenders. 

[108]                     
An ASF presented in
court carries an inherent level of reliability that the judicial system accepts
and, in fact, implicitly relies upon in the workings of the administration of
justice.  It follows that not allowing an ASF to be admitted for its truth in a
subsequent hearing, to be weighed and evaluated by the trier of fact, is
problematic when viewed through the wider lens of the repute of the system of
administration of justice.  What does it say about the administration of
justice if the courts accept the reliability of a statement to convict an
individual and to vary the length of his sentence for a crime as serious as
murder, but are unwilling to place that same statement before the trier of fact
in another proceeding to be weighed and considered against a recantation of
that statement?

[109]                     
As a general rule, if a
statement is accepted for its truth by the courts, and used to balance the
liberty interests of the accused with societal considerations such as
deterrence and retribution, then that statement provides a level of implicit
reliability that warrants consideration in the admissibility inquiry in a
subsequent third-party trial.  That is not to say that a statement’s use and
judicial acceptance at a prior proceeding is sufficient in and of itself to
meet the reliability requirement of the principled approach.  Rather, it is
merely a factor that must be considered in the admissibility inquiry, a factor
that goes towards meeting the threshold reliability standard.

[110]                     
Certainly, there are
potential dangers that could arise with the use of such statements at
subsequent trials.  Indeed, these concerns are captured in a line of Ontario
cases that has suggested that care should be taken when considering the
admissibility of a statement for its truth under the principled approach when
it is read in at a witness’s earlier guilty plea (see R. v. Tran, 2010
ONCA 471, 103 O.R. (3d) 131; R. v. D.P., 2010 ONCA 563, 268 O.A.C. 118;
and R. v. McGee, 2009 CanLII 60789 (Ont. S.C.J.)).  There is a whole
host of reasons for which an accused could provide untruthful information in
the context of a guilty plea, including a reduced sentence, expediency of
multiple proceedings, retribution against the target of a subsequent trial
through cooperative testimony, or even the lack of understanding of the meaning
of the statement or of the charges laid against the individual.  

[111]                     
However, these potential
dangers do not apply in every case and the resulting blanket assertions of
unreliability do not take account of the nuanced approach that should take
stock of factors that may add to or detract from the reliability inquiry in the
particular context of the statement in question.  While these cases correctly
highlight some of the reliability concerns with this type of statement, they do
not address some of the potential indicia of reliability that may be found in
certain circumstances.  It requires little imagination to envision circumstances
where making a statement against friends, family, or professional acquaintances
could be socially or even physically detrimental to a recanting witness. These
social or physical ramifications against the interests of the witness provide
an indication of reliability that may be weighed against any motive to lie. But
these are considerations that must be borne out by the evidence and by the
unique circumstances of each case and may not even be necessary to explore in
depth at this stage of the analysis.  Certainly, motive need not be considered
if reliability can be established by other means.  Nevertheless, motive is
something that can provide context to the threshold reliability analysis.  

[112]                     
 I also do not accept
the argument that only the essential elements of the crime detailed in the ASF
are accepted for their truth by the courts in a guilty plea.  The implication
of this proposition is that the courts are willing to accept a statement that
is only partially true so long as it provides the judiciary with the necessary
elements to convict an individual. Beyond the obvious concerns of threatening
individuals’ liberty or reducing sentencing based on documents that are deemed
to be at least partially unreliable or untrue, this creates an arbitrary
distinction about which aspects of a guilty plea are accepted for their truth.

[113]                     
Certainly an argument
could be made that the reliability of a guilty plea rests on the admission
against the interests of the accused. However, as I have stated above, what
constitutes a statement against the interests of the accused may vary from case
to case depending on the circumstances.  Indeed, an individual may place his
safety or even his life in jeopardy by implicating himself in a serious crime. 
This factor should be considered on the circumstances of each case.  A rigid
rule finding that all third-party guilty pleas are unreliable is potentially
detrimental to the truth-finding function of the judicial process.

[114]                     
Further, accepting that only the essential
elements of a guilty plea need to be accepted for their truth ignores the interrelated nature of a guilty plea and sentencing. 
Factors that do not form part of the essential elements of a crime may
nonetheless prove to be pertinent when considering mitigating or aggravating
factors in sentencing.  This is particularly true where the trial judge is
presented with a joint submission by the Crown and the accused concerning
sentencing and must determine whether the recommendation is appropriate within
the entire context of the crime in question.

[115]                     
Looking at the case before this Court, the three
crucial facts from the ASF which the Crown relies on
are certainly not essential elements of D.S.’s crime.  The source of the gun,
D.S.’s reasons for shooting Freake, and the manner in which the gun was
disposed of do not form part of the actus reus or mens rea
relating to D.S.’s crime.  Nonetheless, these factors are relevant to motive
and the degree of planning and deliberation, all of which are properly
considered during sentencing. Allowing a judge to consider these factors in
sentencing, while finding that they are not sufficiently reliable to even be
weighed by the trier of fact in another case, allows for an inconsistent
application of the reliability of evidence and brings the administration of
justice into question.

[116]                     
In summary, when dealing
with threshold reliability, the fact that courts accept the statements read in
on a guilty plea when considering convictions and sentencing is a factor that points to the reliability of the prior
inconsistent statement, even when such statement implicates a third party.  It
would not be prudent to make blanket conclusions about the dangers associated
with this sort of statement, nor about its inherent reliability.  Each case
will have to be examined on its particular circumstances when determining
threshold reliability, but consideration should certainly be given to the
general acceptance of and reliance on statements read in as part of a guilty
plea. 

[117]                     
While the nature of the statement in question
warrants consideration, it is still necessary in the instant case to determine
whether the ASF meets the requirements of necessity and reliability under the
principled approach.  Since necessity is not at issue, the balance of my
analysis will explore whether the threshold of reliability is met.

                    (2)      Reliability

 

[118]                     
The essential question before this Court is
whether the trial judge erred in finding that the ASF was not sufficiently
reliable to be admitted for its truth.  For the reasons that follow, I agree
with the conclusion of the Ontario Court of Appeal that the trial judge failed
to adequately assess the available indicia of reliability and erroneously found
the opportunity to cross-examine D.S. to be illusory.  While the ASF may in
fact prove to be too unreliable to be admitted, the trial judge’s analysis was
insufficient to permit him to come to that conclusion.  As highlighted by
Charron J. in Khelawon, the most important contextual factor in the
reliability inquiry is the availability of the declarant for cross-examination. 
Accordingly, my analysis will begin there.

                    (a)      Cross-Examination

 

[119]                     
The opportunity to cross-examine the declarant
in relation to his prior inconsistent statement warrants strong consideration
in a reliability analysis.  While the concerns of hearsay evidence still exist
even where the declarant is available at trial, cross-examination can go a long
way towards alleviating those concerns.  As Lamer C.J. noted in B. (K.G.),
“the focus of the inquiry in the case of prior inconsistent statements is on
the comparative reliability of the prior statement and the testimony offered at
trial” (p. 787).  The availability of cross-examination allows the opposing
party to test the current version and simultaneously address the declarant’s
initial statement.  As Charron J. states in Khelawon, at para. 41:      


         Hence, although the underlying
rationale for the general exclusionary rule may not be as obvious when the
declarant is available to testify, it is the same — the difficulty of testing
the reliability of the out-of-court statement.  The difficulty of assessing W’s
out-of-court statement is the reason why it falls within the definition of
hearsay and is subject to the general exclusionary rule.  As one may readily
appreciate, however, the degree of difficulty may be substantially alleviated
in cases where the declarant is available for cross-examination on the earlier
statement, particularly where an accurate record of the statement can be
tendered in evidence.  I will come back to that point later.  My point here
is simply to explain why, by definition, hearsay extends to out-of-court
statements tendered for their truth even when the declarant is before the
court. [Emphasis added.]

[120]                     
The issue before this
Court is whether D.S.’s assertion of solicitor-client privilege led to the
opportunity for cross-examination becoming so illusory that it could not be
used to establish reliability.  For the reasons that follow, I agree with the
Ontario Court of Appeal’s finding that the trial judge erred in finding the
opportunity for cross-examination to be illusory.

[121]                     
The first error committed by the trial judge was to overextend the breadth of
solicitor-client privilege and its impact on the ability to cross-examine D.S. 
The trial judge found that solicitor-client privilege precluded questioning
D.S. and his former counsel about the circumstances of the guilty plea, the
drafting of the ASF, and D.S.’s implication of Youvarajah as the person who
provided him the gun and directed him to do the shooting.  While I am loath to
provide a road map for the Crown to follow at a new trial, the Ontario Court of
Appeal was correct in finding that the opportunity to cross-examine D.S. was
not entirely closed and that the trial judge misapprehended the scope and
impact of solicitor-client privilege on the opportunity for cross-examination. 


[122]                     
Solicitor-client privilege is intended to prohibit the disclosure of any form of communication
made in confidence between a lawyer and his client for the legitimate purpose
of obtaining lawful professional advice or assistance, unless the privilege is
waived by the client or a recognized exception to the privilege applies.  This
definition is captured succinctly by J. H. Wigmore in Evidence in Trials at
Common Law (McNaughton rev. 1961), vol. 8, at p. 554, and adopted by this
Court in R. v. McClure, 2001 SCC 14, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 445, at para. 36:

                    Where
legal advice of any kind is sought from a professional legal adviser in his
capacity as such, the communications relating to that purpose, made in
confidence by the client, are at his instance permanently protected from disclosure
by himself or by the legal adviser, except the protection be waived.

[123]                     
This definition does not
encompass all communications between a lawyer and his client.  More importantly
to the admissibility inquiry in this case, solicitor-client privilege does not
foreclose cross-examining D.S. in relation to a number of areas concerning the
ASF.  Specifically, the Ontario Court of Appeal identified six areas about
which D.S. could have been cross-examined, had the trial judge not
misunderstood the scope of solicitor-client privilege:

(1)               D.S.’s understanding of the ASF;

 

(2)               D.S.’s understanding of any conditions that were
attached to the plea deal;

 

(3)               D.S.’s understanding of the consequences of
misleading the police, the court and the Crown;

 

(4)               D.S.’s motive for making what he now asserts were
false statements;

 

(5)               D.S.’s instructions to counsel regarding
communications to the court and the Crown; and

 

(6)               D.S.’s knowledge of the Crown’s theory at the time
he provided counsel with instructions.

[124]                     
Admittedly, these six areas of potentially
permissible lines of questioning could eventually be curtailed by issues of solicitor-client privilege.  However, that is an issue
for the trial judge to address as those possible issues arise.  In any event,
there is certainly the possibility of cross-examination in relation to these
six areas.  Indeed, both defence counsel and Crown counsel cross-examined D.S.
on some of these very issues, eliciting information that could have been
relevant in the reliability assessment.

[125]                     
The Crown elicited
evidence from D.S. regarding his understanding of the ASF.  Specifically, D.S.
acknowledged that at his guilty plea he agreed that “Yousanthan Youvarajah gave
[D.S.] a loaded small black handgun” and that he understood what that meant. 
Further, the Crown read the following statement to D.S. from the ASF:  “When he
was given the gun, [D.S.] was told by Yousanthan Youvarajah to shoot Mr. Freake
sometime during the course of the drug rip off” (A.R., vol. V, at pp. 62-63).
During the Crown’s cross-examination, D.S. admitted that he remembered the
statement being read at his guilty plea and that he agreed to those facts
through his counsel. 

[126]                     
Similarly, defence
counsel was able to elicit substantial information regarding the motive behind
D.S.’s guilty plea and the ASF.  Specifically, during defence counsel’s
cross-examination, D.S. conceded that a factor in his decision to plead guilty
was his impression that he would not have to provide further statements.  He
also agreed to defence counsel’s assertion that D.S. signed an ASF that he knew
contained false information to “get to the end game that day which was pleading
to second degree murder” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 92).  Defence counsel was also
able to elicit D.S.’s assertions that he had never implicated Youvarajah in the
killing until his guilty plea on September 17, 2009.   

[127]                     
These examples are merely illustrative of the
information that was potentially available on cross-examination without
breaching D.S.’s asserted solicitor-client privilege.  Had the trial judge
permitted the cross-examination to proceed and addressed issues involving
solicitor-client privilege as they arose, information sufficient to meet the
threshold reliability standard may have been brought forward.  

[128]                     
The appellant claims
that any cross-examination on the six aforementioned areas would either skirt
the critical issues or be entirely blocked by solicitor-client privilege.  I
cannot agree with this position.  The appellant’s position presupposes that
D.S.’s recantation arose from direct or indirect communications with counsel. 
While this is certainly possible, and maybe even likely, an admissibility
inquiry should not rest on assumptions.  Further, and as I have already alluded
to, limits on cross-examination should not be applied rigidly and absolutely
where solicitor-client privilege is asserted.  Rather, issues of privilege
should be addressed as they arise on cross-examination.  This way, relevant
information that may not be prohibited by the assertion of privilege may still
be elicited, furthering the underlying truth-seeking function of the
proceedings.  

[129]                     
While the issue is not
before this Court, it bears mentioning that this approach is not an invitation
for counsel to attempt to skirt privilege by inducing the waiver of privilege
by an unsuspecting witness who has clearly asserted solicitor-client
privilege.  Solicitor-client privilege is a fundamental principle of the
Canadian legal system.  Any conduct that unscrupulously attempts to erode
solicitor-client privilege should not be encouraged.  While solicitor-client
privilege is not absolute and circumstances may arise where it will be
subordinated, duping a witness into waiving privilege is never an acceptable
practice. 

[130]                     
Given that there were
several subjects about which D.S. could have been cross-examined and that this
could have potentially assisted in establishing reliability, the trial judge
erred in determining that cross-examination was effectively foreclosed by the
claim of solicitor-client privilege.  

[131]                     
The appellant argues that the mistaken view of
the scope of solicitor-client privilege rested solely on the shoulders of Crown
counsel and that the trial judge cannot be held accountable for the tactical
decisions made by counsel.  I cannot agree with this argument, given the facts
before this Court.  Crown counsel certainly misunderstood the implications of
D.S.’s asserted privilege, but the transcripts provide clear indication that
the mistake was shared.  Indeed, defence counsel was the first to state that
any cross-examination was meaningfully foreclosed once D.S. asserted privilege,
a position that, coincidentally or not, was advantageous to the accused’s
case.  Crown counsel seemingly concurred by indicating that he did not
anticipate calling further witnesses after the privilege was asserted.  The
trial judge did not correct these erroneous assumptions.  Rather, as Simmons
J.A. correctly notes, “the trial judge put his stamp of approval on this
approach — and effectively prevented the Crown from reconsidering calling
D.S.’s counsel” (para. 95).  This is evident from the following exchange:

[CROWN COUNSEL]:  And I don’t
anticipate even now given the comments of Mr. Marentette I don’t anticipate
needing to call further witnesses.

 

THE COURT:  Well, no legal
witnesses that have ever spoken to this man anyway.

 

[CROWN COUNSEL]:  Right.

 

THE COURT:  Right.  I mean,
we’re going to take Mr. Marentette’s word as the final word on that.

 

[CROWN COUNSEL]:  Right. [A.R.,
vol. II, at p. 132]

[132]                     
The trial judge’s
misapprehensions were also evident when he stated: “Well, you bump into the
solicitor/client . . . privilege every which way here” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 1). 
Perhaps most telling was the following excerpt from the trial judge’s reasons
where he summarized the impact of solicitor-client privilege without having
heard any argument on the matter:

Solicitor/client privilege precluded
questions to or from [D.S.] or indeed of his counsel about how it came to be
that this confession from [D.S.] as the shooter and his implication of the
accused as the person who provided him with the gun and directed him to do the
shooting was made on the day of his guilty plea almost two years after his arrest
when he had never confessed or implicated Yousanthan Youvarajah in all that
time. [A.R., vol. I, at p. 59]

[133]                     
The appellant is correct
in asserting that a judge must remain an impartial arbiter and refrain from
intervening where parties do not properly raise evidentiary issues (see R.
v. S.G.T., 2010 SCC 20, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 688, at para. 36).  However, it
cannot be said that the trial judge in the present case remained impartial by
weighing in with a clear expression of prohibition.  The appellant’s argument would
be more compelling had the trial judge remained silent on the matter and merely
allowed Crown counsel to proceed, but this was clearly not the case.  At the
very least, the trial judge’s remarks improperly influenced the conduct of
counsel.

[134]                     
While the appellant did
not present the argument before this Court that the instant case was analogous
to the situation in Conway, a brief discussion of that case is
warranted to support the conclusion that the opportunity to cross-examine D.S.
was not illusory.  

[135]                     
In Conway, two men were charged with the
second degree murder of an elderly disabled man while committing a robbery. 
They pleaded not guilty to murder charges but guilty to the lesser charge of
manslaughter on the grounds that they did not have the requisite mens rea,
having ingested intoxicating substances prior to committing the offence.  One
witness provided a written statement to the police denying knowledge of the
killing and provided a subsequent written statement implicating the accused. 
This statement had none of the indicia of reliability outlined in B. (K.G.). 
At trial, the witness could not recall providing either written statement to
police.  In finding the second written statement inadmissible for its truth,
Labrosse J.A. found that the opportunity to cross-examine a witness who
recanted and denied all recollection of the prior inconsistent statement was
illusory.  

[136]                     
The important distinction to be made between that matter and the present one is that two
versions of the witness’s story could not be said to be before the trier of
fact.  The evidence given by the witness amounted to a declaration of “I don’t
remember” (p. 589).  As Labrosse J.A. stresses, the value of cross-examining a
recanting witness lies in assessing the comparative reliability of the two
versions.  Where both versions cannot be tested by the trier of fact, this
cannot be accomplished.    

[137]                     
In the instant case, the potential
cross-examination of D.S. as to his statements does not suffer from the same
deficiency as that encountered in Conway.  Simmons J.A. correctly states
that while D.S. initially claimed not to recall signing the ASF, he later
confirmed that he remembered a number of events set out within the document. 
Indeed, Simmons J.A. astutely points out, at para. 74, that the trial judge
acknowledged this very fact when he stated:  “When cross-examined by the Crown,
[D.S.] admitted making many of the statements in the [ASF] and conceded that many
of those statements were true” (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 49-50).

[138]                     
So while it is possible
for a recanting witness’s cross-examination to prove too illusory to ground a
reliability analysis, this may not be the situation in the present case.  D.S.
was available for cross-examination, he recalled having made many of the
statements within the ASF, he did not dispute understanding the key facts in
the ASF which he subsequently denied at Youvarajah’s trial, and he recalled the
ASF being read in at his guilty plea proceeding.  As a result, Simmons J.A.
correctly summarized that the trial judge erred by failing to assess “whether
it could properly be said that two versions of the events were before the
court; and whether the extent of D.S.’s recollection would afford sufficient
scope to assist the jury in assessing which, if either, version was true”
(para. 79).

[139]                     
Accordingly, the trial
judge erred in precluding a cross-examination which possibly could have gone
towards establishing the threshold reliability of the ASF.  Given the
importance of cross-examination in the admissibility inquiry, this error is
sufficient in and of itself to order a new trial.  However, in the interest of
completeness and of providing guidance for the new trial, I will briefly
address the errors of the trial judge with regard to other indicia of
reliability.  

                    (b)      Other
Indicia of Reliability

[140]                     
The two other indicia of
reliability detailed in B. (K.G.), namely a statement made under oath
and captured by video, were not present in the context of the ASF in this
matter.  However, the inquiry does not end there.  A reliability analysis is
not restricted to the three indicia detailed in B. (K.G.).  In fact, as
stated by Lamer C.J. in B. (K.G.) itself, “other circumstantial
guarantees of reliability may suffice to render such statements substantively
admissible” (p. 796).  This was clearly understood by the Ontario Court of
Appeal in this case where Simmons J.A. stated that “the focus of the threshold
reliability inquiry can change depending on the circumstances of the case”
(para. 123). I also agree with the Ontario Court of Appeal’s finding that other
factors were available in this case that could have satisfied the trial judge
that the circumstances surrounding the drafting and reading in of the ASF
provided assurances of reliability equivalent to an oath and presence, in the
form of video.  If these indicia had been considered and cross-examination had
been permitted, it is possible that threshold reliability would have been
met.    

[141]                     
In the instant case, perhaps the most persuasive
indicia of reliability are the nature of the statement and how it was
constructed.  As quoted above, in Khelawon, at para. 41, Charron J.
indicated that where the declarant is available for cross-examination, an
accurate record of the statement can do much to alleviate the dangers of
hearsay.

[142]                     
The ASF tendered as evidence in D.S.’s guilty
plea proceeding provides just such a record.  Having been reduced to writing,
signed not only by D.S. but by both Crown and defence counsel, and having been
read in to the record in the context of D.S.’s guilty plea, the source of the
document cannot be disputed.  

[143]                     
The nature of how the ASF was constructed
further supports its reliability.  This was not a statement that was unilaterally drafted and forced upon D.S. to adopt. 
Rather, the drafting of the ASF was a collaborative effort where there is
evidence that at least one crucial component to the Crown’s case against
Youvarajah was supplied by defence counsel — namely the statement that
Youvarajah supplied D.S. with the gun.  

[144]                     
Moreover, D.S. had the
opportunity to review the ASF with his counsel prior to signing it and adopting
it.  This is an important aspect as it refutes any negative inferences that
could be drawn against the ASF on the grounds that it was not captured in
D.S.’s own words or that D.S. did not understand its contents.  

[145]                     
The appellant correctly argues that a lawyer’s
ethical obligation not to knowingly present false statements to the court does
not ensure the truth of the contents of the ASF.  However, it does provide some
assurances that D.S. was advised of the consequences of providing a false
statement.  Before entering a guilty plea, counsel has an ethical obligation
under rules of professional conduct to ensure that the client (1) is
voluntarily admitting the elements of the offence; and (2) understands the
implications and possible consequences of a guilty plea, particularly with
regards to the authority and discretion of the court.  In the absence of
evidence to the contrary in the instant case, it is not unreasonable to assume
that counsel would have advised D.S. about the contents of the ASF, the
potential consequences of implicating the appellant, and the potential penal
consequences of subsequently recanting.  This assumption is also supported on
the record by D.S.’s admission that he understood that the basis of his guilty
plea was the ASF.

[146]                     
Perhaps most importantly, D.S. testified that he
understood the three crucial components of the ASF, namely that the appellant gave D.S. the gun, told him to shoot Freake, and
demanded that D.S. return the gun.  Without more persuasive evidence to the
contrary, this essentially forecloses any argument that D.S. lacked
understanding of the ASF’s contents.

[147]                     
Looking beyond the construction of the ASF, the
context of the proceedings under which it was read in to court and the contents
of the ASF itself provide additional indicia supporting threshold reliability. 
As the Ontario Court of Appeal stated, “the solemnity of the occasion on which
the [ASF] was presented” was a feature that favoured threshold reliability
(para. 137).  It certainly would have been ideal for the ASF to have been
adopted under oath or solemn affirmation, but the nature of the guilty plea can
help fill that gap when considered with the other indicia of reliability before
the court.

[148]                     
The Ontario Court of Appeal also correctly
rejected the trial judge’s assertion that the lack of spontaneity of the statement and the fact that it was not in D.S.’s own words
detracted from the reliability of the ASF.  While spontaneity can be an
indication of reliability, its absence does not necessarily detract from it. 
With regards to an ASF prepared in the context of a guilty plea, reliability is
not found through spontaneity but through the carefully crafted language which
is subsequently adopted by the declarant after careful consideration with his
counsel. 

[149]                     
Finally, the Ontario
Court of Appeal concluded that the lack of “presence” when the ASF was read
in at the guilty plea, for example by way of video, was of no
consequence since D.S.’s only contribution was to reply “yes” in response to
two separate questions by counsel (para. 128).  I respectfully disagree with
this assessment.  It is not appropriate to dismiss presence as indicia of
reliability merely because of the declarant’s limited level of involvement or
because of the brevity of his statement.  Had there been video presence, D.S.’s
demeanour could have been assessed throughout the reading in of the ASF as well
as in his answers to the two questions posed to him.  Even if one were to focus
solely on D.S.’s two short responses, such presence could provide invaluable
insight into D.S.’s demeanour and ultimately into the veracity of the
statement.

[150]                     
While I cannot agree with the Ontario Court of
Appeal’s assessment on the issue of presence, I do not think that lack of
presence is detrimental to potentially establishing reliability.  If the
cross-examination is found sufficiently meaningful and other indicia support
the reliability of the ASF, presence may be superfluous.  As I have detailed
above, the reliability indicia from B. (K.G.) are not rigid and the
absence of one factor can be overcome if other factors are sufficient in
establishing threshold reliability.  It is not necessary for me to draw any
firm conclusion in this regard in the instant matter, and this is a question
best left for a new trial where all of the factors can be assessed in concert. 

V.      Conclusion

[151]                     
While there are certainly concerns with admitting evidence from a guilty plea
proceeding at the trial of a third party, I find it unpalatable to apply a
blanket prohibition at the admissibility inquiry stage.  A proper admissibility
inquiry is only intended to determine whether the prior inconsistent statement
has sufficient markers of reliability to allow the trier of fact to reasonably
assess the appropriate weight it should be given.  This is a contextual
question that will change with the particular circumstances of each case.

[152]                     
Based on my analysis
above, I do not think that a proper analysis was conducted in this case —
particularly in relation to the opportunity for cross-examination and the
consideration of other potential indicia of reliability.  Accordingly, the
decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal should be upheld and a new trial
ordered.  Reliability may be properly assessed at the new trial and the
evidence may be appropriately admitted or excluded upon consideration of all
the relevant factors.

[153]                     
For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

on appeal from the court martial appeal court of canada

                    Constitutional
law — Charter of Rights  — Fundamental justice — Armed forces — Prosecutorial
independence — Right to trial by independent tribunal — Members of Canadian
Forces charged with criminal offences — Sections 230.1 and 245(2) of
National Defence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. N‑5 , giving Minister of
National Defence authority to appeal from decisions of court martial or Court
Martial Appeal Court — Whether these provisions violate ss. 7 and 11(d) of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

                    Criminal law — Trial — Evidence — Mistrial — Accused
bringing motion for mistrial on basis of prejudice arising from inadmissible re‑examination
evidence — Whether military judge erred in declining to grant mistrial.

                    C
was charged with two child pornography offences. At trial, defence counsel
objected to re‑examination evidence given by C’s former girlfriend. The
military judge ruled that it was inadmissible and advised the jury panel to
disregard it, but C brought a motion for a mistrial on the basis of the
prejudice arising from it. The military judge dismissed the motion and gave a
further limiting instruction to the panel. C was found guilty. On appeal, a
majority of the Court Martial Appeal Court found that the mistrial ought to
have been granted and ordered a new trial. The Minister of National Defence
(the “Minister”) appeals as of right to this Court, pursuant to s. 245(2) 
of the National Defence Act , arguing that the military judge made no
error in declining to grant a mistrial. C brings a motion to quash the Minister’s
appeal, on the basis that s. 245(2) , which gives the Minister the
authority to appeal to this Court, violates ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .

                    G
and T were each charged with sexual assault. G was acquitted and the Minister
appealed, seeking a new trial. T presented a plea in bar of trial, on the basis
that the matter was not under military jurisdiction because of an insufficient
nexus with military service. The military judge allowed the plea and the
Minister appealed. G and T brought motions to quash the Minister’s appeals on
the basis that s. 230.1  of the National Defence Act , which gives
the Minister the authority to appeal to the Court Martial Appeal Court, violates
s. 7  of the Charter . The Court Martial Appeal Court dismissed the
motions to quash but agreed that s. 230.1  should be invalidated, as it
violates the right to an independent prosecutor. The Minister appeals to this
Court.

                    Held: The motion
to quash should be dismissed and the appeals should be allowed. Sections 230.1 
and 245(2)  of the National Defence Act  are constitutional.

                    The
power that ss. 230.1  and 245(2)  of the National Defence Act  confer
on the Minister — that is, to initiate an appeal — may effect a deprivation of
liberty. Therefore, s. 7 of the Charter  is engaged. The law
recognizes as constitutional the principle that prosecutors must not act for
improper purposes, such as purely partisan motives. This principle is a basic
tenet of our legal system. It safeguards the rights of the individual and the
integrity of the justice system, and it satisfies the criteria to be considered
a principle of fundamental justice. A prosecutor — whether it be an Attorney
General, a Crown prosecutor, or some other public official exercising a
prosecutorial function — has a constitutional obligation to act independently
of partisan concerns and other improper motives.

                    The
Minister, like the Attorney General or other public officials with a
prosecutorial function, is entitled to a strong presumption that he exercises
prosecutorial discretion independently of partisan concerns. The mere fact of
the Minister’s membership in Cabinet does not displace that presumption. The
law presumes that the Attorney General, also a member of Cabinet, can and does
set aside partisan duties in exercising prosecutorial responsibilities, and
there is no compelling reason to treat the Minister differently in this regard.
Accordingly, Parliament’s conferral of authority over appeals in the military
justice system on the Minister does not violate s. 7  of the Charter .
As to the argument that the impugned provisions violate the right to an
independent tribunal guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter ,
it cannot succeed.

                    The
military judge in C’s case did not err in declining to grant a mistrial. Once
an error has occurred at trial, a trial judge may, in deciding whether to grant
a mistrial, consider whether the error has been or can be remedied at trial. The
decision of whether to grant a mistrial falls within the discretion of the
judge, who must assess whether there is a real danger that trial fairness has
been compromised. That discretion is not absolute, but its exercise must not be
routinely second‑guessed by the court of appeal.

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
These appeals present two issues. First, do
provisions of the National Defence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-5 , giving
the Minister of National Defence (the “Minister”) the authority to appeal from
decisions of a court martial or the Court Martial Appeal Court violate ss. 7  or
11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ? Second, did
the military judge in the Cawthorne matter err in declining to grant a
mistrial?

II.          
Background

A.          
Ordinary Seaman Cawthorne

[2]                             
In July 2012, Ordinary Seaman Cawthorne was on exercise near Hawaii. On
July 20, an able seaman found an iPhone on board the ship. To determine the
owner of the phone, the seaman swiped the screen. He saw an image of a man
having sex with a child. The seaman took the phone to a superior. The phone belongs
to O.S. Cawthorne.

[3]                             
O.S. Cawthorne was charged with two child pornography offences under s.
130  of the National Defence Act . O.S. Cawthorne did not contest
ownership of the phone, nor did he deny accessing and possessing pornographic
images of teenage girls. He testified, however, that his practice was to
download an entire thread of pornographic images, without reviewing each image
individually. He claimed that his download of the child pornography was
inadvertent, and that he had not knowingly possessed or accessed child
pornography.

[4]                             
O.S. Cawthorne’s former girlfriend testified for
the prosecution at trial. During her examination-in-chief, she testified about
several conversations she had with him. She stated that he told her that he had
been arrested “for having inappropriate images on his phone”. She also asked him
what types of images were on his phone. When asked if she recalled his answer,
her response was the following: “He said they were children and I believe that
he said they were both male and female.” 

[5]                             
In brief cross-examination, she was asked
whether her conversations with O.S. Cawthorne amounted to his merely advising
her of the allegations against him (i.e., as opposed to his admitting
culpability). She agreed. 

[6]                             
In re-examination, she was asked, “During any of
those conversations, do you recall him saying that he did in fact do these
things?” She said: “Yes.” 

[7]                             
Defence counsel objected, and the military judge
ruled that her evidence on re-examination was inadmissible because it did not
arise from cross-examination. The military judge advised the jury panel to
disregard the question and answer.

[8]                             
The defence then brought a motion for a mistrial
on the basis of the prejudice arising from the inadmissible re-examination
evidence. The military judge dismissed the motion and gave a further limiting
instruction to the panel:

. . . I
further instruct you that you shall not draw any inference against the accused
. . . from that inadmissible evidence because it is both unreliable and
prejudicial. I therefore instruct you to completely and absolutely ignore the
inadmissible evidence and that you shall evacuate from your mind anything about
it.

[9]                             
The panel returned a verdict of guilty on both
counts charged.

[10]                         
A majority of the Court Martial Appeal Court
found that the mistrial ought to have been granted. The court allowed O.S.
Cawthorne’s appeal and ordered a new trial (2015 CMAC 1, 472 N.R. 47). 

[11]                         
The Minister appeals as of right to this Court,
pursuant to s. 245(2) (a) of the National Defence Act . The Minister
argues that the military judge made no error in declining to grant a mistrial.
O.S. Cawthorne seeks to quash the Minister’s appeal on the basis that s. 245(2) 
violates ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter .

B.           
Warrant Officer Gagnon
and Corporal Thibault

[12]                         
Warrant Officer Gagnon and Corporal Thibault
were each charged with sexual assault.

[13]                         
Warrant Officer Gagnon was acquitted. The
Minister appealed to seek a new trial, on the basis that the military judge
erred by putting the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent to the
panel.

[14]                         
Corporal Thibault presented a plea in bar of trial,
claiming that the matter was not under military jurisdiction because of an
insufficient nexus with military service. The military judge allowed the plea
(2015 CM 1001). The Minister appealed.

[15]                         
Warrant Officer Gagnon and Corporal Thibault
brought motions to quash the Minister’s appeals on the basis that s. 230.1  of
the National Defence Act , which gives the Minister the authority to
appeal to the Court Martial Appeal Court, violates s. 7  of the Charter .

[16]                         
The Court Martial Appeal Court dismissed the
motions to quash but agreed that s. 230.1  of the National Defence Act  should
be invalidated. It found that the law’s conferral of the authority to appeal on
the Minister violates the right to an independent prosecutor, which it held is
a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7  of the Charter  (2015 CMAC
2).

III.       
The Challenged Legislation

[17]                         
Sections 230.1  and
245(2)  of the National Defence Act  provide the following:

230.1 The
Minister, or counsel instructed by the Minister for that purpose, has, subject
to subsection 232(3), the right to appeal to the Court Martial Appeal Court
from a court martial in respect of any of the following matters:

(a) with leave of
the Court or a judge thereof, the severity of the sentence, unless the sentence
is one fixed by law;

(a.1 ) the
decision not to make an order under subsection 745.51(1)  of the Criminal
Code ;

(b) the legality
of any finding of not guilty;

(c) the legality
of the whole or any part of the sentence;

(d) the legality
of a decision of a court martial that terminates proceedings on a charge or
that in any manner refuses or fails to exercise jurisdiction in respect of a
charge;

(e) the legality
of a finding of unfit to stand trial or not responsible on account of mental
disorder;

(f) the legality
of a disposition made under section 201, 202 or 202.16;

(f.1) the
legality of an order for a stay of proceedings made under subsection
202.121(7);

(g) the legality
of a decision made under any of subsections 196.14(1) to (3); or

(h) the legality
of a decision made under subsection 227.01(2).

 

      
245 . . . 

      
(2) The Minister,
or counsel instructed by the Minister for that purpose, may appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada against a decision of the Court Martial Appeal Court

(a) on any question of law on which a judge of the Court Martial
Appeal Court dissents; or

(b) on any question of law, if leave to appeal is granted by the
Supreme Court of Canada.

IV.       
Analysis

A.          
Is the Conferral of the Authority to Appeal on
the Minister of National Defence Unconstitutional?

[18]                         
The main question on these appeals is whether
provisions of the National Defence Act  that give the Minister the
authority to appeal from decisions of a court martial or Court Martial Appeal
Court infringe the right to liberty under s. 7  of the Charter , and if
so, whether the limitation is justified under s. 1  of the Charter . It
is also argued that the law infringes the right to trial by an independent
tribunal under s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

[19]                         
Section 7  of the Charter  provides:

7.  Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person
and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the
principles of fundamental justice.

[20]                         
The power that ss. 230.1  and 245(2)  of the National
Defence Act  confer on the Minister — that is, to initiate an appeal — may
effect a deprivation of liberty. Section 7  is engaged.

[21]                         
The next question is whether the deprivation of
liberty conforms to the principles of fundamental justice. If it does not, the
law violates s. 7 .

[22]                         
The answer is found in this Court’s
jurisprudence on prosecutorial independence and abuse of process. It
establishes, as a matter of constitutional law, that partisan or other improper
considerations must not influence prosecutorial decisions.

[23]                         
Our cases on prosecutorial independence tend to
discuss this principle in the context of the role of the Attorney General. In Krieger
v. Law Society of Alberta, 2002 SCC 65, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 372, Iacobucci and
Major JJ., writing for the Court, noted that there is a “constitutional
principle in this country that the Attorney General must act independently of
partisan concerns when supervising prosecutorial decisions”: para. 30. Charron
J. reiterated this point in Miazga v. Kvello Estate, 2009 SCC 51, [2009]
3 S.C.R. 339, describing the independence of the Attorney General as a
“constitutionally entrenched” principle that “requires that the Attorney
General act independently of political pressures from government”: para. 46.
But the logic of these statements clearly extends to Crown prosecutors and
other public officials exercising a prosecutorial function. Indeed, both Krieger
and Miazga cited with approval Binnie J.’s reasons (dissenting on
another point) in R. v. Regan, 2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297, at
para. 157, where he remarked that a Crown Attorney’s duty “to respect his or
her ‘Minister of Justice’ obligations of objectivity and independence” easily
met the criteria for a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7  of the Charter .

[24]                         
These cases establish that a prosecutor —
whether it be an Attorney General, a Crown prosecutor, or some other public
official exercising a prosecutorial function — has a constitutional obligation
to act independently of partisan concerns and other improper motives: see
generally L. Sterling and H. Mackay, “Constitutional Recognition of the Role of
the Attorney General in Criminal Prosecutions: Krieger v. Law Society of
Alberta” (2003), 20 S.C.L.R. (2d) 169, at p. 170; see also M. Rosenberg, “The Attorney General and the
Administration of Criminal Justice” (2009), 34 Queen’s L.J. 813, at pp.
832-36. 

[25]                         
This principle is also reflected in this Court’s
abuse of process jurisprudence. We have long recognized that the Crown’s unfair
or oppressive treatment of an accused can rise to the level of an abuse of the
court’s process and warrant judicial intervention: see R. v. Power,
[1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at pp. 612-15. Both the common law and s. 7  of the Charter 
empower a court to stay proceedings

where compelling an accused to
stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which
underlie the community’s sense of fair play and decency and to prevent the
abuse of a court’s process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings.

 

(R. v. Jewitt, [1985] 2
S.C.R. 128, at pp. 136-37, quoted in R. v. O’Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R.
411, at p. 455.)

Those principles of justice may be
violated where there is “conspicuous evidence of improper motives or of bad
faith” on the Crown’s part: Power, at p. 616. 

[26]                         
I conclude that the law recognizes as constitutional
the principle that prosecutors must not act for improper purposes, such as
purely partisan motives. This principle is a basic tenet of our legal system.
It safeguards the rights of the individual and the integrity of the justice
system. And it satisfies the criteria for a principle of fundamental justice
identified in R. v. Malmo‑Levine, 2003 SCC 74, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571, at para. 113, and Canadian Foundation for Children,
Youth and the Law v. Canada (Attorney General), 2004 SCC 4, [2004] 1 S.C.R.
76, at para. 8. This principle is, accordingly, a principle of fundamental
justice under s. 7  of the Charter .

[27]                         
I emphasize that the scope of “partisan” in this
context is narrow. “Partisan” is not broadly synonymous with “political”. An
Attorney General — like other public officials exercising a prosecutorial
function — is a “protector of the public interest”: Sterling and Mackay, at p.
179. As L’Heureux-Dubé J. explained in Power, at p. 616:

. . . the Attorney General is a member
of the executive and as such reflects, through his or her prosecutorial
function, the interest of the community to see that justice is properly done.
The Attorney General’s role in this regard is not only to protect the public,
but also to honour and express the community’s sense of justice. Accordingly,
courts should be careful before they attempt to “second-guess” the prosecutor’s motives when he or she makes a decision.

[28]                         
Decisions to prosecute (or to not prosecute) can
have broad social repercussions, and regard for those repercussions properly
informs prosecutorial discretion: ibid.; Rosenberg, at pp. 821-22, fn.
24. It is not open to a court to scrutinize this exercise of discretion, or to
question a prosecutor’s particular conception of the public interest. A
government policy of strict prosecution of certain offences, if motivated by
concerns for the public interest, does not offend s. 7 . It is only when the
considerations underlying a prosecution are partisan — that is, when a
prosecutor acts not for the public good, but “for the good of the government of
the day” — that a court’s intervention is warranted:  Sterling and Mackay, at
p. 179, citing I. Scott, “Law, Policy, and the Role of the Attorney General:
Constancy and Change in the 1980s” (1989), 39 U.T.L.J. 109, at p. 121.

[29]                         
Whether a prosecutor’s purposes are “improper”
will depend on the facts of the case. It would be impossible to exhaustively
define all considerations that are improper in the context of a prosecution,
but our abuse of process decisions provide some guidance on that issue. These
decisions indicate that, whatever the circumstances of the particular case, the
bar for finding that a prosecutor’s conduct was prompted by an improper motive
is rightly very high.

[30]                         
Recognition of this principle as one of
fundamental justice does not affect the existing and well-developed doctrine of
abuse of process; indeed, the two are integrally related. Claims of improper
prosecutorial conduct, including partisan-motivated conduct, will continue to
be brought and assessed under the doctrine of abuse of process, which
determines the standard for improper conduct and the appropriate remedy: see Power,
at pp. 615-16; O’Connor, at pp. 465-68.

[31]                         
There is no evidence of any improper prosecutorial
conduct in the cases before us. But the respondents say such evidence is
unnecessary. In their view, the principle of prosecutorial independence
requires both that a prosecutor be independent and that a reasonable
person perceive him or her as independent. The Minister, they say, is
independent neither in fact nor in appearance. They emphasize that the Minister
is a member of Cabinet not bound by the conventions of independence that apply
to the Attorney General, and that the Minister’s “quasi-judicial” role is
incompatible with his control and administration of the Canadian Forces.
Accordingly, the respondents argue that the law’s conferral on the Minister of
authority over appeals in the military justice system violates s. 7  of the Charter .

[32]                         
I cannot agree. The Minister, like the Attorney
General or other public officials with a prosecutorial function, is entitled to
a strong presumption that he exercises prosecutorial discretion independently
of partisan concerns. The mere fact of the Minister’s membership in Cabinet
does not displace that presumption. Indeed, the law presumes that the Attorney
General — also a member of Cabinet — can and does set aside partisan duties in
exercising prosecutorial responsibilities. There is no compelling reason to treat
the Minister differently in this regard.

[33]                         
It follows that Parliament’s conferral of
authority over appeals in the military justice system on the Minister does not
violate s. 7  of the Charter .

[34]                         
It is conceivable that a statute could create a
prosecutorial framework that genuinely casts doubt on a prosecutor’s
independence, for example, by requiring the prosecutor to take partisan or
other improper considerations into account in the exercise of prosecutorial
discretion. But short of such a statutory regime, and in the absence of
“conspicuous evidence” of partisan conduct in a particular case, there is no
violation of s. 7  of the Charter .

[35]                         
The respondents did not press the argument that
the law violates s. 11 (d) of the Charter , except to suggest that
an abusive prosecution may taint the entire judicial process. In my view, the
argument that the law violates the right to an independent tribunal cannot
succeed.

[36]                         
I conclude, accordingly, that the impugned
provisions of the National Defence Act  do not violate s. 7  or s. 11 (d)
of the Charter .

B.           
Did the Military Judge in the Cawthorne Matter
Err in Declining to Grant a Mistrial?

[37]                         
The Crown says that the Court Martial Appeal
Court should not have disturbed the military judge’s considered decision to not
grant a mistrial. It argues that the evidence of O.S. Cawthorne’s former
girlfriend was not inadmissible, but that even if it was, the military judge
correctly applied the proper law. The respondent says that the inadmissibility
of the evidence is not properly before this Court, and further that the
military judge erred in dismissing the motion for a mistrial.

[38]                         
I would give effect to this ground of appeal.
Even if the evidence in question was inadmissible, of which I am not convinced,
the military judge did not err in declining to grant a mistrial.

[39]                         
The legal principles on the granting of a
mistrial were discussed by LeBel J. in his reasons in R. v. Khan,
2001 SCC 86, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823. Once an error has occurred at trial, a trial
judge may, in deciding whether to grant a mistrial, consider whether the error
has been or can be remedied at trial: para. 79. The decision of whether to
grant a mistrial “falls within the discretion of the judge, who must assess
whether there is a real danger that trial fairness has been compromised”: ibid.
That discretion is not absolute, but “its exercise must not be routinely
second-guessed by the court of appeal”: ibid.

[40]                         
The majority of the Court Martial Appeal Court
did not ask itself whether the judge had erred in declining to grant a
mistrial, but instead focused on the curative proviso of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 . The curative proviso applies
only when an error has been established. The issue on appeal is the following:
Did the military judge commit a reviewable error in declining to grant a
mistrial? Only if the answer to that question is yes do we turn to the curative
proviso. The Court Martial Appeal Court erred in failing to ask itself the
right question: see Khan, at para. 19, per Arbour J.

[41]                         
In my view, the military judge did not err in
declining to grant the motion for a mistrial. As LeBel J. stated in Khan,
at paras. 80-82:

A
decision on whether an incident has affected trial fairness in a way which
would warrant declaring a mistrial must take into account any corrective
measure which has been brought, or could be brought, by the judge to remedy the
irregularity . . . .

 

Thus,
when a trial judge realizes that an error has occurred but decides not to order
a mistrial, the court should consider the remedy selected by the judge, if any,
as one of the elements in its assessment of whether the trial has been or has
appeared unfair. If the remedy chosen by the judge consisted of a warning to
the jury on what they should or should not consider in reaching their verdict,
the ability of a jury to follow instructions must be recognized, although this
reality is obviously subject to its own limits. . . . 

 

Thus,
we should not presume that jurors are incapable of following instructions given
by the judge. On the contrary, when the judge issues a clear and forceful
warning about the use of some information, we are entitled to presume that it
diminishes the danger that the jury will misuse this information when rendering
its verdict. [Emphasis added.]

[42]                         
Here, the decision not to grant a mistrial was
within the military judge’s discretion. He made a reasonable attempt to remedy
the error through two instructions, one immediate and another mid-trial. In his
mid-trial instruction, he instructed the panel to disregard the evidence
because it was both “unreliable and prejudicial”. Nothing suggested to the
judge that the panel was unwilling or unlikely to follow his instruction. I
would not interfere with his decision.

V.          
Conclusion

[43]                         
In the Cawthorne matter, I would dismiss O.S.
Cawthorne’s motion to quash the appeal. Section 245(2)  of the National
Defence Act  is constitutional. The Minister’s appeal is allowed and the
convictions entered at trial against O.S. Cawthorne are reinstated.

[44]                         
In the Gagnon and Thibault matter, I would allow
the Minister’s appeal.  Section 230.1  of the National Defence Act  is
constitutional.  The matter is remitted to the Court Martial Appeal Court for
the hearing of the appeals on the merits.

on appeal from the court of appeal for alberta

                    Criminal
law — Evidence — Circumstantial evidence — Inferences — Reasonable verdict —
Accused found guilty on charge of possession of child pornography — Whether
trial judge erred in his analysis of circumstantial evidence by requiring that
inference supporting conclusion other than guilt be based on evidence rather
than upon lack of evidence — Whether guilty verdict was unreasonable. 

                    V
was having problems with his laptop computer, so he left it with a repair shop.
The repair technician found child pornography on the laptop. He called the
police, whose search of the laptop confirmed the presence of child pornography.
V was charged with a number of pornography related offences, including
possession of child pornography. The trial judge found that the mainly
circumstantial evidence against V proved guilt on the charge of possession of
child pornography beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial judge also disagreed
with V that the police search of the laptop violated s. 8  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms . The Court of Appeal concluded that the
judge had misstated the current law respecting circumstantial evidence and that
the verdict of guilt based on that evidence was unreasonable. The Court of
Appeal therefore set aside the conviction and entered an acquittal. The Court
of Appeal declined to consider the Charter  issues because its acquittal
of V made those issues academic.

                    Held: The appeal should be allowed, the acquittal set aside and the case
remanded to the Court of Appeal for hearing and disposition of the Charter  ss. 8  and 24(2) 
issues.  

                    No
particular form of instruction to the jury is required where the evidence on
one or more elements of the offence is entirely or primarily circumstantial.
However, where proof of one or more elements of the offence depends solely or
largely on circumstantial evidence, it may be helpful for the jury to receive
instructions that will assist them to understand the nature of circumstantial
evidence and the relationship between proof by circumstantial evidence and the
requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt. 

                    An
explanation of the difference between direct and circumstantial evidence is included
in most criminal jury charges and rarely causes difficulty. An instruction
concerning the use of circumstantial evidence and the reasonable doubt
instruction have different, although related, purposes. The reasonable doubt
instruction describes a state of mind — the degree of persuasion that
entitles and requires a juror to find an accused guilty. An instruction about
circumstantial evidence, in contrast, alerts the jury to the dangers of the
path of reasoning involved in drawing inferences from circumstantial evidence.
Telling the jury that an inference of guilt drawn from circumstantial evidence
should be the only reasonable inference that such evidence permits will often
be a succinct and accurate way of helping the jury to guard against the risk of
“filling in the blanks” by too quickly overlooking reasonable alternative
inferences. While this Court has used the words “rational” and “reasonable”
interchangeably to describe the potential inferences, there is an advantage of
using the word “reasonable” to avoid the risk of confusion between the
reasonable doubt standard and inferences that may arise from circumstantial
evidence. However, using the traditional term “rational” is not an error as the
necessary message may be imparted in different ways. 

                    A
view that inferences of innocence must be based on proven facts is no longer
accepted. In assessing circumstantial evidence, inferences consistent with
innocence do not have to arise from proven facts. The issue with respect to
circumstantial evidence is the range of reasonable inferences that can be drawn
from it. If there are reasonable inferences other than guilt, the Crown’s
evidence does not meet the proof beyond the reasonable doubt standard. A
certain gap in the evidence may result in inferences other than guilt. But
those inferences must be reasonable given the evidence and the absence of
evidence, assessed logically, and in light of human experience and common
sense. When assessing circumstantial evidence, the trier of fact should
consider other plausible theories and other reasonable possibilities which are
inconsistent with guilt. The Crown thus may need to negative these reasonable
possibilities, but certainly does not need to disprove every possible
conjecture which might be consistent with innocence. Other plausible theories
or other reasonable possibilities must be based on logic and experience applied
to the evidence or the absence of evidence, not on speculation. 

                    The
Court of Appeal found that the trial judge erred because he failed to consider
reasonable inferences inconsistent with guilt that could have arisen from a
lack of evidence. While there are certainly some problematic statements in the
trial judge’s reasons, when the reasons are read as a whole and these passages
are read in their proper context, he made no reversible error. The judge
correctly stated the law in relation to circumstantial evidence. Contrary to V,
the judge did not lose sight of proper process of inference-drawing, the
overall burden of proof, or the difference between the standard applied to a
committal for trial and the reasonable doubt standard applied to a finding of
guilt.

                    The
judge’s conclusions that a user of V’s computer knowingly downloaded
pornography and that V was knowingly in possession of
the child pornography that had been saved on his computer were reasonable. While there were gaps in the Crown evidence about V’s possession and
control of the computer, the Court of Appeal’s analysis of these gaps in effect
retried the case. It was for the trial judge to decide whether the evidence of
V’s possession and control, when considered in light of human experience and
the evidence as a whole and the absence of evidence, excluded all reasonable
inferences other than guilt. While not every trier of fact would inevitably
have reached the same conclusion as did the trial judge, that conclusion was a
reasonable one.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

                    Cromwell J. — 

I.             
Introduction 

[1]                             
The respondent, Mr. Oswald Villaroman, was
having problems with his laptop computer, so he left it with a repair shop. The
repair technician found child pornography on the laptop. He called the police,
whose search of the laptop confirmed the presence of child pornography. Mr.
Villaroman was charged with a number of pornography-related offences, including
possession of child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(4)  of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , the only charge relevant to this appeal.

[2]                             
At trial, Yamauchi J. found that the mainly
circumstantial evidence against the accused proved guilt on the charge of
possession of child pornography beyond a reasonable doubt: 2013 ABQB 279, 562
A.R. 105. The Court of Appeal, however, concluded that the judge had misstated
the current law respecting circumstantial evidence and that the verdict of
guilt based on that evidence was unreasonable: 2015 ABCA 104, 599 A.R. 294, at
paras. 20 and 38. The Court of Appeal therefore set aside the conviction and
entered an acquittal. The Crown appeals, submitting that the Court of Appeal
erred by requiring the Crown in effect to disprove all innocent possibilities
and, more specifically, by requiring the Crown to prove either that the accused
had downloaded the pornography or that he had exclusive access to the computer
where it was stored. The Crown maintains that the judge did not make any legal
error in his treatment of the circumstantial evidence and that the verdict of
guilt was reasonable. The respondent supports the decision and reasoning of the
Court of Appeal and points to a number of what he says are clear legal errors
in the trial judge’s analysis.

[3]                             
I would allow the appeal. As I see it, the trial
judge’s reasons, read as a whole, do not contain any legal errors and his finding
of guilt was reasonable.

II.          
Issues

[4]                             
The Court of Appeal found that the case law in
relation to circumstantial evidence “may not be readily consistent” and “seems
to have changed in very recent years”: paras. 8 and 20. This appeal is an
opportunity to provide any needed clarification. For the purposes of my
analysis, I have found it helpful to approach the case by answering two
questions:

1.              
Did the Court of Appeal err in finding a legal
error in the trial judge’s analysis in relation to the circumstantial evidence?

2.              
Was the guilty verdict unreasonable?

[5]                             
Some issues related to whether the police search
of the laptop violated s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  were
argued at trial and before the Court of Appeal.  The trial judge found
that the police search was lawful (2012 ABQB 630, 557 A.R. 1), while the Court
of Appeal declined to consider the search issues because its acquittal of Mr.
Villaroman made those issues academic: paras. 38-39. On appeal before this Court,
the parties agreed that if we accept the Crown’s position with respect to the
circumstantial evidence, the case should be remanded to the Court of Appeal to
deal with those issues.   I accept the parties’ position and would remand these
issues back to the Court of Appeal.

III.       
Overview of the Facts and Decisions

A.          
Background

[6]                             
Mr. Villaroman took his laptop computer to a
MyMacDealer shop for repairs to the power button and battery. (While it was not
conceded at trial that Mr. Villaroman was the person who delivered the
computer, it is for the purposes of this appeal.) He provided his name,
address, and telephone number to the repair shop. The technician, Alan Sopczak,
examined the computer, which was not password-protected, and identified the
necessary repairs.  He then telephoned Mr. Villaroman, who authorized the work.


[7]                             
After completing some repairs, Mr. Sopczak
checked some files randomly to test whether the computer’s software was
operating properly. While checking the music files, he discovered child pornography
files in the music folder of the iTunes library folder. He thought the number
of files ruled out a random occurrence and called the police, who seized the
computer. Days later, when Mr. Villaroman came to the shop to get the laptop,
Mr. Sopczak informed him that the police had seized it. 

[8]                             
Mr. LaFontaine, a forensic analyst, testified
that there was only one user account associated with the computer, named
“oswaldvillaroman”. The user account was set up on the computer on July 1, 2007
and there had been almost daily activity on it from that date until November
29, 2009, a couple of days before the computer was brought to the shop. 

[9]                             
Mr. LaFontaine’s evidence was that the
computer’s hard drive contained 36 child pornography files: one picture and 35
videos. Two of the file names appeared to be in an Asian language, but all of
the rest suggested or expressly described underage pornographic content.  The
files were downloaded using a peer-to-peer downloading software called
“Limewire”. Eighteen of the videos were partial or incomplete downloads located
in the Limewire “incomplete” folder. Seventeen were complete downloads that
were found, along with the one picture, in the computer’s music folder. The
user had viewed some videos from each folder using two different media-playing
programs. 

[10]                         
Mr. Villaroman admitted that the computer was
his and that the 36 files found on it constituted child pornography as defined
in the Criminal Code . The main factual issue at trial in relation to the
possession of child pornography charge was whether the evidence established
that Mr. Villaroman had been in possession of the child pornography. As the
trial judge noted, this required the Crown to prove that he knew the nature of
the material, had the intention to possess it, and had the necessary control
over it: para. 26, citing R. v.  Daniels, 2004 NCLA 73, 242 Nfld. & P.E.I.R.
290. 

B.           
Trial Findings

[11]                         
The trial judge noted that the Crown’s case
depended on the circumstantial evidence provided by the technician, Mr. Sopczak,
and the forensic analyst, Mr. LaFontaine. Asking himself whether the inferences
drawn from the evidence satisfied him beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.
Villaroman had committed the offence: para. 43, citing R. v. Lifchus, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320, the
trial judge concluded that they did. He found that Mr. Villaroman “knew the
nature of the material, had the intention to possess it, and had the necessary
control over it”: para. 68. 

C.           
Court of Appeal Decision

[12]                         
The Court of Appeal found that the trial judge
had “misstated the current law” on weighing circumstantial evidence and that
the verdict was unreasonable: para. 20. In the Court of Appeal’s opinion, there
was not sufficient evidence to raise a case for the defence to answer: para.
38.  The conviction was set aside and an acquittal entered. 

IV.       
Analysis

A.          
First Question: Did the Court of Appeal Err in
Finding a Legal Error in the Trial Judge’s Analysis in Relation to the
Circumstantial Evidence?

(1)          
The Alleged Errors

[13]                         
At the core of the errors identified by the
Court of Appeal, and elaborated upon by the respondent, is that the trial judge
erred in his treatment of circumstantial evidence, a subject that dates back at
least to Hodge’s Case (1838), 2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136.  That case
contains a jury instruction about how the jury should assess circumstantial
evidence of identity. The jury was told that in order to convict, they must be
satisfied not only that the circumstantial evidence was consistent with guilt
but rationally inconsistent with any other conclusion than guilt. The nub of
the issue in this case is whether the trial judge erred by requiring that “any
other conclusion than guilt” be based on the evidence. 

[14]                         
The Court of Appeal, as I read its reasons,
found that the trial judge erred by requiring that an inference or hypothesis
supporting a conclusion other than guilt be based on evidence rather than upon
a lack of evidence: para. 10.  The respondent (as he is entitled to do in
seeking to uphold the Court of Appeal’s order), relies on what he claims are
additional errors made at trial: that the trial judge relied on inapplicable
sources; erroneously analyzed the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt;
and wrongly reversed the burden of proof. But at the core of all of these
alleged errors is the point taken by the Court of Appeal: that the trial judge
was wrong to exclude from consideration innocent explanations which had no
foundation in the evidence. 

[15]                         
Before turning to a more detailed analysis, it
is important to remember that a trial judge’s reasons for judgment should not
be “read or analyzed as if they were an instruction to a jury”: R. v.
Morrissey (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514, at p. 525. Rather, the reasons must be
“read as a whole, in the context of the evidence, the issues and the arguments
at trial, together with ‘an appreciation of the purposes or functions for which
they are delivered’”: R. v. Laboucan, 2010 SCC 12, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 397,
at para. 16, citing R. v. R.E.M.; 2008 SCC 51, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3, at
para. 16; see also R. v. C.L.Y., 2008 SCC 2, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 5, at para.
11.

Did the Trial Judge Err by Requiring Innocent
Explanations to be Based on the Evidence?

[16]                         
The Court of Appeal’s concern with the trial
judgment arises from some ongoing difficulties caused by the old rule in Hodge’s
Case. While that case was not mentioned by name, the principle that it
enunciated cast a long shadow over the judgments at trial and on appeal. I will
turn first to some of the troublesome aspects of the jurisprudence flowing from
Hodge’s Case and then return to the errors of law the trial judge is
alleged to have committed.

(a)          
The Current Status of the “Rule” in Hodge’s Case

[17]                         
In Hodge’s Case, the evidence of
identification was made up entirely of circumstantial evidence: p. 1137.  Baron
Alderson, the trial judge, instructed the jury that in order to convict, they
must be satisfied “not only that those circumstances were consistent with [the
accused] having committed the act, but they must also be satisfied that the
facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than
that the [accused] was the guilty person”: p. 1137.  This sort of jury
instruction came to be required in circumstantial cases: see, e.g., McLean v.
The King, [1933] S.C.R. 688.

[18]                         
Over time, this requirement was relaxed: see,
e.g., R. v. Mitchell, [1964] S.C.R. 471; R. v. Cooper, [1978] 1
S.C.R. 860.  It is now settled that no particular form of instruction to the
jury is required where the evidence on one or more elements of the offence is
entirely or primarily circumstantial.  As Charron J. writing for a majority of
the Court put it in R. v. Griffin, 2009 SCC 28,
[2009] 2 S.C.R. 42, at para. 33:

We
have long departed from any legal requirement for a “special instruction” on
circumstantial evidence, even where the issue is one of identification: R. v. Cooper, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 860. The essential
component of an instruction on circumstantial evidence is to instill in the
jury that in order to convict, they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
that the only rational inference that can be drawn from the circumstantial
evidence is that the accused is guilty. Imparting the necessary message to
the jury may be achieved in different ways: R. v. Fleet
(1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 457 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 20. See also R. v. Guiboche, 2004 MBCA 16, 183 C.C.C. (3d) 361, at
paras. 108-10; R. v. Tombran
(2000), 142 C.C.C. (3d) 380 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 29.
[Emphasis added.]

 

[19]                         
There may be some tension between the first and
the second sentence of this passage from Griffin: see, e.g., L. Dufraimont,
“R. v. Griffin and the Legacy of Hodge’s Case” (2009), 67 C.R.
(6th) 74. While the first sentence states that there is no required special
instruction, the second sentence makes it an “essential component” of a jury
instruction to ensure that the jury understands that they must be persuaded
beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational inference is guilt. However, the
cases cited with approval by Charron J. in this passage and our subsequent
decision in R. v. Mayuran, 2012 SCC 31, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 162, at para. 38,
clear up any doubt about what was intended.

[20]                         
In the above passage, Charron J. cited with
approval R. v. Fleet (1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 457 (Ont. C.A.), at para.
20. It is worth quoting that paragraph at length as in my view it makes Charron
J.’s meaning clear:

. . . It will be recalled
that, in Cooper, Ritchie J. specifically rejected the necessity for any
formula of words to be used in a case of circumstantial evidence of identity.
In our view, he can hardly have intended to reject the mandatory recitation of
one formula only to substitute another in its place. We read the object of both
judgments in Cooper to be the eradication of any formulaic approach to
such cases so long as the jury is clearly made aware of the necessity to find
the guilt of the accused to be established beyond a reasonable doubt. This
object may be achieved in more ways than one. Thus, the trial judge, reviewing
the evidence and setting out the position of the defence and relating the
substantial parts of the evidence to that position, may frame the requisite
instruction in the manner he or she considers most appropriate in the
circumstances, for example, by:

 

(a)    charging the jury in accordance with the traditional language of
proof beyond a reasonable doubt (per Laskin C.J.C. in Cooper);

 

(b)   charging the jury in accordance with that language and pointing out
to the jury the other inferences that the defence says should be drawn from the
evidence and the necessity to acquit the accused if any of those inferences
raises a reasonable doubt (as the trial judge did in Cooper in the final
portion of his recharge); or

 

(c)    charging the jury that it must be satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt that the guilt of the accused is the only reasonable inference to be
drawn from the proven facts (per Ritchie J. in Cooper and Dubin
J.A. in Elmosri).

[21]                         
Charron J. also cited with approval R. v.
Tombran (2000), 142 C.C.C. (3d) 380 (Ont. C.A.), (a decision in which she
participated as a member of the Ontario Court of Appeal), at para. 29. Once
again, it is worth quoting that paragraph:

. . . The modern approach to the
problem of circumstantial evidence, enunciated clearly in Cooper, supra,
and reiterated and reinforced by Fleet, supra, is to reject a
formulaic approach and to deal with all the evidence in terms of the general
principles of reasonable doubt. Trial judges are given a degree of latitude to
formulate the appropriate instruction as befits the circumstances of the case.
Trial judges are not required to adopt any specific language or wording,
provided the charge conveys to the jury in a clear fashion the central point,
namely, the necessity to find the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable
doubt. In particular, trial judges are not required to deliver to the jury a
general, abstract lecture on the nature of circumstantial evidence or on the
steps of logic to be followed in assessing circumstantial as distinct from
direct evidence. An academic exercise along those lines may well confuse rather
than assist the jury. Trial judges are entitled to conclude that the essential
message of the need to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt can be better
conveyed in other ways.

[22]                         
These paragraphs, quoted with approval in Griffin,
are consistent with what Charron J. conveyed in her reasons. This reading of
the judgment is confirmed by our subsequent decision in Mayuran in which
the Court reiterated the statement from Griffin that “[w]e have long
departed from any legal requirement for a ‘special instruction’ on
circumstantial evidence”: per Abella J., writing for a unanimous Court, at
para. 38. There is therefore no particular form of mandatory instruction.
However, where proof of one or more elements of the offence depends solely or
largely on circumstantial evidence, it may be helpful for the jury to receive
instructions that will assist them to understand the nature of circumstantial
evidence and the relationship between proof by circumstantial evidence and the
requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt. I will touch briefly on both of
these aspects.

(i)                
An Explanation of the Difference Between Direct
and Circumstantial Evidence

[23]                         
An explanation of the difference between direct
and circumstantial evidence is included in most criminal jury charges and
rarely causes difficulty.  One example of how this distinction may be conveyed
to a jury is found in s. 10.2 of the Model Jury Instructions prepared by
the National Committee on Jury Instructions of the Canadian Judicial Council:

[1] As
I explained at the beginning of the trial, you may rely on direct evidence and
on circumstantial evidence in reaching your verdict. Let me remind you what
these terms mean.

[2] Usually, witnesses tell us what they personally
saw or heard. For example, a witness might say that he or she saw it raining
outside. That is called direct evidence.

[3] Sometimes, however, witnesses say things from
which you are asked to draw certain inferences. For example, a witness might
say that he or she had seen someone enter the courthouse lobby wearing a
raincoat and carrying an umbrella, both dripping wet. If you believed that
witness, you might infer that it was raining outside, even though the evidence
was indirect. Indirect evidence is sometimes called circumstantial evidence.

[24]                         
While there is no particular required form of
explanation, something along these lines will usually be helpful when one or
more elements of the Crown’s case depends solely or mainly on circumstantial
evidence.

(ii)           
The Relationship Between Circumstantial Evidence
and Proof Beyond Reasonable Doubt

[25]                         
The Court has generally described the rule in Hodge’s
Case as an elaboration of the reasonable doubt standard: Mitchell;
John v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R. 781, per Ritchie J., at pp. 791-92; Cooper;
Mezzo v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 802, at p. 843. If that is all that Hodge’s
Case was concerned with, then any special instruction relating to
circumstantial evidence could be seen as an unnecessary and potentially
confusing addition to the reasonable doubt instruction.

[26]                         
However, that is not all that Hodge’s Case
was concerned with. There is a special concern inherent in the inferential
reasoning from circumstantial evidence. The concern is that the jury may
unconsciously “fill in the blanks” or bridge gaps in the evidence to support
the inference that the Crown invites it to draw. Baron Alderson referred to
this risk in Hodge’s Case. He noted the jury may “look for — and often
slightly . . . distort the facts” to make them fit the inference that they are
invited to draw: p. 1137. Or, as his remarks are recorded in another report,
the danger is that the mind may “take a pleasure in adapting circumstances to
one another, and even straining them a little, if need be, to force them to
form parts of one connected whole”: W. Wills, Wills’ Principles of
Circumstantial Evidence (7th ed. 1937), at p. 45; cited by Laskin J. in John,
dissenting but not on this point, at p. 813.

[27]                         
While this 19th century language is not suitable
for a contemporary jury instruction, the basic concern that Baron Alderson
described — the danger of jumping to unwarranted conclusions in circumstantial
cases — remains real. When the concern about circumstantial evidence is
understood in this way, an instruction concerning the use of circumstantial
evidence and the reasonable doubt instruction have different, although related,
purposes: see B. L. Berger, “The Rule in Hodge’s Case: Rumours of its Death are
Greatly Exaggerated” (2005), 84 Can. Bar Rev. 47, at p. 60-61.  

[28]                         
The reasonable doubt instruction describes a
state of mind — the degree of persuasion that entitles and requires a juror to
find an accused guilty: Berger, at p. 60. Reasonable doubt is not an inference
or a finding of fact that needs support in the evidence presented at trial:
see, e.g. Schuldt v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 592, at pp. 600-610. A
reasonable doubt is a doubt based on “reason and common sense”; it is not
“imaginary or frivolous”; it “does not involve proof to an absolute certainty”;
and it is “logically connected to the evidence or absence of evidence”: Lifchus,
at para. 36. The reasonable doubt instructions are all directed to describing
for the jurors how sure they must be of guilt in order to convict.

[29]                         
An instruction about circumstantial evidence, in
contrast, alerts the jury to the dangers of the path of reasoning involved in
drawing inferences from circumstantial evidence: Berger, at p. 60.  This is the
danger to which Baron Alderson directed his comments. And the danger he
identified so long ago — the risk that the jury will “fill in the blanks” or
“jump to conclusions” — has more recently been confirmed by social science
research: see Berger, at pp. 52-53.  This Court on occasion has noted this
cautionary purpose of a circumstantial evidence instruction: see, e.g., Boucher
v. The Queen, [1955] S.C.R., 16 per Rand J., at p. 22; John, per
Laskin J., dissenting but not on this point, at p. 813. 

[30]                         
It follows that in a case in which proof of one
or more elements of the offence depends exclusively or largely on
circumstantial evidence, it will generally be helpful to the jury to be
cautioned about too readily drawing inferences of guilt.  No particular
language is required. Telling the jury that an inference of guilt drawn from
circumstantial evidence should be the only reasonable inference that such
evidence permits will often be a succinct and accurate way of helping the jury
to guard against the risk of “filling in the blanks” by too quickly overlooking
reasonable alternative inferences. It may be helpful to illustrate the concern
about jumping to conclusions with an example. If we look out the window and see
that the road is wet, we may jump to the conclusion that it has been raining.
But we may then notice that the sidewalks are dry or that there is a loud noise
coming from the distance that could be street-cleaning equipment, and
re-evaluate our premature conclusion. The observation that the road is wet, on
its own, does not exclude other reasonable explanations than that it has been
raining. The inferences that may be drawn from this observation must be
considered in light of all of the evidence and the absence of evidence,
assessed logically, and in light of human experience and common sense.

[31]                         
I emphasize, however, that assistance to the
jury about the risk of jumping to conclusions may be given in different ways
and, as noted in Fleet, trial judges will provide this assistance in the
manner they consider most appropriate in the circumstances: p. 549.

(iii)               
“Rational” v. “Reasonable” Inferences

[32]                         
I have suggested the use of the word
“reasonable” to describe the potential inferences rather than the word
“rational” used by Baron Alderson in Hodge’s Case and in many other
cases including Griffin.  Which of these words should be used was one of
the issues touched on by the Court of Appeal (at para. 9) and I should explain
why I think that the word “reasonable” is preferable. The
following comments also apply to the adjective “logique”, which has been
frequently used in the French version of this Court’s jurisprudence on this
issue.

[33]                         
The words “rational” and “reasonable” are
virtually synonyms: “rational” means “of or based on reasoning or reason”;
“reasonable” means “in accordance with reason”: Canadian Oxford Dictionary
(2nd ed. 2004). While some have argued that there is a significant difference,
I do not find that position convincing: see, e.g., E. Scott, “Hodge’s Case: A
Reconsideration” (1965-66), 8 C.L.Q. 17, at p. 25; A. M. Gans, “Hodge’s
Case Revisited” (1972-73), 15 C.L.Q. 127, at p. 132. It seems that our
jurisprudence has used the words “rational” and “reasonable” interchangeably
with respect to inferences: see McLean; Fraser v. The King,
[1936] S.C.R. 1, at p. 2;  Boucher, at pp. 18, 22 and 29; John,
at p. 792; Cooper, at p. 881; Lizotte v. The King, [1951]
S.C.R. 115, at p. 132; Mitchell, at p. 478; Griffin, at para.
33.  This, in addition to the dictionary definitions, suggests that there is no
difference in substance between them. 

[34]                         
There is an advantage of using the word
“reasonable”. It avoids the risk of confusion that might arise from using the
word “reasonable” in relation to “reasonable doubt” but referring to “rational”
inferences or explanations when speaking about circumstantial evidence: see John,
per Laskin J., dissenting but not on this point, at p. 815.  In saying this, I
do not suggest that using the traditional term “rational” is an error: the
Court has said repeatedly and recently that the necessary message may be
imparted in different ways: see, e.g., Griffin, at para. 33.

(iv)       
Whether the Inference Must Be Based on “Proven
Facts”

[35]                         
At one time, it was said that in circumstantial
cases, “conclusions alternative to the guilt of the accused must be rational
conclusions based on inferences drawn from proven facts” see R. v. McIver,
[1965] 2 O.R. 475, at p. 479 (C.A.), aff’d without discussion of this point
[1966] S.C.R. 254. However, that view is no longer accepted. In assessing
circumstantial evidence, inferences consistent with innocence do not have to
arise from proven facts: R. v. Khela, 2009 SCC 4, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 104,
at para. 58; see also R. v. Defaveri, 2014 BCCA 370, 361 B.C.A.C. 301,
at para. 10; R. v. Bui, 2014 ONCA 614, 14 C.R. (7th) 149, at para. 28. 
Requiring proven facts to support explanations other than guilt wrongly puts an
obligation on an accused to prove facts and is contrary to the rule that
whether there is a reasonable doubt is assessed by considering all of the
evidence. The issue with respect to circumstantial evidence is the range of
reasonable inferences that can be drawn from it. If there are reasonable
inferences other than guilt, the Crown’s evidence does not meet the standard of
proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

[36]                         
I agree with the respondent’s position that a
reasonable doubt, or theory alternative to guilt, is not rendered “speculative”
by the mere fact that it arises from a lack of evidence.  As stated by this
Court in Lifchus, a reasonable doubt “is a doubt based on reason
and common sense which must be logically based upon the evidence or lack of
evidence”: para. 30 (emphasis added).  A certain gap in the evidence may
result in inferences other than guilt. But those inferences must be reasonable
given the evidence and the absence of evidence, assessed logically, and in
light of human experience and common sense.

[37]                         
When assessing circumstantial evidence, the
trier of fact should consider “other plausible theor[ies]” and “other
reasonable possibilities” which are inconsistent with guilt:  R. v. Comba,
[1938] O.R. 200 (C.A.), at pp. 205 and 211, per Middleton J.A., aff’d [1938]
S.C.R. 396; R. v. Baigent, 2013 BCCA 28, 335 B.C.A.C. 11, at para. 20; R.
v. Mitchell, [2008] QCA 394 (AustLII), at para. 35. I agree with the
appellant that the Crown thus may need to negative these reasonable
possibilities, but certainly does not need to “negative every possible
conjecture, no matter how irrational or fanciful, which might be consistent
with the innocence of the accused”: R. v. Bagshaw, [1972] S.C.R. 2, at
p. 8. “Other plausible theories” or “other reasonable possibilities” must be
based on logic and experience applied to the evidence or the absence of
evidence, not on speculation.  

[38]                         
Of course, the line between a “plausible theory”
and “speculation” is not always easy to draw. But the basic question is whether
the circumstantial evidence, viewed logically and in light of human experience,
is reasonably capable of supporting an inference other than that the accused is
guilty. 

[39]                         
I have found two particularly useful statements
of this principle. 

[40]                         
The first is from an old Australian case, Martin
v. Osborne, 55 C.L.R. 367, at p. 375:

In the inculpation of an accused person
the evidentiary circumstances must bear no other reasonable explanation.
This means that, according to the common course of human affairs, the degree
of probability that the occurrence of the facts proved would be accompanied by
the occurrence of the fact to be proved is so high that the contrary cannot
reasonably be supposed. [Emphasis added.]

[41]                         
While this language is not appropriate for a
jury instruction, I find the idea expressed in this passage — that to justify a
conviction, the circumstantial evidence, assessed in light of human experience,
should be such that it excludes any other reasonable alternative — a helpful
way of describing the line between plausible theories and speculation.

[42]                         
The second is from R. v. Dipnarine, 2014
ABCA 328, 584 A.R. 138, at paras. 22 and 24-25. The court stated that “[c]ircumstantial
evidence does not have to totally exclude other conceivable inferences;” that
the trier of fact should not act on alternative interpretations of the
circumstances that it considers to be unreasonable; and that alternative
inferences must be reasonable, not just possible.  

[43]                         
Where the line is to be drawn between
speculation and reasonable inferences in a particular case cannot be described
with greater clarity than it is in these passages.

(b)          
Did the Trial Judge Err?

[44]                         
I return to the question of whether the Court of
Appeal was wrong to find a legal error in relation to circumstantial evidence
in the trial judge’s reasons.

[45]                         
The Court of Appeal found that the trial judge
erred because he failed to consider reasonable inferences inconsistent with
guilt that could have arisen from a lack of evidence.  The court found
that, by failing to give the accused the benefit of “gaps” in the evidence, the
trial judge had, in effect, put a burden on the accused to prove something:
paras. 19-20. The respondent supports that conclusion and makes two additional
points. He submits that the trial judge erred in relying on McIver which
wrongly required inferences alternative to guilt to be supported by the
evidence and that the trial judge relied on inapplicable sources — certiorari
applications to quash committals to stand trial, where the beyond a
reasonable doubt standard does not apply.  In doing so, it is submitted, the
judge failed to appreciate the burden of proof on the Crown and the difference
between the standard applied when deciding to commit someone to stand trial at
a preliminary inquiry and the reasonable doubt standard applied at trial.  

[46]                         
I respectfully disagree with the Court of
Appeal’s conclusion and I cannot accept the respondent’s submissions.

[47]                         
There are certainly at first glance some
problematic statements in the trial judge’s reasons.  He mentions that
“inferences are drawn from the evidence that the Crown presents to [the court]”:
para. 45; that speculation is “forming a theory or conjecture without
factual basis”: para. 46; and that “it is evidence that ‘bridges’
the inferential gap”: para. 49.   He cites a number of cases which state that
inferences must be drawn from facts or evidence: paras. 45-49. He cites McIver,
which states that conclusions alternative to guilt must be founded on proven
facts: para. 49. And he wrote that the “Court has no evidence before it
that would support these hypothetical scenarios [of innocence]”: para. 81
(emphases added above).  

[48]                         
However, when the trial judge’s reasons are read
as a whole and these passages are read in their proper context, I am not
persuaded that he made any reversible error.  

[49]                         
For example, most of the references to the
effect that inferences must arise from evidence concern the Crown’s burden
to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Of course, there is no error in this
regard as the Crown cannot rely on a gap in the evidence to prove an element of
the offence. 

[50]                         
When dealing with the defence position, the
judge correctly stated the law, in my opinion.  The judge properly noted that
“the accused cannot ask this Court to rely on supposition or conjecture, that
flows from a purely hypothetical narrative to conclude that the Crown has not
proven he is guilty of the offences with which the Crown has charged him”:
para. 47.  The judge’s citation of McIver was intended to make the same
point, i.e. that a reasonable doubt cannot arise from speculation or
conjecture. This is perfectly correct. As the Court said in Lifchus, “a
reasonable doubt must not be imaginary or frivolous”; need not be proof to an
absolute certainty; and must be based on “reason and common sense”: paras. 31
and 36. The burden on the Crown does not extend to “negativing every
conjecture”:  R. v. Paul, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 181, at p. 191. 

[51]                         
The respondent submits that the judge erred by
relying on a number of cases dealing with committals for trial at a preliminary
inquiry, a context in which the reasonable doubt standard does not apply.
However, the judge referred to these authorities in relation to his assessment
of the range of available and reasonable inferences. He did not, as the
respondent claims, fail to recognize and apply the beyond reasonable doubt
standard of proof. The trial judge stated the proper standard in his reasons,
and there is nothing in his reasons to show that he departed from this
standard:

The
Crown’s counsel and the accused spent a great deal of time arguing about the
inferences that this Court may or may not draw from the evidence that Mr.
Sopczak and Mr. LaFontaine provided. Essentially, the arguments may be boiled
down to the simple question of whether the totality of the evidence that the
Crown has presented to this Court supports an inference that the accused
committed the offences with which the Crown has charged him.  Of course, the
inferences that this Court draws from the evidence must satisfy it beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offences with which the Crown
has charged him . . . . [Emphasis added; para. 43.]

 

[52]                         
Finally, the respondent submits that, by
misapprehending the law in relation to innocent inferences and in applying the
law relating to committals to trials, the trial judge improperly reversed the
burden of proof and applied the wrong standard of proof.  For the reasons I
have just given, the trial judge did not apply the wrong law in these areas,
and properly put the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt solely on the
Crown.

[53]                         
A fair reading of the judge’s reasons as a whole
does not support the respondent’s position that the judge somehow lost sight of
proper process of inference-drawing, the overall burden of proof, or the
difference between a committal for trial and a finding of guilt. The judge did
not err in this regard.

[54]                         
I conclude that the judge did not make any legal
error in relation to his assessment of the circumstantial evidence.

B.           
Second Question: Was the Verdict of Guilt Reasonable?

(1)          
Legal Principles

[55]                         
A verdict is reasonable if it is one that a
properly instructed jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered: R.
v. Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381. Applying this standard requires
the appellate court to re-examine and to some extent reweigh and consider the
effect of the evidence: R. v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168, at p. 186.
This limited weighing of the evidence on appeal must be done in light of the
standard of proof in a criminal case. Where the Crown’s case depends on
circumstantial evidence, the question becomes whether the trier of fact, acting
judicially, could reasonably be satisfied that the accused’s guilt was the only
reasonable conclusion available on the totality of the evidence:  Yebes,
at p. 186; R. v. Mars (2006), 205 C.C.C. (3d) 376 (Ont. C.A.), at para.
4; R. v. Liu (1989) 95 A.R. 201 (C.A.), at para. 13; R. v. S.L.R.,
2003 ABCA 148 (CanLII); R. v. Cardinal (1990), 106 A.R. 91 (C.A.); R.
v. Kaysaywaysemat (1992), 97 Sask. R. 66 (C.A.), at paras. 28 and 31. 

[56]                         
The governing principle was nicely summarized by
the Alberta Court of Appeal in Dipnarine, at para. 22. The
court noted that “[c]ircumstantial evidence does not have to totally exclude
other conceivable inferences” and that a verdict is not unreasonable simply
because “the alternatives do not raise a doubt” in the jury’s mind.  Most
importantly, “[i]t is still fundamentally for the trier of fact to decide if
any proposed alternative way of looking at the case is reasonable enough to
raise a doubt.”  

(2)          
Analysis

[57]                         
In order to establish possession of child
pornography, the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent
was aware that he had physical custody of the pornography and that he was aware
of what it was: see, e.g., R. v. Morelli, 2010 SCC 8, [2010] 1 S.C.R.
253, at paras. 16 and 136. There can be no serious question about the fact that
the respondent had physical possession of the material in the sense discussed
by the majority of the Court in Morelli: it had been downloaded on to
his computer and he had physical possession of the computer. The real question
is whether it was reasonable for the judge to find that the respondent knew
that he had physical possession of the pornography that was in fact in his
computer’s memory.

[58]                         
I have found it helpful to consider this issue
in two steps. At the first, the question is whether a user of the respondent’s
computer knowingly downloaded pornography. The judge found that a user of this
computer had done so and, in my view, that conclusion was reasonable: para. 67.

[59]                         
The evidence was that Limewire, a file-sharing
software, was installed on the computer on the same day that the only user
account (named “oswaldvillaroman”) was created. Limewire, the evidence
disclosed, does not download files or other material without the user taking
some action to download the file or material. The user must enter keywords and
double click on the desired search result.  The evidence further showed that a
user of this computer had changed the default saved folder so that completed
files would be saved in the computer’s iTunes music folder.  A user of the
computer had viewed some of the videos from both the Limewire “incomplete”
folder and iTunes music folder through two different media-playing programs.
These viewed files were not automatically opened by either of these
media-playing programs. The evidence was also to the effect that the titles of
downloaded files were “explicit, disturbing, and would logically indicate that
the associated files are child pornography: para. 62.” All of this evidence
tended to show that the offending material would not be downloaded and viewed
without the user’s consent or knowledge, and that the nature of the material
would be obvious to the user.  

[60]                         
These facts were recited in the trial judge’s
reasons, and his conclusion at para. 67 that the “oswaldvillaroman” user
account downloaded the child pornography onto the computer using the Limewire
program was reasonable.

[61]                         
The second step is to ask whether it was
reasonable to conclude that the respondent was knowingly in possession of the
child pornography that had been saved on his computer.  

[62]                         
The trial judge found that the respondent was the
user who had downloaded the material, but I agree with the Crown that this
finding was not essential to proof of the respondent’s knowledge. The judge
also found — and this is the critical finding — that the respondent was aware
of the pornography on his computer: para. 85.  The trial judge considered and
rejected the respondent’s submission that the evidence was not sufficient to
establish the respondent’s knowledge of the nature of the material on his
computer. Noting that the Crown does not have to negative every conjecture, he
found that the evidence as a whole persuaded him beyond a reasonable doubt that
the respondent “was aware that the child pornography resided on the Computer”:
para. 85. 

[63]                         
Contrary to the respondent’s submission, the
trial judge did not merely consider the fact that the accused owned the
computer in coming to this conclusion.  He relied on the evidence of Mr. LaFontaine
and Mr. Sopczak, and referred to the following pieces of evidence before the
court in particular, at paras. 82 and 83:

(a)    two people with whom the accused lives did not download child
pornography to the Computer;

 

(b)   the child pornography was in the iTunes music folder, which is
accessible to the Computer’s user;

 

(c)    the Computer belongs to the accused;

 

(d)   the Computer was used “almost daily” from July 1, 2007, to November
29, 2009;

 

(e)    the user name that was established on the same day that Limewire was
installed is “oswaldvillaroman”;

 

(f)    the Computer was left at the MyMac on December 2, 2009, and the
accused’s name and home address are shown on the Service Repair Order;

 

(g)   the specific problems that the Computer was suffering are listed
under “Problem Description” on the Service Repair Order and specifically refers
to the fact that the “client reports” the problems; and

 

(h)   the clock on the computer was accurate which meant that some of the
pornography had been on the computer for about three months before Mr.
Villaroman took the computer in for repairs.

[64]                         
Was the conclusion that the respondent knew this
material was on his computer reasonable? In my view, it was.

[65]                         
As noted, Mr. Villaroman admitted that the
laptop was his. He had possession and control of it for the purposes of having
it repaired. He delivered it to the shop, paid for the repairs, tried to pick
it up, stated that he was the person who could authorize the work and
authorized the required repairs. The only user account on the computer,
“oswaldvillaroman”, was created using his name. The Limewire software was
installed on the computer the same day. There had been almost daily use of the
computer since. Some of the pornography had been stored on the computer for
about three months before Mr. Villaroman took it in for repairs.  As discussed
earlier, the nature of the material would be obvious to a user of the computer
who saw the file names. Mr. Villaroman admitted that he resided at the same
address as Benigno and Maxima Villaroman, and that neither of them had put the
child pornography on the computer. There was no evidence that anyone else lived
there or that anyone else had the opportunity to download pornography onto the
computer.  While the accused need not lead evidence to show that another person
had such access to his laptop, based on the evidence and lack of evidence
before the Court, it is speculative to consider whether another person had such
an opportunity, let alone to assume that Mr. Villaroman would be ignorant of
the presence of the material on his computer.  

[66]                         
The judge did not ignore hypothetical
alternative explanations advanced by the respondent’s counsel. He found that
they were speculative, noting that the Crown does not have the burden “of negativing
every conjecture to which circumstantial evidence might give rise and which
might be consistent with the innocence of the accused”: para. 81; citing Paul,
at p. 191.

[67]                         
The Court of Appeal, in my respectful view,
erred by focusing on hypothetical alternative theories and, at times, engaging
in speculation rather than on the question of whether the inferences drawn by
the trial judge, having regard to the standard of proof, were reasonably open
to him. 

[68]                         
It is true, as the Court of Appeal noted, that
there was no evidence about where the computer was kept or used and that anyone
who had temporary physical access to the laptop computer could work the laptop,
and could access or transmit the child pornography on it: paras. 25-26. The
Court of Appeal found that the pornography was not “accompanied by any email or
similar communication”, nor was there any evidence about whether an ordinary
user of the computer would notice the child pornography in the music folder:
paras. 34-35. It further found that the pornography was not downloaded very
frequently, at an average of a little over one file per month, which does not
“make actions by another user impossible, nor even highly unlikely”: para. 32. 
I note that this last point is not only speculative, but inaccurate.  The
evidence shows that the pornography was downloaded over a three month period.

[69]                         
These were gaps in the Crown evidence about Mr.
Villaroman’s possession and control of the computer that the trial judge had to
take into account in weighing the evidence. However, the Court of Appeal, in
its analysis of these gaps, in effect retried the case. It was for the trial
judge to decide, as he did, whether the evidence of Mr. Villaroman’s powers of
control and direction over the computer; the coincidence of his name and the
only user name on the computer; the file names descriptive of their
pornographic contents; the admission in relation to the non-involvement of two
other people with whom he lived; and the length of time the pornography had
been on the computer, when considered in light of human experience and the
evidence as a whole and the absence of evidence, excluded all reasonable
inferences other than guilt. In my view, while not every trier of fact would
inevitably have reached the same conclusion as did the trial judge, that
conclusion was a reasonable one.

[70]                         
At certain points in its analysis, the Court of
Appeal crossed the line from considering the effects of gaps in the Crown
evidence to raising purely speculative possibilities. For example, the Court of
Appeal considered questions such as whether the “laptop . . . [went] to work”
or “during the day to a school, college or university” or “may have sat much of
each day in a location or locations frequented by many friends, coworkers, or
fellow student: paras. 28 and 31.” These particular factual scenarios are
purely speculative and postulating them goes beyond the bounds of properly
considering the impact of the gaps in the Crown evidence about the physical
location of the laptop. 

[71]                         
The Court of Appeal’s analysis overlooks the
important point made in Dipnarine that it is fundamentally for the trier
of fact to draw the line in each case that separates reasonable doubt from
speculation. The trier of fact’s assessment can be set aside only where it is
unreasonable. While the Crown’s case was not overwhelming, my view is that it
was reasonable for the judge to conclude that the evidence as a whole excluded
all reasonable alternatives to guilt.

[72]                         
In my view, the judge’s finding that this
evidence proved that Mr. Villaroman had possession of the child pornography
found on his computer was not unreasonable.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

                    Criminal
law — Charge to jury — Evidence — Admissibility — Limiting instructions — Characterization
of witness’s testimony — Accused convicted of manslaughter — Accused’s
appearance changing between time of offence and time of trial — Whether
photographs of accused taken days after offence admissible — Whether trial
judge’s instructions to jury on use it could make of photographs of accused
insufficient — Whether trial judge erred in jury instructions by referring to
witness’s account of conversation with accused as confession.

                    A
was convicted of manslaughter for his alleged involvement in a shooting that took
place in a Toronto park. The victim and some friends were socializing in the
park when a group of men entered the park and attempted to rob some of them. The
victim was shot and killed while chasing after the assailants who fled the
scene. Eyewitnesses only provided general descriptions of the assailants — young,
black, thin and clean-shaven — and described the shooter as being between 5’4”
and 5’8”. A, who was 6’1” at the time, was not identified as being among the
assailants. He was arrested five days after the shooting, when a teacher of his
notified the police that A had approached him and confessed to being present at
the shooting but not to having fired the gun. 

                    Because
A’s appearance had changed between the time of the shooting and his trial, the
Crown sought to have admitted two photographs of him taken five days after the
shooting in order to establish what he looked like at the time. The defence
objected, arguing that the photographs were highly prejudicial. The trial judge
admitted the photographs for the purpose of allowing the jury to consider
whether A had any of the physical attributes described by the eyewitnesses,
subject to a limiting instruction that warned the jury that it could not
conclude that A was among the assailants solely because his appearance fit
within the general description provided by the eyewitnesses. In his
instructions to the jury, the trial judge also summarized the Crown’s position
that the conversation which took place between A and his teacher should be
viewed as a confession of guilt. A appealed his conviction and sentence. A
majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and remitted the matter for
a new trial.

                    Held:
The appeal should be allowed, A’s conviction for manslaughter restored, and the
matter remanded to the Court of Appeal for consideration of the sentencing
appeal.

                    There
is no reason to disturb the trial judge’s finding that the photographs were admissible.
Whether A could have been among the assailants was a critical issue in this
case, because he denied being in the park the night of the shooting. Moreover,
A did not concede that his appearance fit within the general eyewitness
descriptions. Accordingly, the photographs were relevant to the limited
question of whether A’s appearance at the time of the shooting fit within the
general descriptions provided by witnesses. Regarding the potential prejudicial
effect of the photographs, there are particular dangers involved in showing
eyewitnesses a single photograph to determine if the individual shown is the
individual they saw, because the witness’s memory may be tainted by exposure to
that photograph. However, this concern is not relevant where it is the jury who
has been exposed to the photograph of a single person and asked to consider
whether the person shown falls within a general description. The jury has no
pre-existing memory of the person’s appearance to corrupt, nor is the concern
about the over-persuasiveness of tainted witness testimony relevant in this
context. In light of the deference afforded to trial judges on questions of
balancing probative effect against prejudice, there is no reason to disturb the
trial judge’s finding that the risk associated with the photographs could be
appropriately mitigated by a limiting instruction, and thus that the probative
value of the photographs outweighed their prejudicial effect. 

                    The
trial judge’s limiting instruction with respect to the use it could make of the
photographs was adequate. Parsing the language in one particular sentence to
determine whether it was sufficient to warn of an impermissible line of
reasoning, without taking into consideration the greater context of the jury
instructions and the trial itself, represents the kind of dissection and minute
scrutiny this Court has warned against. In this case, there does not appear to
be a considerable risk that the jury would have, as a consequence of minor
imperfections with the jury instructions, abandoned their common sense and
adopted clearly flawed reasoning. Moreover, the risk of a juror actually using
the photographs as the basis for an impermissible line of reasoning in the
context of this case was appropriately minimized both by the fact that Crown
counsel did not urge the jury to adopt impermissible lines of inference and by
the trial judge’s charge to the jury as a whole.

                    The
trial judge’s use of the word “confession” in his jury instructions does not
constitute a toxic instruction such that a new trial should be ordered. Indeed,
the trial judge did not himself label A’s statements to his teacher as
confessions. Rather, he repeatedly described the school exchange as a conversation.
Moreover, the trial judge only referred to the exchanges as a confession when
reiterating the Crown’s position, which was that the school conversation should
be viewed as a confession of guilt. When viewed in light of the trial judge’s
other cautions to the jury, including the caution that the teacher’s testimony
be evaluated only for its evidence of what A said, rather than the teacher’s
interpretation of his statements, as well as the caution that confession to
mere presence at the scene was not sufficient to establish guilt, a single use
of the word “confession” in describing the Crown’s submissions would not have
been so toxic as to call for a correcting instruction. The trial judge fairly
described the conversation between A and his teacher and it was properly for
the jury to conclude whether the conversation amounted to a confession. 

                    Since
the jury instructions were adequate, it is not necessary to consider whether
the facts of this case would warrant the application of the curative proviso
provided in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .

                    The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

[1]                             
Rothstein J. — Nahoor Araya was tried by a judge and jury
for second degree murder and convicted of the included offence of manslaughter
for his alleged involvement in a shooting that took place in a Toronto park on
October 3, 2008. The Ontario Court of Appeal (Strathy J.A. (as he then was),
dissenting) overturned that conviction and ordered a new trial, finding that
the jury instructions given at trial were insufficient to warn the jury against
making improper inferences with regard to certain photographs of Mr. Araya
taken a few days after the shooting and admitted at trial. The Crown appeals
this decision and asks that the manslaughter conviction be restored. In the
alternative, the Crown argues that the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in
failing to apply the curative proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .

[2]                             
In supporting the decision of the majority of
the Court of Appeal, Mr. Araya proffered two additional arguments: first, that
the photographs had no probative value whatsoever and were thus inadmissible,
and second, that the jury instructions were also flawed with respect to the
testimony of Cordel Browne, Mr. Araya’s high school English teacher, with whom
Mr. Araya spoke after the shooting.

[3]                             
On the issue of the jury instructions regarding
the photographs, I agree with Strathy J.A. that the trial judge’s instructions
were adequate. While not perfectly phrased, the totality of the instructions,
viewed in the context of the case as a whole, adequately guarded against the
possibility that the jurors might use the photographs as the basis for
impermissible reasoning.

[4]                             
On the issue of admissibility, I do not agree
with Mr. Araya’s contention that the photographs had no probative value.
Identity was a key issue in this case. Mr. Araya’s appearance had changed from
the time of the shooting to the time of his trial. The defence never conceded
that Mr. Araya fell within the admittedly broad descriptions of the assailants
given by eyewitnesses to the events in the park. Thus, the burden remained on
the Crown to establish identity, and the trial judge found that the photographs
were probative in showing that Mr. Araya fit within the class of individuals
described by the eyewitnesses. I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial
judge’s decision on admissibility should not be disturbed.

[5]                             
Finally, on the issue of Mr. Browne’s testimony,
I do not agree with Mr. Araya’s contention that the trial judge erred in
instructing the jury with regard to the proper uses or characterization of Mr.
Browne’s testimony. The trial judge fairly described the conversation between
Mr. Araya and Mr. Browne in the jury charge, and it was properly for the jury
to conclude whether this conversation amounted to a confession. 

[6]                             
I would allow the appeal and remand the matter
to the Court of Appeal for consideration of the sentencing issue. It is thus
unnecessary to consider the issue of the curative proviso.

I.             
Factual Background

[7]                             
On the evening of October 3, 2008, 17-year-old
Boris Cikovic and a group of friends were drinking and socializing in and
around the tennis courts in Buttonwood Park in west Toronto. According to
witnesses, a second group of around three or four men entered the park at about
10:30 p.m., got into a confrontation with some of the individuals in Mr.
Cikovic’s group, and attempted to rob some of them. Mr. Cikovic resisted and
used a taser against one of the assailants. The assailants then fled the scene
and Mr. Cikovic chased after them, at which point one of the assailants turned
and shot Mr. Cikovic, killing him. 

[8]                             
The lighting near the tennis courts was dim, and
eyewitnesses were only able to provide broad, general descriptions of the
unknown men: young, black, thin, and clean-shaven. Some witnesses recalled some
of the men wearing bandanas over their faces. The shooter was described as
being between 5’4” and 5’8”. Mr. Araya was 6’1” at the time. None of the
witnesses specifically identified Mr. Araya as being among the assailants.

[9]                             
On October 7, four days after the shooting, Mr.
Araya approached Mr. Browne, his English teacher, and asked to speak to him in
private. There was disagreement at trial over the nature of the conversation.
Mr. Araya testified at trial that while he did have a conversation with Mr.
Browne, he did not mention being in Buttonwood Park or having any involvement
with the shooting. Instead, he testified that he made up a fabricated story
about a confrontation at a different location, in the hopes that Mr. Browne
would worry about Mr. Araya’s well-being and offer him a place to stay that
night. According to Mr. Browne, Mr. Araya said that he had been with the group
of people who robbed and shot Mr. Cikovic at Buttonwood Park on October 3, but
that he had not fired the gun and wanted Mr. Browne’s advice on what to do. Mr.
Browne told Mr. Araya that he should inform the authorities, and subsequently
notified the police of his conversation with Mr. Araya. Mr. Araya was arrested
on October 8. Mr. Browne also gave the police a statement on October 8 about
his conversation with Mr. Araya at school the previous day.

II.          
Procedural History

A.          
Trial Proceedings

[10]                         
Mr. Araya was tried before a jury in 2011 on the
basis that he was among the assailants on the night of the shooting, and was
thus liable for second degree murder pursuant to s. 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code . The Crown did not allege that Mr. Araya was the shooter. Eyewitnesses
to the event testified to their recollections about the description of the
assailants. As noted above, these descriptions were limited to vague, general
characteristics – young, black, thin, and clean-shaven. 

[11]                         
Mr. Araya testified that he was not in
Buttonwood Park on the night of October 3, 2008, but was instead at a friend’s
house several kilometres away from the park. He admitted to having a
conversation with Mr. Browne at school on October 7, but disputed the nature of
that conversation. His position was that he made up a story related to a
different robbery to get Mr. Browne’s attention and concern, but that even in
this fabricated story, he did not admit to having been at Buttonwood Park on
the night of October 3. 

[12]                         
Mr. Araya pointed to a number of discrepancies
that had arisen between Mr. Browne’s statement to police the day after the
school conversation and his testimony at trial. Specifically, while Mr. Browne
testified that Mr. Araya had admitted to being in the group of assailants at
the park on October 3, Mr. Araya said that discrepancies in this testimony,
such as whether he had told Mr. Browne “I was involved” or “I wasn’t involved”,
and “we rolled up” or “they rolled up”, undermined the value of Mr. Browne’s inculpatory
testimony (Mr. Browne testified that he understood “roll up” in this context to
mean to rob the individuals in the tennis court). 

[13]                         
The question of whether Mr. Araya was in
Buttonwood Park was thus central to the case against Mr. Araya. He disputed
that he was among those at the park, and never conceded that his appearance on
October 3, 2008 fit within the general description provided by the
eyewitnesses. 

[14]                         
Mr. Araya’s appearance had changed between the
events in 2008 and his trial: by 2011, he had gained weight, had shorter hair,
was clean-shaven, and wore glasses. The Crown sought to admit two photographs
of Mr. Araya taken five days after the shooting in order to establish what he
looked like at the time. The defence objected to the admission of the
photographs, arguing at trial that they were highly prejudicial. The concern
was that the jury might hear the vague eyewitness descriptions of the
assailants, note that the photographs of Mr. Araya showed that he fit those
descriptions, and impermissibly conclude that Mr. Araya must have been one of
the assailants as a result. The trial judge, McMahon J., admitted the
photographs for the limited purpose of allowing the jury to consider whether
Mr. Araya had any of the physical attributes described by the eyewitnesses,
subject to a limiting instruction that warned against improperly concluding
that Mr. Araya was among the assailants based solely on his appearance fitting
within the general eyewitness descriptions.

[15]                         
Before the jury retired to consider their
verdict, the trial judge issued lengthy jury instructions that addressed, inter
alia, the photographs at issue and Mr. Browne’s testimony.

[16]                         
Mr. Araya was convicted of manslaughter and
sentenced to eight years in prison, less credit for the time he had spent in
pre-trial custody. 

B.           
Ontario Court of Appeal, 2013 ONCA 734, 312
O.A.C. 284

[17]                         
Mr. Araya appealed his conviction and sentence
to the Ontario Court of Appeal, where he argued that the trial judge erred in
admitting the photographs and, in the alternative, that if the photographs were
properly admitted, the limiting instructions to the jury were insufficient to
protect against prejudice.

(1)        
The Majority (per Gillese J.A., Laskin J.A.
Concurring)

[18]                         
The majority found no error in the trial judge’s
finding that the photographs were relevant and had some probative value (para.
31), but agreed with Mr. Araya that this probative value was minimal in light of
the fact that the defence did not challenge the allegation that Mr. Araya’s
appearance in 2008 fit within the general description provided by eyewitnesses
(para. 32).

[19]                         
The majority then found that the use of the
photographs could have had a significant prejudicial effect by leading jurors
to engage in a flawed and impermissible line of reasoning in the following
manner: “The photos of the appellant at the time of the shooting reveal a
young, thin, relatively clean-shaven black male. Thus, at the time of the
shooting, the appellant fit the eyewitness generic descriptions of the robbers
in the tennis courts. Therefore, the appellant was in the park and/or one of
the robbers” (para. 33).

[20]                         
Given the potential prejudice that would arise
if a juror were to engage in such reasoning, the majority found that clear jury
instructions were required, and that the instructions had to meet two
requirements. First, they had to indicate the permissible use that could have
been made of the photos, and second, they had to explain the dangers of
impermissible lines of reasoning (para. 42). The majority found that the first
of these requirements was met (para. 45), but found the instructions
insufficient with regard to the second requirement because they did not
“clearly explain to the jury the chain of impermissible reasoning” (para. 47).
The majority also took issue with the specific wording of the trial judge’s
limiting instruction, finding it “confusing” (para. 46). 

[21]                         
In light of the insufficiency of the limiting
instruction, the majority found that there was a “risk of a serious miscarriage
of justice” (para. 50), and allowed the appeal on this ground. The majority
thus did not find it necessary to address Mr. Araya’s other asserted grounds
for appeal, including the trial judge’s treatment of Mr. Browne’s testimony.

[22]                         
The majority allowed the appeal and remitted the
matter for a new trial.

(2)        
Strathy J.A., Dissenting

[23]                         
Strathy J.A. dissented. He agreed with the
majority that the photographs were probative. He stated that in the absence of
an admission from Mr. Araya that he fit within the general eyewitness
descriptions in 2008, his appearance “remained a live issue” (para. 154). He
reviewed the trial judge’s jury charge and found it adequate to guard against
the risk of a miscarriage of justice. Specifically, he found that the risk of
prejudice needed to be evaluated “having regard to all the evidence before the
jury, the arguments of counsel, and the trial judge’s charge, taken as a whole”
(para. 157, citing R. v. Hay, 2013 SCC 61, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 694, at para.
47).

[24]                         
Looking at the trial proceedings as a whole,
Strathy J.A. found that the impugned photographs played a minor role in the
Crown’s case. They were also referred to by the defence as serving to exclude
Mr. Araya from the general eyewitness descriptions, because some of the
witnesses had described the assailants as clean-shaven, while Mr. Araya had
facial hair at the time (para. 158). He also noted that the defence did not
object to the jury instruction on this issue (para. 171). He found that the
majority’s view that there was significant risk that jurors would make
impermissible use of the photos “gives no credit to the jury’s common sense and
no weight to the trial judge’s instruction that it was precisely what they
should not do” (paras. 178-79).

[25]                         
Strathy J.A. also considered several other
arguments raised by Mr. Araya at the Court of Appeal. Most relevant to the
arguments before this Court, he considered whether the trial judge erred in his
instructions pertaining to Mr. Browne’s testimony. Strathy J.A. summarized both
Mr. Browne’s version and Mr. Araya’s version of the conversation they had at
school on October 7, 2008 (paras. 93-109), as well as their respective versions
of a subsequent conversation at the Metro West Detention Centre on October 23,
2008 (paras. 116-22). He acknowledged that there were apparent discrepancies
between Mr. Browne’s police statement and his testimony at trial (para. 104),
but that the trial judge “thoroughly reviewed the evidence of both the appellant
and Browne concerning their two conversations” (para. 246), that the jury
instructions explained how the jury should consider the differences between Mr.
Browne’s police statement and his testimony at trial (para. 247), and that the
jury was told to consider Mr. Browne’s testimony as to what Mr. Araya said, not
what Mr. Browne interpreted those statements to mean (para. 249). 

[26]                         
Strathy J.A. concluded that the apparent
discrepancies between Mr. Browne’s police statement and trial testimony about
the school conversation and between Mr. Browne’s and Mr. Araya’s
characterization of the detention centre conversation arose because of
ambiguous language (paras. 253-54). Thus, “it was for the jury to consider the
explanation of the alleged inconsistency and to determine what to make of the
evidence” (para. 255). The trial judge’s explanation of the jury’s duties and
his caution that Mr. Browne’s testimony be considered only for Mr. Araya’s
words, rather than Mr. Browne’s interpretation of them, were sufficient to render
the jury instructions adequate (para. 255).

[27]                         
Strathy J.A. would have dismissed the appeal
from conviction.

III.       
Issues

[28]                         
The Crown raises the following issues on appeal:

(1)        Whether the trial judge’s jury instructions regarding the
permissible and impermissible uses of the two photographs of Mr. Araya were
insufficient; and

(2)        Whether the majority at the Court of Appeal erred in
failing to apply the curative proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code .

[29]                         
Mr. Araya seeks to uphold the decision of the majority
of the Court of Appeal and raises the following additional issues:

(3)        Whether the photographs were inadmissible because they
lacked any probative value whatsoever; and

(4)        Whether the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the
jury that Mr. Browne’s account of the October 7, 2008 conversation with Mr.
Araya could not be relied upon as a confession of his involvement in the
robbery. This issue was raised by Mr. Araya before the Court of Appeal but not
addressed by the majority.

IV.       
Analysis

[30]                         
Under s. 686(1)(a) of the Criminal
Code , a court of appeal may allow an appeal against a conviction where the
verdict is unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence, where there has been a
wrong decision on a question of law, or where a miscarriage of justice has
occurred. Mr. Araya asserts that the trial judge’s decision to admit the
photographs, his instructions to the jury regarding the permissible use of the
photographs, and his instructions regarding the use of Mr. Browne’s testimony
each amounted to a miscarriage of justice. Based on the grounds raised, I am of
the opinion that these arguments are properly understood as assertions that the
trial judge engaged in misdirection or non-direction of the jury amounting to
errors of law.

A.          
Admissibility of Photographs

[31]                         
It is a basic principle of the law of evidence
that the probative value of a particular piece of evidence depends on the
context in which it is proffered. In assessing whether evidence was admissible
at trial, the trial judge’s weighing of probative value and prejudicial effect
is entitled to significant deference. Though this deference is not unlimited,
“the trial judge’s advantage of being able to assess on the spot the dynamics
of the trial and the likely impact of the evidence on the jurors” provides good
reason to defer to his or her weighing of the probative value against any
prejudicial effect that might arise as a result of admission: R. v. Shearing,
2002 SCC 58, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 33, at para. 73.

[32]                         
Under s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code , an
accused may be found culpable of an offence if that person shares a common
intent to commit an unlawful act with one or more other people, and one of
those other people commits an offence that the defendant knew or ought to have
known was a probable consequence of the plan.[1]
In this case, Mr. Araya was convicted of manslaughter under this party
liability provision; while the Crown did not assert that Mr. Araya was the
shooter, it did argue that Mr. Araya was among the group of assailants, and
that the shooting was a probable consequence of their plan to accost Mr.
Cikovic’s group in the park. Accordingly, the Crown needed to establish that
Mr. Araya was in Buttonwood Park at the time of the shooting, as well as the
extent of his involvement in the assailants’ common intent to commit robbery
and that he knew or should have known that the shooting was a probable
consequence of that plan.

[33]                         
Whether Mr. Araya could have been among the
assailants was a critical issue in this case, because he denied being in
Buttonwood Park the night of the shooting. The Crown sought to admit the
post-arrest photographs of Mr. Araya as bearing on the question of identity,
and defence counsel objected on the ground that the photographs were highly
prejudicial. The trial judge, in ruling on the admissibility of the
photographs, remarked that the jury was presented with testimony from multiple
witnesses that established a set of vague physical attributes possessed by the
assailants. He then noted that the jury had been able to observe Mr. Araya’s
appearance at trial over several weeks, and that this appearance differed
considerably from Mr. Araya’s appearance in 2008. He found that the photos were
circumstantially relevant to the limited question of whether Mr. Araya’s
appearance in 2008 fit within the general descriptions provided by witnesses.

[34]                         
Mr. Araya contends that the photos were not
relevant to a live issue at trial, and thus were improperly admitted, because
it was “apparent” that he did not dispute that his appearance had changed
significantly between 2008 and 2011. However, even if this Court were to accept
this implied concession, the issue of whether his appearance had changed is a
distinct matter from the issue of whether his appearance in 2008 fit within the
eyewitness descriptions. Here, Mr. Araya did not concede that his appearance
fit within the general eyewitness descriptions. Accordingly, I see no reason to
challenge the trial judge’s finding that the photographs were relevant for this
particular purpose.

[35]                         
Mr. Araya relies on R. v. Proctor (1992),
69 C.C.C. (3d) 436 (Man. C.A.), for the proposition that the Crown may not
adduce prejudicial evidence that bears on matters that are not in dispute. This
reliance is misplaced. Proctor concerned the Crown’s refusal to accept a
“crystal clear” defence admission as to identity in order to artificially
preserve an issue at trial such that highly inflammatory evidence could be
adduced with reference to that issue: pp. 440 and 447. Here, there was no clear
admission that Mr. Araya’s appearance fit within the eyewitness descriptions,
nor did the Crown reject an admission in an attempt to adduce inflammatory
evidence; the trial judge in this case remarked that the photographs were
relatively innocuous in and of themselves, and did not feature the defendant in
an overtly prejudicial light. In addition, at the time the Crown sought to
admit the photographs, it could not have known what would or would not be said
with regard to Mr. Araya’s appearance and the general eyewitness descriptions
when the defence’s evidence was adduced or in defence counsel’s closing
address. Thus, Proctor does not bear on the circumstances at issue in
this case.

[36]                         
Mr. Araya also asserts that, because it would
have been impermissible to show the photographs of a single individual to the
eyewitnesses and ask them if the person shown was the person they observed, it
was impermissible to show the photographs to the jury in this case. I agree
that there are particular dangers involved in showing eyewitnesses a single
photograph to determine if the individual shown is the individual they saw. In
such a case, there is a distinct possibility that “the person who has seen the
photograph will have stamped upon his memory the face he has seen in the
photograph, rather than the face he saw on the occasion of the crime”: R. v.
Goldhar (1941), 76 C.C.C. 270 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 271. But this danger
relates to the fact that the witness’s memory, which may be given
considerable persuasive weight by the jury if found to be credible and
reliable, may be tainted by exposure to a single photograph: Goldhar, at
p. 271; R. v. Smierciak, [1947] 2 D.L.R. 156 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 157-58.
This concern is not relevant where it is the jury who has been exposed to
photographs of a single person and asked to consider whether the person shown
falls within a general description. The jury has no pre-existing memory of the
person’s appearance to corrupt, nor is the concern about the
over-persuasiveness of tainted witness testimony relevant in this context.

[37]                         
Regarding the weighing of probative value and
prejudicial effect, the trial judge was satisfied that “there is probative
value to the jury knowing in an identification case what the accused looked
like at the time of the event”. He also acknowledged Mr. Araya’s argument that
the photos may have a prejudicial effect: 

Since none of the eyewitnesses can
identify the accused, the jury, armed with the photos, could improperly use the
photos to conclude that the accused may have been there because he may have fit
a general description of some eyewitnesses who could only provide vague
descriptions. It is submitted by the defence that this is the risk of prejudice
to the accused. [A.R., vol. VII, at p. 88]

He found that this
prejudicial effect could be appropriately mitigated by a limiting instruction,
and thus concluded that “the probative value of these photographs outweigh[s]
the prejudicial effect”. 

[38]                         
In light of the deference afforded to trial
judges on questions of balancing probative effect against prejudice, I agree
with the Court of Appeal that there is no reason to disturb the finding of the
trial judge that the photos were admissible.

B.           
Adequacy of Limiting Instruction

[39]                         
When considering an alleged error in a trial
judge’s jury instructions, “[a]n appellate court must examine the alleged error
in the context of the entire charge and of the trial as a whole”: R. v. Jaw,
2009 SCC 42, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 26, at para. 32, per LeBel J. Further, trial
judges are to be afforded some flexibility in crafting the language of jury
instructions: see Hay, at para. 48, citing R. v. Avetysan, 2000
SCC 56, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 745, at para. 9. While trial judges must seek to ensure
that their instructions adequately prepare the jury for deliberation, the
standard for jury instructions is not perfection. Appellate review of jury
instructions is meant to “ensure that juries are properly — not perfectly —
instructed”: R. v. Jacquard, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at para. 62, per Lamer
C.J. This Court has emphasized that the charge generally should not be
“endlessly dissected and subjected to minute scrutiny and criticism”: R. v.
Cooper, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 146, at p. 163. As Bastarache J. has summarized it
in R. v. Daley, 2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, at para. 30:

The cardinal rule is that it is the
general sense which the words used must have conveyed, in all probability, to
the mind of the jury that matters, and not whether a particular formula was
recited by the judge. The particular words used, or the sequence followed, is a
matter within the discretion of the trial judge and will depend on the
particular circumstances of the case. 

Appellate courts should
not examine minute details of a jury instruction in isolation. “It is the
overall effect of the charge that matters”: Daley, at para. 31.

[40]                         
I begin with an examination of the jury
instructions. Justice McMahon’s comprehensive jury charge was delivered over a
total of approximately four hours, and discussed a considerable number of
factual and legal issues relevant to the jury’s deliberations, including the
issue of the eyewitness descriptions and their relationship to the photographs.
Because of the importance of taking a functional and contextual approach to
reviewing jury instructions on appeal, the relevant portions of the charge that
address the question of whether Mr. Araya was in Buttonwood Park are reproduced
here. Regarding the eyewitness accounts, the trial judge instructed:

Now, members of the jury,
along with all the evidence I have already reviewed on this issue about whether
or not he was in the park that night, you should also consider how the people
that were in the tennis court that night described the black males that came
in. I want to remind you that none of the young people in the park can identify
Mr. Araya as being there. Many of the people in the tennis court told you
because of how dark it was, how the black males were dressed and how quickly
events took place, they could not tell you what any of the males’ faces looked
like.

 

Some of them were, however,
able to provide vague descriptions of clothing, height and skin colour. Some
were able to provide descriptions of hair style, and my recollection is none of
the people described the males as having facial hair. I also believe none of
the witnesses say they saw any of the males, when I say the males, the black
males that came in, as having a bag or knapsack when they arrived. As you
heard, these descriptions were very vague. [A.R., vol. I, at p. 94]

[41]                         
The trial judge then instructed the jury with
regard to the permissible and impermissible uses that could be made of the
photographs:

Now, you have photographs of
what Mr. Araya looked like five days after the shooting. I believe his evidence
and Ms. Cooke’s [sic] was that is what he looked like about that time of
October 3. You can consider whether he fits or does not fit the vague
descriptions provided by the various witnesses. You cannot, of course, however,
conclude based only on the vague descriptions of what Mr. Araya looked like in
the photographs, that he must be the person. That would be completely improper
since the descriptions are so vague and people can’t identify anyone. If there
are features described which are dissimilar to the accused, they may be used to
demonstrate that the accused was not present.

 

You will recall that none of
the witnesses described seeing facial hair. Now, you will have a picture of Mr.
Araya taken five days later which witnesses say reflect[s] how he looked on
October 3. It would appear he has some facial hair on his chin. Obviously he
does not have a bushy beard. It is what it is in the picture. It will be for
you to decide whether that is something that the witnesses would have noticed
considering the opportunity to observe, the condition of the witnesses and the
lighting conditions. [A.R., vol. I, at pp. 94-95] 

[42]                         
Finally, the trial judge instructed the jury on
how the eyewitness and photographic evidence bearing on Mr. Araya’s presence or
absence in the park related to broader issues of culpability:

If you believe and accept the
witnesses that the males were all clean shaven, then Mr. Araya could not have
been one of the males. Later in my review of the witnesses, I will go over each
witness’ evidence and their brief description.

 

You can, however, consider
how the accused looked and the vague descriptions of the males as but one piece
of circumstantial evidence, whether the accused’s physical appearance fit or
did not fit the vague descriptions. You would consider this along with the
totality of the evidence to determine whether the Crown has satisfied you
beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Araya was one of the black males who
attended the tennis court.

 

After you consider all that
evidence, if on the totality of the evidence you are not satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that Mr. Araya was in Buttonwood Park that night, the night
that Mr. Boris Cikovic was shot, then you will find the accused not guilty and
your deliberations would be over, and you won’t go through any further steps on
the decision tree.

 

If on the totality of the
evidence you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Araya was in that
park that night, then you must go on to determine if he committed any criminal
offence. As I mentioned earlier, simply being present at the scene of a crime
is not enough to find a person guilty of an offence. So assuming you are
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in the park, you would
go to the next step. [A.R., vol. I, at pp. 95-97]

[43]                         
In finding the jury instructions to be
insufficiently clear, the majority at the Court of Appeal placed significant
emphasis on the following sentence from para. 41 above: “You cannot, of course,
however, conclude based only on the vague descriptions of what Mr. Araya looked
like in the photographs, that he must be the person.” The majority found this
sentence confusing for two reasons. First, the phrase “vague descriptions of
what Mr. Araya looked like in the photographs” appears incongruous. The vague
descriptions were of the assailants the eyewitnesses saw in the park, and not
the photographs of Mr. Araya. Second, the majority found the use of the phrase
“he must be the person” unclear, because it did not specify whether the jury
was barred from inferring that he was only in the park or inferring that he was
one of the robbers (para. 46).

[44]                         
With respect, these concerns are overstated when
viewed in the context of the broader instructions. Regarding the apparent
ambiguity about the phrase “vague descriptions of what Mr. Araya looked like in
the photographs”, this phrasing appears to be a minor misstatement. A clarified
articulation in the judge’s oral charge would have stated that the jurors could
not draw conclusions about identity based only on the general descriptions and
what Mr. Araya looked like in the photographs. Indeed, the written charge to
the jury stated exactly this in instructing that the jury could not “conclude
based only on the vague descriptions and what Mr. Araya looked like in
the photographs, that he must be the person” (emphasis added). I would not go
so far as to suggest that all flaws in oral jury instructions may be remedied
by corrected written instructions alone, as some jurors may place significant
weight on what they hear in the courtroom. But where the criticism of oral jury
instructions rests on the possibility that the jurors may have been confused,
including unambiguous language in the written instructions helps ensure that
jurors who found themselves confused would have had access to that clarified
language for reference.

[45]                         
Further, in the context of the oral jury charge
itself, the trial judge adopted a clear phrasing moments later when he instructed
the jury that “[y]ou can, however, consider how the accused looked and
the vague descriptions of the males as but one piece of circumstantial
evidence, whether the accused’s physical appearance fit or did not fit the
vague descriptions” (emphasis added). This statement further clarifies the
logical relationship between the photos and the vague descriptions.

[46]                         
Regarding the second issue, that the jury may
have been confused by the phrase “he must be the person”, the majority at the
Court of Appeal was concerned that this phrasing did not make it clear exactly
which inferences would be improper to draw based only on the eyewitness
descriptions and the photos. Specifically, given the general nature of the
evidence, it would have been impermissible to infer from the eyewitness
descriptions and the photos alone whether Mr. Araya was in the park or part of
the group of assailants. However, two paragraphs later in the trial judge’s
instructions, he notes that “[i]f you believe and accept the witnesses that the
males were all clean shaven, then Mr. Araya could not have been one of the
males.” Not only does this latter statement emphasize the exculpatory features
of the photographs in a way that would seem to help minimize the danger that
they would be highly prejudicial to Mr. Araya, it further emphasizes that the
inferences relevant to the photographs are those that would place Mr. Araya
with the assailants in the park. 

[47]                         
From the entirety of the jury instructions and
the context of the trial, it is clear that “the males” refers to the group of
male assailants in Buttonwood Park. While I do not dispute that the phrase “he
must be the person” could have been made more explicit, it seems reasonably
clear in the context of this case that inferring that Mr. Araya was “the
person” meant inferring that he was in Buttonwood Park and among the
assailants. Having regard to the context of the jury instructions, I am not
persuaded that the jury would have been confused by the phrase “he must be the
person”.

[48]                         
Before this Court, counsel for Mr. Araya argued
that the trial judge erred further in instructing the jury with regard to the
extent of Mr. Araya’s facial hair at the time of the shooting, and whether the
witnesses would have observed it. The trial judge instructed that “[i]t will be
for you to decide whether [Mr. Araya’s facial hair, as shown in the post-arrest
photographs,] is something that the witnesses would have noticed considering
the opportunity to observe, the condition of the witnesses and the lighting
conditions.”

[49]                         
It was asserted by Mr. Araya’s counsel that this
instruction is problematic because it amounts to an assumption that Mr. Araya
was in the park. I cannot agree. Taken in context, it cannot fairly be said to
expressly or impliedly assume that he was in the park. The very next sentence
in the jury charge instructs the jury that if they believe the witnesses that
all of the assailants were clean-shaven, Mr. Araya could not have been among
them. Thus, the possibility that Mr. Araya may not have been in the park or
among the assailants was expressly acknowledged. Reading these two statements
together, I do not find that there was a significant risk that the jury may
have been improperly swayed by the instruction regarding whether the witnesses
would have been able to observe Mr. Araya’s facial hair. It remained
sufficiently clear that the question of whether Mr. Araya was in the park or
among the assailants was one for the jury to decide. 

[50]                         
It is worth noting that neither counsel invited
the jury to follow the impermissible line of reasoning or use the photographs
in the problematic manner suggested by the majority of the Court of Appeal.
That is not to say that a flawed instruction could not by itself give rise to a
miscarriage of justice, but it is a relevant consideration in evaluating the
context of the jury instructions.

[51]                         
It is also relevant that Mr. Araya’s trial
counsel (not counsel on appeal) — the person in the courtroom most attuned to
Mr. Araya’s interests — did not object to the allegedly confusing and insufficient
instruction at trial. This failure to object suggests that the phrasing of this
instruction, heard in its full context in the courtroom, did not sound likely
to confuse or to invite improper reasoning. This Court has stated that while
defence counsel’s failure to object to jury instructions is not determinative
on appeal, it nonetheless “says something about both the overall accuracy of
the jury instructions and the seriousness of the alleged misdirection”: Jacquard,
at para. 38.

[52]                         
Parsing the language in one particular sentence
to determine whether it was sufficient to warn of an impermissible line of
reasoning, without taking into consideration the greater context of the jury
instructions and the trial itself, represents the kind of dissection and minute
scrutiny this Court warned against in Cooper. While the instruction
regarding impermissible use was not perfect, I would emphasize Dickson C.J.’s
comments in R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, at p. 692, that “it
would be quite wrong to make too much of the risk that the jury might
use the evidence for an improper purpose. This line of thinking could seriously
undermine the entire jury system” (emphasis in original). In this case, there
does not appear to be a considerable risk that the jury would have, as a
consequence of minor imperfections with the jury instructions, abandoned their
common sense and adopted the clearly flawed reasoning that because Mr. Araya’s
appearance fit within a broad description that could have encompassed a great
many individuals, he must have been in Buttonwood Park.

[53]                         
Finally, in assessing the overall adequacy of
the jury instructions, the majority of the Court of Appeal emphasized that
“this was not a strong Crown case” (para. 49). Before this Court, Mr. Araya’s
counsel further urged that the adequacy of the jury instructions should be
evaluated in light of the strength of the Crown’s case. I agree with the Crown
that the strength of its case was not a proper consideration in evaluating the
adequacy of the jury instructions. As this Court observed in R. v. Hibbert,
2002 SCC 39, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 445, at para. 43, per Arbour J., the proper order
of inquiry in evaluating jury instructions requires judges first to look to the
adequacy of the instructions. Only then, if they are found inadequate, must the
nature and effect of the error in the instructions be determined with reference
to the strength of the Crown case, in the context of the curative proviso
framework of s. 686(1)(b)(iii). 

[54]                         
In my opinion, the foregoing establishes that
the risk of a juror actually using the photographs as the basis for an
impermissible line of reasoning in the context of this case was appropriately
minimized both by the fact that Crown counsel did not urge the jury to adopt
impermissible lines of inference and by the trial judge’s charge to the jury.
Accordingly, I am satisfied that the limiting instruction, taken in context,
was adequate.

C.           
Characterization of the Testimony of Mr. Browne

[55]                         
Mr. Araya emphasizes certain inconsistencies
between Mr. Browne’s testimony and police statement about the school
conversation on October 7, 2008 and argues that, in light of these
inconsistencies, it was an error for the trial judge to refer to that conversation
as a “confession” in the jury instructions. Three questions are relevant in
addressing this argument: first, what was the nature of the alleged
inconsistencies between Mr. Browne’s police statement and his testimony at
trial? Second, did the trial judge err in his consideration of those
inconsistencies? Third, did the trial judge err in labeling the school
conversation a “confession” in the jury instructions?

(1)        
Inconsistencies Between Mr. Browne’s Police
Statement and His Trial Testimony

[56]                         
Mr. Araya points to several phrases that he
argues establish significant inconsistencies between Mr. Browne’s police
statement and his testimony at trial. Further, he says that Mr. Browne’s
testimony contained his interpretation of Mr. Araya’s words, rather than the exact
words used by Mr. Araya during the school conversation (R.F., at para. 53), and
that the manner in which the testimony was framed for the jury in the jury
instructions constituted a miscarriage of justice. (As indicated earlier, I am
of the opinion that this is better characterized as an allegation that the
trial judge erred in law.) I will first consider each of the alleged
inconsistencies. I will then consider whether the jury instructions respecting
those alleged inconsistencies were adequate given the potentially inconsistent
nature of Mr. Browne’s statements. However, in considering each alleged
inconsistency, it is important to observe that the analysis of any particular
phrase, removed from the context of the trial record and jury instructions, should
not be given undue weight in evaluating the adequacy of the jury charge as a
whole. Rather, analysis of these phrases informs the broader contextual inquiry
into whether the jury was adequately instructed on how, as a matter of law,
they could consider Mr. Browne’s statements. 

[57]                         
First, Mr. Browne indicated in his police
statement that Mr. Araya told him “[t]hey rolled up on these guys” in
the park, while at trial he testified that Mr. Araya said “[w]e rolled
up on these guys” (R.F., at para. 55 (emphasis in factum)). Mr. Araya asserts
that the first phrasing indicates that he was not participating in the robbery
that led to the shooting, while the second phrasing suggests he was an active
participant (R.F., at para. 55). He argues that the two statements are
fundamentally inconsistent, and that the critical implication that he was a
participant in the robbery arose out of Mr. Browne’s interpretation of Mr.
Araya’s comments, and not from Mr. Araya’s actual words during the school
conversation. Put briefly, Mr. Araya argues that Mr. Browne’s police statement
should be taken as accurate and exculpatory, while his statements at trial
should be viewed as an impermissible interpretive spin on Mr. Araya’s actual
words.

[58]                         
Examining these two phrases in greater context,
I am not persuaded that they are irreconcilable. During his police statement,
Mr. Browne occasionally spoke in sentence fragments and mixed his recollections
of Mr. Araya’s actual words with his own summaries of Mr. Araya’s words and
with recollections of his own words. Regarding the issue of who rolled up on
Mr. Cikovic’s group in the park, Mr. Browne described this portion of the
conversation to the police as follows: “And [Mr. Araya] went on to explain
basically that he said, no, he didn’t want to be involved in it but they rolled
up on the guys anyway.” By contrast, Mr. Browne’s testimony at trial was that
“the summary would be I was there, I was involved. We rolled up on some guys. I
didn’t have the gun, things went down, someone got hit, but I wasn’t the one
carrying the gun.”

[59]                         
In my view, Mr. Browne’s police statement that
“they rolled up on the guys” could have been a direct recollection of Mr.
Araya’s specific use of the word “they” — doing so could have been Mr. Araya’s
way of distancing himself from the assailants by removing himself from the
group. Alternately, this phrase could have been Mr. Browne speaking about Mr.
Araya and the rest of the group of assailants rolling up on Mr. Cikovic’s group
together after Mr. Araya’s initial protest. It does not seem unreasonable that
the jury could have interpreted Mr. Browne’s use of “they” in this latter
sense. Nor do these statements necessarily establish that Mr. Browne was
spinning Mr. Araya’s words during his testimony at trial to make them seem more
inculpatory than the statements he initially reported to police.

[60]                         
Second, Mr. Araya emphasizes that at trial, Mr.
Browne described his recollection of Mr. Araya’s statement as follows: “Well,
you know, someone got shot but I -- I didn’t do it. I was there, I was
involved, but I didn’t do it. I didn’t have the gun” (emphasis added). By
contrast, during his police statement, Mr. Browne described Mr. Araya’s
statement as follows: 

. . . I said what about [the
shooting in Buttonwood Park] and he’s like well I was there but I wasn’t
involved and I said what do you mean Nahoor? And he’s like, I was there but
I wasn’t involved, I didn’t have the gun and he went on to explain
basically that um he had said no he didn’t want to be involved in it but they
rolled up on the guys anyway. [Emphasis added; A.R., vol. VII, at pp. 138-39.]

Mr. Araya asserts that
Mr. Browne’s initial statement to the police (“I was there but I wasn’t
involved”) was his recollection of what Mr. Araya said to him, while what Mr.
Browne said at trial (“I was there, I was involved, but I didn’t do it”) was
his interpretation of Mr. Araya’s statements (see R.F., at para. 53).

[61]                         
Mr. Browne gave additional testimony that
creates some ambiguity about whether Mr. Araya actually admitted to
“involvement” in the robbery, despite his protestations that the group should
not go through with it. Mr. Browne testified that he understood Mr. Araya’s
statement that he was present in the park as implying involvement in the
robbery: “. . . him being there, I’m interpreting it as he’s
involved” (emphasis added). However, when asked by defence counsel immediately
after that statement whether “it’s only your interpretation that he was
involved in rolling up”, Mr. Browne clarified: “No, he said that he was there
and that they decided to roll up on this guy. He was one of the guys saying no.
Something went down, someone was hit, and now he’s seeking my advice as to what
he should do about his involvement in this matter.” While Mr. Browne expressly
denied that his testimony contained any interpretive spin, it appears that his
testimony contained both efforts to recall Mr. Araya’s actual words as well as
statements that could be read as Mr. Browne’s interpretation of the meaning of
those words. Even if this statement to the police were to be considered
inconsistent, however, it must nonetheless be considered in the context of the
rest of Mr. Browne’s testimony and the trial judge’s instructions to the jury
in this regard.

[62]                         
Third, regarding Mr. Browne’s own statements to
Mr. Araya during the school conversation, Mr. Araya argues that there is an
important difference between Mr. Browne’s testimony that he told him to “inform
the authorities” and his testimony that he told him to “turn [your]self in”
(R.F., at para. 55). Mr. Araya argues that the phrase “inform the authorities”
is more appropriately said to a witness, rather than a participant in a crime,
and that this inconsistency, combined with the other alleged inconsistencies in
Mr. Browne’s testimony, made it wrong for the trial judge to use the word
“confession” in the jury instructions (R.F., at para. 57). I am not persuaded
by Mr. Araya’s argument that the use of the phrase “inform the authorities”
should be given significant weight on appeal in determining whether the trial judge
acted improperly in using the word “confession” as he did in the jury
instructions. Examining Mr. Browne’s testimony regarding the school
conversation as a whole, his memory of his words to Mr. Araya was imperfect,
but he recalls telling him to inform the authorities with the understanding
that this phrase meant to turn himself in. 

[63]                         
The context of Mr. Browne’s testimony thus
indicates some uncertainty about the exact words he and Mr. Araya used in their
conversation at school, as well as his explanation for that uncertainty, which
the jury was entitled to consider. Further, the trial judge did take note of
inconsistencies in Mr. Browne’s testimony in his jury instructions, framing
them as follows:

Cordel Browne told you in
examination-in-chief that Mr. Araya told him he was there and involved in the
robbery but not the shooting. In cross-examination he was asked about the video
statement he gave to the police the day after that conversation. He admitted
telling the police that Mr. Araya said he was not involved. He also admitted
that what he told the police was the truth. He also provided an explanation for
the difference between what he said here and what he said in his earlier
statement. Since it would appear Mr. Browne adopted his prior statement, you may
consider that as part of his evidence. You must also consider his explanation
for the differences. [A.R., vol. I, at p. 38]

[64]                         
Given the possible interpretations of Mr.
Browne’s police statement and testimony, and of his testimony regarding the
meaning of the inconsistencies, I do not find that the trial judge’s
instruction regarding how the jury was to consider Mr. Browne’s evidence
amounted to misdirection. Where there were possible inconsistencies between Mr.
Browne’s police statement and trial testimony, the jury was properly instructed
to evaluate these differences. 

[65]                         
Even if one were to find some amount of
interpretive spin in Mr. Browne’s testimony about Mr. Araya’s statements on
October 7, 2008, as, for example, where he discusses the meaning of the word
“involved”, the trial judge’s jury instructions also expressly warned the jury
about the dangers of such testimony. The jury was instructed that it was “what
Mr. Browne was told that is relevant, not what Mr. Browne thinks Mr. Araya
meant by what he said”. Accordingly, I am not persuaded that the trial judge
misdirected the jury in relation to Mr. Browne’s evidence.

(2)        
Characterizing the School Conversation as a
“Confession”

[66]                         
Mr. Araya argues that the inconsistencies in Mr.
Browne’s testimony and the exculpatory nature of Mr. Araya’s statements as
initially recounted by Mr. Browne during his police statement make it
impermissibly prejudicial to describe the school conversation as a
“confession”. In this regard, Mr. Araya takes issue with the following jury instruction:

It is submitted that on October 7,
2008, Mr. Araya confessed to being one of the group of males who “rolled up” to
rob Mr. Cikovic and his friends in Buttonwood Park on the evening of October 3,
2008. It is submitted he told his teacher, Mr. Browne, that he did not have the
gun, he did not fire the shot, but that he was part of the group that “rolled
up.” It is the Crown’s position that in this context, Mr. Araya was using the
term “roll up” to mean they were going to commit a robbery. [A.R., vol. I, at
p. 159]

[67]                         
According to counsel for Mr. Araya, the use of
the word “confession” in this context was a “toxic instruction” that should
give rise to a new trial under the reasoning of R. v. Samuels (2005),
196 C.C.C. (3d) 403 (Ont. C.A.) (R.F., at para. 58). I do not agree. This case
is not like Samuels; in that case, the defendant’s statements were
largely exculpatory, but the trial judge himself instructed the jury that “the
statements of the accused Samuels contain both admissions or confessions as well
as excuses which tend to exonerate him”: para. 27. The trial judge went on to
suggest that greater weight should be placed on the defendant’s inculpatory
statements than his exculpatory ones. Armstrong J.A. held that the instruction
in that case was “seriously flawed. The statements of the appellant are largely
exculpatory and support his defence of accident. It is therefore wrong and
prejudicial to describe the statements as containing ‘admissions’ or
‘confessions’”: Samuels, at para. 28. Samuels thus found it
prejudicial for the trial judge, in the context of that case, to label
certain statements of the defendant as “confessions”.

[68]                         
By contrast, the trial judge in this case did
not himself label Mr. Araya’s statements as confessions. Indeed, he repeatedly
described the school exchange as a “conversation”, rather than a confession,
elsewhere in the charge. In the portion of the jury instructions emphasized by
Mr. Araya, the trial judge remarked that “[i]t is submitted that . . .
Mr. Araya confessed” (emphasis added). This statement amounts to a reiteration
of the Crown’s position, which was that the school conversation should be
viewed as a confession of guilt. When viewed in light of the trial judge’s
other cautions to the jury, including the caution that Mr. Browne’s testimony
should be evaluated only for its evidence of what Mr. Araya said, rather than
Mr. Browne’s interpretation of his statements, as well as the caution that
confession to mere presence at the scene was not sufficient to establish guilt,
I do not find that the single use of the word “confession” in describing the
Crown’s submissions would have been so “toxic” an instruction as to call for a
correcting instruction.

D.          
Grounds of Appeal Before the Ontario Court of
Appeal

[69]                         
Before the Court of Appeal, Mr. Araya asserted
that the trial judge had made seven errors. The majority of the Court of Appeal
found that the alleged flaws in the jury instructions pertaining to the
permissible use of the photographs were sufficient to allow the appeal, and thus
did not address the remaining alleged errors. Two of the seven errors
originally asserted — the admissibility of the photographs and the associated
jury instructions, and the trial judge’s treatment of Mr. Browne’s testimony —
were argued before this Court. The other five grounds that Mr. Araya asserted
before the Court of Appeal were that the trial judge erred in: 

(b) failing to caution the
jury concerning how to use disbelief of the appellant’s alibi; 

 

(c) failing to give a Vetrovec
caution with respect to the evidence of one eyewitness, George Athens; 

 

(d) failing to properly
instruct the jury regarding party liability under s. 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code  . . .;

 

. . .

 

(f) failing to instruct the
jury that it was improper for the Crown to ask the appellant to comment on why
his teacher would lie and implicate him in the shooting, given their positive
relationship; and 

 

(g) permitting the Crown to
lead evidence of the appellant’s demeanour at the time he learned of the
warrant for his arrest, and following his arrest, as after the fact conduct
capable of supporting an inference of guilt. 

(Court
of Appeal reasons, at para. 68, per Strathy J.A., dissenting) 

[70]                         
For the reasons of Strathy J.A., I agree that
the trial judge did not err in regard to any of these five additional grounds
of appeal.

E.           
Curative Proviso

[71]                         
Because I find the jury instructions to have
been adequate, it is not necessary to consider whether the facts of this case
would warrant the application of the curative proviso provided in s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .

V.          
Conclusion

[72]

conviction for manslaughter is restored. The matter is remanded to the Ontario
Court of Appeal for consideration of the sentencing appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for manitoba

                    Criminal
law — Defences — Evidence — Admissibility — Unknown third party suspect — Accused
denied involvement in abduction-murder case — Accused sought to adduce evidence
at trial that unknown third party suspect involved in similar alleged abduction
which accused could not have committed — Trial judge found on balance of
probabilities that alleged abduction had not happened and refused to admit
evidence — Appropriate framework for determining admissibility of defence-led
evidence concerning unknown third party suspect — To what extent framework
requires trial judge to assess and weigh evidence of unknown third party
suspect.

                    In
2007, G was charged with the first degree murder of D, a notorious cold-case,
on the basis of newly-tested DNA evidence. G denied any involvement in the
murder, and sought to adduce evidence to suggest that, based on the modus
operandi and other physical evidence, D’s abductor had also abducted W while
G was in custody.

                    Having
found that the same legal test applied to the admissibility of known third
party suspect evidence and unknown third party suspect evidence, the trial
judge concluded on a balance of probabilities that the alleged abduction of W
had not happened. He refused to admit the evidence. G was convicted of second
degree murder by the jury. The Manitoba Court of Appeal concluded that G should
have been permitted to lead the evidence, allowed his appeal and ordered a new
trial.

                    Held: 
The appeal should be dismissed.

                    While
the tests governing known third party suspect evidence and similar fact
evidence may provide useful insights into the underlying concerns and
principles, they should not be stretched beyond the particular circumstances that
they were designed to address. Instead, first principles governing the
admissibility of evidence properly balance the competing interests that arise
when the defence seeks to lead evidence of an unknown third party suspect.

                    Defence-led
evidence is admissible where (1) the evidence is relevant to a fact in
issue, and (2) the probative value of the evidence is not substantially
outweighed by its prejudicial effects. The trial judge must therefore first
determine whether the evidence is logically relevant to an available defence.
Where the defence’s theory is that an unknown third party committed the
indicted crime, this factual foundation will be established by a sufficient
connection between the crime for which the accused is charged and the allegedly
similar incident(s) suggesting that the crimes were committed by the same
person, coupled with evidence that the accused could not have committed the
other offence. Once a sufficient connection is shown, the evidence will be
admissible unless its prejudicial effects substantially outweigh its probative
value. This assessment is inherently individualized, and is capable of
responding to various levels and forms of prejudice. It does not require the
accused to satisfy a higher admissibility threshold or require the trial judge
to engage in an enhanced evaluation of the evidence. The trial judge may not
invade the province of the jury and determine the strength of the evidence.

                    In
this case, the trial judge erred in law in treating the evidence relating to
the alleged abduction of W as known third party suspect evidence and in
requiring G to establish on a balance of probabilities that the alleged
abduction of W took place.  These errors entitled the Court of Appeal to
conduct its own assessment of the evidence. It was entitled to conclude that
there was evidence upon which the jury could find that the alleged crime
against W had occurred and, having regard to the similarities, that it had been
committed by the same person who killed D. The evidence that G could not have
committed the offence against W and the evidence of similarities between the
two offences would have provided some evidence capable of giving the unknown
third party suspect defence an air of reality. While an appellate court is
entitled to step into the shoes of the trial judge if the record permits, in
this case, the Court of Appeal was not in the position to assess and weigh the
extent of the probative value and the extent of prejudicial effect of the
unknown third party suspect evidence. The trial judge’s legal errors were
clearly not minor, and do not attract the application of the curative proviso
in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code . The verdict would not
necessarily have been the same had the trial judge applied the correct
principles in determining the test for the admissibility of this defence
evidence. As this case must be re-tried in any event, the balancing of the
probative value and the prejudicial effect of the evidence is best left for the
trial judge.

judgment of the Court was delivered by

                    Karakatsanis J. — 

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
In 2007, the respondent, Mark Edward Grant, was
charged with the first degree murder of Candace Derksen, a notorious cold-case
murder that occurred in Winnipeg, Manitoba, almost 23 years earlier.  The
Crown’s case depended substantially on the recent analysis of small quantities
of DNA found at the scene of the crime.  Mr. Grant challenged the DNA evidence
and sought to lead evidence suggesting that an unknown third party suspect had committed
the crime.  The trial judge refused to admit the evidence of an allegedly
similar offence committed within months of the Derksen murder, while Mr. Grant
was in custody on an unrelated matter.[1] 
Mr. Grant was subsequently convicted of second degree murder by the jury.  The
Manitoba Court of Appeal concluded that Mr. Grant should have been permitted to
lead the evidence.  It allowed his conviction appeal and ordered a new trial.

[2]                             
The issues before this Court are the appropriate
framework for determining the admissibility of defence-led evidence concerning
an unknown third party suspect, and to what extent this framework requires the
trial judge to assess and weigh the evidence.

[3]                             
Obviously, the identification of an accused as the perpetrator of
the crime charged is essential to establishing criminal liability.  The burden
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person before the court is the
guilty party rests squarely on the Crown.  In accordance with the presumption
of innocence, the accused is never required to prove her innocence.  An accused
person’s Charter-protected right to make full answer and defence
entitles her to challenge the Crown’s case and lead evidence to raise a
reasonable doubt about whether the accused committed the crime.

[4]                             
However, the accused’s rights are not the
only interests at stake.  The integrity of the administration of justice
requires that the proceedings stay focused on the indicted crime and not
devolve into trials within a trial about matters that may not be sufficiently
connected to the case.  Such tangents risk causing delays, confusion and
distractions that undermine the trial’s truth-seeking function.  This risk is
especially heightened where the defence seeks to introduce other alleged
suspects or crimes into the trial.

[5]                             
The parties agree that balancing these interests requires the
trial judge to evaluate the probative value of defence-led evidence of an
unknown third party suspect against the elevated risks it poses to the
integrity of the trial, but disagree about what this evaluation entails.  The
appellant the Manitoba Prosecution Service (the Crown) says that the trial
judge must apply the stringent admissibility tests developed for known third
party suspect and similar fact evidence.  The defence maintains that these
tests place an unfair burden on the accused and that the general rules of
admissibility adequately address the issues of relevance, probative value and
prejudicial effects.

[6]                             
In my view, it is not helpful to slot evidence
concerning an unknown third party suspect into categories that were not
designed to accommodate it.  While the tests governing known third party
suspect evidence and similar fact evidence may provide useful insights into the
underlying concerns and principles, they should not be stretched beyond the
particular circumstances that they were designed to address.

[7]                             
Instead, first principles governing the
admissibility of evidence properly balance the competing interests that arise
when the defence seeks to lead evidence of an unknown third party suspect.  In
such cases, the defence must first establish the logical relevance of the
evidence.  This may be done by demonstrating a sufficient connection ― or
similarity ― between the crime charged and another crime the accused
could not possibly have committed to support the logical inference that the
same person committed both crimes.  Once this threshold is met, the evidence will be admissible unless its prejudicial effects substantially
outweigh its probative value (R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577).

[8]                             
In this case, I conclude that the trial judge
erred in evaluating and assessing the credibility of the unknown third party
suspect evidence on a balance of probabilities.  I agree with the Court of
Appeal that a new trial is required.

Facts

[9]                             
Candace Derksen, a 13-year-old girl, went
missing after leaving school on Friday, November 30, 1984.  Her body was
discovered tied up in a shed in an industrial yard on January 17, 1985.  She
had died of hypothermia resulting from exposure.

[10]                         
In May 2007, Mr. Grant was arrested and charged
with first degree murder on the basis of newly tested DNA evidence.

[11]                         
Mr. Grant denied any involvement in the
abduction-murder, and sought to adduce evidence of the alleged involvement of
an unknown third party suspect.  That evidence related to the alleged abduction
of a 12-year-old girl (P.W.) after she left school on Friday, September 6,
1985, at a time when Mr. Grant was in custody.  Mr. Grant argued that the modus
operandi and other physical evidence indicated that the same person had
abducted both Candace Derksen and P.W.

A.          
Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench

[12]                         
In reviewing the applicable legal framework,
Joyal A.C.J.Q.B. concluded that the legal test set out in R. v. Grandinetti,
2005 SCC 5, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 27, applies equally to admissibility of both
unknown third party suspect evidence and known third party suspect evidence. 
Thus, evidence of an unknown third party suspect could be “admitted only after
some threshold evidence ha[d] been demonstrated respecting a link between the
third party, known or unknown, and the crime before the court” (trial transcript,
A.R., vol. III, at p. 48).  The trial judge also referred to this Court’s
jurisprudence for similar fact evidence and, specifically, to R. v. Handy,
2002 SCC 56, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908.

[13]                         
After reviewing the documentary and testimonial
evidence adduced on the voir dire, the trial judge found that he was
“not, even on a balance of probabilities, able to conclude that the alleged
offence [against P.W.] happened” (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 8-9).  As a result, he
found there could be no unknown third party suspect and thus “no useable
similarities” (p. 9).  The trial judge concluded that the evidence was not
sufficiently probative to justify the impact its admission would have on the
length and complexity of the trial, and ordered that the defence not make any
reference to the P.W. incident.

B.           
Manitoba Court of Appeal, 2013 MBCA 95, 299 Man.
R. (2d) 202

[14]                         
Before the Manitoba Court of Appeal, Mr. Grant
appealed his conviction and brought a motion to adduce fresh evidence relating
to DNA analysis and juror bias.  After rejecting several grounds relating to
the conviction, Monnin J.A., writing for the court, held that the trial judge
erred in not allowing Mr. Grant to lead evidence relating to an alleged unknown
third party suspect (paras. 9-10, 78).

[15]                         
The Court of Appeal concluded that the trial
judge made factual and credibility findings that “he was not entitled to make”
in determining admissibility and that he relied “almost exclusively on the viva
voce evidence of P.W. to the exclusion of all of the other evidence before
him, including P.W.’s two prior statements” (para. 68).  The trial judge erred
in applying the balance of probabilities standard to determine whether the P.W.
incident occurred; he should have instead applied the Seaboyer test that
broadly governs the admissibility of defence-led evidence (paras. 73-74). 
Furthermore, in determining whether the defence theory had an air of reality,
all that was required was “some evidence” that could leave a jury with a
reasonable doubt as to the accused’s guilt (para. 68).

[16]                         
The Court of Appeal characterized the evidence
tendered in this case as “more akin to similar-fact evidence” than to known
third party suspect evidence (para. 72).  However, the court concluded that the
test applicable to Crown-led similar fact evidence does not apply when such
evidence is advanced by an accused; rather, defence-led similar fact evidence
is admissible unless its prejudicial effects substantially outweigh its
probative value, in accordance with Seaboyer.

[17]                         
The Court of Appeal concluded that the evidence
pertaining to the P.W. incident was “very relevant” and “pointed to the
possibility that the same person who killed Candace Derksen abducted P.W., if
the jury so found that to have occurred” (para. 70).  As Mr. Grant was in
custody at the time of the P.W. incident, this evidence “could provide the
basis upon which a reasonable, properly instructed jury could acquit” (ibid.). 
The court concluded that, since the prejudicial effects of the evidence did not
substantially outweigh its probative value, Mr. Grant should have been
permitted to place the evidence of the P.W. incident before the jury (para.
78).  The court noted that this evidence was also relevant in assessing
the evidence of the defence DNA expert that excluded Mr. Grant as a suspect. 
The accused was denied his opportunity to make full answer, and this legal
error was sufficient to set aside the conviction and order a new trial.

III.       
Analysis

A.          
Principles Governing the Admission of Defence
Evidence in Criminal Proceedings

[18]                         
The truth-seeking function of the trial creates
a starting premise that all relevant evidence is admissible (R. v. L. (D.O.),
[1993] 4 S.C.R. 419; R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670).  Evidence is
logically relevant where it has any tendency to prove or disprove a fact in
issue (Corbett, at p. 715).

[19]                         
However, not all relevant evidence is
admissible.  The trial judge must also balance the probative value of the
evidence against the prejudicial effects of its admission (R. v. Noël, 2002 SCC 67, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 433; Corbett;
Sweitzer v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 949; Seaboyer; R. v. Harrer, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562).  Evidence led by the Crown will be excluded where its prejudicial
effects outweigh its probative value (Seaboyer).  The presumption of the
accused’s innocence leads us to strike a different balance where defence-led
evidence is concerned.  As this Court explained in Seaboyer, “the prejudice must substantially outweigh the value of the evidence
before a judge can exclude evidence relevant to a defence allowed by law” (p.
611; see also R. v. Shearing, 2002 SCC 58, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 33; R. v. Arcangioli,
[1994] 1 S.C.R. 129).

[20]                         
In order for the judge to put a defence to the
jury, the accused must point to evidence on the record
that gives the defence an air of reality (R. v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29,
[2002] 2 S.C.R. 3).  The trial judge must
determine whether there is some evidence that is “reasonably capable of
supporting the inferences required for the defence to succeed” (ibid.,
at para. 83).  The air of reality test applies to all
defences, and acts as a threshold to ensure that “fanciful or far-fetched”
defences are not put before the trier of fact (para. 84).  When applying this
test, the trial judge must take the evidence to be true and must not assess
credibility or make other findings of fact (para. 54).

[21]                         
These principles are distinct, but may be
interrelated.  In most cases, where the defence evidence relates to the facts
underlying the offence charged, the logical relevance and the admissibility of
the evidence will be obvious.  However, where the evidence refers to a factual
matrix beyond the offence charged, its relevance to a fact in issue or an
available defence may be less clear.  In such circumstances, the gate-keeping
role of the trial judge may require her to determine whether the evidence is
logically relevant and connected to a defence that has an air of reality.  For
example, while the degree of similarity may be logically relevant to whether
the same person committed the offence, it will not relate to a fact in issue at
trial unless the defence has an air of reality.  In this case, the unknown
third party suspect defence will not have an air of reality unless there is
evidence that the accused could not have committed the other offence.  Thus,
logical relevance will sometimes be assessed with reference to whether the
defence for which the evidence is tendered is available.  That said, the air of
reality test set out in Cinous does not displace the Seaboyer admissibility
test.  The air of reality test and the Seaboyer admissibility test
remain two distinct inquiries.

[22]                         
These principles are firmly established in this
Court’s jurisprudence and are not generally challenged by the parties to this
appeal.  Instead, the dispute concerns their proper application to evidence
concerning an unknown third party suspect.

[23]                         
The Crown
argues that a modified version of Seaboyer must be applied,
incorporating aspects of the tests governing similar fact and known third party
suspect evidence.  I disagree.  As I discuss below, these tests are designed to
respond to the particular risks and benefits presented by particular types of
evidence.  Where evidence does not fit within these categories ― where it
does not present these specific risks and benefits ― its admission is
governed directly by the general principles of admissibility set out in Corbett
and Seaboyer.

B.           
The Known Third Party Suspect Test Does Not
Provide the Proper Template for Determining the Relevance of Unknown Third
Party Suspect Evidence

[24]                         
In order for evidence relating to a known third
party suspect to have any probative value, the evidence must show a sufficient
connection between the third person and the crime for which the accused is
charged (Grandinetti, at para. 47; McMillan v. The Queen, [1977]
2 S.C.R. 824).  The defence points to such evidence to raise a reasonable doubt
that someone else committed the crime in question.  Evidence that this third
person had the motive, the means, or the propensity to commit the crime will
often establish this sufficient connection.

[25]                         
As this Court recognized in McMillan, the
sufficient connection test is nothing more than an elaboration of the logical
relevance analysis applied in the particular context of allegations that
another, known individual committed the crime (pp. 828-29).  Abella J. affirmed
this point in Grandinetti, where she wrote:

The
requirement that there be a sufficient connection between the third party and
the crime is essential.  Without this link, the third party evidence is neither
relevant nor probative.  The evidence may be inferential, but the inferences
must be reasonable, based on the evidence, and not amount to speculation.  [para.
47]

Without a sufficient connection
between the third party and the crime, the evidence of a known third party
suspect is simply not logically relevant.

[26]                         
There is no principled reason to require that
the connection be established by evidence relating directly to the third party
where that individual is unknown.  Such an articulation of the test ―
designed, for example, to capture the motive, propensity or opportunity of a
known third party to commit the crime ― would place an unrealistic burden
on the accused.  How could an accused establish the motive, propensity or opportunity of an
unknown individual?  (See, on this point, State
v. Scheidell, 227 Wis.2d 285 (1999), at paras. 24-27.)

[27]                         
Where the third party’s identity is unknown, the
nature of the connection must reflect a different factual matrix.  In such
circumstances, the sufficient connection ― to anchor the relevance and
probative value of the evidence ― generally arises from similarities
between the crime charged and another crime that the accused could not possibly
have committed.

[28]                         
This focus on the similarities between the
offences is not a formulation of a new, categorical test. Rather, it reflects
the principles underlying Grandinetti which play out differently in
different factual contexts.  Like known third party suspect evidence, “in the
absence of some nexus with the alleged offence”, unknown third party suspect
evidence will constitute mere speculation (R. v. McMillan (1975), 7 O.R.
(2d) 750 (C.A.), at p. 758, aff’d [1977] 2 S.C.R. 824).  Unless the
circumstances and similarities to the other offence are sufficient to suggest
that the same individual committed both crimes, unknown third party suspect
evidence will not be logically relevant.

[29]                         
This is consistent with the
approaches taken by other common law jurisdictions in assessing defence-led
evidence of similar acts.[2]

[30]                         
A finding of logical relevance does not end the
admissibility inquiry.  Even the Grandinetti sufficient connection test
speaks only to the probative value side of the Seaboyer equation.  Once
the relevance threshold is met, the trial judge must still be satisfied that
the probative value of the evidence tendered by the defence is not
substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effects.

C.           
The Admissibility Test for Crown-led Similar
Fact Evidence Does Not Apply to Defence-led Evidence of the Similar Acts of a Non-accused

[31]                         
Similar fact evidence is, most
commonly, evidence of the accused’s prior bad acts led by the Crown.  Such
evidence is presumptively inadmissible, as its highly prejudicial effects
generally outweigh its probative value (R. v. Arp, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 339; Handy). 
As this Court noted in R. v. B. (C.R.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 717, at p. 732, putting
evidence of the accused’s “prior immoral or illegal acts” before the jury
inevitably results in a “heavy prejudice” to the accused.  The presumptive
inadmissibility of this evidence is tied to both the moral aspect of this
prejudice ― the
danger that the trier of fact will wrongfully convict the accused simply to
condemn her for her prior bad acts ― and the reasoning aspect of this prejudice ― the danger that the
trier of fact will become distracted by the similar bad act evidence and accord
it more weight than it merits (Handy, at paras. 139-47).  Exceptionally,
similar fact evidence will be admitted where, based on the similarity of the
alleged acts, the Crown “satisf[ies] the trial judge on a balance of
probabilities that . . . the probative value of the evidence in relation to a
particular issue outweighs its potential prejudice and thereby justifies its
reception” (Handy, at para. 55).  Where the Crown leads similar fact
evidence to establish the identity of the perpetrator, the Crown must
satisfy the trial judge that, on a balance of probabilities, “the same person
committed the alleged similar acts” (Arp, at para. 48).

[32]                         
In addition to applying the Grandinetti
test for known third party suspects, the trial judge in the present case
applied a “balance of probabilities” threshold test to determine whether the
P.W. incident actually occurred.  In so doing, he referred to the admissibility
test for Crown-led similar fact evidence, as set out in Handy.  The
Court of Appeal found that the evidence in question was “akin to similar-fact
evidence”, but noted that, because this is defence-led evidence, Seaboyer,
not Handy, governs its admissibility (paras. 73-74).

[33]                         
This conclusion is
consistent with the approach taken by Canadian appellate courts where evidence
of a non-accused’s similar acts is sought to be introduced.  Appellate courts
faced with this issue have consistently found that such evidence is not
governed by the test applicable to
evidence of an accused’s similar acts (see, for example, R. v. Scopelliti
(1981), 34 O.R. (2d) 524 (C.A.); R. v. Pollock (2004), 187 C.C.C. (3d) 213 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 104; R. v. Kendall (1987), 35 C.C.C.
(3d) 105 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Sims (1994), 28 C.R. (4th) 231 (B.C.C.A.); R.
v. Hamilton, 2003 BCCA 490, 180 C.C.C. (3d) 80; R. v. Brousseau,
2006 QCCA 858).

[34]                         
Defence-led evidence concerning an
unknown third party suspect is only similar fact evidence in the sense that its
probative value is derived from the similarity between the incidents where it
is impossible for the accused to have committed the uncharged offence.  An onus
requiring proof on a balance of probabilities is not consistent with the
lower evidential burden of the accused to put a defence in issue by adducing
sufficient evidence “upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably
could acquit” (Cinous, at para. 49).  Rendering such defence-led
evidence presumptively inadmissible would effectively impose a persuasive burden
on the accused to prove her innocence.  As this Court noted in Seaboyer,
the test governing defence-led evidence must be accountable to “the fundamental
tenet of our judicial system that an innocent person must not be convicted” (p.
611).

[35]                         
Moreover, unknown third party
suspect evidence does not risk causing moral prejudice to the accused.  Such
evidence is intended to be exculpatory when raised by an accused, as it was in
this case.  Although the evidence engages some of the same reasoning prejudice
concerns as does evidence of the prior bad acts of the accused (Arp, at
para. 40; Handy, at para. 37), this prejudice can be addressed directly
under Seaboyer.

[36]                         
To conclude, the balance of probabilities test governing the admissibility of similar
fact evidence does not apply to unknown third party suspect evidence proffered
by the accused.  The similarity of the acts goes to the relevance of the
evidence, but imposing the onus of the Handy test on the accused is
neither consistent with the presumption of innocence nor necessary to protect
the accused from moral prejudice.  Any reasoning prejudice or risks to the
integrity of the trial process engaged by this evidence are better addressed
directly within the Seaboyer framework.

D.          
The Seaboyer Test Applies to the Admission of
Unknown Third Party Suspect Evidence

[37]                         
In my view, the
admissibility of evidence concerning an unknown third party suspect is best
determined in accordance with the broader, principled approach to the admission
of evidence found in Seaboyer.  Evaluating the admissibility of this
evidence under Seaboyer, rather than under disparate tests not designed
for its particularities, allows the trial judge to tailor her evaluation and
weighing of the probative value and prejudicial effects of the evidence to the
specific facts presented.  In accordance with Seaboyer, once the
evidence has been found to be relevant, unknown third party suspect evidence will be admitted unless its prejudicial
effects substantially outweigh its probative value.

[38]                         
As noted above, there are two components to the Seaboyer
analysis.  First, in applying Seaboyer, the trial judge must assess the
potential probative value of the evidence.  Where the
evidence relates to an unknown third party suspect, probative value will depend
in part on the strength of the connection or nexus between the two events
― that is, the degree of similarity between the indicted crime and the
allegedly similar incident.  As the Supreme Court of Wisconsin noted in Scheidell, “the
greater the similarity, complexity, and distinctiveness of the events, as well
as the relative frequency of the event, the stronger the case for admission” (para.
41, citing State v. Sullivan, 216 Wis.2d 768 (1998), at para. 54).

[39]                         
Second, the Seaboyer test is concerned
with the potential prejudicial effects of the evidence.  Unknown third party
suspect evidence, like Crown-led similar fact evidence, poses a particular risk
of reasoning prejudice.  Introducing evidence of other crimes that are
sufficiently similar to the crime charged may risk “the distraction of members
of the jury from their proper focus on the charge itself aggravated by the
consumption of time” (Handy, at para. 144).

[40]                         
However, these significant prejudicial effects
must nonetheless be evaluated in accordance with the fundamental principles
governing criminal proceedings.  In giving constitutional protection to the
accused’s rights to make full answer and defence and to be presumed innocent
until proven guilty, we must accept a certain amount of complexity, length, and
distraction from the Crown’s case as a necessary concession to the
actualization of those rights.  (See, for example, Scheidell,
at para. 65, per Abrahamson C.J., dissenting in the result.)

[41]                         
Contrary to the Crown’s submissions, applying Seaboyer
does not “mak[e] the test for admissibility turn on whether or not the third
party is named” (A.F., at para. 44).  Known third party suspect evidence is already
subject to the Seaboyer admissibility test:  do the prejudicial effects
substantially outweigh the probative value?  (See, for example, R. v. Murphy,
2012 ONCA 573, 295 O.A.C. 281 (third party suspect evidence); R. v.
Underwood, 2002 ABCA 310, 170 C.C.C. (3d) 500 (hearsay evidence of a
third party suspect).)  Indeed, defence-led evidence is generally subject to Seaboyer
(Shearing (defence cross-examination of a complainant); R. v. Clarke
(1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (complainant’s credibility); R. v. Jackson,
2013 ONCA 632, 301 C.C.C. (3d) 358, aff’d 2014 SCC 30, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 672
(deceased victim’s criminal convictions); R. v. C. (T.) (2004),
189 C.C.C. (3d) 473 (Ont. C.A.) (third party records in the possession of the
accused); Pollock (character evidence of a co-accused); R. v. Humaid (2006), 37 C.R. (6th) 347
(Ont. C.A.) (defence hearsay evidence); Hamilton (bad character evidence
of the deceased)).  Thus, while the principles in Seaboyer will always
apply, they play out differently in different situations.

[42]                         
As this discussion demonstrates, many of the
concerns animating the specific tests governing the admissibility of known
third party suspect and similar fact evidence are also addressed in the Seaboyer
analysis.  In all cases, the evidence must be beyond mere speculation and
conjecture.  The value of the evidence must be balanced against the risks posed
to the integrity of the trial when a party seeks to expand the ambit of the
trial to individuals or events not directly related to the crime indicted.

E.           
The Trial Judge’s Role as Evidentiary Gatekeeper
and the Seaboyer Test

[43]                         
The Crown argues that the trial judge, as
gatekeeper, must assess the quality and reliability of evidence as part of the
admissibility inquiry.  In light of the elevated risks posed by unknown third
party suspect evidence, the Crown submits that the Court of Appeal dangerously
lowered the threshold for third party suspect evidence by applying the “some
evidence” standard articulated in Cinous.  For the reasons that follow,
I do not accept this submission.

[44]                         
The trial judge plays a fundamentally important
role as evidentiary gatekeeper, tasked with preserving both the right of the
accused to make full answer and defence and the integrity of the trial
process.  To fulfill this mandate, the trial judge engages in a limited
weighing of the evidence to ensure that the jury only considers evidence (1) that
is relevant to a fact in issue, including an available defence; and (2) whose
probative value is not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effects. 
These inquiries often overlap.  However, the trial judge is not permitted to
invade the province of the jury and determine the strength of the evidence (R.
v. Hart, 2014 SCC 52, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 544, at para. 98).

[45]                         
The trial judge must determine whether the
evidence is logically relevant to an available defence ― one that can be
put to the jury.  The air of reality test requires the trial judge, taking the
proposed evidence at its greatest strength, to determine whether the record
would contain “a sufficient factual foundation for a properly instructed jury
to give effect to the defence” (R. v. Buzizi, 2013 SCC 27, [2013] 2
S.C.R. 248, at para. 16).  Where the defence’s theory is that an unknown third
party committed the indicted crime, this factual foundation will be established
by a sufficient connection between the crime for which the accused is charged
and the allegedly similar incident(s), coupled with the impossibility that the
accused committed the other offence.

[46]                         
The trial judge must also assess and balance the
extent of the probative value and prejudicial effects of the evidence in
accordance with Seaboyer.  Like the air of reality test, the Seaboyer
admissibility test does not permit the trial judge to decide how much
weight to give the evidence or to make findings of fact.  Doing so would usurp
the role of the jury and would place a persuasive burden on the accused
inconsistent with the presumption of innocence.

[47]                         
The Crown argues that the substantial prejudice
arising from evidence concerning an unknown third party suspect requires a
higher threshold for both admissibility and putting the defence to the jury. 
However, substantial prejudice does not require a higher threshold; it simply
weighs heavier in the balance.  The Seaboyer admissibility test does not
presuppose a particular level of prejudice or probative value for certain
categories of evidence; instead, it requires a trial judge to conduct the
balancing process contextually, based on the particularities of the evidence
before her.  As an inherently individualized assessment, it is capable of
responding to various levels and forms of prejudice.  No other test or higher
threshold is required to protect the integrity of the trial process.

[48]                         
The same is true of the “some evidence”
threshold in the air of reality test, which the Crown argues the Court of
Appeal erred in applying in this case.  This standard does not indirectly lower
the threshold for unknown third party suspect evidence.  Rather, this standard,
when used in conjunction with the requirement for a sufficient connection
between the crimes, respects the requirements of Corbett, Seaboyer and
Cinous, and properly balances the integrity of the trial process with
the accused’s right to make full answer and defence.

[49]                         
This conclusion does not, as the Crown submits
it would, increase the scope of the Crown’s potential disclosure obligations
such that compliance becomes impossible.  The Crown continues to be required to disclose all relevant evidence
to the defence (R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, at pp. 336-40). 
The application of the Stinchcombe test obviously depends on the
circumstances of each case and each disclosure request.

[50]                         
In this case, the disclosure request was based
on notes by the lead investigator in the police file on the Derksen murder concerning a similar crime
(the P.W. incident) that was “very probably” connected to the Derksen murder (A.R., vol.
II, at p. 135).  The evidence for which disclosure was
sought was clearly relevant.

[51]                         
Where the similarities or the temporal or
geographic connections between the charged crime and the crime(s) for which
disclosure is sought are insufficient, the evidence will not be relevant, and
disclosure will not be required.  Allowing the defence to establish a
sufficient connection with reference to the crimes, rather than to the suspect,
does not extend the Crown’s duty of disclosure.

[52]                         
Nor does this conclusion jeopardize the Crown’s
ability to protect the privacy interests of individuals implicated in unrelated
criminal matters or the confidentiality of ongoing investigations.  The
disclosure test remains one of relevancy, and the legislative measures that
restrict disclosure to protect the privacy interests of individuals implicated
in criminal matters continue to apply (see, for example, Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , ss. 278.1  to 278.91 ; R. v. Quesnelle, 2014 SCC 46,
[2014] 2 S.C.R. 390).  Moreover, the Crown exercises discretion with respect to
the manner and timing of disclosure, thus allowing the Crown to delay
disclosure to ensure the safety of individuals involved in an ongoing
investigation (Stinchcombe, at pp. 339-40).  This discretionary
decision, like all other exercises of Crown discretion in disclosure matters,
must be justified on review (Stinchcombe, at p. 340).

F.            
Summary of Analysis 

[53]                         
To summarize, any
elevated risks of prejudice that arise when an accused seeks to introduce
evidence of an unknown third party suspect do not require the accused to
satisfy a higher admissibility threshold or require the judge to engage in an
enhanced evaluation of the evidence.  Existing rules achieve the appropriate
balance of maintaining the integrity of the trial
process while protecting the right of an accused to make full answer and
defence to the charges against her.

[54]                         
Thus, defence
evidence is admissible where (1) the evidence is relevant to a fact in
issue; and (2) the probative value of the evidence is not substantially
outweighed by its prejudicial effects.  Where the connection between the
evidence and a fact in issue at trial is not obvious, the air of reality test
may help a trial judge in determining if the evidence tends to prove a defence
that may become available.  Relevant evidence concerning an
unknown third party suspect will only be excluded where its prejudicial effects
substantially outweigh its probative value.

G.          
Application to the Facts

[55]                         
The trial judge erred in law in treating the
evidence relating to the P.W. incident as known third party suspect evidence. 
The connections tying a known third party to the charged crime ―
generally motive, opportunity or propensity ― do not fit the context of
an unknown third party suspect.  He also erred in requiring the accused to
establish on a balance of probabilities that the alleged abduction took place. 
There is no such evidentiary burden on the accused where he seeks to rely on
the defence that an unknown third party committed the crime in question.  To
the extent that the trial judge made findings of probative value and
prejudicial effects, those findings are intimately tied to the incorrect
balancing tests he used, and thus cannot be relied upon.

[56]                         
These errors entitled the Court of Appeal to
conduct its own assessment of the evidence (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002
SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at paras. 31-35).  The court considered P.W.’s viva
voce testimony and her prior statements to the police, which the trial
judge had accepted (for the purposes of the voir dire) for the truth of
their contents, in accordance with R. v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2
S.C.R. 787.  The court also considered other statements that had been admitted
on the voir dire for the truth of their contents with the Crown’s
consent, and other evidence pertaining to the incident, including the police
reports noting a possible connection between the P.W. incident and the Derksen
murder.

[57]                         
The Court of Appeal concluded that the evidence
was “very relevant” and that its probative value arose from the marked
similarities between the alleged abduction of P.W. and the crime for which Mr. Grant
is charged.  In each case, the victim was of a similar age.  Both victims left
school at the same time of day, on the same day of the week, nine months
apart.  Both were left in unlocked shed-like premises in the same industrial
area of Winnipeg, 2.6 kilometres apart.  Both victims were found abandoned with
their hands and feet tied with similar knots.  In neither case was there
evidence of physical or sexual assault.  The same type of gum wrapper was found
at both scenes (although, in the crime charged, it was found in the deceased’s
pocket, suggesting it may have been hers).

[58]                         
I cannot accept the Crown’s submission that
these similarities are insufficient on any test and that the evidence relied
upon by the Court of Appeal would not be available at trial.  As the Crown
cannot resile from its concession that the various statements were admissible
for their truth for the purpose of determining admissibility, the Court of
Appeal was entitled to rely upon this voir dire evidence in assessing
its potential probative value.

[59]                         
The Court of Appeal was entitled to conclude
that there was evidence upon which the jury could find that the subsequent
crime had occurred and, having regard to the similarities, that it had been
committed by the same person who killed Candace Derksen.  In light of the
evidence that the accused could not have committed the other offence, there was
some evidence capable of giving the unknown third party suspect defence an air
of reality.

[60]                         
The Court of Appeal applied Seaboyer as
follows:

It is left to be decided whether this
relevant evidence should be excluded because its prejudicial effect
substantially outweighed its probative value. In this case, the only
prejudicial effect would be the impact this evidence would have had on the trial
process in what was an already complicated and lengthy trial.  From his
reasons, the judge was obviously concerned about this impact.  In my view, that
concern did not substantially outweigh the probative value.  [para. 78]

[61]                         
Seaboyer requires
the court to measure and weigh the extent of probative value and the extent of
the prejudicial effect of the evidence.  Obviously, this balancing is highly
fact driven and best done by the trial judge.  The prejudicial effects of this
evidence primarily concern the impact on the complexity, focus, and length of
the trial process.  To some extent, the trial judge can craft a process that
will limit these prejudicial effects.  However, the trial judge did not address
this issue in any detail.

[62]                         
While an appellate court is entitled to step
into the shoes of the trial judge if the record permits, in this case, the
Court of Appeal was not in the position to assess and weigh the extent of the
probative value of the unknown third party suspect evidence and the extent of
prejudicial effect of this evidence.

[63]                         
The trial judge’s legal errors were clearly not
minor, and do not attract the application of the curative proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .  The verdict would not necessarily have been the
same had the trial judge applied the correct principles in determining the test
for the admissibility of this defence evidence (R. v. Morin, [1988] 2
S.C.R. 345, at p. 374).  This case must be re-tried in any event.  In these
circumstances, the balancing of the Seaboyer factors is best left for
the trial judge.

[64]                         
Before this Court, Mr. Grant also submitted a
motion to adduce fresh evidence relating to DNA analysis and juror bias. 
Because of my finding with respect to the admission of evidence relating to an
unknown third party suspect, it is not necessary to deal with that motion.

Chief Justice Joyal (as he then was) of the Court of Queen’s Bench of Manitoba,
dated January 19, 2011, A.R., vol. I, at p. 90.





[2]         Australian law
requires the defence to show “a sufficient similarity between the two acts as
to allow the jury to conclude that there is a real possibility that the same
person was involved” (J. D. Heydon, Cross on Evidence (9th Aust. 2013),
at p. 713).  In the United Kingdom, evidence of the bad character of someone
other than the defendant is admissible where the similarities give the evidence
“substantial probative value” (Criminal Justice Act 2003 (U.K.),
2003, c. 44, s. 100(1)(b), (3)(c) and (d); H. M. Malek et al., eds., Phipson
on Evidence (18th ed. 2013), at paras. 22-04, 22-24 to 22-27).  Similarly, in the United States, some
federal and state jurisprudence holds that defence-led evidence of similar acts
will be admissible where it is
“sufficiently similar to the crime at bar so that it is relevant” (United
States v. Stevens, 935 F.2d 1380 (3rd Cir. 1991), at p. 1384; Scheidell,

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

                    Criminal
law — Sentencing — Appeals — Powers of Court of Appeal — Court of Appeal
reducing sentence of imprisonment from six and a half to four years — Whether
Court of Appeal erred in substituting sentence it considered appropriate for
one imposed by trial judge, primarily on basis that trial judge had deviated
from sentencing range established by courts for impaired driving offences — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 687 .

                    Criminal
law — Sentencing — Considerations — Impaired driving causing death — Whether it
was open to trial judge to consider frequency of impaired driving in region
where offence was committed as relevant sentencing factor — Whether length and
other terms of driving prohibition imposed by trial judge were appropriate —
Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 , ss. 259(2) (a.1 ), 718 to 718.2.

                    On
June 17, 2011, at about 4:00 a.m., L lost control of his vehicle
while entering a curve on a country road in the Beauce region. He was speeding,
and his ability to drive was impaired by alcohol. Two passengers sitting in the
back seat of the vehicle died instantly. Neither the vehicle’s mechanical
condition nor the weather contributed to the accident. L is entirely responsible
for it, and he pleaded guilty to two counts of impaired driving causing death.

                    The
trial judge sentenced L, on each count, to six years and six months’
imprisonment; the two sentences were to be served concurrently. He also
prohibited L from operating a vehicle for a period of 11 years starting
from the sentencing date. The Court of Appeal replaced the sentence imposed by
the trial judge with one of four years’ imprisonment. It also reduced the
length of the driving prohibition to four years commencing at the end of L’s
incarceration.

                    Held
(McLachlin C.J. and Gascon J. dissenting): The appeal should be
allowed and the sentence imposed by the trial judge restored except as regards
the driving prohibition, which should be reduced to two years and four months
commencing at the end of L’s incarceration.

                    Per
Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Wagner and Côté JJ.: Sentencing remains
one of the most delicate stages of the criminal justice process in Canada.
Although this task is governed by ss. 718 et seq. of the Criminal Code ,
and although the objectives set out in those sections guide the courts and are
clearly defined, it nonetheless involves, by definition, the exercise of a
broad discretion by the courts in balancing all the relevant factors in order
to meet the objectives being pursued in sentencing.

                    The
Court has on many occasions noted the importance of giving wide latitude to
sentencing judges. Since they have, inter alia, the advantage of
having heard and seen the witnesses, sentencing judges are in the best position
to determine, having regard to the circumstances, a just and appropriate
sentence that is consistent with the objectives of the Criminal Code .
Ultimately, except where a sentencing judge makes an error of law or an error
in principle that has an impact on the sentence, an appellate court may not
vary the sentence unless it is demonstrably unfit.

                    Proportionality
is the cardinal principle that must guide appellate courts in considering the
fitness of a sentence imposed on an offender. The more serious the crime and
its consequences, or the greater the offender’s degree of responsibility, the
heavier the sentence will be. In other words, the severity of a sentence
depends not only on the seriousness of the crime’s consequences, but also on the
moral blameworthiness of the offender. Determining a proportionate sentence is
a delicate task. Both sentences that are too lenient and sentences that are too
harsh can undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.
Moreover, if appellate courts intervene without deference to vary sentences
that they consider too lenient or too harsh, their interventions could
undermine the credibility of the system and the authority of trial courts.

                    Although
sentencing ranges are used mainly to ensure the parity of sentences, they
reflect all the principles and objectives of sentencing. Sentencing ranges are
nothing more than summaries of the minimum and maximum sentences imposed in the
past, which serve in any given case as guides for the application of all the
relevant principles and objectives. However, they should not be considered
“averages”, let alone straitjackets, but should instead be seen as historical
portraits for the use of sentencing judges, who must still exercise their
discretion in each case.

                    There
will always be situations that call for a sentence outside a particular range:
although ensuring parity in sentencing is in itself a desirable objective, the
fact that each crime is committed in unique circumstances by an offender with a
unique profile cannot be disregarded. The determination of a just and
appropriate sentence is a highly individualized exercise that goes beyond a
purely mathematical calculation. It involves a variety of factors that are
difficult to define with precision. This is why it may happen that a sentence
that, on its face, falls outside a particular range, and that may never have
been imposed in the past for a similar crime, is not demonstrably unfit.
Everything depends on the gravity of the offence, the offender’s degree of
responsibility and the specific circumstances of each case. Thus, the fact that
a judge deviates from a sentencing range established by the courts does not in
itself justify appellate intervention.

                    In
this sense, the Court of Appeal erred in this case in basing its intervention
on the fact that the sentence fell outside the sentencing range established by
the courts, while disregarding the criteria that are normally applied in the
determination of a just and appropriate sentence. Any other conclusion would
have the effect of authorizing appellate courts to create categories of
offences with no real justification and accordingly intervene without deference
to substitute a sentence on appeal. But the power to create categories of
offences lies with Parliament, not the courts.

                    The
Court of Appeal also erred in failing to address the factor relating to the
local situation, that is, to the frequency of impaired driving in the Beauce
region, on which the trial judge had relied. Although the fact that a type of crime
occurs frequently in a particular region is not in itself an aggravating
factor, there may be circumstances in which a judge might nonetheless consider
such a fact in balancing the various sentencing objectives, including the need
to denounce the unlawful conduct in question in that place and at the same time
to deter anyone else from doing the same thing. In this case, the mere fact
that the trial judge found that impaired driving is a scourge in the Beauce
district was in itself sufficient for him to consider this factor in
determining what would be a just and appropriate sentence. It was inappropriate
for the Court of Appeal to disregard this factor in assessing the fitness of
the sentence, as that meant that its analysis was incomplete. In the context of
offences such as the ones at issue, courts from various parts of the country
have in fact held that the objectives of deterrence and denunciation must be
emphasized in order to convey society’s condemnation, as such offences are ones
that might be committed by ordinarily law‑abiding people.

                    The
Court of Appeal was therefore wrong to reduce the sentence imposed by the trial
judge. Even though the trial judge had made an error in principle by
considering an element of the offence as an aggravating factor (the fact that L
was intoxicated), that error had clearly had no impact on the sentence. The
sentence of six years and six months’ imprisonment imposed by the trial
judge, although severe, falls within the overall range of sentences normally imposed
in Quebec and elsewhere in the country and is not demonstrably unfit. It must
therefore be restored.

                    As
to the term of the driving prohibition, the length of the presentence driving
prohibition should be subtracted from that of the prohibition imposed in the
context of the sentence. In this case, the driving prohibition of four years
and seven months is demonstrably unfit and must be reduced to two years and
four months to take account of the recognizance entered into by L under
which he was to refrain from driving from his release date until his sentencing
date (two years and three months).

                    Finally,
the Court of Appeal erred in not admitting the fresh evidence of L’s breaches
of his recognizances. That evidence was relevant. It could have affected the weight
given to the favourable presentence report and could therefore have affected
the final sentencing decision. In particular, the Court of Appeal might have
reached a different conclusion if it had admitted that evidence, which would
have helped it in assessing the fitness of the sentence that had been imposed
at trial.

                    Per McLachlin C.J. and Gascon J. (dissenting): Sentencing
judges must take into consideration, inter alia, the objectives of
deterrence and rehabilitation, any relevant aggravating and mitigating
circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and the principle that a
sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for
similar offences committed in similar circumstances. If a judge fails to
individualize a sentence and to consider the relevant mitigating factors while
placing undue emphasis on the circumstances of the offence and the objectives
of denunciation and deterrence, all that is done is to punish the crime. The
reconciliation of the different factors requires that the sentence be
consistent with the fundamental principle of proportionality.  This principle
requires that full consideration be given to each of the factors.
Proportionality is a limiting principle that requires that a sentence not exceed
what is just and appropriate in light of the moral blameworthiness of the
offender and the gravity of the offence. Deterrence can thus work through
conditions tailored to fit the offender. This is even more important in the
case of a young person with no criminal record.

                    The
standard of intervention to be applied by appellate courts in sentencing
matters is well known: a sentence can only be interfered with if it is
demonstrably unfit or if it results from an error in principle, the failure to
consider a relevant factor or the overemphasis of a relevant factor. If a party
shows that the trial judge made an error in principle, failed to consider a
relevant factor or overemphasized appropriate factors, there is no requirement
that the sentence also be shown to be demonstrably unfit before an appellate
court can intervene. Even if none of these three situations exists, however,
intervention may be necessary if the sentence is demonstrably unfit. 

                    Where
a reviewable error is shown in the reasoning on which a sentence is based, it
is appropriate for an appellate court to be able to intervene and assess the
fitness of the sentence. The error that is identified thus opens the door to
intervention and permits an appellate court to reopen the sentencing analysis.
However, the court of appeal’s role in ensuring consistency in sentencing
requires it before intervening to ascertain, among other things, that the
sentence represents a substantial and marked departure from the sentences
customarily imposed for similar offenders who have committed similar crimes.
There is no such thing as a uniform sentence for a particular crime, and
sentencing is an inherently individualized process. A sentence must reflect a
consideration of all the relevant factors, and it is in this sense that the
“process” of sentencing is important. It is by correctly repeating the
analytical exercise that the court can determine whether the sanction imposed
on the offender is just and appropriate or whether it should be varied, and the
court need not show deference in such a case.

                    The
sentencing ranges established by appellate courts are only guidelines, and not
hard and fast rules. A judge can therefore order a sentence outside the
established range as long as it is in accordance with the principles and
objectives of sentencing. As a corollary, the mere fact that a sentence falls
within the range applicable to a certain type of crime does not necessarily
make it fit. It is by analyzing the trial judge’s reasoning or thought process
that an appellate court can determine whether a sentence that falls within the
proper range is tailored to fit the circumstances of the offender and is
therefore individualized and proportionate.

                    The
Court of Appeal properly justified its intervention in this case. The trial judge
committed a number of errors, and the sentence that resulted from his analysis
was thus neither proportionate nor individualized; it also represented a
substantial and marked departure from the sentences customarily imposed on
similar offenders who have committed similar crimes in similar circumstances.
In his analysis, the trial judge began by identifying some aggravating factors
that were not really aggravating factors, namely an element of the offence —
the fact that L was intoxicated — and the impact on those close to L. Next, he
discounted some relevant factors that are normally characterized as mitigating
factors and that must be considered in determining the appropriate sentence —
namely the youth of the accused and the facts that he had expressed remorse,
that he had no criminal record and that the presentence report was favourable
to him. Indeed, the trial judge failed to discuss the presentence report and
its positive findings, which represented a mitigating factor that was relevant
to and important for the determination of the appropriate sentence. Finally,
his failure to consider certain mitigating factors that favoured L’s potential
for rehabilitation and the emphasis he placed on exemplarity led him to impose
an excessive sentence that departed from the principle of proportionality.

                    The
local situation factor clearly magnified the exemplary focus of the sentence
with which the Court of Appeal took issue. When considered in the
sentencing context, the frequency of a crime in a given region does not help
paint a portrait of the accused, but instead reflects external factors. The degree of
censure required to express society’s condemnation of the offence is limited by
the principle that an offender’s sentence must be equivalent to his or her moral
culpability. Even though courts of appeal have noted that a trial judge can sometimes
consider the local situation when imposing a sentence, the judicial notice that
judges can take of their communities is not without limits, and caution must be
exercised in establishing its scope. Being familiar with the local situation in
one’s region is one thing, but claiming to compare that situation with what
happens elsewhere in order to draw conclusions or inferences from it is
something else. Although a court has wide latitude as to the sources and types of evidence upon
which to base the sentence to be imposed, it must never lose sight of
the importance of procedural fairness and must bear in mind the importance of the
facts in question and the impact on the offender of how they are dealt with. In this case,
there is no indication that the trial judge was in a position to take judicial
notice of the fact that impaired driving is trivialized in the Beauce region
more than elsewhere. Knowing the impact on sentencing of that factor, which he
considered to be aggravating, and the particular weight he was going to attach
to it in imposing a more severe sanction, he should, in the interest of
procedural fairness, have informed L of his concerns on this point and requested
submissions from him. But he did not do so, even though the importance he
attached to that aggravating factor ultimately led him to impose a sentence
that favoured exemplarity at the expense of proportionality. 

                    Given
that the trial judge overemphasized the objectives of
exemplarity and deterrence while at the same time overlooking the principles of
similarity of sentences and individualization in sentencing, the Court of
Appeal was justified in intervening and reopening the analytical process in
order to determine whether the sentence was just and appropriate. In the name of
deterrence and exemplarity, the trial judge focused on the perceived prevalence
of the crime in the community and disregarded the individual and contextual
factors, which led him to impose a sentence that was excessive in L’s case. In so doing, he disregarded the principle
that sentences should be similar to other sentences imposed in similar
circumstances, which is the corollary of the principle of proportionality. He provided little if any explanation for the sentence of
78 months’ imprisonment that he ultimately imposed on L, despite the fact
that the severity of that sentence is not in any doubt. Although it would also
have been preferable for the Court of Appeal to provide a more thorough
explanation, the 48‑month sentence it imposed is much more consistent
with what can be seen in comparable decisions. Unlike the one imposed by the trial judge, this sentence does not represent a substantial and marked departure from
the sentences imposed on similar offenders who committed similar crimes in
similar circumstances. Rather, it is consistent with the sentences imposed on
offenders with characteristics similar to those of L. Insofar as the Court of
Appeal correctly stated the law before intervening, it is not open to the Court
to substitute its view for that of the Court of Appeal on the sentence.

                    On
the issue of the driving prohibition, the length of the presentence prohibition
is a factor to be considered in analyzing the reasonableness and
appropriateness of the prohibition to be imposed under s. 259(3.3) (b)
of the Criminal Code . In light of the length of the presentence
prohibition in this case, it is appropriate to reduce the length of L’s driving
prohibition to one year and nine months, plus the period of 48 months
to which he was sentenced to imprisonment.

                    Finally,
the Court of Appeal did not make an error warranting intervention when it
declined to admit the fresh evidence of two breaches by L of his
recognizances.  Absent an error of law or a palpable and overriding error of
fact, the Court should not reconsider the weight attached by the Court of
Appeal to those breaches and substitute its view of what would have been
relevant.

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
Sentencing remains one of the most delicate
stages of the criminal justice process in Canada. Although this task is
governed by ss. 718 et seq. of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C‑46 , and although the objectives set out in those sections guide the
courts and are clearly defined, it nonetheless involves, by definition, the
exercise of a broad discretion by the courts in balancing all the relevant
factors in order to meet the objectives being pursued in sentencing. 

[2]                             
For this purpose, the courts have developed
tools over the years to ensure that similar sentences are imposed on similar
offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances — the
principle of parity of sentences — and that sentences are proportionate by
guiding the exercise of that discretion, and to prevent any substantial and
marked disparities in the sentences imposed on offenders for similar crimes
committed in similar circumstances. For example, in Quebec and other provinces,
the courts have adopted a system of sentencing ranges and categories designed
to achieve these objectives.

[3]                             
The credibility of the criminal justice system
in the eyes of the public depends on the fitness of sentences imposed on
offenders. A sentence that is unfit, whether because it is too harsh or too
lenient, could cause the public to question the credibility of the system in
light of its objectives.

[4]                             
One of the main objectives of Canadian criminal
law is the rehabilitation of offenders. Rehabilitation is one of the
fundamental moral values that distinguish Canadian society from the societies
of many other nations in the world, and it helps the courts impose sentences
that are just and appropriate.

[5]                             
In the context of offences such as the ones in
the case at bar, namely impaired driving causing either bodily harm or death,
courts from various parts of the country have held that the objectives of
deterrence and denunciation must be emphasized in order to convey society’s
condemnation: R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at
para. 129; R. v. Lépine, 2007 QCCA 70, at
para. 21 (CanLII); R. v. Brutus, 2009 QCCA 1382, at
para. 18 (CanLII); R. v. Stimson, 2011 ABCA
59, 499 A.R. 185, at para. 21; R. v. McIlwrick, 2008 ABQB 724, 461
A.R. 16, at para. 69; R. v. Junkert, 2010 ONCA 549, 103 O.R. (3d)
284, at paras. 46‑47; R. v. Ruizfuentes, 2010 MBCA 90, 258
Man. R. (2d) 220, at para. 36.

[6]                             
While it is normal for trial judges to consider
sentences other than imprisonment in appropriate cases, in the instant case, as
in all cases in which general or specific deterrence and denunciation must be
emphasized, the courts have very few options other than imprisonment for
meeting these objectives, which are essential to the maintenance of a just,
peaceful and law‑abiding society.

[7]                             
The increase in the minimum and maximum sentences
for impaired driving offences shows that Parliament wanted such offences to be
punished more harshly. Despite countless awareness campaigns conducted over the
years, impaired driving offences still cause more deaths than any other
offences in Canada: House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human
Rights, Ending Alcohol‑Impaired Driving: A Common Approach
(2009), at p. 5. 

[8]                             
This sad situation, which unfortunately
continues to prevail today, was denounced by Cory J. more than
20 years ago:

                        Every year, drunk driving leaves a terrible
trail of death, injury, heartbreak and destruction. From the point of view of
numbers alone, it has a far greater impact on Canadian society than any other
crime. In terms of the deaths and serious injuries resulting in
hospitalization, drunk driving is clearly the crime which causes the most
significant social loss to the country.

(R. v. Bernshaw, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 254, at para. 16)

[9]                             
Such is the backdrop to the main issues in the
case at bar. The appellant is appealing a Quebec Court of Appeal judgment that
reduced from six and a half to four years a term of imprisonment imposed on the
respondent by the trial judge after the respondent had pleaded guilty to two
counts of impaired driving causing death.

[10]                         
This appeal affords this Court, first of all, an
occasion to clarify the standard on the basis of which an appellate court may
intervene and vary a sentence imposed by a trial judge. The Court must
determine, inter alia, the extent to which a deviation from a sentencing
range that is otherwise established and adhered to may justify appellate
intervention. 

[11]                         
This Court has on many occasions noted the
importance of giving wide latitude to sentencing judges. Since they have, inter alia,
the advantage of having heard and seen the witnesses, sentencing judges are in
the best position to determine, having regard to the circumstances, a just and
appropriate sentence that is consistent with the objectives and principles set
out in the Criminal Code  in this regard. The fact that a judge deviates
from the proper sentencing range does not in itself justify appellate
intervention. Ultimately, except where a sentencing judge makes an error of law
or an error in principle that has an impact on the sentence, an appellate court
may not vary the sentence unless it is demonstrably unfit.

[12]                         
In such cases, proportionality is the cardinal
principle that must guide appellate courts in considering the fitness of a
sentence imposed on an offender. The more serious the crime and its
consequences, or the greater the offender’s degree of responsibility, the
heavier the sentence will be. In other words, the severity of a sentence
depends not only on the seriousness of the crime’s consequences, but also on
the moral blameworthiness of the offender. Determining a proportionate sentence
is a delicate task. As I mentioned above, both sentences that are too lenient
and sentences that are too harsh can undermine public confidence in the
administration of justice. Moreover, if appellate courts intervene without deference
to vary sentences that they consider too lenient or too harsh, their
interventions could undermine the credibility of the system and the authority
of trial courts. With respect, I am of the opinion that the Court of Appeal was
wrong in this case to reduce the sentence imposed by the trial judge by basing
its intervention on the fact that he had departed from the established
sentencing range.

[13]                         
Secondly, this appeal also raises the question
whether it is appropriate for a judge to consider the fact that a type of
offence occurs with particular frequency in a given region as a relevant factor
in determining a just and appropriate sentence. In this case, I am of the
opinion that it was open to the trial judge, in balancing the relevant
sentencing factors, to consider the frequency of impaired driving offences in
the district where the crime was committed. Moreover, the Court of Appeal
failed completely to address this question.

[14]                         
Another question raised in this appeal relates
to the length and other terms of the driving prohibition imposed by the trial
judge. In this case, the length of the presentence driving prohibition should
be subtracted from that of the prohibition imposed in the context of the
sentence. In addition, the driving prohibition of four years and seven months
is demonstrably unfit and must be reduced to two years and four months to take
account of the recognizance entered into by the respondent under which he was
to refrain from driving from his release date until his sentencing date (two
years and three months).

[15]                         
Finally, the appeal also concerns the
admissibility of fresh evidence. In this case, the evidence in question was of
two breaches of recognizances the respondent had entered into. The Court of
Appeal found that the fresh evidence was inadmissible. Unlike the Court of
Appeal, I am of the opinion that the evidence was admissible and that it
provided information that was relevant to the determination of a just and
appropriate sentence.

[16]                         
In short, I respectfully find that the Court of
Appeal erred in intervening, without valid grounds, to substitute a sentence it
considered appropriate for the one that had been imposed by the trial judge.
Even though the trial judge had made an error in principle by considering an
element of the offence as an aggravating factor, that error had clearly had no
impact on the sentence, which, moreover, was not demonstrably unfit. In this
sense, the Court of Appeal erred in basing its intervention on the fact that
the sentence fell outside the sentencing range established by the courts, while
disregarding the criteria that are normally applied in the determination of a
just and appropriate sentence. It also failed completely to address the factor
relating to the local situation, that is, to the frequency of the type of
offence at issue, on which the trial judge had relied. For these reasons, the
appeal should be allowed and the sentence of imprisonment imposed by the trial
judge should be restored.

II.          
Background and Judicial History

A.          
Facts

[17]                         
The respondent pleaded guilty to two counts
of alcohol‑impaired driving causing death, an offence under
s. 255(3)  of the Criminal Code . The parties filed a joint statement
of facts. The following facts taken from it are relevant for the purposes of
this appeal.

[18]                         
On June 17, 2011, at about 4:00 a.m.,
Tommy Lacasse, the respondent in this appeal, lost control of his vehicle while
entering a curve on a country road in Sainte‑Aurélie in the Beauce
region. He was speeding, and his ability to drive was impaired by alcohol.
Nadia Pruneau, who was celebrating her 18th birthday that night, and
Caroline Fortier, aged 17, were in the back seat of the vehicle. They both
died instantly. Neither the vehicle’s mechanical condition nor the weather
contributed to the accident. The respondent is entirely responsible for it.

[19]                         
The respondent admitted to having smoked a joint
of cannabis at about 7:00 p.m., after which he had drunk four small beers
between 7:30 p.m. and midnight, another between 1:00 and 2:30 a.m.
and about 100 mL of a lemonade and vodka mixture between 10:30 and
11:00 p.m. The parties agreed that it was the alcohol and not the cannabis
that had impaired the respondent’s ability to drive.

[20]                         
The collision investigation report concluded
that the vehicle had been travelling at 130 km/h, whereas the recommended
speed for taking the curve was 75 km/h. The vehicle skidded more than
60 metres before hitting the bottom of a ditch, lifting off the ground and
rolling over several times.

[21]                         
The respondent did not testify at the sentencing
hearing, although the defence adduced some evidence to show that he had been
deeply distressed during the weeks and months following the accident. The
evidence also showed that he had become suicidal and had said that he wished he
had died instead of the victims.

[22]                         
At the time of the sentencing hearing, the
respondent was 20 years old. He was living with his parents and working as
an autobody repairer in his family’s business. He did not have a criminal
record, although he had been convicted of offences under the Highway Safety
Code, CQLR, c. C‑24.2, including three speeding offences.

B.           
Court of Québec, 2013 QCCQ 11960

[23]                         
In the Court of Québec, the appellant asked for
a sentence of six to eight years’ imprisonment followed by a seven‑year
driving prohibition. The respondent suggested a sentence of no more than three
years’ imprisonment.

[24]                         
Judge Couture began by listing the aggravating
factors: the facts that the respondent had been intoxicated and had smoked
cannabis, the context in which he had been drinking alcohol, the speed at which
he had been driving, his driving record with the Société de l’assurance
automobile du Québec, the number of victims and the impact of the accident on
the victims’ families. He also identified a few mitigating factors, but he
reduced the weight to be attached to them, except as regards the fact that the
presentence report was favourable to the respondent.

[25]                         
More specifically, Judge Couture attached less
weight to the fact that the respondent had pleaded guilty on the ground that he
had done so relatively late, long after he was in a position to make decisions
about the conduct of his trial. Judge Couture also attached less weight to
the fact that the respondent did not have a criminal record, because in his
view, the offence was one that was likely to be committed by people who do not
have criminal records. He relied in this regard on this Court’s decision in Proulx,
at para. 129. He also noted that the respondent had sustained injuries,
but pointed out that this was merely a consequence of the respondent’s own
actions. In addition, Judge Couture reduced the weight attached to the
respondent’s youth.

[26]                         
After reiterating the principle of
proportionality together with the principle of parity of sentences, Judge
Couture stressed the importance of individualizing sentences and the need to
emphasize the objectives of deterrence and denunciation where crimes involving
impaired driving are concerned. He specified that sentencing ranges are only
guidelines, and not hard and fast rules. He added that, in the case of impaired
driving offences, it is the most law‑abiding citizens who must be
targeted in an approach based on deterrence and denunciation.

[27]                         
Furthermore, Judge Couture emphasized the
particular situation in the Beauce region, where approximately one in five
cases involves an impaired driving offence. He even posed the question whether
driving while impaired is trivialized more there than elsewhere. 

[28]                         
In the end, he found that the aggravating
circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances in this case.

[29]                         
For all these reasons, Judge Couture sentenced
the respondent, on each count of impaired driving causing death, to six years
and six months’ imprisonment minus the period of one month the respondent had
spent in pre‑trial detention; the two sentences were to be served concurrently.
He also prohibited the respondent from operating a vehicle for a period of
11 years starting from the sentencing date.

C.           
Quebec Court of Appeal, 2014 QCCA 1061

[30]                         
The Court of Appeal essentially focused its
analysis on the application of the sentencing range outlined in R. v. Comeau,
2008 QCCQ 4804, which it had confirmed in R. v. Paré, 2011 QCCA 2047.
According to that range, which is divided into three categories, sentences are
to be imposed as follows:

(1)   lenient sentences varying between 18 months’ and three years’
imprisonment where the predominant factors favour the accused;

(2)   harsh sentences varying between three and six years’ imprisonment
where the factors of deterrence and denunciation outweigh the personal factors
of the accused;

(3)   very harsh sentences varying between six and nine years’
imprisonment where personal factors are unfavourable to the accused, and even
more severe sentences are possible [translation]
“when circumstances approach the worst‑case situations” (Paré, at
para. 21 (CanLII)).

[31]                         
The Court of Appeal noted that the trial judge
had placed the sentence he imposed at the lower end of the sentences in the
third category, adding that personal factors unfavourable to the accused
are normally what explain a move from the second to the third category. But, it
stated, such factors were almost non‑existent in this case.

[32]                         
The Court of Appeal found that the sentence of
six years and five months was excessive because it departed from the principle
of proportionality. In the court’s opinion, the trial judge should have given
greater consideration to the respondent’s potential for rehabilitation and
placed less emphasis on the objective of making an example of an offender.

[33]                         
The Court of Appeal accordingly replaced the
sentence imposed by the trial judge with one of four years’ imprisonment minus
one month for the period of pre‑trial detention. It also reduced the
length of the driving prohibition to four years commencing at the end of the
respondent’s incarceration.

[34]                         
In addition, the Court of Appeal held that the
fresh evidence the appellant wanted to adduce was inadmissible. The record
showed that the respondent had breached two recognizances with which he had
agreed to comply while awaiting trial. First, he had failed to comply with
the terms of a curfew imposed on him by the court and, second, he had contacted
Maxime Pruneau, the brother of one of the victims, although he was prohibited
from doing so. According to the Court of Appeal, this fresh evidence was
inadmissible because the breaches in question had been punished separately, by
an additional 15 days’ imprisonment. Moreover, they were not indicative of
a risk of the respondent’s reoffending in this case. The Court of Appeal also
held that the fresh evidence in question was unlikely to affect the result of
the appeal, because the disparity between the sentence imposed at trial and the
one that, in the court’s opinion, had to be substituted for it was too great.

III.       
Issues

[35]                         
The appeal raises the following issues:

1.         Was it
open to the Court of Appeal to substitute the sentence it considered
appropriate for the one imposed by the trial judge, primarily on the basis that
the trial judge had deviated from the sentencing range established by the
courts for impaired driving offences?

2.         Was it
open to the trial judge to consider the frequency of impaired driving in the
region where the offence was committed as a relevant sentencing factor? If so,
was it open to the Court of Appeal to disregard this factor in analyzing the
fitness of the sentence?

3.         Were the
length and the other terms of the driving prohibition imposed by the trial
judge appropriate?

4.         Did the
Court of Appeal err in holding that the fresh evidence the appellant wished to
file was inadmissible?

IV.       
Analysis

A.          
Standard for Intervention on an Appeal From a
Sentence

[36]                         
Appellate courts generally play a dual role in
ensuring the consistency, stability and permanence of the case law in both the
criminal and civil law contexts. First, they act as a safeguard against errors
made by trial courts and are thus required to rectify errors of law and review
the reasonableness of the exercise of discretion. They must ensure that trial
courts state the law correctly and apply it uniformly.

[37]                         
Second, appellate courts must ensure the
coherent development of the law while formulating guiding principles to ensure
that it is applied consistently in a given jurisdiction. They must therefore
clarify the law where clarification is necessary or where conflicting decisions
have been rendered: T. Desjardins, L’appel en droit criminel et pénal
(2nd ed. 2012), at p. 1. In Quebec, the Court of Appeal has an
additional responsibility in civil cases, since it ensures the harmonious
interpretation of the distinctive rules of Quebec civil law. 

[38]                         
In the criminal law context, appellate courts play
this dual role in appeals from both verdicts and sentences. In the case of an
appeal from a sentence, the power of an appellate court to substitute a
sentence for the one imposed by the trial judge is provided for in s. 687 
of the Criminal Code :

                          687. (1) Where
an appeal is taken against sentence, the court of appeal shall, unless the
sentence is one fixed by law, consider the fitness of the sentence appealed
against, and may on such evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to
receive,

(a) vary the sentence within
the limits prescribed by law for the offence of which the accused was
convicted; or

(b) dismiss the appeal.

                          (2) A
judgment of a court of appeal that varies the sentence of an accused who was
convicted has the same force and effect as if it were a sentence passed by the
trial court.

[39]                         
This Court has reiterated on many occasions that
appellate courts may not intervene lightly, as trial judges have a broad
discretion to impose the sentence they consider appropriate within the limits
established by law: s. 718.3(1)  of the Criminal Code ; see also R.
v. Shropshire, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, at para. 46; R. v. L.M.,
2008 SCC 31, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163, at para. 14; R. v. L.F.W., 2000
SCC 6, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 132, at para. 25; R. v. Nasogaluak,
2010 SCC 6, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, at paras. 43‑46. 

[40]                         
In this regard, Iacobucci J. explained in Shropshire
that consideration of the fitness of a sentence does not justify an appellate
court taking an interventionist approach on appeal:

                    An
appellate court should not be given free rein to modify a sentencing order
simply because it feels that a different order ought to have been made. The
formulation of a sentencing order is a profoundly subjective process; the trial
judge has the advantage of having seen and heard all of the witnesses whereas
the appellate court can only base itself upon a written record. A variation in
the sentence should only be made if the court of appeal is convinced it is not
fit. That is to say, that it has found the sentence to be clearly unreasonable.
[para. 46]

[41]                         
In Proulx, this Court, per
Lamer C.J., discussed these same principles, which continue to be
relevant:

                        In recent years, this Court has repeatedly
stated that the sentence imposed by a trial court is entitled to considerable
deference from appellate courts: see Shropshire, supra, at
paras. 46‑50; M. (C.A.), supra,
at paras. 89‑94; McDonnell, supra, at paras. 15‑17 (majority); R. v. W. (G.),
[1999] 3 S.C.R. 597, at paras. 18‑19. In M. (C.A.), at
para. 90, I wrote:

                                    Put
simply, absent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or
an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only
intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably
unfit. Parliament explicitly vested sentencing judges with a discretion
to determine the appropriate degree and kind of punishment under the Criminal
Code . [First emphasis added; second emphasis in original.]

. . .

                        Although
an appellate court might entertain a different opinion as to what objectives
should be pursued and the best way to do so, that difference will generally not
constitute an error of law justifying interference. Further, minor errors in
the sequence of application of s. 742.1 may not warrant intervention by
appellate courts. Again, I stress that appellate courts should not second‑guess
sentencing judges unless the sentence imposed is demonstrably unfit.
[paras. 123 and 125]

These principles have
since been reiterated in L.M. and Nasogaluak.

[42]                         
My colleague states that a sentence may be unfit
if there is a reviewable error in the thought process or reasoning on which it
is based (para. 140). For this reason, in his view, where there is a
reviewable error in the trial judge’s reasoning, for example where the judge
has characterized an element of the offence as an aggravating factor
(para. 146), it is always open to an appellate court to intervene to
assess the fitness of the sentence imposed by the trial judge. Having done so,
the court can then affirm that sentence if it considers the sentence to be fit,
or impose the sentence it considers appropriate without having to show
deference (paras. 139 and 142). In other words, any error of law or error
in principle in a trial judge’s analysis will open the door to intervention by
an appellate court, which can then substitute its own opinion for that of the
trial judge. 

[43]                         
With all due respect for my colleague, I am of
the view that his comments on this point need to be qualified. I agree that an
error in principle, the failure to consider a relevant factor or the erroneous
consideration of an aggravating or mitigating factor can justify the
intervention of an appellate court and permit that court to inquire into the
fitness of the sentence and replace it with the sentence it considers
appropriate. However, in my opinion, every such error will not necessarily
justify appellate intervention regardless of its impact on the trial judge’s
reasoning. If the rule were that strict, its application could undermine the
discretion conferred on sentencing judges. It is therefore necessary to avoid a
situation in which [translation]
“the term ‘error in principle’ is trivialized”: R. v. Lévesque‑Chaput,
2010 QCCA 640, at para. 31 (CanLII).

[44]                         
In my view, an error in principle, the failure
to consider a relevant factor or the erroneous consideration of an aggravating
or mitigating factor will justify appellate intervention only where it appears
from the trial judge’s decision that such an error had an impact on the
sentence. 

[45]                         
For example, in R. v. Gavin, 2009 QCCA 1,
the Quebec Court of Appeal found, first, that the trial judge had erred in
considering a lack of remorse and the manner in which the defence had been
conducted as aggravating circumstances (para. 29 (CanLII)). However, it
then considered the impact of that error on the sentence and stated the
following, at para. 35 :

                        [translation]  I find that the lack of
remorse was a secondary factor in the trial judge’s assessment. This is apparent
in the wording of the judgment. The judge referred to and considered all of the
relevant sentencing factors, and the issue of lack of remorse was nothing more
than incidental. . . . Consequently, unless the Court finds that
the sentence imposed was harsher because the judge erroneously determined that
the defence’s conduct (as in R. v. Beauchamp, supra) and the lack
of remorse were aggravating circumstances, this error in principle had no real
effect on the sentence. Essentially, therefore, our task now is to ensure that
the sentence is not clearly unreasonable . . . .

Thus, the Court of
Appeal, finding that the error in principle made by the trial judge was not
determinative and had had no effect on the sentence, rightly concluded that the
error in question could not on its own justify the court’s intervention. This
ultimately led the court to inquire into whether the sentence was clearly
unreasonable having regard to the circumstances.

[46]                         
The Quebec Court of Appeal also adopted this
reasoning in R. v. Sidhu, 2009 QCCA 2441. As in Gavin, the trial
judge had considered lack of remorse as an aggravating factor (para. 23
(CanLII)), but the Court of Appeal found that this error was not determinative
and had had no effect on the sentence (para. 24). Since the sentence the
judge imposed would not have been different had there been no mistake in that
respect (para. 26), the error was not reviewable (para. 55). Thus,
rather than simply substituting its opinion for that of the trial judge because
he had made an error in principle, the Court of Appeal limited itself to
considering whether, independently of that error, the sentence was unreasonable
or demonstrably unfit. On finding that that was not the case, it decided not to
intervene (para. 55).

[47]                         
On this issue, the impact of two decisions cited
by my colleague in support of his opinion that any error of law or error in
principle justifies the intervention of a court of appeal needs to be clarified
and qualified. In R. v. Flight, 2014 ABCA 380, 584 A.R. 392, the
Alberta Court of Appeal found that the trial judge had erred in considering the
consumption of alcohol and the death of a victim as aggravating circumstances
where the accused was charged with impaired driving causing death
(para. 4). The Court of Appeal therefore intervened to substitute its own
opinion for that of the trial judge on the ground that the judge had erred in
principle. However, the court explained that it was difficult to determine what
weight the trial judge had given to the aggravating factors at issue in her
judgment (para. 5). And in Stimson, the Alberta Court of Appeal
identified at least four errors in principle in the trial judge’s reasons,
and there was no doubt that they had affected his analysis (paras. 20‑27).
The Court of Appeal’s intervention was therefore clearly warranted. 

[48]                         
The reminder given by this Court about showing
deference to a trial judge’s exercise of discretion is readily understandable.
First, the trial judge has the advantage of having observed the witnesses in
the course of the trial and having heard the parties’ sentencing submissions.
Second, the sentencing judge is usually familiar with the circumstances in the
district where he or she sits and therefore with the particular needs of the
community in which the crime was committed: R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996]
1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 91. Finally, as Doherty J.A. noted in R. v.
Ramage, 2010 ONCA 488, 257 C.C.C. (3d) 261, the appropriate use of judicial
resources is a consideration that must never be overlooked:

                    Appellate
repetition of the exercise of judicial discretion by the trial judge, without
any reason to think that the second effort will improve upon the results of the
first, is a misuse of judicial resources. The exercise also delays the final
resolution of the criminal process, without any countervailing benefit to the
process. [para. 70]

[49]                         
For the same reasons, an appellate court may not
intervene simply because it would have weighed the relevant factors
differently. In Nasogaluak, LeBel J. referred to R. v. McKnight
(1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 41 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 35, in this
regard:

                    To
suggest that a trial judge commits an error in principle because in an
appellate court’s opinion the trial judge gave too much weight to one relevant
factor or not enough weight to another is to abandon deference altogether. The
weighing of relevant factors, the balancing process is what the exercise of
discretion is all about. To maintain deference to the trial judge’s exercise of
discretion, the weighing or balancing of relevant factors must be assessed
against the reasonableness standard of review. Only if by emphasizing one
factor or by not giving enough weight to another, the trial judge exercises his
or her discretion unreasonably should an appellate court interfere with the
sentence on the ground the trial judge erred in principle. [para. 46]

[50]                         
The Quebec Court of Appeal commented to the same
effect in Lévesque‑Chaput, at para. 31:

                    [translation]  There is no doubt that he
focused on the mitigating circumstances, overemphasizing them in the
appellant’s opinion, but that balancing exercise was within his jurisdiction
and the reasons he gave make it easy to follow his reasoning.

[51]                         
Furthermore, the choice of sentencing range or
of a category within a range falls within the trial judge’s discretion and
cannot in itself constitute a reviewable error. An appellate court may not
therefore intervene on the ground that it would have put the sentence in a different
range or category. It may intervene only if the sentence the trial judge
imposed is demonstrably unfit.

[52]                         
It is possible for a sentence to be demonstrably
unfit even if the judge has made no error in imposing it. As Laskin J.A.
mentioned, writing for the Ontario Court of Appeal, the courts have used a
variety of expressions to describe a sentence that is “demonstrably unfit”:
“clearly unreasonable”, “clearly or manifestly excessive”, “clearly excessive
or inadequate”, or representing a “substantial and marked departure” (R. v.
Rezaie (1996), 31 O.R. (3d) 713 (C.A.), at p. 720). All these
expressions reflect the very high threshold that applies to appellate courts
when determining whether they should intervene after reviewing the fitness of a
sentence.

[53]                         
This inquiry must be focused on the fundamental
principle of proportionality stated in s. 718.1  of the Criminal Code ,
which provides that a sentence must be “proportionate to the gravity of the
offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender”. A sentence will
therefore be demonstrably unfit if it constitutes an unreasonable departure
from this principle. Proportionality is determined both on an individual basis,
that is, in relation to the accused him or herself and to the offence committed
by the accused, and by comparison with sentences imposed for similar offences
committed in similar circumstances. Individualization and parity of sentences
must be reconciled for a sentence to be proportionate: s. 718.2 (a)
and (b) of the Criminal Code .

[54]                         
The determination of whether a sentence is fit
also requires that the sentencing objectives set out in s. 718  of the Criminal
Code  and the other sentencing principles set out in s. 718.2  be taken
into account. Once again, however, it is up to the trial judge to properly
weigh these various principles and objectives, whose relative importance will
necessarily vary with the nature of the crime and the circumstances in which it
was committed. The principle of parity of sentences, on which the Court of
Appeal relied, is secondary to the fundamental principle of proportionality.
This Court explained this as follows in M. (C.A.): 

                    It
has been repeatedly stressed that there is no such thing as a uniform sentence
for a particular crime. . . . Sentencing is an inherently individualized
process, and the search for a single appropriate sentence for a similar
offender and a similar crime will frequently be a fruitless exercise of
academic abstraction. [para. 92] 

[55]                         
This principle of parity of sentences also means
that the deference owed to the sentencing judge must be shown except in the
circumstances mentioned above. The Court said the following in this regard in L.M.:

                        This
exercise of ensuring that sentences are similar could not be given priority
over the principle of deference to the trial judge’s exercise of discretion,
since the sentence was not vitiated by an error in principle and the trial
judge had not imposed a sentence that was clearly unreasonable by failing to
give adequate consideration to certain factors or by improperly assessing the
evidence (M. (C.A.), at para. 92, quoted in McDonnell,
at para. 16; W. (G.), at para. 19; see also Ferris, at
p. 149, and Manson, at p. 93). [para. 35]

B.           
Sentencing Ranges

[56]                         
The principle of parity of sentences has
sometimes resulted in the adoption of a system of sentencing ranges and
categories. This concern for parity in sentencing did not originate with the
codification of the principle in 1996. As early as the 19th century, “tariffs”
were being used by the English courts: D. A. Thomas, Principles of
Sentencing (2nd ed. 1979), at p. 29. The tariffs
synthesized, as it were, the relevant principles applicable to each type of
crime in order to standardize sentencing for it:

                             While in certain contexts the Court
articulates a principle, or series of principles, in a systematic manner, it is
frequently necessary to identify the operative principles from the examination
of a considerable number of cases, none of which specifically identifies the
relevant criteria, but which, when viewed collectively, clearly conform
substantially to a pattern which can be described. This is particularly true of
what is conventionally known as “the tariff”, the principles governing the
lengths of sentences of imprisonment.

(Thomas, at p. 5)

[57]                         
Tariffs differ from sentencing ranges in that
tariff‑based sentencing is theoretically the opposite of sentence
individualization, which the ranges allow: Thomas, at p. 8. On the other
hand, the principle underlying the two approaches is the same: ensuring that
offenders who have committed similar crimes in similar circumstances are given
similar sentences. The same is true of the starting‑point approach, which
is used mainly in Alberta but sometimes also in other Canadian provinces: R.
v. McDonnell, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, at para. 69. Ultimately, whatever
mechanism or terminology is used, the principle on which it is based remains
the same. Where sentencing ranges are concerned, although they are used mainly
to ensure the parity of sentences, they reflect all the principles and objectives
of sentencing. Sentencing ranges are nothing more than summaries of the minimum
and maximum sentences imposed in the past, which serve in any given case as
guides for the application of all the relevant principles and objectives.
However, they should not be considered “averages”, let alone straitjackets, but
should instead be seen as historical portraits for the use of sentencing
judges, who must still exercise their discretion in each case:

                    Even when an appellate court has established a
range, it may be that a fact pattern will arise, which is sufficiently
dissimilar to past decisions that the “range”, as it were, must be expanded.
The fundamental point is that a “range” is not a straitjacket to the exercise
of discretion of a sentencing judge.

(R. v. Keepness, 2010 SKCA 69, 359 Sask. R. 34, at
para. 24)

[58]                         
There will always be situations that call for a
sentence outside a particular range: although ensuring parity in sentencing is
in itself a desirable objective, the fact that each crime is committed in
unique circumstances by an offender with a unique profile cannot be
disregarded. The determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a highly
individualized exercise that goes beyond a purely mathematical calculation. It
involves a variety of factors that are difficult to define with precision. This
is why it may happen that a sentence that, on its face, falls outside a
particular range, and that may never have been imposed in the past for a
similar crime, is not demonstrably unfit. Once again, everything depends on the
gravity of the offence, the offender’s degree of responsibility and the
specific circumstances of each case. LeBel J. commented as follows on this
subject:

                    A judge can order a sentence outside that range
as long as it is in accordance with the principles and objectives of
sentencing. Thus, a sentence falling outside the regular range of appropriate
sentences is not necessarily unfit. Regard must be had to all the circumstances
of the offence and the offender, and to the needs of the community in which the
offence occurred.

(Nasogaluak, at para. 44)

[59]                         
In Brutus, the Quebec Court of Appeal
described the limits of the process of ensuring the similarity of sentences as
follows:

                        [translation]  There is no doubt that the
sentence imposed in this case differs from certain sentences imposed in other
cases for the same offence. However, as our colleague Rochon J.A. stated
in Ferland v. R, 2009 QCCA 1168, with respect to the principle of parity
of sentences that is set out in section 718.2 (b) Cr.C., it “has
some limits because of the individualized nature of the sentencing process” and
cannot provide a basis for departing from the principle of deference to the
trial judge’s exercise of his or her sentencing discretion (R. v. L.M., supra,
at para. 35). [para. 12]

[60]                         
In other words, sentencing ranges are primarily
guidelines, and not hard and fast rules: Nasogaluak, at para. 44.
As a result, a deviation from a sentencing range is not synonymous with an error
of law or an error in principle. Sopinka J. stated this clearly in McDonnell, although
he was referring in that case to categories of assault:

                        . . .
in my view it can never be an error in principle in itself to fail to place a
particular offence within a judicially created category of assault for the
purposes of sentencing. . . . If the categories are defined
narrowly, and deviations from the categorization are generally reversed, the
discretion that should be left in the hands of the trial and sentencing judges
is shifted considerably to the appellate courts. [para. 32]

[61]                         
Any other conclusion would have the effect of
authorizing appellate courts to create categories of offences with no real
justification and accordingly intervene without deference to substitute a
sentence on appeal. But the power to create categories of offences lies
with Parliament, not the courts: McDonnell, at para. 33.

[62]                         
It should also be noted that Parliament has
regularly raised the level of the minimum and maximum sentences applicable to
impaired driving offences. For example, in 2000, the maximum sentence for the
crime of impaired driving causing death was raised from 14 years to
imprisonment for life: An Act to amend the Criminal Code (impaired driving
causing death and other matters), S.C. 2000, c. 25. 

[63]                         
Similarly, in 2008, the minimum sentences for
all crimes related to impaired driving were increased to $1,000 for a first
offence, imprisonment for 30 days for a second offence and
imprisonment for 120 days for any subsequent offence: Tackling Violent
Crime Act, S.C. 2008, c. 6. 

[64]                         
The sentences imposed for such crimes in Quebec
have also changed. For example, before 2009, the terms of imprisonment imposed
for impaired driving causing death varied from one to 10 years: R. v.
Verreault, 2008 QCCA 2284, at para. 25 (CanLII); R. v. Morneau,
2009 QCCA 1496, at para. 21 (CanLII). Since Comeau, however, the
Quebec courts have used a new sentencing range divided into
three categories. As I mentioned above, the Court of Appeal held in Paré
that it was appropriate for the courts to use that range. 

[65]                         
The appellant correctly observes that Quebec is
the only province in which the courts have subdivided the sentencing range into
categories for the crime of impaired driving causing death. Other provinces
have also adopted the range system, but without subdividing the ranges into
categories. In those provinces, sentences vary from 18 months to two years in
the least serious situations and from seven to eight years in the most serious:
R. v. Bear, 2008 SKCA 172, 320 Sask. R. 12, at para. 59; R.
v. Berner, 2013 BCCA 188, 297 C.C.C. (3d) 69, at para. 37; R. v.
Smith, 2013 BCCA 173, 296 C.C.C. (3d) 386, at para. 60; Stimson,
at para. 18; Ruizfuentes, at para. 22. 

[66]                         
The Ontario Court of Appeal has refused to
define a sentencing range for the crime of impaired driving causing death,
noting that the crime can be committed in an infinite variety of circumstances:
Junkert, at para. 40; R. v. Kummer, 2011 ONCA 39, 103 O.R.
(3d) 641. This is why there is so much variation in the ranges and why
penitentiary sentences much longer than six and a half years have been reported
almost everywhere in Canada.

[67]                         
Like the range itself, the categories it
comprises are tools whose purpose is in part to promote parity in sentencing.
However, a deviation from such a range or category is not an error in principle
and cannot in itself automatically justify appellate intervention unless the
sentence that is imposed departs significantly and for no reason from the
contemplated sentences. Absent an error in principle, an appellate court may
not vary a sentence unless the sentence is demonstrably unfit. 

[68]                         
My colleague finds that the Court of Appeal’s
reasons, read as a whole, show that it did not intervene solely because of a
deviation from the sentencing range (para. 144). With respect, I cannot
agree with this interpretation. As can be seen from the Court of Appeal’s
reasons, it justified its intervention on the basis that it was not open to the
trial judge to impose a sentence falling into the third category of the
sentencing range, because personal factors unfavourable to the respondent,
which would normally support such a sentence rather than one from the second
category, were almost non‑existent in this case. It is clear from the
Court of Appeal’s reasons that it based its intervention primarily on an
erroneous determination of the applicable sentencing category by the trial
judge. 

[69]                         
I believe that the Court of Appeal was wrong to
apply the sentencing range rigidly. By saying that the sentence should have
been in the second category rather than at the lower end of the sentences in
the third category, the Court of Appeal substituted its own assessment for that
of the trial judge without first determining that the sentence in question was
demonstrably unfit. In doing so, the Court of Appeal erred in applying the
sentencing range mechanism as if it were a straitjacket. The sentencing ranges
must in all cases remain only one tool among others that are intended to aid
trial judges in their work.

[70]                         
In this case, even though the sentence fell
outside one of the categories of sentences that have been established since Comeau,
this did not mean that it was manifestly excessive. Terms of imprisonment of
six years or more have in fact been imposed on people without criminal records
who were convicted of impaired driving causing death. For example, in Kummer,
the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld an eight‑year prison sentence imposed
on a driver with no criminal record who had caused the deaths of three people
while driving under the influence of alcohol. In R. v. Wood (2005), 196
C.C.C. (3d) 155, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a nine‑year sentence
imposed on a person who had no criminal record for impaired driving but had
caused the deaths of three people and caused permanent injuries to another. In Morneau,
the Quebec Court of Appeal upheld a six‑year term of imprisonment on a
charge of impaired driving causing the death of one person. Although the
offender in that case already had a criminal record consisting of three
convictions, the convictions all dated back more than 10 years. In light of the
foregoing, therefore, the sentence of six and a half years imposed in the
instant case on an offender who caused the deaths of two young girls was not
disproportionate.

[71]                         
Moreover, by justifying its intervention on the
basis of the trial judge’s failure to adhere to the categories of sentences,
the Court of Appeal was acknowledging that a six‑year sentence was one of
the possible results in this case. The six‑month difference between the
sentence imposed by the trial judge and the one the Court of Appeal believed
should have been imposed on the basis of the category of sentences it chose
does not constitute a marked departure that would have authorized it to
intervene. In addition, although the sentence imposed at trial departs somewhat
from the sentences applicable to the category the Court of Appeal considered
the most appropriate, it falls within the overall range established by the
Quebec courts, and lies clearly within the range of sentences imposed elsewhere
in the country for similar offences.

[72]                         
In sum, the sentence imposed by Judge Couture is
consistent with the sentencing objectives and principles set out in the Criminal
Code . Judge Couture properly emphasized the importance of deterrence and
denunciation in this case, but he did not overlook the objective of
rehabilitation (para. 92 (CanLII)). Indeed, the Court of Appeal
acknowledged that [translation]
“[t]he trial judge gave extensive reasons for the judgment to which the motion
relates, and it is clear that he very carefully weighed the sentencing
objectives and principles set out in sections 718  to 718.2  of the Criminal
Code ” (para. 5 (CanLII)). Because Judge Couture did not make a
reviewable error in his judgment, and because the sentence he imposed was not
demonstrably unfit, it was not open to the Court of Appeal to intervene and
substitute its own assessment for his. The Court of Appeal nevertheless reduced
the sentence imposed at trial, which was indeed severe, without taking account
of the principle that deterrence and denunciation must be emphasized in such
cases. In reducing the sentence imposed by Judge Couture on the basis that it
departed from the principle of proportionality, the Court of Appeal also
disregarded the local reality, thereby itself departing from the objectives of
deterrence and denunciation.

C.           
Deterrence and Denunciation

[73]                         
While it is true that the objectives of
deterrence and denunciation apply in most cases, they are particularly relevant
to offences that might be committed by ordinarily law‑abiding people. It
is such people, more than chronic offenders, who will be sensitive to harsh
sentences. Impaired driving offences are an obvious example of this type of
offence, as this Court noted in Proulx:

                    .
. . dangerous driving and impaired driving may be offences for which harsh
sentences plausibly provide general deterrence. These crimes are often
committed by otherwise law‑abiding persons, with good employment records
and families. Arguably, such persons are the ones most likely to be deterred by
the threat of severe penalties: see R. v. McVeigh (1985), 22 C.C.C. (3d)
145 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 150; R. v. Biancofiore (1997), 119 C.C.C.
(3d) 344 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 18‑24; R. v. Blakeley
(1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 541 (C.A.), at pp. 542‑43. [para. 129]

[74]                         
As I mentioned in the introduction, courts from
various parts of the country have adhered to the principle that the objectives
of deterrence and denunciation must be emphasized in imposing sentences for
this type of offence. For example, the Quebec Court of Appeal made the following comments in Lépine:

                        [translation] 
Sentences imposed for crimes involving dangerous operation of a motor vehicle
while under the influence of alcohol must be aimed at deterring the public
generally from driving in that manner. This Court has therefore upheld
significant custodial sentences for such offences: R. v. Kelly, J.E. 97‑1570
(C.A.).

                        Very often, the objective gravity of such
crimes is based more on their consequences and the extent of those consequences
than on consciousness of guilt, which is why Parliament has increased the
maximum sentences on the basis of the consequences of the operation of the
vehicle.

                        A
loss of human life caused by the operation of a vehicle while impaired is a
consequence that cannot be remedied, which is why it is important for the
courts to convey a message of denunciation to those who put themselves in
potentially dangerous situations, even if the offender does not have a criminal
record and did not wish to cause the tragic accident. [paras. 19‑21]

[75]                         
Along the same lines, the Quebec Court of Appeal
said the following in Brutus: 

                        [translation] In closing, it should be
borne in mind that the courts have long been sharply critical in discussing the
commission of driving offences of this nature and have asserted that the
objectives of denunciation and deterrence must be emphasized in order to convey
their wish to give expression to society’s condemnation of such crimes by means
of exemplary sentences, particularly in cases (like this one) involving serious
consequences for the victims. Society’s condemnation may be reflected in longer
terms of imprisonment, which have a deterrent effect both on the offender and
on all those who might be tempted to imitate the offender. The sentence imposed
in this case is not unreasonable in light of this objective, nor is it
unreasonable in light of all the circumstances of the case. [para. 18]

[76]                         
The Quebec Court of Appeal was right to note the
importance of the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. With respect,
however, it erred in the instant case in departing from those objectives and
intervening.

[77]                         
My colleague is of the opinion that
Judge Couture overemphasized the objective of deterrence (para. 145).
He also maintains that Judge Couture made several errors of law by considering
aggravating factors that were not really aggravating factors and by failing to
consider some important mitigating factors, such as the respondent’s youth and
the facts that he had expressed remorse, that he had no criminal record and
that the presentence report was favourable to him (ibid.). For these
reasons, my colleague “believe[s] the Court of Appeal was justified in
intervening and reopening the analytical process in order to determine whether
the sentence was just and appropriate” (para. 164). 

[78]                         
Here again, I find that my colleague’s comments
need to be qualified. Judge Couture did not fail to consider the
mitigating factors in question (para. 33), but instead attached less
weight to them because of the nature of the offence at issue, as the respondent
himself acknowledges (at para. 29 of his factum). In short, what is being
criticized is the weight the trial judge attached to those factors. As I
mentioned above, however, determining the weight to be given to aggravating or
mitigating circumstances falls strictly within the sentencing judge’s
discretion. The decision to weigh such factors in a given way is not in itself
an error that opens the door to appellate intervention unless the weighing is
unreasonable. 

[79]                         
This being said, the trial judge was justified
in attaching less weight to the mitigating factors in this case. Although an
offender’s youth is often an important mitigating factor to consider, it should
be noted that it is young people who are affected the most by motor vehicle
accidents that result from impaired driving. In light of the importance that
must be attributed to the objectives of deterrence and denunciation in such
cases as well as the dire consequences of the accident in the instant case, for
which the respondent is entirely responsible, the trial judge was right to
reduce the weight attached to his youth as a mitigating factor. 

[80]                         
As to the fact that the respondent did not have
a criminal record, Judge Couture was right to point out that his driving
record was not clean. He had been convicted three times for speeding. This
showed that he was irresponsible when behind the wheel, and his convictions
under the Highway Safety Code were all the more relevant given that
speeding had played a part in the accident in this case. The respondent
repeatedly and frequently drove irresponsibly. 

[81]                         
The trial judge was also right to attach less
weight to the remorse expressed by the respondent and to his guilty plea
because of the lateness of that plea. A plea entered at the last minute before
the trial is not deserving of as much consideration as one that was entered
promptly: R. v. O. (C.), 2008 ONCA 518, 91 O.R. (3d) 528, at
paras. 16‑17; R. v. Wright, 2013 ABCA 428, 566 A.R. 192, at
para. 12. 

[82]                         
I would also point out that the trial judge
considered the presentence report, which was favourable to the respondent, as
well as the latter’s prospects for rehabilitation. At para. 92 of his
judgment, he stated that [translation]
“[t]he objective of separation implies that the sentence should not be so long
as to hamper the rehabilitation of the accused.” However, for the reasons given
above, the trial judge cannot be criticized for having discounted this factor. 

[83]                         
My colleague is also of the opinion that Judge
Couture erred in identifying certain elements of the offence, including the
fact that the respondent was intoxicated, as aggravating factors
(para. 146) and that this constitutes a reviewable error warranting the
intervention of the Court of Appeal. As I mentioned above, however, the
erroneous consideration of an aggravating or mitigating factor warrants
appellate intervention only if it can be seen from the trial judge’s decision
that the error had an actual impact on the sentence. In the instant case, I
agree with my colleague that the fact that the accused was intoxicated should
not have been mentioned as an aggravating factor, since being intoxicated is
one of the elements of the offence. However, this is a non‑determinative
error that did not unduly affect the sentence, given that Judge Couture
identified other aggravating factors (para. 32). Unlike the situation in Flight,
in which it was difficult to determine what weight the judge had attached to
what she had erroneously identified as an aggravating factor, it is apparent
from the decision of Judge Couture in the instant case that he attached no real
weight to this factor in his judgment; rather, he simply included it in the
list of aggravating factors. 

[84]                         
Incidentally, I note that this enumeration of
aggravating factors also includes the fact that the respondent had consumed
cannabis. I agree with Judge Couture that even if the consumption of
cannabis played no role in the accident, it is nevertheless evidence of the
respondent’s irresponsibility.

[85]                         
My colleague also states that “the impact on
those close to the accused cannot be considered an aggravating factor that
would justify a harsher sentence for the accused” (para. 147). He cites
s. 718.2  of the Criminal Code  in support of this assertion. But the
list of aggravating factors in that section is not exhaustive. Also, this
factor, like that of intoxication, played a secondary role in the determination
of the sentence. Moreover, contrary to the respondent’s contention, the impact
on those close to the victim can be an aggravating factor: R. v. J.B.,
2015 QCCQ 1884, at para. 59 (CanLII); R. v. Tang, 2010 QCCS
5009, at para. 23 (CanLII). 

[86]                         
In any event, the Court of Appeal justified its
decision not on the basis of these supposed errors by the trial judge but,
rather, by finding that the judge had departed from the sentencing range
established by the courts for impaired driving offences and that the sentence
he had imposed departed from the principle of proportionality. In short, the
arguments to the effect that the trial judge made errors in respect of the
mitigating and aggravating factors must fail.

D.          
Local Situation

[87]                         
In conducting his sentencing analysis, the trial
judge also referred to the [translation]
“local situation” factor (para. 73) and stressed the need to convey a strong
message of general deterrence and denunciation. The Court of Appeal completely
overlooked this in its decision. With all due respect, I find that in so doing,
the Court of Appeal made another error.

[88]                         
I note in this regard that the respondent
submits that the trial judge erred in considering the particular situation in
the Beauce region with regard to impaired driving offences. In my view, the
respondent is wrong.

[89]                         
Even though the Criminal Code  applies
everywhere in the country, local characteristics in a given region may explain
certain differences in the sentences imposed on offenders by the courts. The
frequency of a type of offence in a particular region can certainly be a
relevant factor for a sentencing judge. In M. (C.A.),
Lamer C.J. stated the following:

                    The
determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a delicate art which
attempts to balance carefully the societal goals of sentencing against the
moral blameworthiness of the offender and the circumstances of the offence, while
at all times taking into account the needs and current conditions of and in the
community. [Emphasis added; para. 91.]

He then added the
following in the next paragraph:

                    As
well, sentences for a particular offence should be expected to vary to some
degree across various communities and regions in this country, as the “just and
appropriate” mix of accepted sentencing goals will depend on the needs and
current conditions of and in the particular community where the crime occurred.
[para. 92]

[90]                         
Although the fact that a type of crime occurs
frequently in a particular region is not in itself an aggravating factor, there
may be circumstances in which a judge might nonetheless consider such a fact in
balancing the various sentencing objectives, including the need to denounce the
unlawful conduct in question in that place and at the same time to deter anyone
else from doing the same thing. It goes without saying, however, that the
consideration of this factor must not lead to a sentence that is demonstrably
unfit.

[91]                         
The Quebec Court of Appeal has played an
important role in the development of the Canadian case law on this subject. For
example, in R. v. Valiquette, 2004 CanLII 20126, at paras. 48‑50,
it affirmed the decision of the trial judge, who had considered an upsurge in
crimes involving the production of drugs in the Joliette district in order to
emphasize the objectives of denunciation and general deterrence in the
determination of a just and reasonable sentence.

[92]                         
Similarly, the Quebec Court of Appeal found in R.
v. Nguyen, 2007 QCCA 1500, at para. 7 (CanLII), that, in
determining the sentence, the trial judge had been right to take into account
the fact that there had been a large number of offences involving the
cultivation of cannabis in certain parts of the Basses‑Laurentides
region, as well as the existence of a well‑developed narcotics
trafficking network there. In the Court of Appeal’s view, the trial judge had
not therefore been wrong to impose a sentence that would be harsh enough to
deter individuals who might be tempted by the lure of gain to commit such
offences.

[93]                         
Other Canadian courts of appeal have also
referred to the principle that the local situation may be one of the relevant
factors to consider in determining a just and appropriate sentence: R. v.
Morrissette (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 307 (Sask. C.A.), at p. 310; R.
v. Laurila, 2010 BCCA 535, 296 B.C.A.C. 139, at para. 6; R. v.
Woghiren, 2004 CanLII 46649 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 3.

[94]                         
It is true that considerations of procedural
fairness will generally require that a judge who intends to attach weight to
the local reality and to the frequency of a crime in a given region offer the
parties an opportunity to make representations on the subject. However, this
was not an issue in the case at bar, given that the local reality was not in
dispute. The record shows that the point about the local reality was raised by
the appellant in argument in a timely fashion and that the respondent therefore
had all the information he needed in deciding to say nothing in this regard:
transcript from September 14, 2013, A.R., vol. II, at p. 91. 

[95]                         
In any event, I am of the view that it was open
to Judge Couture to take judicial notice of the evil represented by the
large number of offences related to drinking and driving that are committed in
the Beauce district. Judge Couture was the resident judge in that
district. He was therefore in a position to observe and assess the magnitude of
the problem in his region, especially given that it is well established in our
law that judges can take judicial notice of the contexts in which they perform
the duties of their offices: R. v. Z.Z., 2013 QCCA 1498, at
para. 68 (CanLII); R. v. Hernandez, 2009 BCCA 546, 277
B.C.A.C. 120, at para. 29. This Court stated in R. v. MacDougall,
[1998] 3 S.C.R. 45, at para. 63, per McLachlin J., that trial judges
and provincial courts of appeal are in the best position to know the particular
circumstances in their jurisdictions. In the case at bar, the frequency of
impaired driving offences is something that can be determined objectively by
consulting the court rolls. In short, it is public information that is known
and uncontroversial, and the local reality was not in dispute in the instant
case.

[96]                         
In the circumstances, requiring the preparation
and filing of additional evidence to establish that prosecutions for impaired
driving offences were regularly on the penal or criminal roll in the Beauce
district is in my opinion pointless. It is the trial judge who is in the best
position to know the nature of the cases before his or her court.

[97]                         
My colleague agrees that, in the circumstances,
Judge Couture cannot be criticized for the comments he made on the situation in
his region in referring (at para. 72) to [translation]
“this scourge” in his district. Having said this, my colleague states that
Judge Couture was not in a position to take judicial notice of the fact that
impaired driving is trivialized in the Beauce region more than elsewhere in
Quebec. Yet that is not what Judge Couture did. Rather, he merely asked out
loud whether, given the large number of criminal charges involving impaired
driving that have been laid in the Beauce district, driving in such a state is
trivialized there more than elsewhere.

[98]                         
In any case, it would have been open to the
trial judge, as the resident judge in the Beauce district and one who was
required to sit in other judicial districts, to compare the hearing rolls in
the Beauce district with the rolls of other districts had he in fact done so.
In R. v. Dumais, 2010 QCCA 1030, at para. 7 (CanLII), the
Quebec Court of Appeal affirmed the sentence that had been imposed by the trial
judge, which was based, in part, on his having taken judicial notice of a
scourge of drug trafficking in the Baie‑Comeau area. Even though the
trial judge did not reside in Baie‑Comeau, he was familiar with the
community, where he sat regularly and where he had previously presided over a
trial concerning a major drug trafficking network that had taken several weeks
to complete. 

[99]                         
At any rate, I am of the opinion that the mere
fact that the trial judge found that impaired driving is a scourge in the
Beauce district was in itself sufficient for him to consider this factor in
determining what would be a just and appropriate sentence. 

[100]                     
The case law of the Quebec Court of Appeal
supports this conclusion. For example, in Valiquette, that court found
that it had been open to the trial judge to consider an upsurge in crimes
involving the production of narcotics in the Joliette district as a relevant
factor in the sentencing process. It did not require the trial judge to
compare the local situation with the situation elsewhere before emphasizing the
objectives of general deterrence and denunciation, as it merely stated that [translation] “the judge [had] not
err[ed] in taking the local situation and the upsurge in this type of crime in
the Joliette area into account”: Valiquette, at para. 48. 

[101]                     
And in a recent case, R. v. St‑Germain,
2015 QCCA 1108, at paras. 38 and 47 (CanLII), the Quebec Court of Appeal
affirmed a decision in which the trial judge had emphasized the objectives of
deterrence and denunciation because of the upsurge in crimes involving the
production of drugs in the Joliette district. No comparative analysis was
necessary, nor was one required by the Court of Appeal, in support of that
conclusion. 

[102]                     
Moreover, the fact that trial judges normally
preside in or near the communities that have borne the consequences of the
crimes in question is one of the factors in support of deferring to their
sentencing decisions, and it is not necessary for them to have knowledge of the
situations in other judicial districts. They are accordingly aware of the
frequency of various offences in their communities, and for that reason in
particular, they are in the best position to determine what weight to attach to
this and [translation] “to
properly assess the particular combination of sentencing objectives that is
just and appropriate for the protection of [the] community”: R. v. Pelletier,
2008 QCCA 1616, at para. 3 (CanLII). 

[103]                     
For the reasons set out above, I am of the
opinion that Judge Couture did not make an error in principle by referring in
his decision to the particular situation in the Beauce region as one of the
relevant factors to consider in imposing an exemplary or deterrent sentence.

[104]                     
For the same reasons, I respectfully find that
the Court of Appeal erred in principle by failing to consider the local
situation factor in its decision despite the fact that it had previously found
this factor to be legitimate in other cases. Given that Judge Couture had
stressed the relevance of the local situation in the circumstances of this
case, it was inappropriate for the Court of Appeal to disregard this factor in
assessing the fitness of the sentence, as that meant that its analysis was
incomplete.

[105]                     
In conclusion, it is my opinion that the
sentence of six years and six months’ imprisonment imposed by Judge
Couture, although severe, falls within the overall range of sentences normally
imposed in Quebec and elsewhere in the country and is not demonstrably unfit.
It must therefore be restored.

E.           
Driving Prohibition

[106]                     
The appellant submits on the basis of
s. 719(1)  of the Criminal Code  that a sentence must commence when
it is imposed and that the Court of Appeal erred in imposing a four‑year
driving prohibition on the respondent at the end of his term of incarceration.

[107]                     
In my view, the appellant is wrong on this
point. The case on which the appellant relies for this, R. v. Laycock
(1989), 51 C.C.C. (3d) 65 (Ont. C.A.), was decided in 1989, at which time
s. 259(2) (a) of the Criminal Code  was worded as follows:

                          259. . . .

                          (2) Where an offender is convicted or
discharged under section 736 of an offence under section 220, 221,
236, 249, 250, 251, 252 or this section or subsection 255(2)  or (3) 
committed by means of a motor vehicle, vessel or aircraft, the court that
sentences the offender may, in addition to any other punishment that may be
imposed for that offence, make an order prohibiting the offender from operating
a motor vehicle on any street, road, highway or other public place, a vessel or
an aircraft, as the case may be,

(a)
during any period that the court considers proper, if the offender is liable to
imprisonment for life in respect of that offence;

[108]                     
This provision was subsequently amended. The
relevant paragraph currently reads as follows:

                          (a.1) during any period that the
court considers proper, plus any period to which the offender is sentenced
to imprisonment, if the offender is liable to imprisonment for life in respect
of that offence and if the sentence imposed is other than imprisonment for
life;

[109]                     
By adding the words “plus any period to which
the offender is sentenced to imprisonment”, Parliament was making it clear that
it intended driving prohibitions to commence at the end of the period of
imprisonment, not on the date of sentencing. Section 719(1)  provides that
a sentence commences when it is imposed, except where an enactment otherwise
provides. That is exactly what s. 259(2)  does. The Court of Appeal did not
err in this regard. 

[110]                     
What remains is a simple mathematical operation.
Judge Couture imposed an 11‑year driving prohibition commencing at the
time of sentencing. If the term of imprisonment of six years and
five months is subtracted, the driving prohibition should have been for
four years and seven months commencing at the time of the respondent’s release.


[111]                     
Another question concerning the driving
prohibition arose at the hearing. The respondent submits that, because he
entered into a recognizance under which he was not to drive from July 5,
2011, the date he was released on conditions, until October 4, 2013, the
date of his sentencing, he should be credited for that period. In the same way
as the conditions of pre‑trial detention, the length of a presentence
driving prohibition can be considered in analyzing the reasonableness of the
prohibition: R. v. Bilodeau, 2013 QCCA 980, at para. 75 (CanLII);
see also R. v. Williams, 2009 NBPC 16, 346 N.B.R. (2d) 164. 

[112]                     
The courts have seemed quite reluctant to grant
a credit where the release of the accused was subject to restrictions, given
that such restrictive release conditions are not equivalent to actually being
in custody (“bail is not jail”): R. v. Downes (2006), 79 O.R. (3d) 321
(C.A.); R. v. Ijam, 2007 ONCA 597, 87 O.R. (3d) 81, at para. 36;
R. v. Panday, 2007 ONCA 598, 87 O.R. (3d) 1.

[113]                     
In the instant case, the driving prohibition has
the same effect regardless of whether it was imposed before or after the
respondent was sentenced. In R. v. Sharma, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 814,
Lamer C.J., dissenting, explained that the accused had in fact begun
serving his sentence, given that the driving prohibition would have been
imposed as part of his sentence had he been tried and found guilty within a
reasonable time. In short, where a driving prohibition is not only one of the
release conditions imposed on an accused but also part of the sentence imposed
upon his or her conviction, the length of the presentence driving prohibition
must be subtracted from the prohibition imposed in the context of the sentence.

[114]                     
In my view, therefore, the driving prohibition
of four years and seven months imposed in this case is demonstrably unfit and
must be reduced to two years and four months to take account of the
recognizance entered into by the respondent under which he was to refrain from
driving from his release date until his sentencing date (two years and
three months).

F.            
Fresh Evidence

[115]                     
The criteria that apply to a court of appeal’s
decision whether to receive fresh evidence were articulated in Palmer v. The
Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759:

(1)       The
evidence should generally not be admit­ted if, by due diligence, it could have
been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not be applied
as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases . . . .

(2)       The
evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a decisive or
potentially decisive issue in the trial.

(3)       The
evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief,
and

(4)       It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when
taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected
the result. [Citation omitted; p. 775.]

[116]                     
Although that case involved an appeal from a
verdict, this Court has confirmed that the same criteria apply under
s. 687(1)  of the Criminal Code  when a court of appeal determines
whether it thinks “fit” to receive fresh evidence to decide an appeal against a
sentence: R. v. Lévesque, 2000 SCC 47, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 487. As
Charron J. noted in R. v. Angelillo, 2006 SCC 55, [2006] 2 S.C.R.
728, “[w]hat must guide the court of appeal in assessing the admissibility of
fresh evidence [are] the interests of justice” (para. 12).

[117]                     
In the case at bar, only the
fourth criterion is problematic. The appellant submits that the evidence
of the respondent’s two breaches of his recognizances would have affected the
trial judge’s decision, since those breaches relate to the respondent’s
potential for rehabilitation. The respondent argues that the two breaches were
essentially minor and that the Court of Appeal was not wrong to find that the
evidence regarding them would have been unlikely to affect the final result.

[118]                     
In my opinion, the fresh evidence was relevant.
Although the two breaches in question are not actually related to the operation
of a motor vehicle, they are evidence of a lack of respect on the respondent’s
part for court orders and for the law, which relates directly to the conditions
for his rehabilitation. 

[119]                     
In Lees v. The Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R.
749, McIntyre J. found that evidence of potential but untried charges was
admissible on the issue of “the appellant’s character, conduct, and attitude,
all proper factors to be taken into consideration on sentencing” (p. 754).
In the instant case, the respondent pleaded guilty to two counts of
failure to comply with a recognizance. If made earlier, those guilty pleas
would certainly have been included in the presentence report in accordance with
s. 721(3) (b) of the Criminal Code .

[120]                     
From this perspective, the evidence of the two
breaches of the recognizances could have affected the weight given to the
favourable presentence report and could therefore have affected the final
sentencing decision. In particular, the Court of Appeal might have reached a
different conclusion if it had admitted that evidence, which would have helped
it in assessing the fitness of the sentence that had been imposed at trial.

V.          
Disposition

[121]                     
For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and
restore the sentence imposed by the trial judge except as regards the driving prohibition,
which is reduced to two years and four months commencing at the end of the
respondent’s incarceration.

                    Gascon
J. (dissenting) — 

I.         
Introduction 

[122]                     
I have read the reasons of Wagner J., and I
will defer to his summary of the facts and of the decisions rendered by the
courts below. With respect, however, I disagree with my colleague’s disposition
of the issues. I am fully aware of the devastating consequences of the offences
in question for the victims and their families, but I nonetheless believe that
the Quebec Court of Appeal was right to intervene in this case. Although that
court’s comments about the application of the sentencing ranges may, if considered
in isolation, suggest that it adopted an overly rigid approach, I am satisfied
from its reasons as a whole that it correctly stated the law on the criteria
for intervention in this regard. 

[123]                     
The degree of censure required to express
society’s condemnation of an offence is always subject to the principle that an
offender’s sentence must be equivalent to his or her moral culpability, and not
greater than it. In the instant case, the trial judge placed undue emphasis on
the factors related to the objectives of general deterrence and exemplarity
(i.e. the fact of making an example of an offender). This led him to err,
first, in disregarding this fundamental principle of proportionality and,
second, in imposing a sentence that represented a substantial and marked
departure from the sentences customarily imposed on similar offenders who have
committed similar offences in similar circumstances. By varying the sentence
from 78 to 48 months, the Court of Appeal reduced it by more than a third,
which was certainly a significant reduction. Insofar as the Court of Appeal
correctly stated the law and as its intervention was therefore warranted, this
Court should not interfere with its conclusions as to the sentence it imposed
on the respondent, which is in fact just and appropriate. 

[124]                     
On the other hand, I agree with my colleague
that the courts below erred in failing to take into account the length of the
respondent’s presentence driving prohibition. Indeed, the appellant conceded
this at the hearing in this Court. The driving prohibition imposed by the Court
of Appeal should therefore be varied accordingly. I would retain the
wording it used with respect to this prohibition, however.

[125]                     
Finally, the Court of Appeal held that fresh
evidence of breaches by the accused of two recognizances was not reasonably
capable of tipping the scales in favour of a harsher sentence for the purpose
of protecting society. On this point, too, it correctly applied the law. I see
no error that justifies this Court in interfering with that conclusion. 

[126]                     
Accordingly, I would have allowed the appeal for
the sole purpose of reducing the respondent’s driving prohibition to one year
and nine months, plus the period of 48 months to which he was sentenced to
imprisonment.

II.      
Analysis

A.      
Sentence 

(1)      Sentencing Principles and Objectives

[127]                     
Sentencing judges must take into consideration, inter alia,
the objectives of deterrence and rehabilitation, any relevant aggravating and
mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and the
principle that a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar
offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances: ss. 718 
and 718.2 (a) and (b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C‑46  (“Cr. C.”). The reconciliation of these
different factors requires that the sentence be consistent with the fundamental
principle of sentencing, set out in s. 718.1  Cr. C., that
“[it] must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of
responsibility of the offender”: R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R.
773, at para. 42; see also R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5, [2000] 1
S.C.R. 61, at para. 82; R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688.

[128]                     
The principle of proportionality has a long
history as a guiding principle in sentencing, and it has a constitutional dimension:
R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, at para. 41; R.
v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 41. A person cannot be
made to suffer a disproportionate punishment simply to send a message to
discourage others from offending: Nur, at para. 45. As
Rosenberg J.A. wrote in R. v. Priest (1996), 30 O.R. (3d)
538 (C.A.), at pp. 546‑47:

                        The
principle of proportionality is rooted in notions of fairness and justice. For
the sentencing court to do justice to the particular offender, the sentence
imposed must reflect the seriousness of the offence, the degree of culpability
of the offender, and the harm occasioned by the offence. The court must have
regard to the aggravating and mitigating factors in the particular case.
Careful adherence to the proportionality principle ensures that this offender
is not unjustly dealt with for the sake of the common good. [Footnote omitted.]

Although a court can, in
pursuit of the objective of general deterrence, impose a harsher sentence in
order to send a message with a view to deterring others, the offender must
still deserve that sentence: R. v. Paré, 2011 QCCA 2047; G. Renaud,
The Sentencing Code of Canada: Principles and Objectives (2009), at
para. 3.13. If a judge fails to individualize a sentence and to consider
the relevant mitigating factors while placing undue emphasis on the
circumstances of the offence and the objectives of denunciation and deterrence,
all that is done is to punish the crime: R. v. R. (M.),
2010 QCCA 16, 73 C.R. (6th) 136. Proportionality requires that a sentence
not exceed what is just and appropriate in light of the moral
blameworthiness of the offender and the gravity of the offence. From this
perspective, it serves as a limiting principle: Nasogaluak, at
para. 42. 

[129]                     
My colleague states that the principle of
proportionality means that the more serious the crime and its consequences, or
the greater the offender’s degree of responsibility, the heavier the sentence
will be (para. 12). I would qualify this statement somewhat. In my view,
an offender’s degree of responsibility does not flow inevitably and solely from
the gravity of the offence. The gravity of the offence and the moral
blameworthiness of the offender are two separate factors, and the principle of
proportionality requires that full consideration be given to each of them: Proulx,
at para. 83. As s. 718.1 Cr. C. provides, “[a] sentence
must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of
responsibility of the offender.”

[130]                     
Whereas the gravity of the offence concerns the
harm caused by the offender to the victim as well as to society and its values,
the other aspect of the principle of proportionality involves factors that
relate to the offender’s moral culpability:

                        The “degree of responsibility of the offender”
as used in s. 718.1 certainly includes the mens rea level of intent,
recklessness or wilful blindness associated with the actus reus of the crime
committed. For this assessment, courts are able to draw extensively on criminal
justice principles. The greater the harm intended or the greater the degree of
recklessness or wilful blindness, the greater the moral culpability. However,
the reference in s. 718.1 is not simply to the “mens rea degree of
responsibility of the offender” at the time of commission of the crime.
Parliament evidently intended “degree of responsibility of the offender” to
include other factors affecting culpability. These might relate, for example,
to the offender’s personal circumstances, mental capacity or motive for
committing the crime. Where else does the Code provide for an offender’s
degree of responsibility generally to be taken into account? Here, too, the
answer takes us to s. 718.2 . 

                        Section 718.2  directs the sentencing
judge to take into consideration a number of principles. All are either
components of the proportionality principle or properly influence its
interpretation and application. Either way, all are relevant in determining a
just sanction that satisfies the proportionality principle. [Citation omitted.]

(R. v. J.L.M.A.,
2010 ABCA 363, 499 A.R. 1, at paras. 58‑59; see also Nasogaluak,
at para. 42; M. (C.A.), at para. 40.)

[131]                     
The application of the proportionality principle
may therefore cause the two factors to conflict, particularly where the gravity
of the offence points strongly to a sentence at one end of the range while the
moral culpability of the offender points in the other direction: R. v.
Hamilton (2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at para. 93, quoted in C. C.
Ruby, G. J. Chan and N. R. Hasan, Sentencing (8th ed. 2012),
at pp. 26‑27. In short, although it is true that the gravity of the
crime is a relevant factor, it must nevertheless be considered in conjunction
with the offender’s degree of responsibility, a factor that is unrelated to the
gravity of the offence.

[132]                     
I would also qualify my colleague’s statement
that the courts have “very few options other than imprisonment” (para. 6) for
meeting the objectives of general or specific deterrence and denunciation in
cases in which they must be emphasized. In my view, the courts should not
automatically assume that imprisonment is always the preferred sanction for the
purpose of meeting these objectives. To do so would be contrary to other
sentencing principles. Rather, a court must consider “all available sanctions, other
than imprisonment”, that are reasonable in the circumstances: s. 718.2 (e)
Cr. C.; Gladue, at para. 36.

[133]                     
The common law principle that even where a term
of imprisonment is necessary, it should be the lightest possible sanction in
the circumstances is codified in s. 718.2 (d) Cr. C.:
Ruby, Chan and Hasan, at p. 510. This Court has noted Parliament’s desire
to give increased prominence, for all offenders, to this principle of restraint
in the use of prison as a sanction: Proulx, at para. 17. A court
that emphasizes general deterrence must therefore always be mindful of both the
principle of restraint and that of proportionality: Ruby, Chan and Hasan, at
p. 15, citing R. v. Hawkins, 2011 NSCA 7, 298 N.S.R. (2d) 53, at
paras. 42 and 47; see also R. v. Wismayer (1997),
33 O.R. (3d) 225 (C.A.); R. v. Coffin, 2006 QCCA 471, 210 C.C.C. (3d)
227; F. Dadour, De la détermination de la peine: Principes et
applications (2007), at p. 8. 

[134]                     
Furthermore, [translation]
“the objective of general and even specific deterrence does not relate
exclusively to the severity of a sentence considered in the abstract.
Deterrence can work through conditions tailored to fit the offender or the
circumstances of the offender, as the . . . Court noted in Proulx”:
Dadour, at p. 8 (footnote omitted). This principle is even more important
in the case of a young person with no criminal record: Priest. As
Twaddle J.A. observed in R. v. Leask (1996), 113 Man. R. (2d) 265
(C.A.), at para. 3, “the transition from statutorily defined young person
to adult should not be marked by an immediate abandonment of rehabilitation as
the primary goal in cases where the prospect of successful rehabilitation is
real”. 

(2)     
Standard of Intervention Applicable to
Sentencing Decisions

[135]                     
My colleague states that this appeal affords the
Court an opportunity to clarify the standard on the basis of which an appellate
court may intervene in sentencing decisions (para. 10). In my opinion,
there is no reason to believe that this is necessary. The applicable standard
is well known, and when all is said and done, the appeal before us concerns
only how it should be applied in the circumstances of this case.

[136]                     
In Nasogaluak, this Court summarized the
applicable law as follows: “. . . a sentence [can] only be
interfered with if it [is] ‘demonstrably unfit’ or if it reflect[s] an
error in principle, the failure to consider a relevant factor, or the over‑emphasis
of a relevant factor” (para. 46 (emphasis added), citing M. (C.A.),
at para. 90). In Paré, a case that was referred to in the decisions
of the courts below, the Quebec Court of Appeal reiterated the principles
established in those cases and wrote the following:

                        [translation]  . . . a court
of appeal may intervene only in circumstances indicating an error in
principle, an overemphasis of an appropriate factor, or a failure to consider a
relevant factor, unless the sentence is quite simply demonstrably unfit
or, in other words, clearly unreasonable. Thus, appellate courts retain the
power to ensure that sentences are consistent with those imposed “for similar
offences committed in similar circumstances”; indeed, this is set out in
subsection 718.2 (b) Cr. C. [Emphasis added;
para. 38 (CanLII).]

[137]                     
If a party shows that the trial judge made an
error in principle, failed to consider a relevant factor or overemphasized
appropriate factors, I do not think it can be said that the judge acted within
the limits of his or her discretion in sentencing matters. In such cases, the
relevant decisions of this Court do not require that the sentence also be shown
to be demonstrably unfit before an appellate court can intervene. The effect of
such a requirement would be to raise the recognized standard of intervention. 

[138]                     
In my opinion, the current approach is neither
incongruous nor unfair. The highly deferential standard of appellate review
must be adhered to as long as the trial judge did not err in principle, fail to
consider a relevant factor or overemphasize appropriate factors: R. v. Stone,
[1999] 2 S.C.R. 290, at para. 230. Even if none of these three situations
exists, however, intervention may be necessary if the sentence is demonstrably
unfit. This other ground for intervention has been described in several ways: a
court of appeal can still vary a sentence if it is convinced that the sentence
is “not fit” or “clearly unreasonable” (R. v. Shropshire, [1995] 4
S.C.R. 227, at para. 46), that it is “[u]nreasonabl[e]” or “fall[s]
outside the ‘acceptable range’” (Shropshire, at para. 50), or that
it is “demonstrably unfit” (R. v. McDonnell, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, at
para. 17; M. (C.A.), at para. 90). 

[139]                     
Therefore, where a reviewable error is shown in
the reasoning on which a sentence is based, it is appropriate for an appellate
court to be able to intervene and assess the fitness of the sentence. This does
not necessarily mean that the court will automatically vary the sentence. As
the passage from Paré quoted above indicates, the court’s role in
ensuring consistency in sentencing requires it before intervening to ascertain,
among other things, that the sentence represents a “substantial and marked
departure from the sentences customarily imposed for similar offenders
committing similar crimes”: M. (C.A.), at para. 92;
see also Stone, at para. 230. An error merely opens the door to
intervention and permits an appellate court to reopen the sentencing analysis.
Only by correctly repeating the analytical exercise can the court determine
whether the sanction imposed on the offender is just and appropriate or whether
it should be varied. In other words, the court can then impose the sentence it
considers appropriate without having to show deference: T. Desjardins, L’appel
en droit criminel et pénal (2nd ed. 2012), at p. 217, citing, inter alia,
R. v. Gallon, 2006 NBCA 31, 297 N.B.R. (2d) 317; R. v. Biancofiore
(1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 782 (C.A.), at p. 789; and R. v. Gagnon
(1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 194 (Que. C.A.), at p. 199. 

[140]                     
In this regard, it seems to me that this Court’s
decisions reflect a careful reading of s. 687  Cr. C. What
emerges from the Court’s remarks is that the fitness of a sentence is not
assessed in the abstract. There is no such thing as a uniform sentence for a
particular crime, and sentencing is an inherently individualized process: M. (C.A.),
at para. 92. A sentence must reflect a consideration of all the relevant
factors, and it is in this sense that the “process” of sentencing is important.
In the words of Dickson J. in R. v. Gardiner, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368,
“[i]f policy considerations are to enter the picture, as they often do, there
would appear to me to be every reason why this Court should remain available to
adjudicate upon difficult and important questions of law in the sentencing
process”: p. 404. The fitness of a sentence is determined on the basis of
several relevant principles, objectives and factors, and a sanction may be
unfit if there is a reviewable error in the thought process or reasoning on
which it is based. However, it is only by assessing that process or reasoning
that an appellate court can determine whether the identified errors make the
sentence unfit.

[141]                     
I note that my colleague seems to detect a
certain absoluteness in my words that is quite simply not there (paras. 42‑43).
I am not saying that a sentence cannot be fit if there is a reviewable error in
the reasoning process on which it is based. Rather, I am saying that a sanction
may be unfit in such a case, which is very different. The first of these
wordings would be absolute. The second depends on the appellate court’s
assessment of the sanction in question, which is in fact made in accordance
with the principles set out in my reasons.

[142]                     
Therefore, although I agree that, as
Hall J.A. stated in R. v. Orr, 2008 BCCA 76, 228 C.C.C. (3d) 432,
at para. 7, an appellate court should not vary a sentence that is fit, I
consider it imperative that that court retain its ability to rule on the trial
court’s analysis and to intervene where there is an error warranting its
intervention. 

[143]                     
Finally, I agree with my colleague that it is
accepted that the ranges established by appellate courts are in fact only
guidelines, and not hard and fast rules (para. 60). A judge can therefore
order a sentence outside the established range as long as it is in accordance
with the principles and objectives of sentencing. Regard must be had not only
to the circumstances of the offence and the needs of the community in which the
offence occurred, but also to the circumstances of the offender: Nasogaluak,
at para. 44. As a corollary, the mere fact that a sentence falls within the
range applicable to a certain type of crime does not necessarily make it fit,
since the judge may, in determining the sentence, have failed to take account
of the particular circumstances of the offender. It is by analyzing the trial
judge’s reasoning or thought process that an appellate court can determine
whether a sentence that falls within the proper range is tailored to fit the
circumstances of the offender and is therefore individualized and
proportionate.

(3)     
Intervention of the Court of Appeal

[144]                     
In light of the above, I find that the Court of
Appeal properly justified its intervention in this case. Although the comments
it made in para. 15 (CanLII) of its reasons might at first glance
suggest that it took an inflexible view of the sentencing ranges, I believe
that the substance of the court’s reasoning can instead be found at
paras. 16‑17: 2014 QCCA 1061. I do not agree with my colleague that
the Court of Appeal intervened solely because the trial judge had deviated from
the proper sentencing range (para. 11) or because the sentence fell
outside the accepted sentencing range (para. 16), or that it essentially
focused its analysis on the application of the sentencing range (para. 30)
or applied that range mechanically (para. 69). Rather, its reasons, read
as a whole, show that its analysis went much further than that. I think it will
be helpful to reproduce the entirety of paras. 15‑17, which I find
to be enlightening in this regard: 

                        [translation] 
By imposing a sentence of 77 months’ imprisonment (six years and six
months minus one month because of the time spent by the applicant in pre‑trial
custody), the trial judge unquestionably placed the sentence at the lower end
of the third category of sentences, the most severe ones. The respondent argued
at the hearing that the sentence was actually in the second category, increased
slightly because of the serious consequences of the offence, which had claimed
two victims. But that argument must be rejected, because “personal factors
of the accused” that are unfavourable to the accused are normally what justify
a move from the second to the third category. This can be seen from
the breakdown of sentences in recent cases.

                        However, such factors are almost non‑existent
in this case, as is clear from the report prepared by a probation officer for
sentencing purposes and from the testimony given by the psychologist and the
social worker who attended the applicant following the accident. The applicant
has strong support from his family. There is virtually no possibility of him
reoffending. It is likely that, once he has served his sentence, he will
be able to find a job in an autobody repair business owned by his mother. There
is no doubt that he is aware of the extreme seriousness of the consequences of
his wrongdoing: he was and still is tortured by remorse, so much so that
the professionals around him became concerned about possible suicidal
tendencies and took preventive action accordingly. 

                        In
light of the foregoing, the sentence imposed on October 4, 2013 is excessive
because it departs from the principle of proportionality. In
individualizing the sentence in this case, the judge should have given
greater consideration to the applicant’s potential for rehabilitation, which is
substantial, and reduced the emphasis he placed on exemplarity. A sentence
that is severe without being draconian will be more than sufficient for the
purposes of this last factor in the case of individuals who, like the
applicant, have no record (despite a few Highway Safety Code
offences in his case), are law‑abiding and are capable of
understanding the magnitude, for all those close to the victims, of a
tragedy like the one that occurred on June 17, 2011. [Emphasis added;
footnote omitted.] 

[145]                     
By justifying its intervention as it did, the
Court of Appeal complied with the principles laid down by this Court for such
cases. As it noted, and as I will explain in the next section, the sanction
imposed in this case was not consistent with the principles and objectives of
sentencing. The trial judge considered some aggravating factors that were not
really aggravating factors, rejected or failed to consider some relevant and
important mitigating factors, and placed undue emphasis on the objective of deterrence.
The sentence that resulted from his analysis was thus neither proportionate nor
individualized; it also represented a substantial and marked departure from the
sentences customarily imposed on similar offenders who have committed similar
crimes in similar circumstances. 

(4)     
Trial Judge’s Errors

(a)       Aggravating Factors That Were Not Really Aggravating Factors

[146]                     
In his analysis, the trial judge began by
identifying some aggravating factors that were not really aggravating factors:
2013 QCCQ 11960, at para. 32 (CanLII). In principle, s. 718.2  Cr. C.
lists a number of what are considered to be aggravating factors. An element
of the offence cannot in itself constitute such a factor. A judge who
characterizes an element of the offence as an aggravating factor thus makes an
error of law that opens the door to appellate intervention: R. v. Flight,
2014 ABCA 380, 584 A.R. 392, at para. 4; R. v. Stimson, 2011 ABCA
59, 499 A.R. 185, at para. 20; R. v. Dass, 2008 CanLII 13191 (Ont.
S.C.J.), at pp. 59-60; R. v. Dankyi (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 368
(Que. C.A.), at p. 372. 

[147]                     
In the instant case, the accused being
intoxicated was in itself already an element of the offence. Incidentally, the
record does not indicate what his blood alcohol level was. Similarly, the
consumption of alcohol or drugs before driving was already part of the offence,
so the fact that the accused drank alcohol cannot be an aggravating factor in
the absence of some more blameworthy conduct. Moreover, the parties agreed that
it was the alcohol alone that had impaired the ability of the accused to drive;
his consumption of cannabis had not contributed to the accident, and this is
confirmed by the record. The accused had consumed cannabis (taking three puffs
on a joint) at about 7:00 p.m., and the accident occurred shortly before
4:00 a.m. the next day: trial, at para. 2; R.F., at para. 7.
Finally, the impact on those close to the accused cannot be considered an
aggravating factor that would justify a harsher sentence for the accused:
s. 718.2  Cr. C.

(b)      Discounted Mitigating Factors

[148]                     
Next, the trial judge discounted some relevant
factors that are normally characterized as mitigating factors and that must be
considered in determining the appropriate sentence — namely the youth of the
accused and the facts that he had expressed remorse, that he had no criminal
record and that the presentence report was favourable to him. The Court of
Appeal discussed the last three of these factors at paras. 16‑17 of
its reasons. By contrast, although the trial judge listed them at
para. 33, he actually ended up discounting all of them except the
presentence report, which he simply failed to discuss. He even discounted
the youth of the accused to favour exemplarity and deterrence (para. 39),
despite the principle that “the general rule for most offences is that a
sentence should not be imposed on a youthful offender for the purpose of
general deterrence, but should rather be directed at rehabilitation”: Ruby, Chan
and Hasan, at p. 263.

(c)      Failure to Discuss an Important Mitigating Factor

[149]                     
Furthermore, the trial judge initially referred
to the favourable presentence report and the positive conclusions reached in
it: paras. 18‑19. After that, he mentioned that the report was one
of the relevant mitigating factors: para. 33. But he did not discuss this
important factor further in his analysis. As the Court of Appeal noted, he in
fact disregarded the report and the following findings:

                    [translation]  The applicant has strong
support from his family. There is virtually no possibility of him reoffending.
It is likely that, once he has served his sentence, he will be able to find a
job in an autobody repair business owned by his mother. There is no doubt that
he is aware of the extreme seriousness of the consequences of his wrongdoing:
he was and still is tortured by remorse, so much so that the professionals
around him became concerned about possible suicidal tendencies and took
preventive action accordingly. [para. 16] 

[150]                     
That report and those positive findings
represented a mitigating factor that was relevant to and important for the
determination of the appropriate sentence. Yet the trial judge referred only
very briefly to the rehabilitation of the accused in para. 92, in which he
merely said: [translation] “The
objective of separation implies that the sentence should not be so long as to
hamper the rehabilitation of the accused.” I must agree with the Court of
Appeal that this does not show that he really considered this important factor.
Instead, a review of his reasons as a whole leads to the opposite conclusion,
that is, that he conducted no analysis in respect of the objective of
rehabilitation and its impact on the circumstances of the case. Unlike my
colleague, I find that the trial judge’s reasons do not support a conclusion
that he considered the respondent’s prospects for rehabilitation
(para. 82). As the Court of Appeal found, the trial judge’s failure to
consider this factor constituted a failure to take the offender’s potential for
rehabilitation, which is significant, into account in the individualization of the
sentence. 

(d)     Disproportionate Emphasis on Exemplarity 

[151]                     
Finally, as the Court of Appeal noted, the trial
judge’s failure to consider certain mitigating factors that favoured the
potential for rehabilitation of the accused and the emphasis he placed on exemplarity
led him to impose an excessive sentence that departed from the principle of
proportionality. Although the Court of Appeal found that the trial judge had
gone too far in emphasizing exemplarity, it is true that it did not deal
specifically with the local situation factor. I agree with my colleague that it
would have been preferable for the court to do so (para. 87). In the
instant case, the local situation factor clearly magnified the exemplary focus
of the sentence with which the Court of Appeal took issue. I will just make
three comments about what my colleague says in this regard. 

[152]                     
First, the views expressed by the authors and
the courts do not seem to me to be so uniform on the question whether judges
can rely on their own perceptions of the frequency of particular crimes in
their regions in order to justify imposing harsher sentences. For instance, I
note the following remarks by Ruby, Chan and Hasan, at p. 124:

                        Since
the sentencing hearing is merely part of a criminal trial, there is no reason
for thinking that the doctrine of judicial notice would not apply in the
ordinary way. But the distinction between facts that are sufficiently certain
to notice judicially and those that are not is one that must be borne in mind,
as excessive reliance on matters not proved in evidence can be destructive
of the fairness of the sentencing process. The incidence of crime in a
jurisdiction is not a matter that can be the subject matter of judicial notice.
[Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.]

[153]                     
When considered in the sentencing context, the
frequency of a crime in a given region does not help paint a portrait of the
accused, but instead reflects external factors:

                    The contradiction inherent in such sentences
is that the exemplary sentence is imposed on a particular offender who becomes
the scapegoat for others who have committed similar crimes, but who have not
been caught or who have not been singled out for the calling of the requisite
evidence. This is utterly impermissible. This action requires reliance upon
a deterrence theory, which has little, if any, statistical base upon which to
stand, and is not self‑proving. It is, nevertheless, a popular theory.

                          The use of evidence of increased
prevalence of a particular crime in the community as a factor aggravating the
appropriate sentence for a particular offender must rest on the theory that
higher penalties will deter offenders from committing that particular kind of
offence. The truth of this theory is not self‑evident, and deterrence
theories in general have suffered from criticism, though deterrence remains a
principle of sentencing. [Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.] 

(Ruby, Chan and Hasan, at p. 256)

[154]                     
It is true that in M. (C.A.), Lamer C.J.
stated that the needs of and current conditions in the community are a factor
to be considered in sentencing. A sentencing judge normally has a strong sense
of the blend of sentencing goals that will be “just and appropriate” for the
protection of the community where he or she presides: M. (C.A.), at
para. 91. However, although these remarks do support the view that the
frequency of a crime in the community can be considered in the sentencing
process, it should be borne in mind that Lamer C.J. also stated that, the
community’s needs notwithstanding, it is always necessary to carefully balance
the societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of the
offender and the circumstances of the offence: M. (C.A.), at
para. 91. Thus, whatever weight a judge may wish to accord to the needs of
the community and the objective of deterrence, the resulting sentence must
always be consistent with the fundamental principle of proportionality. The
degree of censure required to express society’s condemnation of the offence is
limited by the principle that an offender’s sentence must be equivalent to his
or her moral culpability: Nasogaluak, at paras. 40‑42. In the
case at bar, the Court of Appeal properly emphasized factors relating to the
accused himself that the trial judge had disregarded.

[155]                     
Second, the views expressed by the authors and
the courts also do not seem to me to be so uniform on the question whether it
is appropriate for a judge to take judicial notice of the frequency of a crime
in his or her community during sentencing.

[156]                     
This Court considered the application of the doctrine
of judicial notice in R. v. Spence, 2005 SCC 71, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 458.
Ultimately, the permissible scope of judicial notice should vary according to
the nature of the issue under consideration: Spence, at para. 60.
Thus, the closer a fact approaches the dispositive issue, the more stringent is
the test for its admissibility: Spence, at paras. 60‑61; P. Béliveau and M. Vauclair, Traité
général de preuve et de procédure pénales (22nd ed. 2015), at para. 2366. When a fact falls between an adjudicative fact (one that is at
the centre of the controversy between the parties) and a background fact (one
that is only at the periphery of the controversy, and that the court will
assume to be uncontroversial), the court must ask itself

                    whether such “fact” would be accepted by
reasonable people who have taken the trouble to inform themselves on the topic
as not being the subject of reasonable dispute for the particular purpose
for which it is to be used, keeping in mind that the need for reliability
and trustworthiness increases directly with the centrality of the “fact” to the
disposition of the controversy. [Emphasis in original.] 

(Spence, at para. 65)

This is why a court may
take judicial notice of a “fact” in one case but decline to do so in another
case in which the issue is dispositive: Spence, at para. 65.

[157]                     
My colleague refers to some cases in support of
the proposition that judges can take judicial notice of the conditions that
exist in a region. In only one of those cases did the sentencing judge take
judicial notice of the local situation: R. v. Valiquette, 2004 CanLII
20126 (Que. C.A.), at paras. 48‑50. In the other cases, the courts
of appeal did note that a trial judge could consider the local situation when
imposing a sentence, but there was no indication that they agreed that judicial
notice could be taken of such evidence. 

[158]                     
In the case at bar, the trial judge referred to
the situation in his district, but he also suggested that impaired driving is
trivialized there more than elsewhere (para. 72). However, the judicial
notice that judges can take of their communities is not without limits. In my
view, caution must be exercised in establishing its scope. According to my
colleague, judicial notice in this regard is not limited to the magnitude of
the problem observed by the judge in his region, but can also be extended to a
comparison of the local situation with situations in other places as well as to
information gathered from the hearing rolls of courts (paras. 95 and 98).
This seems to me to go much farther than judicial notice of the fact that a
city has a francophone majority or of recent unlawful conduct in a particular
community, to which reference was made in the cases cited by my colleague in
support of his remarks (para. 95; R. v. Z.Z., 2013 QCCA 1498, at
para. 68 (CanLII); R. v. Hernandez, 2009 BCCA 546, 277 B.C.A.C.
120, at para. 29). Being familiar with the local situation in one’s region
is one thing, but claiming to compare that situation with what happens
elsewhere in order to draw conclusions or inferences from it is something else.

[159]                     
Third, and finally, I agree that the sentencing
process differs considerably from a trial in that it is more informal. As
Dickson J. noted in Gardiner, “the strict rules which govern at
trial do not apply at a sentencing hearing and it would be undesirable to have
the formalities and technicalities characteristic of the normal adversary
proceeding prevail”: p. 414; see also R. v. Lévesque, 2000 SCC 47,
[2000] 2 S.C.R. 487, at para. 30. A court has wide latitude as to the
sources and types of evidence upon which to base the sentence to be imposed. It
can rely on counsel’s submissions and arguments, and mere assertions by counsel
may sometimes suffice to found factual decisions by the court: R. v. Witvoet,
2015 ABCA 152, 600 A.R. 200; see also R. v. Bartlett, 2005 NLCA 75, 252
Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 154; R. v. Joseph, 2012 BCCA 359, 326 B.C.A.C. 312,
at para. 32. 

[160]                     
Still, despite the latitude judges have in
sentencing hearings, they must never lose sight of the importance of procedural
fairness. Professor Davis explains this as follows:

                        The basic principle is that extra‑record
facts should be assumed whenever it is convenient to assume them, except that convenience
should always yield to the requirement of procedural fairness that parties
should have opportunity to meet in the appropriate fashion all facts that
influence the disposition of the case. [Emphasis added; emphasis in
original deleted.]

(K. C. Davis,
Administrative Law Text (3rd ed. 1972), at p. 314, quoted in
R. J. Delisle, D. Stuart and D. M. Tanovich, Evidence:
Principles and Problems (9th ed. 2010), at p. 357.)

[161]                     
One decision that illustrates this principle is R.
v. Provost, 2006 NLCA 30, 256 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 205, in which the Court
of Appeal stressed that arguments about the prevalence of a crime in a
community must be dealt with in ways that are consistent with the principles of
procedural fairness:

                         In para. 15 of his sentencing
decision, the Provincial Court Judge wrote:

                        . . .
considering the number of trafficking offences that are coming before the
courts, it is obvious that conditional periods of imprisonment have failed to
have a deterrent effect. Those who are involved in significant criminal
enterprises must be made to understand that their criminal activity will not be
tolerated and that if caught and convicted, they will receive significant
periods of incarceration.

                        It is good
when judges are mindful of developments in their communities and of patterns of
offences that come before the courts. That being said, such considerations need
to be dealt with in ways that maintain procedural fairness; as well, they must
not be used so as to detract from proper application of recognized principles
of sentencing. [Emphasis added; paras. 13‑14.]

[162]                     
In the instant case, it is true that the
prosecution referred to the number of impaired driving cases in the region, and
defence counsel did not dispute that fact. With this in mind, I agree with my
colleague that the judge cannot be criticized for his comments on the situation
in his region, such as his reference at para. 72 to [translation] “this scourge” in his
district. However, I find that the opposite is true for his question: “Might it
be that driving in such a state is trivialized here more than elsewhere?”
(para. 72). Sentencing has high stakes both for the individual and for society.
For the respondent, as for many accused — the vast majority of whom plead
guilty, as Dickson J. noted in Gardiner — the sentence is the most
important decision the criminal justice system will have to make about them.
Although judges should not be denied an opportunity to obtain relevant
information by requiring compliance with all the evidential rules common to a
trial, “the obtaining and weighing of such evidence should be fair. A
substantial liberty interest of the offender is involved and the information
obtained should be accurate and reliable”: Gardiner, at p. 414. In
exercising their discretion in conducting the proceedings to choose the
information on which they will rely in order to impose a just sentence, judges
must bear in mind the importance of the facts in question and the impact on the
offender of how they are dealt with: Ruby, Chan and Hasan, at
pp. 100‑101, citing R. v. Alarie (1980), 28 C.R. (3d) 73
(Que. Ct. Sess. P.).

[163]                     
In my opinion, there is no indication that the
trial judge in the case at bar was in a position to take judicial notice of the
fact that impaired driving is trivialized in the Beauce region more than
elsewhere. In this regard, knowing the impact on sentencing of that factor,
which he considered to be aggravating, and the particular weight he was going
to attach to it in imposing a more severe sanction, he should, in the interest
of procedural fairness, have informed the respondent of his concerns on this
point and requested submissions from him. But he did not do so, even though the
importance he attached to that aggravating factor ultimately led him to impose
a sentence that favoured exemplarity at the expense of proportionality. 

(5)     
Just and Appropriate Sentence

[164]                     
In light of all the above, I agree with the
Court of Appeal that the trial judge overemphasized the objectives of
exemplarity and deterrence while at the same time overlooking the principles of
similarity of sentences and individualization in sentencing. Having regard to
the sentencing judge’s failure to consider a relevant and important mitigating
factor, namely the favourable presentence report, and to the excessive emphasis
he placed on aggravating factors that were not really aggravating factors, I
believe the Court of Appeal was justified in intervening and reopening the
analytical process in order to determine whether the sentence was just and
appropriate. With respect, these were not non‑determinative errors by the
trial judge, nor did they amount to a mere failure to properly weigh the
aggravating or mitigating factors he analyzed. In my opinion, it was open to
the Court of Appeal to find, on the contrary, that they were reviewable errors
that, viewed as a whole and given their determinative impact on sentencing
principles, warranted its intervention.

[165]                     
On the one hand, in the name of deterrence and
exemplarity, the trial judge focused on the perceived prevalence of the crime
in the community and disregarded the individual and contextual factors, which
led him to impose a sentence that was excessive in the respondent’s case. It
can be seen from his reasons that he placed emphasis on deterrence, to the
detriment of other penological objectives. At paras. 76‑86, he
discussed several decisions in which reference had been made to the primacy of
the deterrence factor. However, in most of those decisions, the courts had
discussed deterrence as a factor in addition to other serious aggravating
circumstances that existed in the cases before them, which does not reflect the
situation in the case at bar.

[166]                     
For example, in R. v. Junkert, 2010 ONCA
549, 103 O.R. (3d) 284, the Ontario Court of Appeal acknowledged that a five‑year
sentence for impaired driving causing death was at the high end of the
sentences that are normally imposed. However, it upheld the sentence in light
of a number of aggravating factors, including a very high blood alcohol level
and the reckless way the accused had been driving. In R. v. Ruizfuentes,
2010 MBCA 90, 258 Man. R. (2d) 220, the Manitoba Court of Appeal referred to
the trend toward higher sentences in recent years and stressed the importance
of denunciation and deterrence. It nevertheless intervened to reduce the
sentence despite the fact that there were a number of aggravating factors. In R.
v. Lépine, 2007 QCCA 70, the Quebec Court of Appeal considered the
particular circumstances of the accused and stated that [translation] “the judge based his
decision on well‑supported reasons that led him to conclude that a term
of imprisonment was necessary both for general deterrence and for specific
deterrence”: para. 17 (CanLII) (emphasis added). The sentence imposed
on each of the two counts of impaired driving causing death was three years’
imprisonment. Finally, in R. v. Brutus, 2009 QCCA 1382, while the Quebec
Court of Appeal stressed the importance of denunciation and deterrence in
impaired driving cases, it added that [translation]
“[t]he sentence imposed in this case is not unreasonable in light of [the
objective of deterrence], nor is it unreasonable in light of all the
circumstances of the case”: para. 18 (CanLII) (emphasis added). In
that case, the court found that there were several aggravating factors,
including a high blood alcohol level, the fact that the accused had been
driving with a suspended driver’s licence and the fact that she had done nothing
concrete to turn her situation around. 

[167]                     
On the other hand, the trial judge’s errors also
had another consequence: the violation of the principle that sentences should
be similar to other sentences imposed in similar circumstances, which is the
corollary of the principle of proportionality (see G. Renaud, Principes
de la détermination de la peine (2004), at p. 37). He determined the
sentence by referring, inter alia, to the two victims, to the
importance of the local situation in this case, to the importance of the
objectives of denunciation and deterrence, and to Paré, which he
distinguished. Although the trial judge referred to several decisions in his
reasons, he provided little if any explanation for the sentence of
78 months’ imprisonment that he ultimately imposed on the respondent,
despite the fact that the severity of that sentence is not in any doubt. In my
view, however, a review of the cases concerning offenders who committed similar
crimes in similar circumstances does not bring any comparable case to light in
which so severe a sentence was imposed. This being so, I am of the opinion that
it was open to the Court of Appeal to intervene to reassess the fitness of the
sentence. In this regard, although it would also have been preferable for the Court
of Appeal to provide a more thorough explanation, the 48‑month sentence
it imposed seems much more consistent with what can be seen in comparable
decisions. I will focus my analysis on some recent cases that, like the
respondent’s case, involved two counts of impaired driving causing death.

[168]                     
In R. v. Charles, 2011 BCCA 68, 10 M.V.R.
(6th) 177, aff’g 2009 BCSC 1391, the British Columbia Court of Appeal upheld a
sentence of three years’ imprisonment on two counts of impaired driving
causing death for a 21‑year‑old Aboriginal accused with no criminal
record. His alcohol consumption had been excessive and, although he did have
family support, he had displayed a lack of remorse.

[169]                     
In R. v. McIlwrick, 2008 ABQB 724, 461
A.R. 16, the accused was convicted of two counts of impaired driving causing
death and two counts of impaired driving causing bodily harm. He had been
smoking marijuana while driving to work and had had a high level of THC in his
blood, which had caused his impairment. He had a criminal record (assault, drug
possession, possession for the purpose of trafficking). Although he had
expressed remorse, the judge and the probation officer had concluded that he
had failed to take full responsibility for his actions. The accused had
nonetheless been co‑operative with the police, had support from his
family and required medical care. The judge sentenced him to 48 months’
imprisonment.

[170]                     
In R. v. Olsen, 2011 ABCA 308, 515 A.R.
76, the accused pleaded guilty to two counts of impaired driving causing death;
the victims were the parents of five children. He had been 22 years old at
the time of the offence; his blood alcohol level had been
226 mg/100 mL, and he had been driving in excess of the speed limit.
He had a lengthy record of driving offences, including in particular
16 convictions in the five years before the incident, some of them for
speeding. His licence had been suspended four times. He had no criminal
record, and he had expressed remorse in a letter written to the victims’
children and family. He had the support of his family and was employed. The
Alberta Court of Appeal sentenced him to 42 months’ imprisonment. 

[171]                     
In R. v. Pelletier, 2009 QCCQ 6277, the
accused pleaded guilty to two counts: one of having operated a vehicle while
his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol and having caused the deaths of
two persons as a result, and the second of having, in the same circumstances,
caused bodily harm to a third person. He had a criminal record with convictions
for attempting to commit an indictable offence and breaking and entering with
intent, and for drug possession, but none involving the operation of a motor
vehicle. After drinking for several hours [translation]
“while visiting friends and also at a bar, he drove his vehicle from place to
place and, finally, still behind the wheel of his vehicle, headed for a
convenience store to buy beer”: para. 22 (CanLII). His blood alcohol level
was 182 mg/100 mL, and he was driving at 120 km/h in a
90 km/h zone at the time of the accident. The victims were 15 and 16 years
old. He had been convicted of three speeding offences under the Quebec Highway
Safety Code, CQLR, c. C‑24.2, between 2004 and 2007. The
mitigating factors identified by the court included his age and the facts that
he had pleaded guilty, had expressed remorse to the probation officer, had
developed an awareness, had obtained a new job, had a support network, had been
given a favourable presentence report and had complied with his release
conditions. The court imposed a sentence of 42 months’ imprisonment.

[172]                     
In R. v. Nottebrock, 2014 ABQB 662, 15
Alta. L.R. (6th) 114, the accused was convicted of two counts of criminal
negligence causing death and two counts of impaired driving causing death. She
had had a blood alcohol level between 222 and 227 mg/100 mL and had
been driving at between 135 and 145 km/h in an 80 km/h zone when
she ran a red light without even braking. She was 28 years old at the time
of her sentencing. She was extremely remorseful and took responsibility for her
actions. The risk of her reoffending was low. The court sentenced her to
54 months’ imprisonment. 

[173]                     
By comparison, the cases of impaired driving
causing death in which sentences of between six and nine years have been
imposed have involved significant aggravating circumstances that are not
present in the case at bar, such as a criminal record for similar offences
(impaired driving or driving with a blood alcohol level over the limit), a
larger number of victims, driving with children in the vehicle, refusal to
listen to other people’s warnings, driving without a licence or while
disqualified from driving or prohibited from consuming alcohol, an extremely
high blood alcohol level, an untreated alcohol dependence, a risk of
reoffending, or a negative presentence report: see, for example, R. v.
Cooper, 2007 NSSC 115, 255 N.S.R. (2d) 18; R. v. Kummer, 2011 ONCA
39, 103 O.R. (3d) 641; R. v. Cote, 2007 SKPC 100, 300 Sask. R. 194; R.
v. York, 2015 ABCA 129, 78 M.V.R. (6th) 4; R. v. Gravel, 2013 QCCQ
10482; R. v. Comeau, 2008 QCCQ 4804, aff’d 2009 QCCA 1175; R. v. Côté, 2002 CanLII 27228 (C.Q.); R. v. Morneau, 2009 QCCA 1496; R. v.
Bois, 2005 CanLII 10575 (C.Q.).

[174]                     
In particular, the three cases on which my
colleague relies at para. 70 in support of his conclusion that a term of
imprisonment of six years or more is clearly not excessive all involved
circumstances very different from those of the respondent. In two of the three
cases, there were three victims rather than two; this is a factor that creates
a significant disparity in the sentences in question. In R. v. Wood
(2005), 196 C.C.C. (3d) 155 (Ont. C.A.), for example, the accused, who had a
long criminal record, had killed three people while driving on the wrong side
of the road and without a licence, and while severely intoxicated: his blood
alcohol level had been more than twice the legal limit. In Kummer, too,
the appellant had caused the deaths of three people and bodily harm to
two others, and his blood alcohol level had been more than twice the legal
limit. In Morneau, the third case cited, the accused had three prior
convictions for impaired driving, he had done nothing to obtain treatment for
his drinking problem, his blood alcohol level had been three times the legal
limit and, despite the fact that he had pleaded guilty, he had shown [translation] “great immaturity” and
recklessness: 2009 QCCQ 1271, at para. 15 (CanLII). With respect, I do not
consider these to be proper parallels to justify the sentence the Court of
Appeal found to be excessive in the respondent’s circumstances.

[175]                     
In my view, this analysis leads to two
observations. First, the Court of Appeal did not intervene lightly: by varying
the sentence imposed by the trial judge from 78 to 48 months, the court
reduced it by more than a third. This significant reduction supports the Court
of Appeal’s finding that the sentence was excessive. Second, the sentence
imposed by the Court of Appeal does not itself represent a substantial and
marked departure from the sentences imposed on similar offenders who committed
similar crimes in similar circumstances. On the contrary, it is entirely
consistent with the sentences imposed on offenders with characteristics similar
to those of the respondent. Insofar as the Court of Appeal correctly stated the
law before intervening, I am of the opinion that it is not open to this Court
to substitute its view for that of the Court of Appeal on the sentence. The
Court of Appeal considered the relevant sentencing principles and took the
specific features of the case into account. Although sentences imposed by
provincial appellate courts are not entitled to the same level of deference as
is accorded to sentences imposed by trial judges, they are nonetheless entitled
to deference, since those courts hear appeals against sentence more often than
this Court, which rarely hears them: R. v. R.N.S., 2000 SCC 7, [2000] 1
S.C.R. 149, at para. 23; Proulx, at para. 2. 

B.       Driving Prohibition

[176]                     
Turning to the issue of the driving prohibition,
I agree with my colleague that the Court of Appeal and the trial judge both erred
in failing to take into account the length of the presentence driving
prohibition. In their defence, the issue was not raised until the hearing in
this Court, at which the appellant in fact agreed that it was a relevant
consideration. 

[177]                     
In R. v. Bilodeau, 2013 QCCA 980, I
expressed the opinion that [translation]
“[a]lthough the length of the presentence driving prohibition need not be
subtracted in equal measure, it is nonetheless a factor to be considered in
analyzing the reasonableness and appropriateness of the prohibition to be
imposed under section 259(3.3) (b) Cr. C.”: para. 75
(CanLII). The Ontario Court of Appeal had already expressed a similar view in R.
v. Pellicore, [1997] O.J. No. 226 (QL), at para. 1. The same
reasoning also applies under s. 259(2) (a.1) Cr. C. In
the instant case, I therefore consider it appropriate to reduce the length of
the driving prohibition as my colleague suggests, that is, by the entire period
during which the respondent was subject to a prohibition as part of his release
conditions before being sentenced.

[178]                     
Having said this, I believe that the wording
chosen by the Court of Appeal in determining the length of the prohibition is
consistent with that used by Parliament in s. 259(2) (a.1) Cr. C.
I would retain that wording. My colleague refers either to a period “commencing
at the time of the respondent’s release” (para. 110) or to one “commencing
at the end of the respondent’s incarceration” (para. 121). However, the
“time of the offender’s release” or “the end of the offender’s incarceration”
could sometimes be confusing and could also differ from the “period to which
[an] offender [was] sentenced to imprisonment”, which is the one specifically
referred to in the relevant provisions of the Cr. C. In my opinion,
it would be more prudent to stick to the words chosen by Parliament, as the
Court of Appeal did in its judgment.

[179]                     
In this case, the Court of Appeal [translation] “[prohibited the
respondent] from operating any motor vehicle in Canada for a period of four
years, plus the period to which he [had been] sentenced to imprisonment”:
para. 24. If the length of the presentence driving prohibition (two years
and three months) is taken into account in recalculating the prohibition, the
result is instead a period of one year and nine months (four years minus
two years and three months). This is what I would retain for this aspect of the
sentence.

C.       Fresh Evidence

[180]                     
Finally, I am of the view that the Court of
Appeal did not make an error warranting the intervention of this Court when it
declined to admit the fresh evidence of the respondent’s two breaches of his
recognizances. Those breaches were a failure on his part to be at his residence
as required between 9:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on November 26,
2011, and the fact that he contacted the brother of one of the victims despite
being prohibited from doing so: para. 19. 

[181]                     
The Court of Appeal held that the evidence in
question did not satisfy the fourth condition from Lévesque and Palmer
v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, since, in the court’s estimation, it was
unlikely to affect the result: para. 19. It was appropriate for the Court
of Appeal to distinguish the circumstances of this case from those of Bilodeau.
In that case, the appellant had been convicted of two counts of dangerous driving
causing death, and the fresh evidence concerned a breach of a recognizance
according to which he was not to operate a motor vehicle. As the Court of
Appeal stated in its analysis, that evidence was capable of shedding light on
the risk of his reoffending. The two breaches identified in the case at bar are
very different.

[182]                     
Of course, no breach of a recognizance should be
taken lightly. However, the breaches that the Court of Appeal had to consider
in this case were, all in all, relatively minor, especially when all the
relevant factors are taken into account. It was open to the Court of Appeal to
conclude that the additional evidence was irrelevant in this context. Absent an
error of law or a palpable and overriding error of fact warranting intervention,
this Court should not reconsider the weight attached by the Court of Appeal to
those breaches and substitute its view of what would have been relevant.

III.   
Disposition

[183]                     
For these reasons, I would allow the appeal for
the sole purpose of reducing the respondent’s driving prohibition to one year
and nine months, plus the period of four years to which he was sentenced
to imprisonment.

                    Criminal
law — Offences — Elements of offence — Cheating at play
— Fraud — Accused attempted to rig horse races
by drugging horses — Whether horse race constituted a game for purposes of offence of
cheating at play — Whether
accused’s conduct constituted cheating at play or fraud — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 ,
ss. 197(1)  “game”, 209, 380(1).

                    R
tried to rig two horse races. He was caught drugging one horse and trying to
sneak syringes with drugs into the track for the purpose of doing the same
thing to another. Bets in excess of $5,000 had been placed on both races. R was
charged with cheating while playing a game, defrauding the public, and
attempting to commit the same offences. At trial, he was acquitted. The Court
of Appeal allowed an appeal and set aside the acquittals. It ordered a new
trial on the cheating counts and entered convictions on the fraud counts. 

                    Held:
The appeal should be dismissed.

                    The
Court of Appeal was correct to order a new trial on the charges of cheating
while playing a game. “Game” is defined as “a game of chance or mixed chance and
skill” in s. 197(1)  of the Criminal Code . The Crown had to
establish that a horse race is a game with a systematic resort to chance to
determine outcomes. There was evidence that post position is determined at
random and that certain post positions are more advantageous than others. The
trial judge failed to consider this evidence upon which a trier of fact could
find that there was systematic resort to chance which made the race a game of
mixed chance and skill. Whether the evidence actually establishes this will be
for the trier of fact at the new trial to determine.

                    Fraud
consists of dishonest conduct that results in at least a risk of deprivation to
the victim. Fraudulent conduct for the purposes of a fraud prosecution is not
limited to deception, such as misrepresentations of fact. Rather, fraud
requires proof of deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means. The term “other
fraudulent means” encompasses all other means which can properly be stigmatized
as dishonest. Where the alleged fraudulent act is not in the nature of deceit
or falsehood, the causal link between the dishonest conduct and the deprivation
may not depend on showing that the victim relied on or was induced to act by
the fraudulent act. R’s conduct constituted other fraudulent means because it can
properly be stigmatized as dishonest conduct that caused a risk of deprivation
to the betting public. There is a direct causal relationship between R’s
conduct and a risk of financial deprivation to the betting public. The trial
judge erred in law by finding that the betting public was not put at risk of
deprivation and that any risk of deprivation was too remote.

                    The
trial judge made the necessary findings of fact to support the fraud convictions
entered by the Court of Appeal, including in relation to both required aspects
of the required mens rea of fraud. The trial judge found that R knew
that his acts were dishonest and, in the context of the cheating while playing
a game charges, that he knew that his dishonest conduct put bettors at risk of
deprivation. That, after all, is what cheating is.

judgment of the Court was delivered by

                    Cromwell J. — 

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
This appeal was heard and dismissed, with
reasons to follow, on October 13, 2015. These are the reasons. 

[2]                             
The appellant, Mr. Riesberry, tried to rig two
horse races by drugging two horses. The question at the bottom of this appeal
is whether the provisions of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 ,
under which he was charged can apply to this conduct. 

[3]                             
Mr. Riesberry was a licensed trainer of
Standardbred horses. He was caught on video drugging one horse, and caught
trying to sneak syringes with drugs into the track for the purpose of doing the
same thing to another.  For the drugging caught on tape, he was charged with
cheating while playing a game (a horse race) with the intent to defraud the
public wagering money on its outcome (s. 209  of the Criminal Code ) and
with defrauding the public of money wagered on the outcome of a horse race (s.
380(1) ).  For trying to sneak the drugs into the track, he was charged with
attempting to commit the same offences. At trial, he was acquitted. However,
the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal, set aside the
acquittals on all four counts, ordered a new trial on the cheating and
attempted cheating counts (“cheating counts”) and entered convictions on the
fraud and attempted fraud counts (“fraud counts”): 2014 ONCA 744, 122 O.R. (3d)
594. 

[4]                             
Mr. Riesberry appeals the fraud convictions as
of right and the order for a new trial by leave of the Court. There are four
main issues before us, two concern the cheating counts and two the fraud
counts. 

[5]                             
With respect to the cheating counts, the main
questions are (i) whether the trial judge made a legal error in his interpretation
of what constitutes a “game”; and (ii) whether there was any evidence that
could establish that a horse race is a “game” as defined in s. 197  of the Criminal
Code  for these offences.  I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial
judge erred in this respect and that there was evidence that could establish
that a horse race is a game as defined for these offences.

[6]                             
The two issues in relation to the fraud
convictions are (i) whether the Court of Appeal was wrong to reverse the trial
judge’s finding that the betting public was not put at risk by his conduct; and
(ii) whether, even if the trial judge made that error, the Court of Appeal was
wrong to have entered convictions rather than ordering a new trial. I also
agree with the Court of Appeal’s disposition of these issues.

II.          
Analysis

A.          
Brief Overview of the Facts

[7]                             
At trial, the judge found that, before a race,
Mr. Riesberry injected a horse, “Everyone’s Fantasy”, with epinephrine and/or clenbuterol
for the purpose of enhancing the horse’s performance in the race. The horse
participated in the race and finished sixth. The trial judge also found that,
on a later occasion, Mr. Riesberry tried to bring a syringe loaded with prohibited
drugs onto raceway property at which another horse, “Good Long Life”, was to
race later that day. Mr. Riesberry was arrested and the horse was scratched
from the race. The trial judge found that Mr. Riesberry, as a licensed trainer,
was bound by rules barring possession of syringes and use of the drugs in
question in order to enhance performance: Ontario Racing Commission, Rules
of Standardbred Racing, 2008, r. 10.01(a) and (b). The trial judge also
found that, in both instances, Mr. Riesberry had breached those rules and
attempted to create an unfair advantage for the horses in the race.
Nonetheless, the trial judge acquitted on all charges.

[8]                             
It was undisputed on appeal that bets in excess
of $5,000 had been placed on both races and that the trial judge erred in
saying otherwise: Court of Appeal reasons, at para. 18.

B.           
The Cheating at Play Convictions

[9]                             
With respect to the cheating while playing a
game charges, the trial judge concluded that a horse race is not a game as
defined in the Criminal Code  and therefore the charges were not made
out. The first issue is whether the trial judge erred in law in his legal
interpretation of what constitutes a “game” for the purposes of this offence.


[10]                         
The charges against Mr. Riesberry arise under s.
209  of the Criminal Code  which provides that everyone is guilty of an
offence who, “with intent to defraud any person, cheats while playing a game”.
“Game” is defined as “a game of chance or mixed chance and skill”: s. 197(1) .
It follows that the Crown had to establish that a horse race is a game with at
least some element of chance. The trial judge relied on the U.S. case of Harless
v. United States, 1 Morris 169 (Iowa 1843), to conclude that a horse race
is a game of pure skill. 

[11]                         
It is somewhat unclear to what extent the trial
judge relied on this authority as stating the law in Canada. However, to the
extent that he did so, he made a legal error. The statute considered by the
U.S. court divided games into only two categories, games of chance and games of
skill. That case, therefore, did not address a point that must be addressed
under the Criminal Code . That point is whether horse racing is a game of
mixed chance and skill. The applicable Canadian law on this point is
found in Ross, Banks and Dyson v. The Queen, [1968] S.C.R. 786. There
must be a “systematic resort to chance” to determine outcomes, not merely the
“unpredictables that may occasionally defeat skill”: p. 791.

[12]                         
Even if we were to accept that the trial judge
was alive to this difference between the law as set out in Harless and
Canadian law, he nonetheless erred by failing to consider evidence in the
record upon which a trier of fact could find that there was systematic resort
to chance which made the race a game of mixed chance and skill.  I therefore
conclude that the trial judge erred in law on this aspect of the case.  

[13]                         
The Court of Appeal’s finding of a legal error
at trial does not, on its own, justify setting aside the acquittals and
ordering a new trial. A new trial may be ordered only if the Crown satisfies
the appellate court that the “error (or errors) of the trial judge might
reasonably be thought, in the concrete reality of the case at hand, to have had
a material bearing on the acquittal”: R. v. Graveline, 2006 SCC 16, [2006]
1 S.C.R. 609, at para. 14, per Fish J. for the majority. Whether the Crown has
satisfied this burden is the second issue. The answer depends in this case on
whether there is in the trial record any evidence which could support a finding
that horse racing has a sufficient element of chance to be considered a game of
mixed chance and skill. Mr. Riesberry claims that there is not while the Crown
says that there is.

[14]                         
I agree with the Court of Appeal that the record
at trial contains evidence upon which horse racing, in the present
circumstances, could be found to involve a systematic resort to chance. There
was evidence that post position is determined by a computerized random post
position generator and that certain post positions are more advantageous than
others: Court of Appeal reasons, at para. 41. It follows that the Court of
Appeal was correct to order a new trial on these charges. Of course, whether
the evidence actually establishes this will be for the trier of fact at the new
trial to determine.

[15]                         
Like the Court of Appeal, I would not address on
appeal the Crown’s highly fact-driven alternative position that Mr. Riesberry’s
conduct converted what would otherwise be a game of pure skill into one of
mixed chance and skill.

[16]                         
To conclude on the cheating counts, the Court of
Appeal correctly ordered a new trial on these charges.

C.           
The Fraud Charges

[17]                         
Fraud consists of dishonest conduct that results
in at least a risk of deprivation to the victim. The trial judge found that the
Crown had failed to prove that the betting public was at risk of deprivation
due to Mr. Riesberry’s conduct. The trial judge also found that, even if the
Crown had proved deprivation, there was no proof of any causal connection
between Mr. Riesberry’s actions and any risk of loss of the money wagered by the
betting public. 

[18]                         
The Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal
from the acquittals. On the fraud charges, the court identified a number of
legal errors such that the acquittals had to be set aside. The court also
concluded that if the trial judge had not made these legal errors, he would
have convicted Mr. Riesberry of both fraud counts.

[19]                         
Mr. Riesberry submits first that his conduct did
not put the betting public at risk of deprivation and that any risk of
deprivation was too remote. His second submission is that, even if the trial
judge was wrong about this, the Court of Appeal should not have entered
convictions on the fraud charges, but ought instead to have ordered a new
trial. I will address these points in turn.

(1)          
Did Mr. Riesberry’s Fraudulent Acts Cause a Risk
of Deprivation That Was Not Too Remote?

[20]                         
Like virtually all offences, fraud consists of
two main components, the prohibited act (actus reus) and the required
state of mind (mens rea). Mr. Riesberry’s submission focuses on one of
the two aspects of the actus reus. Those two aspects are: 

1.  . . . an act
of deceit, a falsehood or some other fraudulent means; and

 

2.   deprivation
caused by the prohibited act, which may consist in actual loss or the placing of
the victim’s pecuniary interests at risk. 

 

(R. v.
Théroux, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 5, at p. 20; R. v. Zlatic, [1993] 2 S.C.R.
29, at p. 43)

[21]                         
The issue here concerns the aspect of
deprivation. Mr. Riesberry contends that there was no evidence that his
fraudulent conduct caused any risk of deprivation or that at least any such
risk was too remote from his conduct. He submits that the Crown did not
establish that anyone betting on the race had been induced to bet by, or would
not have bet but for, his fraudulent conduct. 

[22]                         
I cannot accept this position. Contrary to Mr.
Riesberry’s contention, proof of fraud does not always depend on showing that
the alleged victim relied on the fraudulent conduct or was induced
by it to act to his or her detriment. What is required in all cases is proof
that there is a sufficient causal connection between the fraudulent act and the
victim’s risk of deprivation. In some cases, this causal link may be
established by showing that the victim of the fraud acted to his or her
detriment as a result of relying on or being induced to act by the accused’s
fraudulent conduct. But this is not the only way the causal link may be
established. 

[23]                         
We should first be clear about what Mr.
Riesberry’s fraudulent conduct was before turning to the question of whether it
caused a risk of deprivation. Fraudulent conduct for the purposes of a fraud
prosecution is not limited to deception, such as deception by
misrepresentations of fact. Rather, fraud requires proof of “deceit, falsehood
or other fraudulent means”: s. 380(1). The term “other fraudulent means”
encompasses “all other means which can properly be stigmatized as dishonest”: R.
v. Olan, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1175, at p. 1180. The House of Lords made the same
point in Scott v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner, [1975] A.C. 819, a
case approved by the Court in Olan (p. 1181). Fraud, according to
Viscount Dilhorne in Scott, may consist of depriving “a person
dishonestly of something which is his or of something to which he is or would
or might but for the perpetration of the fraud be entitled”: p. 839.  And as
Lord Diplock said, the fraudulent means “need not involve fraudulent
misrepresentation such as is needed to constitute the civil tort of deceit”: ibid.,
at p. 841. 

[24]                         
It follows that where the alleged fraudulent act
is not in the nature of deceit or falsehood, such as a misrepresentation of
fact, the causal link between the dishonest conduct and the deprivation may not
depend on showing that the victim relied on or was induced to act by the
fraudulent act. This is such a case. 

[25]                         
Mr. Riesberry injected and attempted to inject the
racehorses with performance-enhancing substances. The use of such drugs is
prohibited and trainers such as Mr. Riesberry are prohibited even from
possessing loaded syringes at a racetrack. This conduct constituted “other
fraudulent means” because in the highly regulated setting in which he acted,
that conduct can “properly be stigmatized as dishonest”: Olan, at
p. 1180. He carried out these dishonest acts for the purpose of affecting the
outcome of two horse races on which members of the public placed bets.  His
dishonest acts, therefore, were intended to and in one case actually did result
in the possibility that a horse that might otherwise have won would not. The
conduct therefore caused a risk of deprivation to the betting public: it
created the risk of betting on a horse that, but for Mr. Riesberry’s dishonest
acts, might have won and led to a payout to the persons betting on that horse.
To return to Viscount Dilhorne’s words in Scott, Mr. Riesberry’s
dishonest conduct created a risk that bettors would be deprived dishonestly of
something which, but for the dishonest act, they might have obtained. 

[26]                         
There is a direct causal relationship between
Mr. Riesberry’s dishonest acts and the risk of financial deprivation to the
betting public. Simply put, a rigged race creates a risk of prejudice to the
economic interests of bettors. Provided that a causal link exists, the absence
of inducement or reliance is irrelevant. I agree with the Court of Appeal that
Mr. Riesberry’s reliance on Vézina and
Côté v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 2, is misplaced.
That case made it clear that 

[f]raud
consists of being dishonest for the purpose of obtaining an advantage and which
results in prejudice or a risk of prejudice to someone’s “property, money or
valuable security”. There is no need to target a victim . . . and the victim
may not be ascertained. [p. 19] 

[27]                         
This statement covers what Mr. Riesberry did.

[28]                         
I conclude that the trial judge erred in law by
finding that the betting public was not put at risk of deprivation by Mr.
Riesberry’s dishonest acts and that any risk of deprivation was too remote.

(2)          
Was the Court of Appeal Wrong to Enter Convictions
Rather Than Order a New Trial?

[29]                         
Mr. Riesberry submits that the Court of Appeal
erred by entering convictions because the trial judge had not made all of the
necessary findings of fact to support those convictions: see R. v. Cassidy,
[1989] 2 S.C.R. 345, at pp. 354-55. These submissions focus on what Mr.
Riesberry contends is the absence of the necessary findings of fact in relation
to the mental element or mens rea of fraud. 

[30]                         
The mental element of fraud consists of two
states of mind: 

1.     
subjective knowledge of the prohibited act; and

 

2.   subjective knowledge that the prohibited act could have as a consequence
the deprivation of another (which deprivation may consist in knowledge that the
victim’s pecuniary interests are put at risk).

 

(Théroux,
at p. 20; Zlatic, at p. 43)

[31]                         
Mr. Riesberry’s position is that the trial judge,
having dismissed the fraud charges on the basis of no proof of the actus
reus, did not go on to make findings in relation to these two aspects of
the required mens rea. However, I agree with the Court of Appeal that
the trial judge in fact did make the necessary findings. 

[32]                         
There can be no doubt that the trial judge found
that Mr. Riesberry knew that his acts were dishonest, which is the first aspect
of the mens rea. The trial judge found that his conduct was for the
purpose of enhancing his horses’ performances, not for any legitimate medical
purpose. As for the second aspect, the trial judge held, in his analysis of the
same record in the context of the cheating while playing a game charges, that
Mr. Riesberry’s conduct amounted to cheating. In other words, he intended to
create an unfair advantage for his horses in their races. This is a finding of
fact that Mr. Riesberry knew that his dishonest conduct put bettors at risk of
deprivation.  That, after all, is what cheating is.

(3)          
Conclusion

[33]                         
In my view, Mr. Riesberry’s submissions in
relation to the fraud charges cannot be accepted.

III.

                    APPEAL
from a judgment of the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal (Welsh, Barry
and Hoegg JJ.A.), 2013 NLCA 51, 339 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 248, 1054 A.P.R. 248,
[2013] N.J. No. 267 (QL), 2013 CarswellNfld 286, upholding the accused’s
conviction for aggravated assault.  Appeal dismissed.

 

                    Keir O’Flaherty and Bob Buckingham, for the appellant.

 

                    Iain R. W. Hollett, for the respondent.

 

                    The
judgment of the Court was delivered orally by

 

[1]               Abella J. — The critical issue at trial was whether Mr. Vokurka
intentionally inflicted the victim’s injuries. The majority in the Court of
Appeal found that the trial judge’s findings of fact, inferences drawn from
those facts, and the finding of guilt were reasonable.  

 

[2]               The
dissenting judge was of the view that the trial judge erred in failing to
adequately consider and explain why, in her view, the “equally plausible
explanation” supporting the defence of accident was not accepted.  We do not
agree, and agree instead with the majority that the trial judge adequately
explained why he rejected the possibility of accident and found that the charge
was proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  The trial judge set out the evidence of
the victim’s statements, a doctor’s expert evidence about the nature of the
wound, and the victim’s reaction to being cut, all of which led him clearly to
the view that there was no “equally plausible explanation” for the
cutting. He reviewed the relevant evidence and set out his reasons for
concluding beyond a reasonable doubt that the injuries were intentionally
inflicted. His inferences were reasonably supported by the evidence. Like the
majority in the Court of Appeal, we see no error on his approach. It was not
open to the dissenting judge, with respect, to reweigh the evidence by
substituting her own view of it. The
appeal is therefore dismissed.

on appeal from the court
of appeal for nova scotia

                    Criminal
law — Offences — Sexual assault — Consent — Complainant consenting to sexual
activity with male partner unaware that he had sabotaged condom — Whether
evidence establishing that there was no voluntary agreement of the complainant
to engage in the sexual activity in question or whether complainant’s apparent
consent was vitiated by fraud — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 ,
ss. 265(3) (c), 273.1(1) .

                    The
complainant agreed to sexual activity with her partner, H, insisting that he
use a condom in order to prevent conception.  Unknown to her, H had poked holes
in the condom and the complainant became pregnant.  H was charged with
aggravated sexual assault.  The trial judge found that the complainant had not
consented to unprotected sex and convicted H of sexual assault.  On appeal, the
majority upheld the conviction on the basis that condom protection was an
“essential feature” of the sexual activity, and therefore the complainant did
not consent to the “sexual activity in question”.  The dissenting judge held
that there was consent to the “sexual activity in question”, but that a new
trial was required to determine whether consent was vitiated by fraud.

                    Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

                    Per McLachlin C.J. and Rothstein, Cromwell and Wagner JJ.:  The
Criminal Code  sets out a two-step process for analyzing consent to
sexual activity. The first step is to determine whether the evidence
establishes that there was no “voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage
in the sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1)  and it requires
proof that the complainant did not voluntarily agree to the touching, its
sexual nature, or the identity of the partner. If the complainant consented, or
her conduct raises a reasonable doubt about the lack of voluntary agreement to
the sexual activity in question, the second step is to consider under ss. 265(3) 
and 273.1(2)  whether there are any circumstances that may vitiate the
complainant’s ostensible consent or participation.  In this case, the main
issue is whether condom sabotage resulted in there being no “voluntary
agreement by the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question”
under s. 273.1(1)  or whether the condom sabotage constituted fraud
under s. 265(3) (c), with the result that no consent was obtained. Resolving
this issue requires the Court to determine the meaning of the “sexual activity
in question” in s. 273.1(1) .

                    There
are essentially two approaches to determining the meaning of what constitutes
voluntary agreement to the sexual activity in question and the role of mistake
or deception in determining whether such agreement existed.  The first approach
defines the “sexual activity in question” as extending beyond the basic sexual
activity the complainant thought she was consenting to at the time to
conditions and qualities of the act or risks and consequences flowing from it,
provided these conditions are “essential features” of the sexual activity or go
to “how” the physical touching was carried out.  The second approach defines
“the sexual activity in question” more narrowly as the basic physical act
agreed to at the time, its sexual nature, and the identity of the partner.  If
the complainant subjectively agreed to the partner’s touching and its sexual
nature, voluntary agreement is established under s. 273.1(1) .  That
voluntary agreement, however, may not be legally effective. 

                    The
primary tools of statutory construction including the plain words of the
provisions, the scheme of the provisions and the legislative history support a
narrow interpretation of the basic definition of consent in s. 273.1(1) . The
jurisprudence and the provisions also support this interpretation. This Court
has interpreted the fraud provision in s. 265(3) (c) of the Criminal
Code  in the context of HIV non‑disclosure cases: Cuerrier; Mabior. 
The adoption of the “essential features”/“how the act was carried out” approach
would be inconsistent with the approach adopted in Cuerrier and Mabior
and would put the outcome in those cases in question.  Under the “essential
features”/“how the act was carried out” approach, mistakes — they need not be
deceptions — about conditions and qualities of the physical act will result in
a finding of no consent under s. 273.1(1)  even in the absence of risk of
harm.  For example, there would be no consent found under s. 273.1(1)  in
cases involving deception about HIV status, even where the accused had a low
viral load and condom protection was used.  Finally, adopting the “essential
features” or “how the physical act was carried out” approach would re-introduce
a vague and unclear test for consent, and could also criminalize conduct that
lacks the necessary reprehensible character, casting the net of the criminal
law too broadly. 

                    Properly
interpreted, voluntary agreement to the sexual activity in question in s. 273.1(1) 
means that the complainant must subjectively agree to the specific physical
act itself, its sexual nature and the specific identity of the partner. The
“sexual activity in question” does not include conditions or qualities of the
physical act, such as birth control measures or the presence of sexually
transmitted diseases.  Here, the “sexual activity in question” was sexual
intercourse and the complainant voluntarily agreed to it.  On the question of
whether her agreement to the “sexual activity in question” was vitiated by
fraud, the dishonesty is evident and admitted.  The only remaining issue is
whether there was a sufficient deprivation to establish fraud.  Where a
complainant has chosen not to become pregnant, deceptions that expose her to an
increased risk of becoming pregnant may constitute a sufficiently serious
deprivation to vitiate consent under s. 265(3) (c).  This application
of “fraud” under s. 265(3) (c) is consistent with Charter
values of equality and autonomy, while recognizing that not every deception
that induces consent should be criminalized. In this case, there was no consent
by reason of fraud, pursuant to s. 265(3) (c).

                    Per Abella, Moldaver and Karakatsanis JJ.:  At its core, this case
concerns the right recognized in R. v. Ewanchuk, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330,
to determine how sexual activity will take place.  Society’s commitment to
protecting a person’s autonomy and dignity requires that individuals have the
right to determine who touches their body, and how the touching
will occur.  This protection underlies the definition of consent set out in
s. 273.1(1)  as “the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in
the sexual activity in question”.  Consent to the “sexual activity in question”
necessarily means the complainant’s voluntary agreement both to engage in
touching of a sexual nature and to the manner in which that touching is carried
out.  The starting point for the analysis of consent under the actus reus
of sexual assault is s. 273.1(1) .  When a complainant does not voluntarily
agree to the sexual activity which occurred, consent does not exist within the
meaning of s. 273.1(1) , and the inquiry for the purposes of the actus
reus of sexual assault is complete.  If there is no consent ab
initio, it is pointless to inquire whether there was fraud under s. 265(3) (c)
which would have vitiated the complainant’s consent.  In other words, without
voluntary agreement as to the “how” — the manner in which the sexual activity
in question occurred — there is no consent within the meaning of s. 273.1(1) .


                    Unlike
under s. 265(3) (c), which requires both a dishonest act and
a deprivation, consent under s. 273.1(1)  has never
required an analysis of the risks or consequences caused by unwanted sexual
touching.  It is the unwanted nature of non-consensual sexual activity that
violates the complainant’s sexual integrity and gives rise to culpability under
the criminal law, not just the risk of further harm that the sexual touching
may create.  Requiring an analysis of the risks or consequences of non-consensual
touching by applying s. 265(3) (c) whenever deception is later
discovered, adds a barrier to the simple ability to demonstrate whether the
activity which occurred was agreed to when it occurred.  It thereby
undermines the values of personal autonomy and physical integrity sought to be
protected by making sexual assault an offence.

                    It
does not follow that because a condom is a form of birth control, it is not
also part of the sexual activity.  Removing the use of a condom from the meaning of sexual activity in
s. 273.1(1)  because the condom may have been intended for contraceptive
purposes, means that an individual has no right to
require the use of a condom during intercourse where pregnancy is not at
issue.  All individuals must have an equal right to determine how they are
touched, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, reproductive capacity, or
the type of sexual activity they choose to engage in.  By any definition, when
someone uses a condom, it is part of the sexual activity.  It is therefore part
of what is — or is not — consented to.  When individuals agree to sexual
activity with a condom, they mean an intact condom.  They are not merely
agreeing to a sexual activity, they are agreeing to how it should take
place.  That is what s. 273.1(1)  was intended to protect. 

                    A
person consents to how she will be touched, and she is entitled
to decide what sexual activity she agrees to engage in for whatever reason she
wishes. The fact that some of the consequences of her motives are more serious
than others, such as pregnancy, does not in the slightest undermine her right
to decide how the sexual activity she chooses to engage in is carried out.  It
is neither her partner’s business nor the state’s.  The complainant’s voluntary
agreement to the manner in which the sexual touching is carried out, requires
the complainant’s consent to where on her body she was touched and with what. 
It does not, however, require consent to the consequences of that touching, or
the characteristics of the sexual partner, such as age, wealth, marital status,
or health.  These consequences or characteristics, while undoubtedly
potentially significant, are not part of the actual physical activity that is
agreed to.  

                    In
this case, the question is not whether consent was vitiated by fraud.  It is
whether there was consent to the sexual activity in the first place.  The
complainant agreed to engage in sexual activity in a certain manner, that is,
sexual intercourse with an intact condom.  H deliberately sabotaged the condom
without her knowledge or agreement.  The fact that she only learned of the
deliberate sabotaging after the sexual activity took place, is of no
relevance.  What is relevant is what sexual activity she agreed to engage in
with H and whether he stuck to the bargain.  In this case, he did not.  Since
the complainant did not agree to how she was touched at the time it occurred, consent
within the meaning of s. 273.1(1)  did not exist.

Introduction

[1]                             
Control over the sexual
activity one engages in lies at the core of human dignity and autonomy: R. v. Ewanchuk, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330, at
para. 28. This principle underlies the offences of assault and sexual assault.
Sexual activity without consent is a crime under the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 . 

[2]                             
In this case, the complainant consented to
sexual activity with a condom to prevent conception.  Unknown to her at the
time, her partner, Mr. Hutchinson,   poked holes in the condom and the
complainant became pregnant.  Mr. Hutchinson was charged with aggravated sexual
assault. The complainant said that she did not consent to unprotected sex. The
trial judge agreed and convicted Mr. Hutchinson of sexual assault (2011 NSSC
361, 311 N.S.R. (2d) 1).  The majority of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, per
MacDonald C.J.N.S., upheld the conviction on the basis that condom protection
was an essential feature of the sexual activity, and therefore the complainant
did not consent to the “sexual activity in question”.  Farrar J.A., dissenting,
held that there was consent to the sexual activity, but that a new trial was
required to determine whether consent was vitiated by fraud (2013 NSCA 1, 325
N.S.R. (2d) 95). 

[3]                             
The immediate problem is how cases such as this
fall to be resolved under the provisions of the Criminal Code .  This is
an issue of statutory interpretation.  Underlying this is a broader question —
where should the line between criminality and non-criminality be drawn when
consent is the result of deception? 

[4]                             
The Criminal Code  sets out a two-step process for analyzing consent to sexual
activity. The first step is to determine whether the evidence establishes that
there was no “voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual
activity in question” under s. 273.1(1) . If the complainant consented, or her
conduct raises a reasonable doubt about the lack of consent, the second step is
to consider whether there are any circumstances that may vitiate her apparent
consent. Section 265(3)  defines a series of conditions under which the law
deems an absence of consent, notwithstanding the complainant’s ostensible consent
or participation: Ewanchuk, at para. 36. Section 273.1(2)  also lists
conditions under which no consent is obtained. For example, no consent is
obtained in circumstances of coercion (s. 265(3) (a) and (b)),
fraud (s. 265(3) (c)), or abuse of trust or authority (ss. 265(3) (d)
and 273.1(2) (c)).  

[5]                             
We conclude that the
first step requires proof that the complainant did not voluntarily agree to the
touching, its sexual nature, or the identity of the partner.   Mistakes on the
complainant’s part (however caused) in relation to other matters, such as
whether the partner is using effective birth control or has a sexually
transmitted disease, are not relevant at this stage. However, mistakes
resulting from deceptions in relation to other matters may negate consent at
the second stage of the analysis, under the fraud provision in s. 265(3) (c)
of the Criminal Code .

[6]                             
Applying this template to the facts in this case
leads us to conclude that, at the first step, the complainant voluntarily
agreed to the sexual activity in question at the time that it occurred.  The
question is whether that consent was vitiated because she had been deceived as
to the condition of the condom.  This question is addressed at the second
step.  The accused’s condom sabotage constituted fraud within s. 265(3) (c),
with the result that no consent was obtained.  We would therefore affirm the
conviction and dismiss the appeal.

II.          
The Provisions of the Criminal Code 

[7]                             
Section 265(1)  of the Criminal Code  establishes
the general offence of assault:

                              265. (1) A person commits an assault when

 

                              (a) without the consent of
another person, he applies force intentionally to that other person, directly
or indirectly;

 

                              (b) he attempts or threatens,
by an act or a gesture, to apply force to another person, if he has, or causes
that other person to believe on reasonable grounds that he has, present ability
to effect his purpose; or

 

                              (c) while openly wearing or
carrying a weapon or an imitation thereof, he accosts or impedes another person
or begs.

[8]                             
Section 265(2) states
that this section applies to all forms of assault, including sexual assault. 

[9]                             
The offence of sexual assault is created by s.
271 :

                              271. Everyone who commits a sexual assault is guilty of

 

                              (a) an indictable offence and
is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years and, if the
complainant is under the age of 16 years, to a minimum punishment of
imprisonment for a term of one year; or

 

                              (b) an offence punishable on
summary conviction and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 18
months and, if the complainant is under the age of 16 years, to a minimum
punishment of imprisonment for a term of 90 days.

[10]                         
Section 273.1(1)  defines “consent” as follows:

                             273.1 (1)
Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 265(3) , “consent” means, for the
purposes of sections 271 , 272  and 273 , the voluntary agreement of the
complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question.

[11]                         
These provisions define
the basic offence of sexual assault.  They are supplemented by two additional
sets of provisions which give a non-exhaustive list of circumstances in which no
consent is obtained.  Section 265(3) , which applies to all assaults, lists four
such situations involving the accused’s abuse of authority and use of force,
fear and fraud:

                             265. . . . 

 

                             (3)  For the purposes of this section,
no consent is obtained where the complainant submits or does not resist by
reason of

 

                              (a) the application of force to
the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;

 

                              (b) threats or fear of the
application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;

 

                              (c) fraud; or

 

                              (d) the exercise of authority.

[12]                         
Section 273.1(2) lists
five non-exhaustive situations where no consent is obtained for purposes of the
sexual assault offences:

                             273.1 . . .


 

                             (2) No consent is obtained, for the
purposes of sections 271 , 272  and 273 , where

 

                              (a) the agreement is
expressed by the words or conduct of a person other than the complainant;

 

                              (b) the complainant is
incapable of consenting to the activity;

 

                              (c) the accused induces the
complainant to engage in the activity by abusing a position of trust, power or
authority;

 

                              (d) the complainant
expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in the activity;
or

 

                              (e) the complainant, having
consented to engage in sexual activity, expresses, by words or conduct, a lack
of agreement to continue to engage in the activity.

[13]                         
Section 273.1(1) makes
the definition of “consent” for the purposes of sexual assault “[s]ubject to”
subsection (2) and to s. 265(3) . Thus, s. 273.1(1) does not replace the
circumstances of no consent in ss. 273.1(2)  and 265(3) . Fraud, for example,
continues to negate consent to sexual assault, pursuant to s. 265(3) (c).


III.       
Issue

[14]                         
The main issue here is
whether the Crown proved that the complainant did not consent to the sexual
touching by the appellant. Did the condom sabotage, as the majority of the
Court of Appeal held, result in there being no “voluntary agreement of the
complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1)  of
the Criminal Code ? Or should the condom sabotage be analyzed, as the
dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal concluded, under the fraud provision in
s. 265(3) (c) of the Criminal Code ?  

[15]                         
Resolving this issue
requires this Court to determine the meaning of the “sexual activity in
question” in s. 273.1(1) . 

[16]                         
The basic rule of statutory interpretation is that “the words of an Act are to be read in their
entire context, in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the
scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament”: R.
Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (5th ed. 2008), at
 p. 1. The task is to determine the intent of Parliament, insofar as this
can be done, by looking at the words used and the scheme and object of the
provision.  Every part of a provision or set of provisions should be given
meaning if possible:  Sullivan, at p. 210.

IV.       
Analysis

A.          
Sexual Autonomy and the Criminal Law: Overview

[17]                         
The sexual assault offences invoke the criminal law to protect sexual autonomy. The Criminal
Code  and jurisprudence establish a high level of protection of the right to
choose whether to engage in sexual activity and with whom.  The absence of
consent to sexual activity, as part of the actus reus of the offence, is
judged subjectively from the complainant’s point of view: Ewanchuk, at
paras. 25-26. Consent cannot be implied, must coincide with the sexual
activity, and may be withdrawn at any time.  Additionally, no consent is
obtained if the apparent agreement to the sexual activity is obtained by
coercion, fraud or abuse of authority.  (We note that this is a case of
apparent agreement — the complainant subjectively agreed at the time sexual
intercourse occurred.  This is not a case where there was no such
agreement.  The question is whether, in spite of that agreement, no consent was
obtained in law because that agreement was obtained as a result of Mr.
Hutchinson’s deceit about the condition of the condom.)  Individually and
collectively, these features of sexual assault law protect Canadians’ sexual
autonomy. 

[18]                         
But the law has long recognized that there are
limits on how completely it may fulfil that objective through the blunt
instrument of the criminal law. As the most serious interference by the state
with peoples’ lives and liberties, the criminal law should be used with appropriate
restraint, to avoid over-criminalization.  It draws a line between conduct
deserving the harsh sanction of the criminal law, and conduct that is
undesirable or unethical but “lacks the reprehensible character of criminal
acts”: R. v. Cuerrier, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 371, at para. 133; A. Wertheimer,
Consent to Sexual Relations (2003).  The companion of restraint is certainty. 
The criminal law must provide fair notice of what is prohibited and clear
standards for enforcement: R. v. Mabior, 2012 SCC 47, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584, at paras. 14 and 19. 

[19]                         
The need for restraint and certainty, which
sometimes work at cross-purposes to absolute protection of sexual autonomy, has
influenced the law’s approach to consent, particularly where consent has been
obtained by deception.

B.           
Interpreting the Provisions: Two Approaches 

[20]                         
There are essentially
two approaches to the question of what constitutes “voluntary agreement . . .
to . . . the sexual activity in question” and the role of mistake or deception
in determining whether such agreement existed.

[21]                         
The first approach,
which has many variants, defines the “sexual activity in question” as extending
beyond the basic sexual activity the complainant thought she was consenting to
at the time to conditions and qualities of the act or risks and consequences
flowing from it, provided these conditions are “essential features” of the
sexual activity (reasons of the majority of the Court of Appeal, at paras. 71
and 81) or go to “how” the physical touching was carried out (reasons of Abella
and Moldaver JJ.).  Under this approach, whether a complainant’s mistake
prevents voluntary agreement to the sexual activity under s. 273.1(1)  depends
on the nature of the mistake. The difficulty with this approach, as we shall
see, is that it provides no clear line between mistakes that result in no
consent under s. 273.1(1) , and mistakes that do not.  The result of this lack
of clarity may be inappropriate criminalization and uncertainty in the law. 

[22]                         
The second approach
defines the “sexual activity in question” more narrowly as the basic physical
act agreed to at the time, its sexual nature, and the identity of the partner. 
If the complainant subjectively agreed to the partner’s touching and its sexual
nature, voluntary agreement is established under s. 273.1(1)  of the Criminal
Code .  That voluntary agreement, however, may not be legally effective. The
Code also sets out a number of situations in which, notwithstanding
apparent agreement, no consent is obtained. In particular, deceptions may
negate consent if they meet the requirements for fraud under s. 265(3) (c).


[23]                         
The choice between these
approaches is a matter of statutory construction.  Which approach is correct
depends on (1) the wording, scheme and object of the provisions of the Criminal
Code ; (2) the jurisprudence on the provisions and their common law
predecessors; and (3) the underlying objectives of the criminal law.  We will
consider each of these in turn.

(1) The Wording,
Scheme and Object of the Legislation and the Scheme of the Provisions

[24]                         
The plain words of the provisions, read in their ordinary and natural sense, support a narrow
interpretation of the basic definition of “consent” in s.  273.1(1) . The
ordinary meaning of the “sexual activity in question” is the physical act
agreed to; there is nothing in the wording to suggest that it includes the
conditions or qualifications of the sexual act.   

[25]                         
The scheme of the provisions — a basic
definition of “consent” in s. 273.1(1) , coupled with circumstances vitiating
such agreement in s. 265(3)  and s. 273.1(2)  — also supports a narrow
interpretation of “voluntary agreement . . . to . . . the sexual activity in
question”.  

[26]                         
The “essential features”
approach of the Court of Appeal and the “how the physical act is carried out”
approach of Abella and Moldaver JJ. do not conform to this two-part scheme. The
fraud provision in s. 265(3) (c) deals with situations where consent to
the sexual activity has been given because of a deception by the accused. But
under these approaches, all deceptions about “essential features” of the sexual
activity or about “how” the sexual activity was carried out would result in a
finding of no consent to the “sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1) .
Many deceptions would be dealt with at the first step under s. 273.1(1) , rather
than where the scheme of the Criminal Code  suggests they should be dealt
with, under s. 265(3) (c). Section 273.1(1)  would do most of the work
that the fraud provision was intended to do, rendering the fraud provision in
s. 265(3) (c) redundant in many cases, contrary to the principle that
every word and provision in a statute has a meaning and a function.

[27]                         
Finally, the object of
s. 273.1, as revealed by its legislative history, does not support a broad
reading of the “sexual activity in question”.  The definition of “consent” in
s. 273.1 was part of a parcel of amendments added to the Criminal Code 
in 1992, intended to address Parliament’s concerns about sexual violence
against women and children and to promote and ensure the full protection of s.
7  and s. 15  Charter  rights (see the preamble to Bill C-49, containing
the 1992 Criminal Code  amendments, S.C. 1992, c. 38). The centerpiece of
the revisions was a new provision narrowing the defence of honest belief of
consent. An accused who chooses to rely on the defence of honest belief of
consent is required to take reasonable steps to ascertain that the complainant
was consenting. Parliament’s intention was to “overcome the apparent
unwillingness by some to let go of the debunked notion that unless a
complainant physically resisted or expressed verbal opposition to sexual
activity, an accused was entitled to assume that consent existed”: R. v.
Ewanchuk, 1998 ABCA 52, 57 Alta. L.R. (3d) 235, at para. 58.  Section 273.1
therefore signalled that the focus should be on whether the complainant
positively affirmed her consent to the “sexual activity in question”.  There
was no suggestion that Parliament intended to expand the notion of “sexual
activity” by including not only the sexual act for which consent is required,
but also potentially infinite collateral conditions, such as the state of the condom.

[28]                         
In summary, the primary
tools of statutory construction all point to a rejection of the broad
interpretation of the “sexual activity in question” under the “essential
features”/“how the act was carried out” approach. 

          (2) The Jurisprudence

[29]                         
This Court has
interpreted the fraud provision in s. 265(3) (c) of the Criminal Code 
in the context of HIV non-disclosure cases: Cuerrier; Mabior. In
our view, adoption of the “essential features”/“how the act was carried out”
approach would put the outcomes in those cases in question and replace the
clarity and restraint achieved by those decisions with confusion and
over-criminalization. 

[30]                         
Initially, the common
law of fraud in sexual relations focussed on the nature of the deceit and asked
whether it went to certain “essential” characteristics of the act. If the
deception went to the sexual nature of the act or the identity of the partner,
it was said to vitiate consent: R. v. Clarence (1888), 22 Q.B.D. 23 (Cr.
Cas. Res.).  This test was incorporated into Canada’s first Criminal Code  in
1892 (S.C. 1892, c. 29). Parliament restricted deceptions vitiating consent to
“false and fraudulent representations as to the nature and quality of the act”
(ss. 259(b) and 266).  The formulation, however, did little to bring
certainty or rationality to the law of consent to sexual activity.  The problem
was where and how to draw the line between those aspects of the sexual activity
that went to the “nature and quality of the act” and those that did not: A.
Hooper, “Fraud in Assault and Rape” (1968), 3 U.B.C. L. Rev. 117, at p.
121.  Simply put, the “nature and quality of the act” did not show courts where
to draw the line — or even help them to do so —  between deceptions that did
and did not vitiate consent.

[31]                         
In view of this unsatisfactory state of affairs,
the Criminal Code  in relation to sexual offences was overhauled in 1983.
In 1983, the language of the “nature and quality of the act” was dropped and
the language of the present s. 265(3) (c) was adopted so that “no consent
is obtained where the complainant submits or does not resist by reason of . . .
fraud” — without any specification of the nature of the deception (S.C.
1980-81-82-83, c. 125, s. 19 ).

[32]                         
While for a time
Canadian courts continued to apply a restrictive interpretation of fraud,
influenced by the earlier jurisprudence concerning the “false and fraudulent
representations as to the nature and quality of the act”, the law of fraud in
relation to sexual assault, as we shall see, had a new beginning in Canadian
law with the Court’s judgment in Cuerrier. 

[33]                         
Three aspects of Cuerrier are
particularly important. First, the majority held that the concept of fraud in
the new s. 265(3) (c) was not restricted to deceptions as to the nature
and quality of the act: para. 108. The former jurisprudence was rejected as
being too restrictive, but at the same time, the majority recognized that some
limitations on the concept of fraud are clearly necessary: para. 135.  

[34]                         
Second, the majority
introduced an analysis of fraud that required two elements to be present before
consent was vitiated by fraud: deceit and injury or, expressed differently,
dishonesty and deprivation or risk of deprivation: Cuerrier, at paras.
110-16. With only two narrow exceptions that we will discuss shortly, consent
will be vitiated by fraud only when consent is obtained by lies or
deliberate failure to disclose coupled with a significant risk of
serious bodily harm as a result of the sexual touching:  paras. 125-39. As Cory
J. wrote for the majority, at para. 135: 

The existence of fraud should not
vitiate consent unless there is a significant risk of serious harm.  Fraud
which leads to consent to a sexual act but which does not have that significant
risk might ground a civil action. However, it should not provide the foundation
for a conviction for sexual assault.  The fraud required to vitiate consent
for that offence must carry with it the risk of serious harm. [Emphasis
added.]

[35]                         
Third, the majority
accepted that the traditional notion of fraud in relation to the nature and
quality of the act and the identity of the partner would continue to vitiate
consent: Cuerrier, at para. 118. We understand this to mean that
deceptions in relation to the sexual nature of the act and the identity of the
partner (narrowly defined) vitiate consent without proof that the sexual
activity gave rise to the risk of serious bodily harm.

[36]                         
The basic architecture of this approach was very
recently approved by the Court in Mabior. The Court said: 

. . . the
Cuerrier approach is in principle valid.  It carves out an
appropriate area for the criminal law — one restricted to “significant risk of
serious bodily harm”.  It reflects the Charter  values of autonomy,
liberty and equality, and the evolution of the common law, appropriately
excluding the Clarence line of authority.  The test’s approach to
consent accepts the wisdom of the common law that not every deception that
leads to sexual intercourse should be criminalized, while still according
consent meaningful scope. [Emphasis added; para. 58.]

[37]                         
The Court in Mabior explained how the Cuerrier
test applies to deceptions about HIV status. The Court concluded that HIV
non-disclosure will not vitiate consent under s. 265(3) (c) if (1) the
accused’s viral load at the time of sexual relations was low; and (2) condom
protection was used. Notably, voluntary agreement to the sexual activity, under
s. 273.1(1)  was not in issue; the case proceeded on the basis that there had
been subjective consent to the sexual touching at the time it had occurred and
the only issue was whether fraud vitiated consent under s. 265(3) (c). 

[38]                         
An approach that asks
whether the deception went to an “essential feature” of the act or “how the
sexual act was carried out” is inconsistent with the Court’s approach in Cuerrier
and Mabior.  Consider two hypotheticals.  In the first, the accused lies
about the fact that the condom has holes in it so that the complainant who
insists that he uses a condom will consent to the sexual activity.  In the
second, the accused lies about his HIV status so that the complainant will
consent to have sex without a condom.  From a legal perspective, what is the
difference between, on one hand, deceiving the complainant about the condition
of the condom and creating a risk of pregnancy, and on the other hand,
deceiving the complainant about HIV status so that she will agree to
unprotected sex?  Since Cuerrier, it is clear that the latter situation
must be analyzed under the fraud provision in s. 265(3) (c) of the Criminal
Code .  Why then not the former? Consistency and certainty in the law
require that both situations be treated the same. 

[39]                         
Both the Court of Appeal majority’s approach and
the approach proposed by Abella and Moldaver JJ. are also fundamentally at odds
with the holdings in Cuerrier and Mabior that apparent consent is
vitiated by fraud only where there is both deception and deprivation. Under the
Court of Appeal’s approach and that of our colleagues, mistakes — they need not
be deceptions — about conditions and qualities of the physical act will result
in a finding of no consent under s. 273.1(1)  even in the absence of harm or
risk of harm. This is contrary to the fundamental point made in Cuerrier
and affirmed in Mabior: “The fraud required to vitiate consent for that
offence must carry with it the risk of serious harm” (Cuerrier, at
para. 135).

[40]                         
These inconsistencies
are not merely semantic — they may affect outcomes under the “essential
features”/“how the act was carried out” approach. HIV status may well be an
“essential feature” of the sexual activity under the Court of Appeal majority’s
approach. It could also be characterized as part of the “how” under Abella and
Moldaver JJ.’s approach. If the use of an intact condom goes to the manner in
which the sexual activity occurred, why not the exchange of diseased fluids?
Thus, under these approaches, deceptions about HIV status could result in a
finding of no consent under s. 273.1(1) , even where the accused had a
low viral load at the relevant time and condom protection was used. That
conclusion, however, would be in direct conflict with Cuerrier and Mabior.


[41]                         
In short, adopting the “essential features”/“how
the act was carried out” approaches would make the law inconsistent, highly
formalistic and unduly uncertain.  The law would be
inconsistent because there is no reason in principle to analyze a case of a lie
that obtains consent to unprotected sex and a lie as to the condition of a
condom differently.  It is highly formalistic because an error with respect to
any essential feature or “physical” element, presumably including whether a
condom is of a certain make or design, would vitiate consent while lies on
matters relating to the physical safety of the complainant would not, absent an
actual risk or harm.  It is uncertain because, as we shall see, it is difficult
to tell which matters form part of the “essential features” or the “how” and
which do not. 

(3)        Underlying Objectives of the Criminal Law: Restraint
and Certainty

[42]                         
Our jurisprudence has
consistently confirmed that in interpreting criminal law provisions, the twin
watchwords of restraint and clarity must inform the inquiry.  In Cuerrier
and Mabior, this Court narrowly limited the sorts of deceptions that
vitiate consent in order to create certainty in the law and limit criminal
liability to serious, reprehensible conduct. The Court held that deceptions
with respect to anything other than the sexual nature of the act or the
identity of the partner will only vitiate consent if there is dishonesty which
gives rise to a risk of physical harm, beyond the injury inherent in being lied
to in order to induce consent. This jurisprudence provides a clear line between
criminal and non-criminal conduct and avoids over-criminalization. Adopting the
“essential features” or “how the physical act was carried out” approach would
undercut the important objectives achieved by the Court’s jurisprudence.  These
approaches re-introduce a vague and unclear test for consent and broaden the
scope for criminalization, including for HIV non-disclosure, thus effectively
reversing this Court’s efforts to restrain and clarify the scope of
criminalization in those circumstances in Cuerrier and Mabior.


[43]                         
The Court of Appeal
majority’s “essential features” approach is inherently uncertain and prone to
over-criminalization.  Historically, such approaches have proven unworkable
because they are incapable of producing a sufficiently clear or restrained
standard for the purposes of defining the scope of criminal liability. 

[44]                         
The majority of the
Court of Appeal held that the “essential features” of the sexual activity are
determined by the complainant’s subjective conditions for consent to that
activity. There need be no deception or dishonesty on the part of the partner. 
It follows that the “essential features” of the sexual activity vary from
person to person. It would therefore be impossible to predict what a particular
person considers “essential”. It is also unclear how “essential” the feature
must be to the complainant. The majority of the Court of Appeal also held that
not all conditions for consent will be considered “essential features” of the
sexual activity; they drew the line between characteristics that merely affect
motive to engage in the sexual activity and characteristics that are
“components” of the sexual activity. But this line is blurry. We are told that
the use of an effective condom is a “component” of the sexual activity, not
part of the motive to engage in the sexual activity. Yet the elimination of the
risk of pregnancy may well be a motivation for agreeing to the sexual act.
Indeed, on the complainant’s evidence in this case, she would not have
consented to sex without a condom. 

[45]                         
Justices Abella and
Moldaver introduce a variation on this approach but one which, as we see it, is
equally uncertain. Under their approach, the “sexual activity in question”
extends to “how” the sexual touching occurs, but not to the consequences of the
sexual activity. But it is not clear what the “how” of the act includes, or
whether agreement is undermined by only deception or also by a complainant’s
unilateral mistake. Presumably, it extends to any physical aspect of the sexual
activity to which the complainant has not agreed in advance — a vast swath of
conduct indeed. And again, the line is blurry; many aspects of the sexual
activity can be characterized as both part of the “how” and part of the
consequences. This case provides an example. Abella and Moldaver JJ. hold that
a sabotaged condom is part of “how” the sexual touching occurred, but
sabotaging a condom also amounts to a deception about the potential
consequences of the physical act — namely, pregnancy. 

[46]                         
These approaches would
also result in the criminalization of acts that should not attract the heavy
hand of the criminal law. We have already noted the difficulty of seeing why
the presence of a sexually transmitted infection would not be a “component” of
the sexual activity or part of “how” the sexual touching occurs. Under the
Court of Appeal majority’s “essential features” test, a man who pierces a
condom may be found guilty of sexual assault; why would a woman who lies about
birth control measures not be equally guilty? Under Abella and Moldaver JJ.’s
test, the quality or effectiveness of a condom changes the sexual
activity that takes place; why would it not follow that an individual might be
prosecuted for using an expired condom or a particular brand of condom? 
Anomalies abound.  The “how the physical act was carried out” test appears not
to capture a woman who lies about taking birth control pills, but it might well
capture a woman who lies about using a diaphragm.  

[47]                         
Conversely, the “how the act was carried out”
approach would not capture conduct that is as equally reprehensible as Mr.
Hutchinson’s actions, like substituting a partner’s birth control pills with
sugar pills.  We do not see any principled basis for criminalizing the act of
sabotaging condoms, but not the act of sabotaging birth control pills.

[48]                         
This difficulty is
apparent on the facts of this case. The trial judge found that the complainant
did not voluntarily agree to sexual intercourse without contraception and that
Mr. Hutchinson knew this:  paras. 44 and 47. What was critical to her consent
was contraception and what she sought to mitigate was the risk of pregnancy. 
Yet on the approach adopted by our colleagues, her lack of voluntary agreement
would result from the use of sabotaged condoms, but not from a lie by Mr.
Hutchinson to the effect that he was sterile. These different results on the
issue of voluntary agreement respectfully lack rational justification in a case
such as this one in which the whole concern of the complainant was pregnancy —
a risked consequence of the sexual activity. Her consent did not turn on the
“how” of the sexual act, but on whether the risk of pregnancy was mitigated to
a degree which she thought sufficient.

[49]                         
Ultimately, these
approaches lead to empty semantic arguments incapable of furnishing a
principled and clear line between criminal and non-criminal conduct. This
conclusion is reinforced by the experience of other jurisdictions. 

[50]                         
We earlier referred to
the difficulties of line drawing inherent in the “nature and quality of the
act” test in Clarence and the Canadian Criminal Code until its
revision in 1983.  Courts experienced great difficulty in formulating
principled reasons for why a certain deception did or did not relate to the
nature and quality of the act and there was no principled basis upon which to
confine the test to serious deceptions meriting the ultimate force of the
criminal law:  see, e.g., Hooper; Cuerrier.  

[51]                         
A further example is the
distinction made in U.S. criminal and tort law between deceptions going to the
fact (“fraud in the factum”) which vitiate consent for the purposes of rape and
battery and other deceptions that act as inducements (“fraud in the
inducement”) which do not. As expressed by one leading text, the rule is that
“if the deception relates not to the thing done but merely to some collateral
matter” the consent is valid:  R. M. Perkins and R. N. Boyce, Criminal Law (3rd
ed. 1982), at p. 1079.  No matter how beguiling it appears at first, the
distinction has proved unworkable. It is not helpful in differentiating between
legally effective and ineffective consent and where it attempts to draw the
line has no basis in principle: see, e.g., P. J. Falk, “Rape by Fraud and Rape
by Coercion” (1998), 64 Brook. L. Rev. 39, at pp. 159-61; D. A. Fischer,
“Fraudulently Induced Consent to Intentional Torts” (1977), 46 U. Cin. L.
Rev. 71, at pp. 79, 87 and 98. As Peter Westen put it, “The
interchangeability of [fraud in the factum and fraud in the inducement] enables
courts and commentators to conceptualize any fraud that they regard as
sufficient to invalidate acquiescence as a fraud in the factum”: The Logic
of Consent (2004), at p. 198 (emphasis in original); see also, E. W.
Puttkammer, “Consent in Rape” (1924-1925), 19 Ill. L. Rev. 410, at p.
423; Wertheimer, at p. 206; J. Feinberg, “Victims’ Excuses: The Case of
Fraudulently Procured Consent” (1986), 96 Ethics 330.

[52]                         
What these lines of
authority have in common is that they, like the “essential features” or “how
the physical act is carried out” approach, attempt to draw a line between
deceptions that do and do not vitiate consent by adjectivally categorizing the
subject matter of the deception. Deceptions described as going to the “nature
and quality of the act” or the “fact” (as opposed to the “inducement”) vitiate
consent, while other types of deceptions do not.  But the attempted distinction
has proven to be too unclear, too easily manipulated, and too unconnected with
underlying policy rationales to provide a useful marker of liability.  

[53]                         
The lesson is clear.  Broad adjectival
approaches to the “sexual activity in question” produce not only uncertainty,
but also may criminalize conduct that lacks the necessary reprehensible
character, casting the net of the criminal law too broadly. There is no reason
to expect that attempting to categorize deceptions as to whether they go to the
“essential features” of the act or to “how the physical act is carried out”
will fare any better that did other adjectival approaches in the past.

C.           
The Correct Approach

[54]                         
We conclude that Farrar
J.A. was correct to interpret the “sexual activity in question” in s. 273.1(1) 
to refer simply to the physical sex act itself (for example, kissing, petting,
oral sex, intercourse, or the use of sex toys). The complainant must agree to
the specific physical sex act. For example, as our colleagues correctly
note, agreement to one form of penetration is not agreement to any or all forms
of penetration and agreement to sexual touching on one part of the body is not
agreement to all sexual touching.  

[55]                         
The “sexual activity in question” does not
include conditions or qualities of the physical act, such as birth control
measures or the presence of sexually transmitted diseases. Thus, at the first
stage of the consent analysis, the Crown must prove a lack of subjective
voluntary agreement to the specific physical sex act. Deceptions about
conditions or qualities of the physical act may vitiate consent under s.
265(3) (c) of the Criminal Code , if the elements for fraud are
met. 

[56]                         
This approach fits within the ordinary meaning of s. 273.1(1)  and the scheme of the Code,
and it does not pose problems of uncertainty, over-criminalization, or
inconsistency with Cuerrier and Mabior. 

[57]                         
In our view, “voluntary agreement . . . to . . . the
sexual activity in question” also encompasses both the sexual nature of the
activity (i.e., that the act was sexual in nature as opposed to being for a
different purpose, such as a medical examination) and the identity of the
partner (defined in the narrow sense of the specific identity of a partner who
is personally known to the complainant). While identity and the sexual nature
of the act were troublesome issues for the early cases, and while Cuerrier,
in obiter, suggests that they might be considered at the second stage of
the consent analysis under s. 265(3) (c), the better view is that
“voluntary agreement . . . to . . . the sexual activity in question” will not
exist under s. 273.1(1)  if the complainant did not subjectively agree to the
sexual nature of the act or the specific identity of the partner. As a result,
a complainant’s mistaken belief about the identity of the partner or the sexual
nature of the act — whether or not that mistake is the result of a deception —
will result in no consent under s. 273.1(1)  of the Criminal Code . 

[58]                         
The sexual nature of the act is
expressly included by the reference in s. 273.1(1)  to the “sexual
activity in question”. If one voluntarily agrees to a non-sexual activity (for
example, a medical examination), one is not voluntarily agreeing to a sexual
activity.  Similarly, in our view, the identity of the partner, in the narrow
sense, should be included in the “sexual activity in question” under s.
273.1(1) ; if a complainant agrees to sexual activity with A, who is a specific
individual known personally to her, she is not agreeing to sexual activity with
B.  

[59]                         
A number of early cases support this interpretation. For example, in R.
v. Flattery (1877), 2 Q.B.D. 410 (Cr. Cas. Res.), the court upheld a
conviction of rape where a man obtained sex from a girl on the pretext of
medical treatment. The court noted that the case was not a case where a man
induced consent to sex through fraud; rather, the victim consented to a surgical
operation — not to a sexual act. Thus, there was no consent to any sexual
activity. 

[60]                         
Similarly, R. v. Dee (1884), 14 L.R. Ir. 468 (Cr. Cas. Res.), the
court upheld a conviction of rape where a man pretended to be the victim’s
husband. May C.J. stated that “[t]he act she permitted cannot properly be
regarded as the real act which took place; therefore, the connexion was done,
in my opinion, without her consent, and the crime of rape was constituted” (p.
479). 

[61]                         
In Dee, Palles C.B. stated:

. . . an act done under the bona
fide belief that it is another act different in its essence is not
in law the act of the party. That is the present case — a case which it is
hardly necessary to point out is not that of consent in fact sought to be
avoided for fraud, but one in which that which took place never amounted to
consent. The person by whom the act was to be performed was part of its
essence. The consent of the intellect, the only consent known to the law, was
to the act of the husband only . . . . [Emphasis in original; p. 488.]

[62]                         
In Clarence, Stephen J. acknowledged that there is abundant
authority for the idea that frauds about identity or the sexual nature of the
act vitiate consent. However, he commented:

I should myself prefer to say that
consent in such cases does not exist at all, because the act consented to is
not the act done. Consent to a surgical operation or examination is not a
consent to sexual connection or indecent behaviour. Consent to connection with
a husband is not consent to adultery. [p. 44]

[63]                         
More recently, the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. G.C., 2010 ONCA 451, 266 O.A.C.
299, leave to appeal refused, [2010] 3 S.C.R. v, adopted this approach
and held that the complainant’s belief that the partner was her boyfriend when
it was in fact his identical twin resulted in no consent to the “sexual
activity in question” under s. 273.1  of the Criminal Code . (See also R.
v. O.A., 2013 ONCA 581, 310 O.A.C. 305.)

V.          
Application

[64]                         
The first question is
whether the complainant voluntarily agreed to the “sexual activity in
question”. On the approach we propose, the “sexual activity in question” was
the sexual intercourse that took place in this case. Effective condom use is a
method of contraception and protection against sexually transmitted disease; it
is not a sex act. 

[65]                         
There is no dispute that the complainant
subjectively consented to sexual intercourse with Mr. Hutchinson at the time
that it occurred. We conclude that the Crown did not prove that there was no
voluntary agreement to the “sexual activity in question” under s. 273.1(1)  of
the Criminal Code . 

[66]                         
The next question is whether any of the
circumstances in which voluntary agreement is not effective apply. These
circumstances are listed in s. 265(3)  and s. 273.1(2) . The only provision
argued is s. 265(3) (c). So the key issue is whether the complainant’s
agreement to the sexual activity in question was vitiated by fraud under s.
265(3) (c) of the Criminal Code . 

[67]                         
As we have seen, “fraud”
for the purposes of consent has two elements: (1) dishonesty, which can include
the non-disclosure of important facts; and (2) deprivation or risk of
deprivation in the form of serious bodily harm which results from the
dishonesty (Cuerrier). Did the Crown prove that no consent was obtained
by virtue of fraud?

[68]                         
The dishonesty in this
case is evident and admitted. Mr. Hutchinson obtained the complainant’s consent
to sexual intercourse only by failing to disclose the critical fact that he had
sabotaged the condoms and thereby compromised their contraceptive value. The
only remaining issue is whether there was a sufficient deprivation to establish
fraud.  

[69]                         
Mr. Hutchinson argues
that the universal threshold for deprivation under s. 265(3) (c) post-Cuerrier
is a “significant risk of serious bodily harm”, and that the Crown did not
establish that here.  The Crown argues that a new trial is required to
determine whether the risk of pregnancy caused by the sabotaged condoms
constituted a “significant risk of serious bodily harm”. These arguments
over-read Cuerrier.  The Court in Cuerrier was addressing the
specific risk of sexually transmitted diseases.  It did not foreclose the
possibility that other types of harm may amount to equally serious deprivations
and therefore suffice to establish the requirements of fraud under s. 265(3) (c).


[70]                         
The concept of “harm”
does not encompass only bodily harm in the traditional sense of that term; it
includes at least the sorts of profound changes in a woman’s body — changes
that may be welcomed or changes that a woman may choose not to accept —
resulting from pregnancy. Depriving a woman of the choice whether to become
pregnant or increasing the risk of pregnancy is equally serious as a
“significant risk of serious bodily harm” within the meaning of Cuerrier,
and therefore suffices to establish fraud vitiating consent under s. 265(3) (c).


[71]                         
We conclude that where a
complainant has chosen not to become pregnant, deceptions that deprive her of
the benefit of that choice by making her pregnant, or exposing her to an
increased risk of becoming pregnant by removing effective birth control, may
constitute a sufficiently serious deprivation for the purposes of fraud
vitiating consent under s. 265(3) (c). 

[72]                         
This application of “fraud” under s. 265(3) (c)
is consistent with Charter  values of equality and autonomy, while
recognizing that not every deception that induces consent should be
criminalized. To establish fraud, the dishonest act must result in a
deprivation that is equally serious as the deprivation recognized in
Cuerrier and in this case. For example, financial deprivations or mere
sadness or stress from being lied to will not be sufficient.

[73]                         
In this case, while the
Crown did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant’s
pregnancy was the result of the damaged condoms, Mr. Hutchinson exposed her to
an increased risk of becoming pregnant by using a faulty condom.  As the trial
judge found, a condom with a pinprick in it is no longer effective birth
control (para. 27).  This constituted a sufficient deprivation for fraud, within
the meaning established in Cuerrier.

[74]                         
We conclude that there
was no consent in this case by reason of fraud, pursuant to s. 265(3) (c)
of the Criminal Code .  Mr. Hutchinson is therefore guilty of
sexual assault.

VI.       
Disposition

[75]                         
We would dismiss the
appeal. 

                    The reasons of Abella,
Moldaver and Karakatsanis JJ. were delivered by

[76]                         
Abella and
Moldaver JJ. — This case involves a woman who agreed to sexual intercourse with a condom.  When a
woman agrees to have sexual intercourse with a condom, she is consenting to a
particular sexual activity.  It is a different sexual activity than sexual
intercourse without a condom.  Her reasons for requiring a condom as
part of the activity may be to prevent pregnancy, or they may be a matter of
personal preference.  But whatever her reasons, they are beyond the scope of
the criminal law.  What is within its scope is what she actually agreed
to, not why.  The deliberate and undisclosed thwarting of her agreement as to
how the intercourse is to take place turns the sexual activity into a
non-consensual act, regardless of its consequences.  This engages s. 273.1(1) 
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , whose purpose is to
ascertain whether there was consent to the activity in the first place.  This
is, first and foremost, a function of everyone’s right to decide whether and
how to engage in sexual activity.

[77]                         
The factual events which
gave rise to these proceedings are not in dispute.  The complainant agreed to
have sexual intercourse with Craig Hutchinson with a condom so that she would
not get pregnant. Condom use, therefore, clearly meant an intact condom.  Mr.
Hutchinson secretly poked holes in the condom and used it during sexual
intercourse.  The complainant only learned of this when he later told her what
he had done.  At trial, Mr. Hutchinson was convicted of sexual assault under s.
271  of the Criminal Code .

[78]                         
The issue before this
Court is which Criminal Code  provision applies in examining whether
there was consent.  The trial judge and a majority of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal
found that s. 273.1(1)  applied and concluded that under that provision, there
was no consent to the sexual activity in question.  The dissenting judge was of
the view that the complainant had consented to sexual intercourse generally and
that the condom was not part of the sexual activity.  He would have ordered a
new trial to determine whether the consent had been vitiated by fraud under s.
265(3) (c). 

[79]                         
We would dismiss the appeal.  The starting point
for the analysis is s. 273.1(1) .  The question is not whether consent was
vitiated by fraud, it is whether there was consent to the sexual activity in
the first place.  In our view, there was no such consent, making s. 273.1(1) 
the applicable provision.  The complainant in this case agreed to engage in sexual
activity in a certain manner, that is, sexual intercourse with a condom.  It
goes without saying that when someone agrees to sexual intercourse with a
condom, she is agreeing to sexual intercourse with an intact condom. 
The deliberate sabotaging of that condom without her knowledge or agreement
makes what happened different from what the complainant agreed to.      Since
the complainant never agreed to engage in sexual intercourse with a sabotaged
condom, there is therefore no consent under s. 273.1(1)  and the inquiry for the
purposes of the actus reus of sexual assault is complete.

Analysis

[80]                         
The relevant provisions,
s. 273.1(1)  and s. 265(3) (c), state:

     273.1 (1) Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 265(3) , “consent” means, for the purposes of
sections 271 , 272  and 273 , the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage
in the sexual activity in question.

 

265.
. . .

 

(3) For the purposes of this section, no consent is obtained where
the complainant submits or does not resist by reason of 

 

(a)
the application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the
complainant;

 

(b)
threats or fear of the application of force to the complainant or to a person
other than the complainant;

 

(c)
fraud; or

 

(d)
the exercise of authority.

[81]                         
In R. v. Ewanchuk, [1999] 1 S.C.R.
330, this Court set out the governing framework for
analyzing whether the elements of sexual assault are met in a given case.  The mens
rea for sexual assault requires the accused to have knowledge of, or be
willfully blind to, the complainant’s lack of consent.  The central focus of
the analysis of the actus reus of sexual assault, on the other hand, is
to determine what the complainant agreed to, and what in fact took place.  The actus
reus requires proof of three elements: “(i) touching, (ii) the sexual
nature of the contact, and (iii) the absence of consent” (para. 25).  While the
first two elements are determined objectively, the third — the absence of
consent — “is subjective and determined by reference to the complainant’s
subjective internal state of mind towards the touching, at the time it
occurred” (para. 26).  It is the third component of the actus reus that
we are concerned with in this appeal. 

[82]                         
In Ewanchuk, the foundational principles underlying the law of sexual assault were distilled by
Major J. as follows:

Society is committed to protecting the
personal integrity, both physical and psychological, of every individual.
Having control over who touches one’s body, and how, lies at the
core of human dignity and autonomy. The inclusion of assault and sexual assault
in the Code expresses society’s determination to protect the security of
the person from any non-consensual contact or threats of force. The common law
has recognized for centuries that the individual’s right to physical integrity
is a fundamental principle, “every man’s person being sacred, and no other
having a right to meddle with it, in any the slightest manner” . . . .  It
follows that any intentional but unwanted touching is criminal.  [Emphasis
added; para. 28.]

[83]                         
In other words,
society’s commitment to protecting a person’s autonomy and dignity requires
that individuals have the right to determine who touches their body, and
how the touching will occur.  The right to determine how sexual
touching is to occur clearly encompasses a person’s right to determine where
one’s body is touched and by what means.  At its core, this case
concerns the right recognized in Ewanchuk to determine how sexual
touching will take place.

[84]                         
This protection
underlies the definition of consent set out in s. 273.1(1)  as being “the
voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in
question”.  When it defined consent in s. 273.1(1)  in this way in 1992,
Parliament’s intent was to address the “fundamental” issue of giving full and
clear meaning to the concept of “consent” (Kim Campbell, Minister of Justice
and Attorney General of Canada, House of Commons Debates, vol. IX, 3rd
Sess., 34th Parl., June 15, 1992, at pp. 12027-28; see also pp. 12041 and
12043). As another parliamentarian explained:

     Consent is the crux of
sexual assault trials. If it has been established that consent has been given,
the woman’s claim of attack is rejected. It is imperative that the law be
absolutely clear on this matter, as must the partners involved in the sexual
activity.

 

     The bill states that
consent is the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual
activity in question. There is no need for lawyers to be present. All you need
are two people who understand each other’s needs . . . . 

 

(Shirley
Maheu, M.P. from Saint-Laurent—Cartierville, ibid., at p. 12045)

[85]                         
Since the protection of
personal integrity underlies the requirement for consent in s. 273.1(1) ,
consent to the “sexual activity in question” necessarily means the
complainant’s voluntary agreement both to engage in touching of a sexual nature
and to the manner in which that touching is carried out.  In other words,
without voluntary agreement as to the “how” — the manner in which the sexual
activity in question occurred — there is no consent within the meaning of s.
273.1(1) .

[86]                         
The dissenting judge in
the Court of Appeal, like McLachlin C.J. and Cromwell J., concluded that the
specific sexual activity in question here was “sexual intercourse”.  Since the
complainant consented to sexual intercourse, there was consent within the
meaning of s. 273.1(1) .  In the dissenting judge’s view, the term “sexual
activity” in s. 273.1(1)  has a narrow meaning, referring only to “actual
incidents of physical touching, whether oral sex, or intercourse, or another
‘category’ of activity, and not to the conditions of that touching” (para.
127 (emphasis in original)).  With respect, adverting to generic, categorical
labels of sexual activity obscures the purpose of the consent inquiry regarding
the actus reus of sexual assault.  The complainant must consent to the
sexual touching which actually took place (Ewanchuk, at
para. 26).  And this Court confirmed in R. v. J.A., [2011] 2
S.C.R. 440, that the relevant time for determining that consent is when the
activity occurred.  To interpret “sexual activity in question” in s. 273.1(1) 
without regard to the specific touching that occurs extinguishes the right of a
person to decide whether to give or withhold consent to the sexual activity
which is to take place.  

[87]                         
The dissenting judge’s
technical definition of “sexual activity in question” also suggests that once a
person consents to a “category” of sexual activity, the inquiry goes to s.
265(3)  to determine whether that general consent was vitiated.  This, with
respect, reads out the protection in Ewanchuk for the “how” of the
sexual touching.  A person who has consented to being touched over her clothing
above the waist, is not consenting to being touched under her clothing below
the waist. Both instances are “touching”, but only one was agreed to.  In the
same way, agreeing to “penetration” does not thereby mean consenting to any or
all forms or penetration. The notion that general consent is given under s.
273.1(1)  so long as the other person’s actions fall somewhere within the
generic category of what the complainant agreed to, such as touching or
penetration, is untenable.  It represents the triumph of terminology over
personal integrity and completely undermines Ewanchuk’s basic principle
that “any intentional but unwanted touching is criminal” by virtue of
the fact that it was unwanted (para. 28 (emphasis added)).

[88]                         
A person consents to how
she will be touched, and she is entitled to decide what sexual
activity she agrees to engage in for whatever reason she wishes. The fact that
some of the consequences of her motives are more serious than others, such as
pregnancy, does not in the slightest undermine her right to decide the manner
of the sexual activity she wants to engage in.  It is neither her partner’s
business nor the state’s.  The complainant’s voluntary agreement to the manner
in which the sexual touching was carried out, requires the complainant’s
consent to where on her body she was touched and with what.  It does
not, however, require consent to the consequences of that touching, or the
characteristics of the sexual partner, such as age, wealth, marital status, or
health.  These consequences or characteristics, while potentially significant,
are not part of the actual physical activity that is agreed to.  If we included
them in the meaning of the sexual activity in question under s. 273.1(1) , we
would be criminalizing activity that thwarts the motives of a
complainant, instead of focussing on the unwanted physical activity that
actually took place.  To state the proposition demonstrates its unacceptable
reach.  While it is true that the third element of the actus reus — the
complainant’s absence of consent to the touching —is a subjective inquiry, it
must nonetheless relate to the specific way in which he or she is touched, not
to why.  The avoidance or pursuit of pregnancy may well motivate why the
specific sexual activity is being agreed to, but the motivation for the sexual
activity is not the sexual activity itself.  

[89]                         
That is why we would not adopt the
“essential features” test proposed by the majority of the Nova Scotia Court of
Appeal, under which “if there is no consent to an essential feature of the
sexual act itself, there can be no consent to ‘the sexual activity in
question’” (para. 46).  By focussing on what is an “essential” feature of the
sexual activity to the complainant, there is a risk of capturing “features”
which are not a part of the how of the sexual activity.  In other words,
the language of “essential features” opens the door to a broader inquiry than
whether the complainant consented specifically to the sexual touching which
occurred.  To the extent that our colleagues have conflated our approach
with the “essential features” test, it does not, with respect, reflect our
reasons.

[90]                         
But neither do we agree
that the fraud provision in s. 265(3) (c) must be the framework for
analyzing consent in sexual assault cases whenever deception is involved.  When
a complainant does not voluntarily agree to the sexual activity which occurred,
consent does not exist within the meaning of s. 273.1(1) , and the inquiry for
the purposes of the actus reus of sexual assault is complete.  

[91]                         
Unlike under s. 265(3) (c), which
requires both a dishonest act and a deprivation, consent
under s. 273.1(1)  has never required an analysis of the risks or consequences
caused by unwanted sexual touching.  This Court has consistently affirmed that
it is the unwanted nature of non-consensual sexual touching that
violates the complainant’s sexual integrity and gives rise to culpability under
the criminal law, not just the risk of further harm that the sexual touching
may create.  Requiring an analysis of the risks or consequences of all
non-consensual sexual touching if deception is later discovered, adds a barrier
to the simple ability to demonstrate whether the activity which occurred was
agreed to when it occurred.  It thereby undermines the values of
personal autonomy and physical integrity sought to be protected by making
sexual assault an offence.  

[92]                         
Regardless of whether deception occurred in a
given case, the analysis under s. 273.1(1)  must link consent to the specific
sexual activity which occurred, including how the sexual touching was
physically carried out.  In other words, did the complainant consent to where
she was touched and by what?  We therefore think the following two-part
test for analyzing consent under the actus reus of sexual assault flows
inevitably from Ewanchuk:

Under s.
273.1(1), has the complainant consented to the identity of her sexual partner,
the sexual nature of the touching, and the manner in which the sexual touching
was carried out? 

If so, are
there any circumstances that vitiate the complainant’s consent under s.
265(3) ?  

[93]                         
This approach does not,
as our colleagues suggest, “do most of the work that the fraud provision was
intended to do”.  What it does do, is give meaning to the word
“consent”.  Indeed, as our colleagues themselves point out, there are many
situations in which a person’s deception does not change the manner in which
the sexual activity is actually carried out. Section 265(3) (c) may well
apply to those deceptions that do not fall under s. 273.1(1), either because
the deception does not go to the manner in which a person is touched, does not
involve the identity of one’s partner, or does not pertain to the sexual nature
of the touching.  If there was no consent ab initio to the sexual
activity, however, it is pointless to inquire under s. 265(3) (c) whether
consent was vitiated by fraud.  The two inquiries are conceptually distinct and
must remain so.  One goes to the manner in which the sexual touching is
carried out, the other to the consequences of the sexual touching.  The
fact that the violation of someone’s consent results in a deprivation does not
change the fact that there was no consent to begin with.  

[94]                         
In our view, both R. v. Cuerrier,
[1998] 2 S.C.R. 371, and R. v. Mabior, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584, are
examples of cases that were properly decided under s. 265(3) (c).  In
those cases, this Court set out the applicable approach to sexual assault cases
under s. 265(3) (c) involving non-disclosure or deception as to the
existence of a disease.  The complainants had consented to the manner in
which the sexual activity had been carried out, the identity of their sexual
partner, and the sexual nature of that touching.  The complainants had
consented to sex with and, in some cases, without condoms, and the sexual
intercourse took place in accordance with that agreement.  The significant
issue before the Court was whether the complainants’ consent had been vitiated
by fraud because the accused had not disclosed that he was HIV-positive (Cuerrier,
at para. 77; Mabior, at para. 106).[1] 
As the risk of HIV transmission is a consequence of sexual activity, and the
complainants had consented to the manner in which the sexual activity occurred,
these cases were properly decided within the realm of s. 265(3) (c).  There are, moreover, important policy considerations that justify
deciding HIV non-disclosure cases under s. 265(3) (c).  Requiring a
“significant risk of serious bodily harm” in HIV non-disclosure cases ensures
that the criminal law does not further stigmatize and criminalize an already
vulnerable group.  

[95]                         
This approach was never intended to replace the
governing framework for analyzing consent in sexual assault cases set out in Ewanchuk.  
By further redefining the deprivation component of the fraud test affirmed in Mabior
only two years ago, our colleagues leave open the possibility that other
“equally serious deprivations” could establish deprivation in future cases. 
This makes the deprivation component a moving target, and generates uncertainty
in an already complex area.  

[96]                         
While the starting point
for the analysis is s. 273.1(1), unlike our colleagues, we see no legal danger
or uncertainty in recognizing that in a given case, lack of consent could
theoretically have been established under either provision. What is
fraught, however, is redefining the concept of consent in a way that
significantly limits the protective scope of s. 273.1(1) and erodes a person’s right, confirmed in Ewanchuk,
to decide what sexual activity will take place.  

[97]                         
The heart of our disagreement with McLachlin
C.J. and Cromwell J. turns on whether the use of a condom is included in the
manner in which the sexual activity is carried out.  According to our
colleagues, the use of a condom during sexual intercourse does not change the “specific
physical sex act” which occurs, but rather is merely a “collateral conditio[n]”
to the sexual activity.  In their view, so long as there is consent to “sexual
intercourse”, this general consent is not vitiated by a deception about condom
use unless it exposes the individual to a deprivation within the meaning of s.
265(3) (c), which they conclude in this case means depriving a woman of
the choice to become pregnant by “making her pregnant, or exposing her to an
increased risk of becoming pregnant”.

[98]                         
With respect, it does not follow that because a
condom is a form of birth control, it is not also part of the sexual activity. 
Removing the use of a condom from the ambit of what is consented to in the
sexual activity because in some cases it may be used for contraceptive
purposes, means that an individual is precluded from requiring a condom during
intercourse where pregnancy is not at issue.  That is, individuals who
engage in sexual activity that has no risk of pregnancy, either because of age,
fertility, or gender, for example, would have no legal right to insist upon the
use of a condom.  If one of those individuals has insisted upon the use of a
condom, and their partner has deliberately and knowingly ignored
those wishes — whether by not using a condom at all, removing it partway
through the sexual activity, or sabotaging it — that individual will
nonetheless be presumed to have consented under the approach suggested by our
colleagues.  In other words, because the person could not become pregnant, the
criminal law will not uphold his or her right to sexual autonomy and physical
integrity.  With respect, even aside from the problematic analogy between
pregnancy and bodily harm, this result does not reflect the fact that everyone
has a right to insist on a condom as part of the sexual activity — for whatever
reason.  All individuals must have an equal right to determine how they are
touched, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, reproductive capacity, or
the type of sexual activity they choose to engage in.  We fail to see how condoms
can be seen as anything but an aspect of how sexual touching occurs.  When
individuals agree to sexual activity with a condom, they are not merely
agreeing to a sexual activity, they are agreeing to how it should take
place.  That is what s. 273.1(1) was intended to protect.

[99]                         
It is worth remembering
that three decades ago, this Court overturned a decision of the New Brunswick
Court of Appeal, R. v. Chase (1984), 55 N.B.R. (2d) 97, that touching a
woman’s breast was an assault, but not a sexual one.  The Court of Appeal
concluded that a breast was only a “secondary” sexual characteristic and that
“sexual” should be given “its natural meaning as limited to the sexual organs
or genitalia”.   A man who had grabbed a woman’s breasts had therefore
committed an assault, but not a sexual assault, since

the contact was not with the
sexual organs of the victim but to the mammary gland, a secondary sexual
characteristic. 

 

. .
. to include as sexual an assault to the parts of a person’s body considered as
having secondary sexual characteristics may lead to absurd results if one
considers a man’s beard. Nor am I prepared to include those parts of the human
body considered erogenous zones lest a person be liable to conviction for
stealing a goodnight kiss. . . .  It seems to me that the word “sexual” as used
in the section ought to be given its natural meaning as limited to the sexual
organs or genitalia. [paras. 13-14]

In this Court, McIntyre
J., had “no difficulty” overturning the Court of Appeal’s decision, concluding
instead that a sexual assault had been committed by the accused ([1987] 2
S.C.R. 293, at p. 303). 

[100]                     
To say that condom use
is not part of the sexual activity in question under s. 273.1(1) but rather a
collateral condition, is reminiscent of the artificially narrow approach to the
word “sexual” taken by the Court of Appeal in Chase and rejected by this
Court. We must similarly take care not to adopt an interpretation of “sexual
activity in question” that unreasonably or arbitrarily excludes certain forms
of touching from the meaning of s. 273.1(1).  By any definition, when someone
uses a condom, it is part of the sexual activity.  It is therefore part of what
is — or is not — consented to.  And if what is consented to is sexual activity
with a condom, the condom is expected to be intact.  If it is not intact because
of its deliberate sabotaging, the activity that has been agreed to has been
unilaterally changed by the saboteur.  

[101]                     
What took place here was sexual intercourse with
a sabotaged condom, a sexual activity to which the complainant did not
consent.  The fact that she only learned of the deliberate sabotaging after
the sexual activity took place, is of no relevance.  What is relevant is what
sexual activity she agreed to engage in with Mr. Hutchinson and whether he
stuck to the bargain.  He did not.  Since the complainant did not agree at any
time to how she was touched, consent within the meaning of s. 273.1(1) did not
exist. 

[102]                     
Nor can we see why
requiring the consistent approach to consent in sexual assault set out in Ewanchuk
— and never abandoned by this Court — can now be said to lead to
“over-criminalization”.  Sexual assault is a crime.  What s. 273.1(1) does is
explain, clearly and simply, that the actus reus of sexual assault is
made out when someone does not agree to the manner of the sexual touching, that
is, when an individual engages in sexual touching in a way that is contrary to
the complainant’s wishes, thereby violating his or her bodily integrity. This
on its own, however, is half the story.  The mens rea for the offence of
sexual assault captures those who knowingly touch the complainant in a
way that he or she has not agreed to, thereby disregarding the complainant’s
right to determine how he or she is sexually touched.  While the criminal law
must remain sensitive to concerns about over-criminalization, those concerns
should not be used to generally undermine the hard-fought legislative protection
for someone’s right to determine how he or she is sexually touched.  It is also
worth remembering the Chief Justice’s comments in J.A. — with the
Court’s unanimous agreement on this point — where she observed that “even mild
non-consensual touching of a sexual nature can have profound implications for
the complainant” (paras. 63 and 121).

[103]                     
The complainant in this
case agreed to engage in sexual activity in a certain manner, that is, sexual
intercourse with an intact condom.  Mr. Hutchinson deliberately sabotaged the
condom without her knowledge or agreement.  It trivializes the seriousness of
the violation of the complainant’s integrity that occurred to analogize a
sabotaged condom, as our colleagues have done, to its brand or expiration
date.  Because of the deliberate deceit of her partner, the sexual activity was
not carried out in the manner that the complainant had agreed to.  Put simply,
the complainant did not consent to how she was touched, and thus she did not
voluntarily agree to the sexual activity in question under s. 273.1 of the Code.

[104]                     
We would therefore dismiss the appeal.

                    The judgment
of the Court was delivered orally by 

[1]                             
The Chief
Justice — On this appeal as of
right, the appellant raises three questions of law on which a judge of the
Alberta Court of Appeal dissented.  Two of them can be dealt with summarily. 
First, the appellant submits that the trial judge was required as part of her
instructions on reasonable doubt to specifically direct the jury that they had
to acquit both accused if they could not decide which accused had committed the
murder.  Second, the appellant submits that the trial judge failed to properly
explain to the jury the relationship between the intoxication defence and the mens
rea required for aiding and abetting in second degree murder.  For the
reasons given by Rowbotham J.A. in the Court of Appeal, we would not give
effect to these grounds.

[2]                             
The third ground of appeal relates to certain
out-of-court statements made by the appellant’s co-accused and which the Crown
introduced into evidence against the co-accused as party admissions. The
appellant submits that the trial judge erred by failing to instruct the jury
that it could rely on those statements for their truth in determining their
verdict in relation to the appellant.

[3]                             
We would not give effect to this argument. The
general rule is that out‑of‑court statements by a party may be
adduced as evidence of their truth by an opposite party. But, as the trial
judge instructed the jury, statements admitted on that basis may in general be
used only in deciding the case of the accused who made the statements.  The
trial judge gave this standard instruction with the express agreement of trial
counsel. She did not err in doing so. The appellant’s counsel at trial did not
seek to adduce the co-accused’s out‑of‑court statements for their
truth as part of the appellant’s case under the principled approach to the
hearsay rule or on any other basis. 

[4]                             
There appears to be nothing that would have prevented the appellant from
attempting to have these statements considered for their truth under the
principled approach to the hearsay rule.  However, no such attempt was made
here.  There was, therefore, no basis raised for the judge to give the
instruction now sought.  We note that R. v. Edwards, 2004 BCCA 558, 205
B.C.A.C. 42, in which one accused adduced in evidence as part of his case an
inculpatory out-of-court statement by a co-accused, gives rise to different
issues which we do not have to address here.

[5]                             
While that is sufficient to address the legal issues on which the dissent in the
Court of Appeal was based, we also observe that the statements made by the
appellant and his co-accused were highly unreliable on their face and tended,
in any event, to incriminate both of them. There is no suggestion that defence
counsel not pursuing the admissibility of these statements as evidence of their
truth by virtue of the principled approach to hearsay or seeking a severance so
that the co-accused would be a compellable witness were anything other than
reasonable tactical decisions. No basis has been shown to permit the appellant
to revisit these matters on appeal: see R. v. J.F., 2013 SCC 12, [2013]
1 S.C.R. 565, at para. 68. 

[6]                             
For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec 

                    Criminal
law — Stay of proceedings — Abuse of process — Accused charged with offences
related to firearms and importation, production and trafficking of
methamphetamine — Accused alleging Crown misconduct in obtaining medical
records, police collusion to mislead court, and Crown threats pressuring
accused to plead guilty — Trial judge staying proceedings — Whether stay of
proceedings necessary to protect integrity of justice system.

                    The
accused were charged with numerous firearms offences, as well as offences
related to the importation, production and trafficking of methamphetamine. 
During the course of the trial, the accused brought an application to stay the
proceedings for abuse of process.  They took issue with three forms of state
misconduct: attempts by the Crown to intimidate them into foregoing their right
to a trial by threatening them with additional charges should they choose to
plead not guilty, collusion on the part of two police officers to mislead the
court about the seizure of a firearm, and improper means used by the Crown in
obtaining the medical records of one of the accused.  The trial judge stayed
the proceedings.  The Court of Appeal set aside the stay and ordered a new
trial.

                    Held
(Abella J. dissenting):  The appeals should be dismissed.

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Cromwell, Moldaver, Karakatsanis and
Wagner JJ.:  A stay of proceedings for an abuse of process will only be
warranted in the clearest of cases.  Two types of state conduct may warrant a
stay.  The first is conduct that compromises the fairness of an accused’s trial
(the “main” category).  The second is conduct that does not threaten trial
fairness but risks undermining the integrity of the judicial process (the
“residual” category).  The test for determining whether a stay of proceedings
is warranted is the same for both categories and consists of three
requirements:  (1) there must be prejudice to the accused’s right to a
fair trial or to the integrity of the justice system that will be manifested,
perpetuated or aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by its outcome, (2) there
must be no alternative remedy capable of redressing the prejudice, and
(3) where there is still uncertainty over whether a stay is warranted after
steps 1 and 2, the court must balance the interests in favour of granting a
stay against the interest that society has in having a final decision on the
merits.

the residual category is invoked, the first stage of the test is met when it is
established that the state has engaged in conduct that is offensive to societal
notions of fair play and decency, and that proceeding with a trial in the face
of that conduct would be harmful to the integrity of the justice system.  At
the second stage of the test, the focus is on whether an alternate remedy short
of a stay of proceedings will adequately dissociate the justice system from the
impugned state conduct going forward.  Finally, the court must decide whether
staying the proceedings or having a trial despite the impugned conduct better
protects the integrity of the justice system.  This inquiry necessarily demands
balancing.  The court must consider such things as the nature and seriousness
of the impugned conduct, whether the conduct is isolated or reflects a systemic
and ongoing problem, the circumstances of the accused, the charges he or she
faces, and the interests of society in having the charges disposed of on the
merits.  

                    In
the instant case, the three forms of state misconduct that are at issue fall
squarely within the residual category.  The trial judge erred in his assessment
of the impugned misconduct and in concluding that a stay of proceedings was
warranted.  As regards the medical records, the trial judge made a palpable and
overriding error in finding that the Crown’s conduct occasioned prejudice to
the integrity of the justice system.  With respect to the police collusion,
apart from its limited extent, the trial judge failed to consider the existence
of another remedy that would have overcome the threat posed to the integrity of
the justice system — namely, excluding the firearm from evidence in respect of
both accused.  As for the threats made by the Crown, while they were reprehensible
and should not be repeated, the trial judge failed to consider that they were
made more than a year before the trial began, and that the accused took no
steps for over a year to address the Crown’s conduct.  These factors shed light
on how seriously the accused took the threats.  The trial judge also failed to
consider that the Crown prosecutor who made the threats was removed from the
case months before the trial started.  Moreover, the trial judge failed to
balance the need for a stay against society’s interest in a trial on the
merits.  When the impugned misconduct is weighed against society’s interest in
a trial, this is not one of the clearest of cases where the exceptional remedy
of a stay of proceedings is warranted. 

                    Per
Abella J. (dissenting):  A stay of proceedings may be imposed when the
state conduct is so profoundly and disproportionately inconsistent with the
public perception of what a fair justice system requires, that proceeding with
a trial means condoning unforgiveable conduct.  A Crown who makes threats
intended to bully an accused into foregoing his or her right to a trial, takes
fatal aim at the heart of the public’s confidence in that integrity.

                    The
unjustifiable nature of the Crown’s conduct in this case was not mitigated by the
length of time between the threats and the trial.  Time is not a legal remedy
for a fundamental breach of the Crown’s role and the passage of time does not
attenuate her unpardonable conduct.  It was the mere fact that the threats were
made at all that was key, not when they were made.  

                    Moreover,
a further balancing exercise was not required in the circumstances.  The trial
judge was unequivocal in concluding that the conduct justified a stay, and
there was none of the uncertainty as to the propriety of a stay that is a
condition precedent to the need for a balancing exercise.  When a trial judge
has found that the conduct cannot be condoned because it is such an exceptional
assault on the public’s sense of justice, it is conceptually inconsistent to ask
the court to undermine its own conclusion by re-weighing the half of the scale
that contains the public’s interest in trials on the merits.  The public has an
interest not only in trials on the merits, it has an even greater interest in
knowing that when the state is involved in proceedings, particularly those that
can result in an individual’s loss of liberty, it will put fairness above
expedience.  Justice is not only about results, it is about how those results
are obtained.  When a Crown threatens an accused with additional offences if he
or she does not plead guilty, the public’s interest in the results of a trial
must yield to the transcendent interest in protecting the public’s confidence
in the integrity of the justice system.

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
This appeal provides the Court with an
opportunity to revisit the law of abuse of process as it relates to state
conduct that impinges on the integrity of the justice system but does not affect
trial fairness — sometimes referred to as the “residual category” of cases for
which a judicial stay of proceedings may be ordered.  In particular, we are
tasked with clarifying the approach to be followed when determining whether a
stay of proceedings should be ordered where such conduct is uncovered.

[2]                             
As we shall see, the appellants, Antal Babos and
Sergio Piccirilli, complain about three forms of state misconduct:

(1)              
Attempts by the original provincial Crown
Attorney to intimidate them into foregoing their right to a trial by
threatening them with additional charges should they choose to plead not
guilty;

(2)              
Collusion on the part of two police officers to
mislead the court about the seizure of a firearm from Mr. Babos’s car; and

(3)              
Improper means used by a federal Crown Attorney
in obtaining Mr. Piccirilli’s medical records from the detention centre where
he was being detained pending trial.

[3]                             
Notably, the appellants do not argue that they
cannot receive a fair trial as a result of the alleged incidents of misconduct
— they accept that they can.  They submit instead that this is one of the
clearest of cases in which a stay of proceedings is necessary to preserve and
protect the integrity of the justice system.  Anything short of that would
amount to judicial condonation of egregious misconduct and erode the public’s
confidence in the administration of justice.

[4]                             
And that, the appellants say, is the basis upon
which the trial judge ordered a stay of proceedings in their case.  In doing
so, he made no error.  His decision was discretionary and entitled to
deference, and the Quebec Court of Appeal should not have interfered.  Hence,
the appellants seek to have the order of the trial judge reinstated. 

[5]                             
For the reasons that follow, I would not give
effect to the appellants’ submissions.  In my respectful view, the trial judge
committed errors in assessing all three forms of state misconduct.  As regards
Mr. Piccirilli’s medical records, he made a palpable and overriding error in
assessing the Crown’s conduct.  With respect to the police collusion, apart
from its limited extent, the trial judge failed to consider that excluding the
firearm found in Mr. Babos’s trunk would have overcome whatever threat it posed
to the integrity of the justice system.  As for the threats by the provincial
Crown, while they were reprehensible and should not be repeated, the trial
judge overstated their seriousness and failed to balance the need for a stay
against society’s interest in a trial on the merits.  

[6]                             
When the impugned misconduct is properly
considered and the correct legal framework is applied, a stay is unwarranted. 
Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeals.

II.          
Background Facts

[7]                             
On February 17, 2006, Mr. Babos was pulled over
by Constables Guy Brière and Marc Sénéchal.  The officers believed that Mr.
Babos was transporting guns.  Upon searching the trunk of his car, they found a
semi-automatic firearm.  Mr. Babos was arrested.  

[8]                             
On June 21, 2006, Mr. Piccirilli was arrested. 
Both he and Mr. Babos were ultimately charged with numerous firearms related
offences, as well as offences related to the importation, production and
trafficking of methamphetamine.

[9]                             
The instances of threatening conduct by Crown
counsel are said to have occurred between June 2006 and February 2007.
Specifically, the provincial prosecutor assigned to the case, Ms. Valérie
Tremblay, was accused of threatening Mr. Piccirilli on three separate occasions
with additional charges if he did not plead guilty.  

[10]                         
According to Mr. Patrice Duliot, Mr.
Piccirilli’s former lawyer, Ms. Tremblay told him, in the presence of Mr.
Piccirilli, that [translation] “if
your client doesn’t settle, he’s gonna be hit by a train” (A.R., vol. V, at p.
5).  Mr. Piccirilli claimed that on another occasion, either in June or
September 2006, Ms. Tremblay threatened him personally in the courtroom. 
According to Mr. Piccirilli, she said “if you proceed, we’ll bring other
charges against you” and that she would  “use section 577 ” and go “straight to
trial” (pp. 65 and 69).[1] 
Another of Mr. Piccirilli’s counsel, Ms. Guylaine Tardif, deposed in an
affidavit that in November 2006 or February 2007, Ms. Tremblay told her that
Mr. Piccirilli would be charged with money laundering and organized crime
offences if he did not plead guilty.  Ms. Tremblay asked Ms. Tardif to relay
this message to her client.  Although Mr. Babos was not threatened directly, no
issue is taken with the fact that the threats conveyed to Mr. Piccirilli would
have come to his attention.

[11]                         
The appellants’ trial began in April 2008. 
Notably, by February 2008, Ms. Tremblay was no longer on the file.  She had
been removed for health reasons and replaced by a federal prosecutor, Ms.
Kovacevich, when the charges against the appellants were joined in a single
indictment.  It was at this juncture that the appellants were charged with four
additional offences relating to organized crime, firearms and drug
trafficking.  The additional charges stemmed from evidence led at the
appellants’ preliminary hearings.  By this point, neither the appellants nor
their counsel had mentioned the alleged threats made by Ms. Tremblay.  Indeed,
the threats did not surface until they were brought to the attention of the
trial judge some six months into the trial and at least eighteen months after
they were made.

[12]                         
At the outset of the trial, Mr. Babos alleged
that the police had illegally searched the trunk of his car and he sought to
have the firearm they seized excluded from evidence under s. 24(2)  of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .  On the s. 24(2)  application, a
key factual issue was whether Mr. Babos consented to the search and opened the
trunk himself.  Constables Brière and Sénéchal testified at the hearing.  Cst.
Brière testified that it was Mr. Babos who opened the trunk of the car.  This
testimony differed from the version of events he had given at the preliminary
inquiry.[2] 
When defence counsel confronted Cst. Brière with the change, Cst. Brière explained
that he had spoken to Cst. Sénéchal while they were waiting to testify, and
that Cst. Sénéchal had [translation]
“convinced” him that the new version of events was the truth. 

[13]                         
The trial judge concluded that the trunk had
been illegally searched and that Mr. Babos’s rights under s. 8  of the Charter 
had been violated.  He also found that the officers had colluded for the
purpose of misleading the court.  The firearm found in the trunk was excluded. 


[14]                         
In June 2008, during the continuation of the
trial, the Crown attempted to adduce the same firearm against Mr. Piccirilli. 
Mr. Piccirilli objected.  The Crown took the position that Mr. Piccirilli had
no standing to allege a violation of his s. 8  rights because the car
from which the firearm was seized belonged to Mr. Babos.  Again Cst. Brière
testified, and again his evidence was somewhat different than before.[3]  The trial judge ruled
in favour of the Crown on the issue of standing, but did so provisionally; he
reserved to Mr. Piccirilli the right to present another motion [translation] “in due course if
necessary” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 124).[4] 


[15]                         
On October 3, 2008, with the trial still
ongoing, Mr. Babos brought an application to stay the charges for unreasonable
delay under s. 11 (b) of the Charter .  That same week, on
October 7, 2008, Mr. Piccirilli had a heart attack and the trial was
adjourned.  Mr. Piccirilli applied for bail, alleging that the detention centre
in which he was being held was unable to adequately care for his health.  As
part of his application, Mr. Piccirilli undertook to provide the court with his
medical report and list of medications.  

[16]                         
Ms. Kovacevich contacted the detention centre
directly and spoke to Mr. Piccirilli’s doctor.  Ms. Kovacevich asked him to
provide an affidavit explaining whether medical staff at the detention centre
had followed up on Mr. Piccirilli’s health since his heart attack and whether
Mr. Piccirilli had been receiving his medication since his hospitalization.  On
October 23, 2008, Mr. Piccirilli’s doctor provided the Crown with medical
documents pertaining to Mr. Piccirilli.  Ms. Kovacevich immediately disclosed
these documents to Mr. Piccirilli’s counsel, but she initially refused to
divulge their source.  A few days later, in an affidavit dated October 30, 2008,
she explained that the medical records had been sent from the detention centre
by Mr. Piccirilli’s doctor.

[17]                         
When Mr. Babos’s s. 11 (b) application
resumed in late October, Mr. Babos’s former counsel (Mr. Duliot) testified.  It
was in the course of his testimony that Ms. Tremblay’s threatening conduct came
to light for the first time.  After hearing evidence regarding Ms. Tremblay’s
conduct, the trial judge asked Ms. Kovacevich if she wanted to call any
witnesses or have Ms. Tremblay prepare an affidavit.  Ms. Kovacevich declined. 
She explained that the only response she could make was that the state of Ms.
Tremblay’s health did not allow her to testify, that the alleged threats were
not admitted, and that no postponement was requested to have her testify.

[18]                         
Both appellants brought an application to stay
the proceedings for abuse of process shortly thereafter.  On November 14, 2008,
the trial judge granted the application and the charges against the appellants
were stayed.  

III.       
Judgments Below

A.          
The Quebec Court, 2008 QCCQ 11373 (CanLII)

[19]                         
Garneau J. stayed the proceedings against both
appellants.  He based his decision to do so on three instances of state
misconduct: (1) Ms. Tremblay’s threats to the appellants that they would face
additional charges if they did not plead guilty; (2) collusion on the part of
Constables Brière and Sénéchal to mislead the court; and (3) Ms. Kovacevich’s
improper conduct in securing Mr. Piccirilli’s medical records from the
detention centre without first obtaining his consent. 

[20]                         
Commencing with Ms. Tremblay’s threatening
conduct, the trial judge described the threats as [translation] “unacceptable, intolerable, unjustifiable,
illegal and, above all, undemocratic” (para. 59).  The trial judge was also
critical of the Crown attorney’s office for failing to take any steps to
address Ms. Tremblay’s conduct, noting that “nothing, absolutely nothing had
been done by the representative of the Attorney General to remedy or even try
to remedy the situation” (para. 66).  Instead, the Crown had “remained
entrenched in its position” (para. 66).  The trial judge found that the threats
had tarnished the reputation of the judicial system and impacted the fairness
of the accused’s trial.  Allowing the trial to continue in the face of these
threats would be “shocking and outrageous” (para. 78).  According to the trial
judge, Ms. Tremblay’s misconduct was sufficient in and of itself to warrant a
stay of proceedings.  

[21]                         
With respect to collusion, the trial judge made
a finding that Constables Brière and Sénéchal colluded in order to mislead the
court.  This finding was based on Cst. Brière’s admission that he had spoken to
Cst. Sénéchal before testifying, and that Cst. Sénéchal had [translation] “convinced” him that Mr.
Babos had opened the trunk of the car (para. 12).  The trial judge also found
that the Crown’s later attempt to lead the firearm seized from the trunk
against Mr. Piccirilli perpetuated the officers’ collusion. 

[22]                         
Finally, regarding Mr. Piccirilli’s medical
records, the trial judge concluded that the Crown should have taken the [translation] “necessary precautions” to
ensure that the confidentiality of Mr. Piccirilli’s records was respected
(para. 53).  The trial judge also found that there had been a “lack of
transparency” because the Crown had “always refused” to disclose the source of
the information once she had obtained it (para. 56). 

[23]                         
In the face of these three instances of
misconduct, but particularly Ms. Tremblay’s threats, the trial judge stayed the
proceedings against both appellants. 

B.           
The Quebec Court of Appeal, 2012 QCCA 471
(CanLII)

[24]                         
Doyon J.A., writing for a unanimous court, set
aside the stay of proceedings and ordered a new trial.  A stay of proceedings
was only to be granted in [translation] “extreme
cases” where no other remedy was possible (para. 56).  This was not such a
case.  

[25]                         
Acknowledging that Ms. Tremblay’s threats were [translation] “unacceptable” and
“outrageous”, Doyon J.A. noted that the impact of the threats was lessened by
the fact that they were made over a year before the trial began and that Ms.
Tremblay had long since been replaced as the prosecutor in charge of the case
(paras. 59 and 73).  

[26]                         
As for the trial judge’s finding that Constables
Brière and Sénéchal colluded to mislead the court, Doyon J.A. considered this
finding to be a palpable and overriding error.  Cst. Brière explained why his
testimony had changed.  The trial judge’s determination that the officers’
conduct amounted to collusion lacked an evidentiary foundation.

[27]                         
With respect to Ms. Kovacevich’s conduct in
securing Mr. Piccirilli’s medical records, Doyon J.A. concluded that there was
no misconduct and that the trial judge committed another palpable and
overriding error in finding otherwise.  Mr. Piccirilli put his medical
condition in issue and at least implicitly waived his right to invoke
confidentiality in the information.  The Crown was free to seek evidence to
contradict Mr. Piccirilli’s assertions for purposes of resisting his
application for interim release.

[28]                         
Having reassessed the facts, Doyon J.A. observed
that Ms. Tremblay’s threats remained the sole cause of concern.  In assessing
whether those threats warranted a stay, he noted that they were uttered months
before trial, by a Crown who was replaced before trial, and about whom the
appellants did not complain until after their trial had been in progress for at
least six months.  In his view, this did not amount to an extreme case that
required a stay of proceedings.

IV.       
Issues

[29]                         
The narrow issue on appeal is whether the trial
judge erred in granting a stay of proceedings.  More broadly, we are tasked
with clarifying the proper analysis to be undertaken when a stay of proceedings
is sought for prior state conduct that is said to impinge on the integrity of
the justice system.

V.          
Analysis

A.          
Abuse of Process and Stays of Proceedings

[30]                         
A stay of proceedings is the most drastic remedy
a criminal court can order (R. v. Regan, 2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 S.C.R.
297, at para. 53).  It permanently halts the prosecution of an accused. 
In doing so, the truth-seeking function of the trial is frustrated and the
public is deprived of the opportunity to see justice done on the merits.  In
many cases, alleged victims of crime are deprived of their day in court.  

[31]                         
Nonetheless, this Court has recognized that
there are rare occasions —the “clearest of cases” — when a stay of proceedings
for an abuse of process will be warranted (R. v. O’Connor, [1995] 4
S.C.R. 411, at para. 68).  These cases generally fall into two categories: (1)
where state conduct compromises the fairness of an accused’s trial (the “main”
category); and (2) where state conduct creates no threat to trial fairness but
risks undermining the integrity of the judicial process (the “residual”
category) (O’Connor, at para. 73).  The impugned conduct in this case
does not implicate the main category.  Rather, it falls squarely within the
latter category.   

[32]                         
The test used to determine whether a stay of
proceedings is warranted is the same for both categories and consists of three
requirements: 

(1)              
There must be prejudice to the accused’s right
to a fair trial or the integrity of the justice system that “will be
manifested, perpetuated or aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by
its outcome” (Regan, at para. 54);

(2)              
There must be no alternative remedy capable of
redressing the prejudice; and 

(3)              
Where there is still uncertainty over whether a
stay is warranted after steps (1) and (2), the court is required to balance the
interests in favour of granting a stay, such as denouncing misconduct and
preserving the integrity of the justice system, against “the interest that
society has in having a final decision on the merits” (ibid., at para.
57).

[33]                         
The test is the same for both categories because
concerns regarding trial fairness and the integrity of the justice system are
often linked and regularly arise in the same case.  Having one test for both
categories creates a coherent framework that avoids “schizophrenia” in the law
(O’Connor, at para. 71).  But while the framework is the same for both
categories, the test may — and often will — play out differently depending on
whether the “main” or “residual” category is invoked.  

[34]                         
Commencing with the first stage of the test,
when the main category is invoked, the question is whether the accused’s right
to a fair trial has been prejudiced and whether that prejudice will be carried
forward through the conduct of the trial; in other words, the concern is
whether there is ongoing unfairness to the accused.  

[35]                         
By contrast, when the residual category is
invoked, the question is whether the state has engaged in conduct that is
offensive to societal notions of fair play and decency and whether proceeding
with a trial in the face of that conduct would be harmful to the integrity of
the justice system.  To put it in simpler terms, there are limits on the type
of conduct society will tolerate in the prosecution of offences.  At times,
state conduct will be so troublesome that having a trial — even a fair one —
will leave the impression that the justice system condones conduct that offends
society’s sense of fair play and decency.  This harms the integrity of the
justice system.  In these kinds of cases, the first stage of the test is met.

[36]                         
In Canada (Minister of Citizenship and
Immigration) v. Tobiass, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391, this Court described the
residual category in the following way:  

For a stay of proceedings to be
appropriate in a case falling into the residual category, it must appear that
the state misconduct is likely to continue in the future or that the carrying
forward of the prosecution will offend society’s sense of justice.  Ordinarily,
the latter condition will not be met unless the former is as well — society
will not take umbrage at the carrying forward of a prosecution unless it is likely
that some form of misconduct will continue.  There may be exceptional cases in
which the past misconduct is so egregious that the mere fact of going forward
in the light of it will be offensive.  But such cases should be relatively very
rare.  [para. 91] 

[37]                         
Two points of interest arise from this
description.  First, while it is generally true that the residual category will
be invoked as a result of state misconduct, this will not always be so. 
Circumstances may arise where the integrity of the justice system is implicated
in the absence of misconduct.  Repeatedly prosecuting an accused for the same
offence after successive juries have been unable to reach a verdict stands as
an example (see, e.g., R. v. Keyowski, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 657), as does
using the criminal courts to collect a civil debt (see, e.g., R. v. Waugh
(1985), 68 N.S.R. (2d) 247 (S.C., App. Div.)).

[38]                         
Second, in a residual category case, regardless
of the type of conduct complained of, the question to be answered at the first
stage of the test is the same: whether proceeding in light of the impugned
conduct would do further harm to the integrity of the justice system.  While I
do not question the distinction between ongoing and past misconduct, it does
not completely resolve the question of whether carrying on with a trial
occasions further harm to the justice system.  The court must still consider
whether proceeding would lend judicial condonation to the impugned conduct.  

[39]                         
At the second stage of the test, the question is
whether any other remedy short of a stay is capable of redressing the
prejudice.  Different remedies may apply depending on whether the prejudice
relates to the accused’s right to a fair trial (the main category) or whether
it relates to the integrity of the justice system (the residual category). 
Where the concern is trial fairness, the focus is on restoring an accused’s
right to a fair trial.  Here, procedural remedies, such as ordering a new
trial, are more likely to address the prejudice of ongoing unfairness.  Where
the residual category is invoked, however, and the prejudice complained of is
prejudice to the integrity of the justice system, remedies must be directed
towards that harm.  It must be remembered that for those cases which fall
solely within the residual category, the goal is not to provide redress
to an accused for a wrong that has been done to him or her in the past. 
Instead, the focus is on whether an alternate remedy short of a stay of
proceedings will adequately dissociate the justice system from the
impugned state conduct going forward.  

[40]                         
Finally, the balancing of interests that occurs
at the third stage of the test takes on added significance when the residual
category is invoked.  This Court has stated that the balancing need only be
undertaken where there is still uncertainty as to whether a stay is appropriate
after the first two parts of the test have been completed (Tobiass, at
para. 92).  When the main category is invoked, it will often be clear by the
time the balancing stage has been reached that trial fairness has not been
prejudiced or, if it has, that another remedy short of a stay is available to
address the concern.  In those cases, no balancing is required.  In rare cases,
it will be evident that state conduct has permanently prevented a fair trial
from taking place.  In these “clearest of cases”, the third and final balancing
step will often add little to the inquiry, as society has no interest in unfair
trials.

[41]                         
However, when the residual category is invoked,
the balancing stage takes on added importance.  Where prejudice to the
integrity of the justice system is alleged, the court is asked to decide which
of two options better protects the integrity of the system: staying the
proceedings, or having a trial despite the impugned conduct.  This inquiry
necessarily demands balancing.  The court must consider such things as the
nature and seriousness of the impugned conduct, whether the conduct is isolated
or reflects a systemic and ongoing problem, the circumstances of the accused,
the charges he or she faces, and the interests of society in having the charges
disposed of on the merits.[5] 
Clearly, the more egregious the state conduct, the greater the need for the
court to dissociate itself from it.  When the conduct in question shocks the
community’s conscience and/or offends its sense of fair play and decency, it
becomes less likely that society’s interest in a full trial on the merits will
prevail in the balancing process.  But in residual category cases, balance must
always be considered.  

[42]                         
This Court’s recent decision in R. v.
Bellusci, 2012 SCC 44, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 509, attests to the need for
balancing when the conduct in question falls solely within the residual
category.  In Bellusci, the accused was assaulted in the back of a van
by a prison guard while he was shackled and handcuffed.  The accused was
charged with assaulting the guard and intimidating a justice system
participant.  Fish J., writing for a unanimous Court, upheld the trial judge’s
decision to issue a stay of proceedings for state misconduct falling in the
residual category.  In doing so, he noted that the trial judge had 

appreciated the need to balance
the competing interests at play in contemplating a stay of proceedings. He
expressly took into account the difficult position of prison guards, the
importance to the justice system of ensuring their protection, the seriousness
of the charges against the accused, the integrity of the justice system, and
the nature and gravity of the violation of Mr. Bellusci’s rights. Only then did
he conclude that a stay was warranted.  [Emphasis added; para. 29.]  

[43]                         
The Ontario Court of Appeal has also recently
emphasized the importance of the balancing stage when the residual category is
in issue:  

In some sense, an accused who is
granted a stay under the residual category realizes a windfall.  Thus, it is
important to consider if the price of the stay of a charge against a particular
accused is worth the gain.  Does the advantage of
staying the charges against this accused outweigh the interest in having the
case decided on the merits?  In answering that question, a court will almost
inevitably have to engage in the type of balancing exercise that is referred to
in the third criterion.  [Emphasis added.]

(R. v. Zarinchang,
2010 ONCA 286, 99 O.R. (3d) 721, at para. 60)

[44]                         
Undoubtedly, the balancing of societal interests
that must take place and the “clearest of cases” threshold presents an accused
who seeks a stay under the residual category with an onerous burden.  Indeed,
in the residual category, cases warranting a stay of proceedings will be
“exceptional” and “very rare” (Tobiass, at para. 91).  But this is as it
should be.  It is only where the “affront to fair play and decency is
disproportionate to the societal interest in the effective prosecution of
criminal cases” that a stay of proceedings will be warranted (R. v. Conway,
[1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659, at p. 1667).  

[45]                         
To recapitulate, while the framework is the same
for both categories, the test may — and often will — play out differently
depending on whether the “main” or “residual” category is invoked.

[46]                         
The following hypothetical may serve as a useful
illustration.  Take a case where it is discovered, after trial, that the police
have tampered with the jury in order to secure the conviction of an accused.  Manifestly,
the police conduct would impinge on the accused’s right to a fair trial — but
it would also impinge on the integrity of the justice system.  

[47]                         
Ordering a new trial would probably redress the
unfairness of the original trial.  But the inquiry would not end there.  The
court would also have to decide whether ordering a new trial, or some other
remedy, would suffice to dissociate it from the prejudice occasioned to the
integrity of the justice system by the police misconduct.  If no remedy would suffice,
the court would have to engage in the balancing process and determine whether
the integrity of the justice system would be better served by a stay of
proceedings or a full trial on the merits.  Given the seriousness of the
misconduct — jury tampering strikes at the very heart of the criminal justice
system — the residual category might well necessitate a stay of proceedings to
redress the threat to the integrity of the justice system, even though the
unfairness that marred the first trial could be cured by a second trial. 

B.           
Whether a Stay of Proceedings Was Warranted in
the Instant Case

[48]                         
The standard of review for a remedy ordered
under s. 24(1)  of the Charter  is well established.  Appellate
intervention is warranted only where a trial judge misdirects him or herself in
law, commits a reviewable error of fact, or renders a decision that is “so
clearly wrong as to amount to an injustice” (Bellusci, at para. 19; Regan,
at para. 117; Tobiass, at para. 87; R. v. Bjelland, 2009
SCC 38, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 651, at paras. 15 and 51).  

[49]                         
In the instant case, the appellants acknowledge
that trial fairness is not in issue.  They accept that the trial judge viewed
the misconduct as coming within the residual category.  Approaching the matter
from that perspective, I am respectfully of the view that the trial judge erred
in assessing all three forms of alleged state misconduct.  

(1)        
The Medical Records

[50]                         
In order for the Crown’s conduct in securing Mr.
Piccirilli’s medical records to factor into a decision to stay proceedings, it
must pass the first stage of the test.  That is, the appellants must show that
Ms. Kovacevich’s conduct was prejudicial to the integrity of the justice
system.  The trial judge appears to have found that this requirement was met
when, after considering her conduct, he held that [translation] “[t]his conduct will be taken into
consideration in reviewing the abuse of process motion” (para. 57).

[51]                         
 The trial judge committed a palpable and
overriding error in reaching the conclusion that this conduct impinged on the
integrity of the justice system.  In the first place, he erred in concluding
that the Crown’s conduct was marked by a lack of transparency because the Crown
had [translation] “always refused
to disclose the source of the information” (para. 56).  In fact, the Crown
disclosed the source of the information within a matter of days.  In addition,
the trial judge failed to consider that Mr. Piccirilli had put his health in
issue in his application for interim release and had undertaken to provide the
court with his medical records.  The trial judge also failed to consider that
Ms. Kovacevich had asked the medical staff at the jail to provide an affidavit
explaining the medical care Mr. Piccirilli had received since his heart
attack.  It appears that Mr. Piccirilli’s doctor took it upon himself to
forward the appellant’s medical records to the Crown. 

[52]                         
In my view, when the Crown’s conduct is
considered free of the trial judge’s errors, it is clear that it occasioned no
prejudice to the integrity of the justice system.  Mr. Piccirilli had put the
state of his health in issue.  Ms. Kovacevich sought an affidavit from the jail
Mr. Piccirilli was being held in.  When she received more than she asked for —
Mr. Piccirilli’s confidential medical records — she immediately disclosed the
information to Mr. Piccirilli’s counsel.  Within a matter of days, she also
disclosed the source of the information.[6] 
Accordingly, the appellants’ argument fails at the first stage of the test.   

(2)        
The Police Collusion

[53]                         
The Court of Appeal disagreed with the trial
judge’s finding that Constables Brière and Sénéchal colluded to mislead
the court.  I too have serious reservations with the trial judge’s finding. 
Indeed, had I been the trial judge, I doubt that I would have reached the same
conclusion.  However, having seen the witnesses, the trial judge was in a
better position to assess the matter.  Accordingly, his finding is entitled to
deference.  

[54]                         
That said, at the first stage of the test, the
officers’ conduct must be looked at in context.  Cst. Brière changed his
testimony on a central issue: whether he or Mr. Babos opened the trunk of the
car.  He did so, however, after having testified at the preliminary inquiry. 
As an officer, he surely knew that this change would be the subject of questioning
by defence counsel.  Changes in an officer’s testimony are routinely exposed in
cross-examination.  And when Cst. Brière was predictably questioned about why
his story had changed, he immediately explained that he had spoken with Cst.
Sénéchal and had been [translation] “convinced”
of the true version of events.  There was no attempt by the officers to cover
up their discussions or to hide anything from the court.  To the extent this
amounts to collusion, it does so in the most technical sense.  Whatever threat
it poses to the integrity of the justice system must surely be slight.

[55]                         
However, given the trial judge’s finding, it is
necessary to proceed to the second stage of the test and ask whether there is
another remedy, short of a stay, capable of redressing the prejudice to the
integrity of the judicial system occasioned by the collusion.

[56]                         
Two concerns to the integrity of the justice
system arise out of the trial judge’s finding of collusion: (1) the impropriety
of police collusion designed to mislead the court, and (2) the Crown’s attempt
to introduce the firearm against Mr. Piccirilli in the wake of the trial
judge’s finding of collusion.  Manifestly, both are improper.  But there was
another remedy before the trial judge that would have addressed both, namely:
refusing to admit the firearm against Mr. Piccirilli even though he had no
standing under s. 8  of the Charter  to challenge its admissibility.  The
trial judge erred in failing to consider that alternative.

[57]                         
Excluding the firearm against Mr. Piccirilli
would serve to dissociate the court from the officers’ collusion and the
Crown’s misguided attempt, in the face of that finding, to introduce the
firearm against Mr. Piccirilli.  Both forms of misconduct were intended to
achieve the same end — admission of the firearm into evidence.  Excluding the
firearm against Mr. Piccirilli — even though it was likely admissible against
him — purges the problematic evidence from the trial, thereby dissociating the
court from the misconduct in question.  By doing so, it cannot be said that the
misconduct has a lingering effect on the integrity of the justice system.  In
my view, this remedy fully addresses any prejudice occasioned to the justice
system by the impugned conduct.  Hence, there is no need to go further in the
analysis.  

(3)        
The Crown’s Threatening Conduct

[58]                         
In the end, I view this case as turning on the
Crown’s threatening conduct.  

[59]                         
The distinction between the Crown’s conduct in
this case and legitimate plea bargaining practices should be made clear at the
outset.  It is perfectly proper for the Crown to indicate that it will drop
certain charges, grounded in the evidence, if the accused pleads guilty.  It is
also proper for a Crown to advise counsel that if evidence arises at the
preliminary inquiry that would support additional charges, they may be added to
the indictment under s. 574(1) (b) of the Criminal Code .[7]  Where discussions of
this sort occur with counsel after substantial disclosure has been provided,
the accused and his or her lawyer are able to make an informed decision as to
how to proceed and nothing improper has occurred.

[60]                         
The Crown’s conduct in this case was of a
different nature.  The impugned comments were made early on in the proceedings,
before the appellants and their counsel had sufficient disclosure to make an
informed decision as to how they wished to proceed.  Moreover, in at least one
instance, the comments occurred in the presence of one of the appellants, Mr.
Piccirilli.  And the Crown’s language was nothing short of threatening.  Mr.
Piccirilli was told, for example, that if he did not settle, he was going to be
[translation] “hit by a train”. 
Put simply, the Crown’s threats were intended to pressure the appellants into
foregoing their right to a trial.  

[61]                         
Without question, the bullying tactic to which
Ms. Tremblay resorted was reprehensible and unworthy of the dignity of her
office.  It should not be repeated by her or any other Crown.  In her capacity
as a Crown, Ms. Tremblay’s role was that of a quasi-judicial officer.  Her
function was to be “assistant to the Court in the furtherance of justice, and
not to act as counsel for any particular person or party” (Boucher v. The
Queen, [1955] S.C.R. 16, at p. 25).  In threatening to charge Mr.
Piccirilli with more offences if he did not plead guilty, Ms. Tremblay betrayed
her role as a Crown.  Manifestly it is the type of conduct the court should
dissociate itself from.

[62]                         
However, the threats must be considered in their
context.  With respect, the trial judge did not do so.  Here, there were
several factors which the trial judge failed to consider.  With respect, he
erred in this regard. 

[63]                         
The threats were made more than a year before
the trial began.  The 18-month long silence of the appellants and their counsel
sheds some light on how seriously they took the threats.  Had they been taken
seriously, one might have expected counsel to respond immediately.  Surely the
proper course of action was not to sit back for over a year before applying,
mid-trial, for a stay of proceedings.  Instead, counsel should have confronted
Ms. Tremblay and, failing an adequate response by her, brought the matter
immediately to the attention of a senior Crown or a judge.  That way, Ms.
Tremblay could have been removed from the file during the early stages of the
proceedings.  Be that as it may, as it turned out, she was removed from the
case months before the trial started — and it was not until six months after
the trial was underway that the threats first came to light.

[64]                         
As indicated, context is essential in
considering the seriousness of the threatening conduct.  By the time the
misconduct came to light, Ms. Tremblay had long since been removed
from the case and no longer played any part in it.  The trial judge
acknowledged this fact but did not consider it to be an attenuating factor
because the Crown’s office had taken no steps [translation]
“to remedy or even try to remedy the situation” once the threats were
revealed and had instead “remained entrenched in its position” (para. 66). 
With respect, this observation does not accurately reflect the facts.  At the
point when the threats first came to light, they were unproven and Ms.
Tremblay’s health did not allow her to testify.[8] 
The Crown’s office did not condone Ms. Tremblay’s actions, but simply left it to
the appellants to prove the threats.  Surely the Crown’s office cannot be
faulted for taking that approach, especially in the absence of any evidence
suggesting that Ms. Tremblay’s conduct was systemic.

[65]                         
Moreover, the trial judge did not consider the
passage of time between when the threats were made and when they were first
brought to light.  He made no mention of this in his reasons.  In this regard,
while I agree in general with Justice Abella that the passage of time itself
cannot  “retroactively cure intolerable state conduct” (para. 82), its
significance here is that it serves as a yardstick against which to measure
just how serious Ms. Tremblay’s conduct was perceived by the defence.  The fact
that defence counsel took no steps for over a year to raise concerns — and
then, almost by accident in the context of a s. 11 (b) delay motion —
sheds important light on this subject.  The trial judge erred in failing to
take this into account.

[66]                         
Manifestly, Ms. Tremblay’s misconduct was
serious enough to warrant proceeding to the second stage of the test.  That
said, in my respectful view, when the mitigating factors which the trial judge
failed to consider are taken into account, the trial judge’s conclusion that
the threats amounted to [translation] “an
abuse of the worst kind” is simply not borne out (para. 78). 

[67]                         
Turning to the second stage of the test, as no
argument was made that there was an alternate remedy capable of redressing the
particular harm caused to the integrity of the justice system by the threats, I
need not finally decide whether such a remedy was available.  Instead, I turn
to the third stage of the test, namely, whether Ms. Tremblay’s conduct was
sufficiently egregious to warrant a stay of proceedings.

[68]                         
The answer lies in the balancing process — an
exercise which the trial judge did not undertake.  The question at this stage
is whether the integrity of the justice system is better preserved by staying
the proceedings, or proceeding to a trial in the face of the Crown’s
threatening conduct.

[69]                         
This balancing requires weighing the seriousness
of the misconduct against the societal interest in having a trial.  At this
stage, the very serious nature of the charges facing the appellants — 22
charges concerning firearms, illegal drugs, and organized crime — looms large. 
Society has a profound interest in seeing justice done by having the guilt or
innocence of the appellants determined through a full trial on the merits. 
When the impugned misconduct — threats uttered more than a year before trial by
a Crown no longer on the case — is weighed against society’s interest in a
trial, I am satisfied that this is not one of the “clearest of cases” where the
exceptional remedy of a stay of proceedings is warranted.  

[70]                         
The appellants contend that this case is analogous
to United States of America v. Cobb, 2001 SCC 19, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 587, a
case in which this Court upheld a stay of proceedings.  In Cobb, the
accused were facing extradition proceedings from Canada to the United States. 
They were granted a stay after the American prosecutor on the file hinted to
the media that uncooperative fugitives would be subjected to rape in prison,
and the judge presiding over their trial in the United States commented that
uncooperative defendants would get the maximum jail sentence legally
available.  

[71]                         
This case is a far cry from Cobb.  In Cobb,
the American prosecutor had threatened the accused with sexual violence.  Here,
the Crown threatened to charge the accused with additional offences if they did
not plead guilty.  While that was improper, the threats related to something
she could have done legally under s. 574(1) (b) of the Criminal Code . 
Moreover, the decision to stay the proceedings in Cobb was motivated in
large part by the fact that the prosecutor who made the threats remained in
charge of the prosecutions.  This Court noted that extraditing the accused
would return them to an “ominous climate” in which the American prosecutor and
judge would play a “large, if not decisive role” in determining their “ultimate
fate” (Cobb, at para. 43).  Here, Ms. Tremblay was off the case long
before trial.  In my view, Cobb provides little or no assistance to the
appellants.    

VI.       
Conclusion

[72]                         
In deciding that a stay of proceedings is
unwarranted in this case, I have assessed the three forms of alleged misconduct
individually.  The Crown’s conduct in securing Mr. Piccirilli’s medical records
occasioned no prejudice to the integrity of the justice system.  The harm
caused by the finding of police collusion was curable through an alternate
remedy: excluding the firearm from evidence against both appellants.  And the
Crown’s threatening conduct, while reprehensible, did not approximate the type
of shocking conduct needed to justify a stay. 

[73]                         
This case lent itself to an individualistic approach. 
The three alleged instances of misconduct were separate and distinct, committed
at different times by different players.  There was no link between them.  And
in only one instance — the Crown’s threatening behaviour — was it necessary to
consider the third stage of the test and balance the Crown’s misconduct against
society’s interest in a trial on the merits.  That said, I should not be taken
as suggesting that an individualistic approach should always be followed. 
Indeed, a judge who is required to balance several instances of misconduct
against the societal interest in a trial will almost certainly wish to consider
the conduct cumulatively and in its full context.  As well, there may be cases
where the nature and number of incidents, though individually unworthy of a
stay, will require one when considered together.  But this is not such a case.

[74]                         
For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeals. 


                    The following are the reasons
delivered by

[75]                         
Abella J. (dissenting) — A stay should only be imposed
in the clearest of cases, as Justice Moldaver points out, since it has the
effect of precluding proceedings which determine the merits of a case,
something to which the public — and the parties — are entitled.  But the public
is also entitled to have confidence in the integrity of the justice system.  A
Crown who makes threats intended to bully an accused into foregoing his or her
right to a trial, takes fatal aim at the heart of the public’s confidence in
that integrity. 

Analysis

[76]                         
A stay may be justified for an abuse of process
under the residual category when the state’s conduct “contravenes fundamental
notions of justice and thus undermines the integrity of the judicial process” (R.
v. O’Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, at para. 73). A stay may be
justified, in exceptional circumstances, when the conduct “is so egregious that
the mere fact of going forward [with the trial] in the light of it [would] be
offensive” (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Tobiass,
[1997] 3 S.C.R. 391, at para. 91). 

[77]                         
There are two public interests at play: “the
affront to fair play and decency” and “the effective prosecution of criminal
cases”.  Where the affront is “disproportionate”, the administration of justice
is “best served by staying the proceedings” (R. v. Conway, [1989] 1
S.C.R. 1659, at p. 1667).

[78]                         
In other words, when the conduct is so
profoundly and demonstrably inconsistent with the public perception of what a
fair justice system requires, proceeding with a trial means condoning
unforgivable conduct.

[79]                         
The Crown who is the focus of this appeal
threatened one of the co-accused, Sergio Piccirilli, on three separate
occasions. The threats were made twice to Mr. Piccirilli personally and once to
his lawyer. All were to the effect that if Mr. Piccirilli did not plead guilty,
he would be charged with additional, serious offences. By the time the trial
started several months after the last threat, the Crown was on medical leave
and a new Crown was assigned to the case.  New charges were in fact brought.  

[80]                         
The trial judge concluded that the Crown’s
conduct was in “bad faith”, “unacceptable”, “intolerable”, “unjustifiable”, and
was one of the “exceptional and rare cases” that justified a stay.

[81]                         
The Court of Appeal agreed that the threats were
“unacceptable” and “outrageous”, but found that the trial judge erred in
imposing a stay because he did not undertake a sufficient balancing or
sufficiently consider the context.  That context included the fact that the
threats were made more than a year before the trial began, that counsel did not
react immediately, and that the Crown was replaced for health reasons months
before the trial started.  In other words, the impact of the threats was
mitigated by the passage of time and the change in personnel.

[82]                         
With great respect, however, the passage of time
does not operate to attenuate what was unpardonable conduct. Time is not a
legal remedy for a fundamental breach of the Crown’s role, and cannot
retroactively cure intolerable state conduct.  The reason, therefore, that the
trial judge did not mention the passage of time in assessing the impact of the
threats on the public’s confidence in a fair justice system, is that it was not
relevant. It was the fact that the threats were made at all that was key, not
when they were made (United States of America v. Shulman, [2001]
1 S.C.R. 616).

[83]                         
Moreover, I am not persuaded that a balancing
exercise was required here. The trial judge was unequivocal in concluding that
the abuse justified a stay. There was none of the uncertainty as to the
propriety of a stay that this Court said was a condition precedent to the need
for a balancing exercise (Tobiass, at para. 92; R. v. Regan,
[2002] 1 S.C.R. 297, at para. 57).  

[84]                         
But in any event, it is not at all clear to me
how one goes about such a balancing. When a trial judge has concluded that
conduct is “so egregious that the mere fact of going forward in the light of it
will be offensive” (Tobiass, at para. 91), against what does one
balance that singularly egregious state conduct? When a trial judge has found
that the conduct cannot be condoned because it is such an exceptional assault
on the public’s sense of justice, it seems to me to be conceptually
inconsistent to nonetheless ask the court to undermine its own conclusion by
re-weighing the half of the scale that contains the public’s interest in trials
on the merits.  It is one thing to require that trial judges look at the
“competing interests at play” (R. v. Bellusci, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 509, at
para. 29) before concluding that the state conduct could not be condoned,
but how, having concluded that it could not be condoned, can such conduct be
subjected to yet another balancing of factors to determine whether it is
nonetheless pardonable? 

[85]                         
Of course the public has an interest in trials
on the merits, but it has an even greater interest in knowing that when the
state is involved in proceedings, particularly those that can result in an
individual’s loss of liberty, it will put fairness above expedience. Justice is
not only about results, it is about how those results are obtained. When a
Crown threatens an accused with additional offences if he or she does not plead
guilty, the public’s interest in the results of a trial must yield to the
transcendent interest in protecting the public’s confidence in the integrity of
the justice system.

[86]                         
In Bellusci, this Court cautioned
appellate courts to exercise restraint with respect to the findings of the
trial judge, intervening only if the trial judge “misdirects himself or if his
decision is so clearly wrong as to amount to an injustice” (para. 17; see also Regan,
at para. 117; Tobiass, at para. 87). There was no such misdirection or
injustice here. On the contrary, the trial judge concluded that a stay was
justified in order to prevent an injustice to the justice system
itself.  I agree.

[87]                         
I would allow the appeals.

“577” is a reference to s. 577  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C-46 , which empowers a Crown to prefer a “direct indictment”, bypassing an
accused’s right to a preliminary inquiry.





[2]
At the preliminary inquiry, Cst. Brière testified that he had opened the trunk
of the car. 





[3]
Cst. Brière testified that Mr. Babos opened the trunk most of the way, and that
he opened the trunk [translation] “a
little bit” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 217). 

 





[4]
As matters turned out, the trial judge never did make a final ruling on the
admissibility of the firearm against Mr. Piccirilli.  Instead, he ended up
staying the proceedings against Mr. Piccirilli and in doing so, he took into
account the Crown’s attempt to introduce the firearm against him despite his
earlier finding of collusion on the part of the officers.





[5]
At this stage, whether the impugned conduct is a systemic and ongoing
problem or lies purely in the past may also become relevant.  Where the conduct
is ongoing and systemic, it may be more difficult for the court to dissociate

                    S
was convicted of importation and possession for the purposes of trafficking of
50 kg of cocaine.  The cocaine was seized by border officers who found it
hidden in a concealed compartment of a pickup truck S attempted to drive from
the United States into Canada.  The case against S was entirely circumstantial
and the only issue at trial was whether he knew of the cocaine in the truck.  S
claimed that an acquaintance had asked him to drive the truck and that he had
no knowledge of the cocaine.  The trial judge rejected S’s testimony in its
entirety.  The judge found that S knew of the cocaine based on:  its amount and
value; expert evidence from a police officer pertaining to the customs and
habits of drug couriers, including the fact that in his many years’ experience
he had never encountered a blind courier; and evidence that S had detached the
fob that controlled access to the secret compartment from his key chain before
handing the keys to the border officer.  The trial judge also relied on
additional items of circumstantial evidence that pointed towards S’s guilty
knowledge.  On appeal, S argued that the trial judge should not have admitted
or relied on the expert evidence of the police officer and in particular, that
portion of his evidence relating to his own experience with blind couriers.  A
majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.

                    Held
(McLachlin C.J. and LeBel J. dissenting):  The appeal should be
dismissed.

                    Per
Abella, Rothstein, Moldaver, Karakatsanis and Wagner JJ.:  The police
officer’s evidence relating to his own experience with blind couriers was
inadmissible and the trial judge erred in relying upon it.  Admission of expert
evidence depends on the Mohan criteria of relevance, necessity in
assisting the trier of fact, absence of any exclusionary rule and a properly
qualified expert.  It is not enough for a trial judge to simply consider the Mohan
criteria at the outset of an expert’s testimony and make an initial ruling as
to the admissibility of the evidence.  The judge must do his or her best to
ensure that throughout, the expert’s testimony remains within the proper boundaries
of expert evidence.  This includes ensuring, so far as possible, that the
content of the evidence itself is properly the subject of expert evidence.  Where
mistakes are made and the testimony strays beyond the proper scope of expert
evidence, it is imperative that the trial judge not assign any weight to the
inadmissible parts.

                    In
this case, the fact that the police officer had never encountered a blind
courier in his many investigations was neither necessary nor relevant to the issue
facing the trial judge — whether S knew about the cocaine.  The officer’s
evidence was not necessary because determining whether S knew about the cocaine
was not beyond the knowledge and experience of the judge and was not technical
or scientific in nature.  Moreover, the guilt or innocence of accused persons
that the police officer had encountered in the past was not legally relevant to
S’s guilt or innocence. In other words, the officer’s testimony was of no
probative value in determining whether S knew about the cocaine and its lack of
relevance is sufficient to justify its exclusion.

                    The
inadmissible testimony, however, forms one sentence of a 16‑page judgment
that is otherwise flawless.  In the judgment, the judge provided a long list of
reasons for rejecting S’s testimony.  And apart from the one aspect of the
expert’s testimony that he should not have considered, the judge provided an
equally impressive list of reasons for concluding that S knew about the cocaine.

                    While
the trial judge’s error in this case is not harmless, the evidence of S’s guilt
is so overwhelming that a trier of fact would inevitably convict.  Hence, the
second branch of the curative proviso can be applied to sustain S’s
convictions.  The fob evidence on its own was devastating.  But it did not
stand alone; it was part of a web of circumstantial evidence pointing towards
S’s guilt.  When considering the second branch of the curative proviso in a
circumstantial case, it is necessary to look at the whole of the admissible
evidence in assessing the strength of the case.  It is not the task of an
appellate court to parse each item of evidence in search of a possible innocent
explanation.  If that were so, it would be impossible to ever satisfy the
second branch. 

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and LeBel J. (dissenting):  The police officer’s
evidence that in his many investigations he had never encountered a blind
courier strayed from what would be admissible expert evidence.  His testimony
was equivalent to a statement that individuals in S’s position always know
about the drugs. It is a short step from such evidence to an inference that S
must have known about the cocaine.  The evidence effectively amounted to an
opinion that S possessed the mens rea for the offences with which he was
charged, which was the issue in this trial.  Whether it was admissible
therefore requires special scrutiny.

                    Applying
the Mohan criteria, the expert evidence should not have been admitted.  The
evidence was not necessary, as it was open to the judge to infer what S knew or
did not know.  Nor was it relevant.  The officer’s opinion invited the judge to
find that S knew about the cocaine on the basis that all people driving
vehicles containing hidden drugs know about the drugs.  In addition to usurping
the trial judge’s role in resolving the issue of guilt or innocence, the
opinion depended on an unacceptable and unfair inference. 

                    Given
the trial judge’s error was not a harmless one that would have no impact on the
verdict, this is not an appropriate case for application of the second branch
of the curative proviso.  The issue in applying the second branch is not
whether the trial judge could make the inference he did or whether that
inference was determinative of guilt, but whether it was the only rational
conclusion. In this case, it was not.

                    While
ordering a new trial places demands on judicial resources, this cannot override
S’s right to a fair trial based solely on admissible evidence.  The trial judge
relied on inadmissible evidence and this was a serious error.  If this Court
excludes evidence described by the trial judge as one of the foundations of his
conclusion that S was guilty, it cannot then hold that the evidence against S
was nonetheless overwhelming without engaging in pure speculation.  Such a
conclusion would contradict what the trial judge himself wrote and would rest
on an improper reweighing of the remaining evidence.  The curative proviso does
not permit this Court to deny a retrial in such circumstances.

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
On January 25, 2005, the appellant, Ajitpal
Singh Sekhon, was charged with unlawfully importing cocaine and unlawfully
possessing cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.  He was arrested when he
attempted to cross the border from Washington State into British Columbia.  The
key issue at trial was whether Mr. Sekhon knew about the cocaine that was
secreted in the pickup truck he was driving.  The trial judge found that he
did.  He based his decision in part on the testimony of an expert police
witness who testified about the customs and practices of the drug trade.  One
aspect of the expert’s evidence strayed beyond the proper scope of expert
testimony.  As such, it was inadmissible and should not have been relied on by
the trial judge.

[2]                             
The flawed testimony upon which the trial judge
relied forms one sentence of a 16-page judgment that is otherwise flawless.  In
particular, the trial judge provided a long list of reasons for disbelieving
the appellant and rejecting his testimony as incredible.  And apart from the
one aspect of the expert’s evidence that he should not have considered, the
trial judge provided an equally impressive list of reasons for concluding that
the appellant was aware of the cocaine secreted in the pickup truck.

[3]                             
In the end, the only issue of concern is whether
the curative proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , can be applied to sustain the convictions.  I
believe it can.  While the error relating to the flawed expert testimony cannot
be swept aside as harmless, the evidence establishing the appellant’s guilty
knowledge — and thus his guilt — is overwhelming.  Hence, the second
branch of the curative proviso can safely be applied to sustain the
convictions. 

[4]                             
Because this case turns on the application of
the second branch of the curative proviso, I find it necessary to review the
evidence and the trial judge’s findings of fact in some detail.

II.          
Facts

[5]                             
On January 25, 2005, shortly after 4:30 p.m.,
Mr. Sekhon attempted to drive a pickup truck across the border from Washington
State into British Columbia.  He was the sole occupant of the truck.

[6]                             
The customs officer at the primary inspection
booth noted that Mr. Sekhon appeared tense and was gripping the steering
wheel.  When asked about the purpose of his trip, he told the customs officer
that he had been delivering cheques to workers at a farm.  He was unable to
produce any receipts or pay stubs to support his stated purpose for travel.

[7]                             
The customs officer referred Mr. Sekhon for a
secondary examination.  Mr. Sekhon was told to park the vehicle in a secondary
parking area and go to the customs office.

[8]                             
At the customs office, Mr. Sekhon was asked for
the keys to the pickup truck.  He complied and turned them over to the customs
officer. 

[9]                             
Mr. Sekhon began to pace nervously around the
customs office.  At one point, he attempted to leave the building but was
directed to return.  Meanwhile, customs officers undertook an inspection of the
truck.  This led to the discovery of packages of a white powdery substance,
believed to be cocaine, hidden in a concealed compartment. 

[10]                         
After the white powdery substance was
discovered, Mr. Sekhon was informed that he was being detained.  He was advised
of his rights and asked to empty his pockets.  Among the items produced were a
key fob on a chain, a cellular phone, and an envelope. 

[11]                         
The cellular phone began ringing and continued
to ring for the duration of the time that it was in the possession of the
customs officers. 

[12]                         
Mr. Sekhon indicated that the key fob was his
and that it was for the truck. 

[13]                         
The envelope bore the name “Westhall Properties
Ltd.”.  On the envelope were the following handwritten notations: “Combo lock
34-11-20, time enterphone 204, Parking 284, locker 185” (A.R., vol. V, at p.
82).

[14]                         
Mr. Sekhon was then arrested and escorted to a
detention cell in the customs building.  He was once again advised of his
rights and chose to speak to a lawyer over the phone.  After this phone call, a
customs officer went to check on Mr. Sekhon.  He noticed a wet, partially
chewed-up piece of green paper on the floor of Mr. Sekhon’s cell.  When asked
about the paper, Mr. Sekhon told the customs officer that he had retrieved it
from the commercial counter in the customs office.  Upon being confronted with
the fact that there was no green paper in that area, Mr. Sekhon said it had
come from the truck. 

[15]                         
Further examination of the hidden compartment of
the truck revealed the presence of 50 bricks of cocaine, each weighing one
kilogram.  The hidden compartment was equipped with a hydraulic jack mechanism
enabling the compartment to be opened and closed.  The key fob recovered from
Mr. Sekhon had been engineered to open and close the compartment if the correct
buttons were pressed in a particular sequence.

[16]                         
Mr. Sekhon was charged with unlawfully importing
cocaine into Canada contrary to s. 6(1)  of the Controlled Drugs and
Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19 , and with unlawfully possessing cocaine
for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of that Act.  

III.       
Proceedings Below

[17]                         
Judge Dohm, of the Provincial Court of British
Columbia, presided over Mr. Sekhon’s trial.  The sole issue at trial was
whether the Crown could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Sekhon had the
requisite mens rea for the two offences charged, that is, knowledge of
the cocaine. 

A.          
Crown Evidence

[18]                         
The Crown called a police officer, Sgt.
Arsenault, to give expert evidence regarding the customs and practices of the
drug trade.  Specifically, Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence was to focus on chains of
distribution, distribution routes, means of transportation, methods of
concealment, packaging, value, cost and profit margins.  Sgt. Arsenault had
been a police officer for 33 years and had been involved in approximately 1,000
cases involving the importation of cocaine.  His qualifications as an expert
witness were admitted.

[19]                         
Sgt. Arsenault testified at length about the
customs of the cocaine trade.  He valued the amount of cocaine found in the
pickup truck to be worth between $1,500,000 and $1,750,000 at the wholesale
level.  He explained that the recruitment of a drug courier takes time and that
an organization will not typically entrust a first-time courier with a large
shipment.  Instead, the courier’s reliability will be tested with smaller
shipments.  He testified that it was significant that Mr. Sekhon had been given
a fob that could open the hidden compartment; the fact that he “actually [ha]d
hands-on access to the shipment itself” showed that he had “a lot more trust .
. . within the group” (A.R., vol. III, at p. 151).

[20]                         
Towards the end of his examination-in-chief, the
following exchange occurred between Crown counsel and Sgt. Arsenault: 

Q  Officer, you described earlier that you’ve been involved in
approximately 1,000 investigations involving the importation of cocaine over
your 33-year career?

 

A  That is correct, Your Honour,
yes.[1]

 

Q  In approximately how many of those investigations were you able
to determine that the person importing the cocaine did not know about the
commodity that they were importing?

 

A  I have never encountered
it, personally. 

 

Q  Have you ever heard of a -- the use of a blind courier or a
courier who doesn’t know about the commodity that he is driving?

 

A  I -- I’ve certainly heard that argument being raised on -- on
occasion, primarily in court, not during my investigations.  [Footnote added;
A.R., vol. III, at p. 144.]

This brief exchange
contains the problematic evidence that is central to this appeal. It comprises
but a few lines of Sgt. Arsenault’s 34 pages of testimony. I shall refer to it
as the “Impugned Testimony”. 

B.           
Defence Evidence

[21]                         
The defence called two witnesses — Mr. Sekhon
himself and Mr. Sekhon’s nephew, Mr. Grewal. 

[22]                         
Mr. Sekhon presented the following version of
events.  On the day of his arrest, he said that he had been working on one of
his family farms in Abbotsford.  At some point in the afternoon, Mr. Grewal
came to pick him up.  Mr. Grewal asked Mr. Sekhon if he would accompany Mr.
Grewal to Washington State to deliver employee pay cheques and to check on some
pruning.  While in Washington State, Mr. Sekhon received a phone call from his
friend Chris, who was shopping at a nearby mall, and they agreed to meet at the
mall for lunch.  On the way to the mall, Mr. Grewal received a telephone call
asking him to return to one of the farms in Canada.  Mr. Grewal left Mr.
Sekhon at the mall because he knew that Mr. Sekhon would be able to get back to
Canada.  Over lunch, Chris told Mr. Sekhon that he had left his pickup truck in
the area the night before.  He had been drinking and received a ride home to
British Columbia with friends.  Since he had come back to the U.S. that day in
another vehicle, Chris asked Mr. Sekhon to drive his truck back to Canada for
him.  Mr. Sekhon agreed and Chris gave him a key attached to a fob.  Chris
showed Mr. Sekhon how to use the fob to lock and unlock the truck and activate
the truck alarm. 

[23]                         
Mr. Sekhon and Chris drove to the border
crossing in two separate vehicles.  Mr. Sekhon testified that after his release
from custody, he attempted to find Chris but was unsuccessful.  He maintained
that, even though he had known Chris for two years, he did not know Chris’s
last name and only had his cell phone number, which had been disconnected. 

[24]                         
Mr. Sekhon testified that he did not know that
there was cocaine in the truck, and that he had no reason to be suspicious of
Chris’s request. 

[25]                         
Mr. Grewal corroborated most of Mr. Sekhon’s
testimony up to the point of dropping Mr. Sekhon off at the mall. 

C.           
Reasons of the Trial Judge

(1)        
The Trial Judge’s View of Mr. Sekhon’s Evidence

[26]                         
The trial judge found numerous difficulties with
the version of events presented by Mr. Sekhon.  He discussed at length no less
than 12 deficiencies inherent in his story.  Some of the more glaring of these
are reviewed below. 

[27]                         
First, the trial judge found that it made “no
sense” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 18) that Chris would have left a vehicle containing
$1.5 million worth of cocaine parked overnight on a city street while he went
out drinking with friends.  Moreover, it would be “completely illogical” (p.
19) for Chris to drive to Washington State the following day without having a
firm plan, before leaving B.C., as to how the extra vehicle would be returned
to Canada.

[28]                         
Second, the trial judge observed that importing
50 kg of cocaine is clearly a risky venture and that Chris would logically want
to take steps to reduce the risk if in fact he had chosen to use a blind
courier.  Yet if Mr. Sekhon were asked at the border whether anyone had given
him anything to bring back into Canada — the question being a common one — the
truthful response would have been “the truck” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 20).  The
fact that Mr. Sekhon did not even know Chris’s last name would likely have
resulted in a referral for a secondary inspection and increased the risk that
the cocaine would be found.  The trial judge found it unlikely that Chris would
use Mr. Sekhon as a blind courier without providing him with more information
about the truck, including the name of its owner. 

[29]                         
Third, the trial judge noted that, according to
Mr. Sekhon’s testimony, when Chris gave the truck keys to Mr. Sekhon, they were
attached to the fob’s chain (A.R., vol. I, at p. 22).  The keys were connected
to this chain by a clasp that was not prone to open accidentally.  Manual
manipulation was required to separate the keys from the chain.  Significantly,
there was no fob attached to the keys that Mr. Sekhon provided to the customs
officer — the fob was only revealed later when Mr. Sekhon was asked to empty
his pockets.  The trial judge conducted a thorough review of the circumstances
surrounding the fob and concluded, based on all the evidence, that Mr. Sekhon
had manually separated the key from the fob after turning off the ignition in
the secondary inspection area.  Based on Mr. Sekhon’s version of the events,
there would have been no reason for doing so.  If, on the other hand, Mr.
Sekhon knew about the hidden compartment, he would logically want to distance
the fob, which controlled access to the hidden compartment, from the truck.

[30]                         
Fourth, the trial judge rejected Mr. Sekhon’s
explanation as to why, at the time of his arrest, he was in possession of the
envelope on which a lock combination was handwritten.  Mr. Sekhon testified
that the information related to a condominium unit he had been interested in
renting.  The trial judge found that it was “completely unbelievable” (A.R.,
vol. I, at p. 23) that information about the combination for a locker at that
unit would be provided to a person who had only expressed an interest in
renting.  The trial judge found it reasonable to conclude that the information
related to a storage locker, and noted that the cocaine would likely need to be
stored in Canada.  The trial judge also pointed out that the envelope was not
in Mr. Sekhon’s wallet, but in the pocket of his farm clothes.  On Mr. Sekhon’s
version of the events, there was no logical reason for having the envelope in
his possession at the time of his arrest.  It made no sense that he would have
put this envelope in his farm clothes; nor did it make any sense that he would
have been wearing his farm clothes when he viewed the condominium unit.

[31]                         
Fifth, the trial judge identified “glaring
inconsistencies” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 24) between what Mr. Sekhon told the
customs officers and what he testified to in court.  For example, when Mr.
Sekhon was initially asked by the customs officer whether he had any receipts
or pay stubs available to support his stated purpose of travel to the U.S., Mr.
Sekhon said he had given them to his accountant.  The trial judge pointed out
that “[i]n court, there was no mention of any accountant, nor could there be,
because it was Mr. Grewal and not the accused who dealt with the cheques and
the workers” (p. 25).  Another example highlighted by the trial judge was the
fact that Mr. Sekhon told a second customs officer that he took the cheques to
his friend’s uncle at the Arco gas station in Linden.  The trial judge noted
that “[t]he accused’s court testimony could not logically include a friend’s
uncle and there was no mention of any Arco gas station” (ibid.).  The
trial judge found that this was not simply an ordinary case of nerves that an
average person might experience at a border crossing.  He noted that some of
the inconsistent statements were made before the cocaine was found and that it
was “difficult to understand” how a true blind courier could be so nervous at
the border that he would misspeak to the extent of the inconsistencies in
question (ibid.).

[32]                         
Sixth, the trial judge addressed the fact that
Mr. Sekhon chewed up a piece of green paper while he was in the detention cell
at the immigration office.  He found that Mr. Sekhon’s explanation regarding
the origin of the paper was “simply unbelievable, as is the accused’s
suggestion that he chewed the paper because it was a habit he had at the time”
(A.R., vol. I, at p. 26).  On this point, the trial judge found that it was
“not unreasonable to conclude that he chewed it up because it contained some
potentially incriminating writing” (p. 33).

[33]                         
In the end, it is abundantly clear that the
trial judge disbelieved Mr. Sekhon’s explanation as to how he came to be
driving a truck, containing 50 kg of cocaine, across the border.  His reasons
are replete with observations that Mr. Sekhon’s version of events made “no
sense”, that it was “illogical”, “difficult to accept”, “difficult to
comprehend”, “incredible”, “not at all convincing”, “not credible”, “completely
unbelievable” and contained “glaring inconsistencies” (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 18,
19, 23, 24, 26 and 27).  As stated earlier, he pinpointed and discussed at
length no less than 12 problems with the evidence given by Mr. Sekhon.  He
concluded that there were “far too many coincidences in the accused’s evidence
to make his version of events plausible” (p. 27) and that “the likelihood that
all these coincidences happened within this limited time frame is so remote as
to render the accused’s evidence unbelievable.  These coincidences present as
created to fit the evidence” (p. 28).

(2)        
The Trial Judge’s View of the Crown’s Case

[34]                         
The trial judge completed his assessment of Mr.
Sekhon’s testimony as follows: 

   The net
effect of these difficulties is that I do not believe the evidence presented by
the accused, nor does it raise any reasonable doubt as to the accused’s guilt
on the two charges, and specifically his knowledge of the cocaine in the
truck’s hidden compartment. [A.R., vol. I, at p. 29]

[35]                         
The trial judge then went on to discuss the
Crown’s evidence.  He found three pieces of circumstantial evidence to be “very
significant” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 30).  First was the value of cocaine
involved.  He concluded, in accordance with Sgt. Arsenault’s testimony, that
the owners of such a significant amount of cocaine would want a trusted and
reliable individual handling the shipment, and “[w]ith that proven reliability
and trust naturally comes some knowledge” (ibid.).

[36]                         
The second significant piece of evidence also
came from Sgt. Arsenault’s testimony, as follows: 

I conclude [Sgt. Arsenault] was a fair,
unbiased witness. I accept his evidence. Included therein is his opinion that
individuals tasked with importing controlled substances in amounts of this size
would be part of a larger, closely-knit organization and they would know what
commodity they were importing, as that would be factored into the fee they had
negotiated.  Sgt. Arsenault also testified that in the thousand or more
cocaine-importing investigations he has been involved in he has never
encountered a blind courier, that being a person who does not know the nature
or existence of the commodity being moved from one location to another. 
[Emphasis added; A.R., vol. I, at pp. 30-31.]

The last sentence of this
passage references the Impugned Testimony. 

[37]                         
The third piece of evidence that the trial judge
found to be significant was the fob.  As mentioned earlier, the trial judge
made a finding of fact that the fob and the ignition key were connected by the
chain until Mr. Sekhon turned off the ignition in the secondary inspection
area.  Prior to this point, there was no opportunity and no rational reason for
separating them.  The trial judge concluded that Mr. Sekhon separated the two
in an attempt to distance the fob from the truck because he knew that the fob controlled
access to the hidden compartment.  Mr. Sekhon takes no issue with that finding.

[38]                         
In addition to these three significant pieces of
evidence, the trial judge noted other circumstantial evidence that also
supported his finding that Mr. Sekhon knew about the cocaine: the incessant
ringing of Mr. Sekhon’s cell phone at a time when others within the
organization would be wanting to know whether the drugs had crossed the border,
the writing on the envelope that Mr. Sekhon had in his possession at the time
he was arrested, Mr. Sekhon’s
excessively nervous behaviour in the customs office, the fact that Mr. Sekhon
chewed up the piece of green paper while in the detention cell, and the fact
that Mr. Sekhon told a number of lies to the customs officers.

[39]                         
In the result, Mr. Sekhon was convicted of
importing cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. 

D.          
British Columbia Court of Appeal, 2012 BCCA 512,
331 B.C.A.C. 170

[40]                         
On appeal, Mr. Sekhon took issue with Sgt.
Arsenault’s testimony.  He maintained that it was neither relevant nor
necessary and that its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value.  

[41]                         
The majority of the B.C. Court of Appeal
disagreed.  Newbury J.A., in dissent, viewed the matter differently.  While she
accepted that the bulk of Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence was properly admissible,
she found that the Impugned Testimony did not fall within this category.  In
her view, it was “purely anecdotal evidence, not amenable to cross-examination
in any real sense, from an officer who was not in a position to determine as a
matter of fact whether in all [of the approximately] 1,000 cases he had
investigated, the courier had been ‘blind’ or not” (para. 26).  Moreover, she
held that the evidence “provided no assistance to the Court as to whether the
accused had known what he was transporting”, but rather “tended to
short-circuit that inquiry” (ibid. (emphasis in original)).  She
provided strong words of caution in regards to such expert testimony:

I see little difference
between this situation and a police officer with experience in domestic
disputes being permitted to testify that in all his or her experience, no such
dispute has ever involved self-defence; or an officer experienced in
investigating murder being permitted to testify that in all the cases he or she
has investigated, the accused intended the death of his or her victim.

 

     Anecdotal
evidence of this kind is just that — anecdotal.  It does not speak to the
particular facts before the Court, but has the superficial attractiveness of seeming
to show that the probabilities are very much in the Crown’s favour, and of
coming from the mouth of an “expert”.  If it can be said to be relevant to the
case of a particular accused, it is also highly prejudicial.  [paras. 26-27]

Newbury J.A. concluded
that the Impugned Testimony “should not have been relied upon by the trial
judge in reaching his verdict” (para. 25).  She would have allowed the appeal
and ordered a new trial.

IV.       
Issues

[42]                         
At issue is whether the trial judge improperly
admitted and relied upon the Impugned Testimony.  If the trial judge so erred,
the remaining question is whether the curative proviso in s. 686(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  can be applied to sustain the convictions. 

V.          
Analysis

A.          
Requirements for Expert Opinion Evidence

[43]                         
As set out R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2
S.C.R. 9, at pp. 20-25, and affirmed in R. v. J.-L.J., 2000 SCC 51,
[2000] 2 S.C.R. 600, and R. v. D.D., 2000 SCC 43, [2000] 2 S.C.R.
275, the admission of expert evidence depends on the following criteria: (1)
relevance; (2) necessity in assisting the trier of fact; (3) the absence of any
exclusionary rule; and (4) a properly qualified expert.

[44]                         
With respect to the “relevance” criterion, Mohan
states that the judge must conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine
“whether its value is worth what it costs” (p. 21, quoting McCormick on
Evidence (3rd ed. 1984), at p. 544).  The cost-benefit analysis requires
the judge to balance the probative value of the evidence against its
prejudicial effect (Mohan, at p. 21). 

[45]                         
As for the “necessity” criterion, Mohan
holds that “[i]f on the proven facts a judge or jury can form their own
conclusions without help, then the opinion of [an] expert is unnecessary” (p.
23, quoting Lawton L.J. in R. v. Turner, [1975] 1 Q.B. 834, at p. 841). 
The Court went on to note that the concern “inherent in the application of this
criterion [is] that experts not be permitted to usurp the functions of the
trier of fact” (p. 24).

[46]                         
Given the concerns about the impact expert
evidence can have on a trial — including the possibility that experts may usurp
the role of the trier of fact — trial judges must be vigilant in monitoring and
enforcing the proper scope of expert evidence.  While these concerns are
perhaps more pronounced in jury trials, all trial judges — including those in
judge-alone trials — have an ongoing duty to ensure that expert evidence
remains within its proper scope.  It is not enough to simply consider the Mohan
criteria at the outset of the expert’s testimony and make an initial ruling as
to the admissibility of the evidence.  The trial judge must do his or her best
to ensure that, throughout the expert’s testimony, the testimony remains within
the proper boundaries of expert evidence.  As noted by Doherty J.A. in R. v.
Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624, 97 O.R. (3d) 330, at para. 62:

        The admissibility inquiry is
not conducted in a vacuum.  Before deciding admissibility, a trial judge must
determine the nature and scope of the proposed expert evidence.  In doing so,
the trial judge sets not only the boundaries of the proposed expert evidence
but also, if necessary, the language in which the expert’s opinion may be
proffered so as to minimize any potential harm to the trial process.  A
cautious delineation of the scope of the proposed expert evidence and strict
adherence to those boundaries, if the evidence is admitted, are essential. 
The case law demonstrates that overreaching by expert witnesses is probably the
most common fault leading to reversals on appeal . . . .  [Emphasis added;
citations omitted.]

[47]                         
The trial judge must both ensure that an expert
stays within the proper bounds of his or her expertise and that the content of
the evidence itself is properly the subject of expert evidence. 

[48]                         
It is foreseeable that mistakes will be made and
that, as happened in the instant case, testimony that strays beyond the proper
scope of the expert evidence will be given.  It is also foreseeable that
defence counsel may fail to object to the testimony at the time the problematic
statements are made.  In a jury trial, once the statements have been made, it
may be somewhat more difficult to address the problem — but a remedial
instruction advising the jury to disabuse their minds of the inadmissible
evidence will generally suffice.  Judges, on the other hand, are accustomed to
disabusing their minds of inadmissible evidence.  It goes without saying that
where the expert evidence strays beyond its proper scope, it is imperative that
the trial judge not assign any weight to the inadmissible parts. 

B.           
Application to This Case

[49]                         
In my view, the trial judge erred in relying
upon the Impugned Testimony.  The fact that Sgt. Arsenault did not personally
encounter a blind courier over the course of his investigations is neither
relevant nor necessary, within the meaning ascribed to those terms by this
Court in Mohan, to the issue facing the trial judge — namely, whether
Mr. Sekhon himself had knowledge of the drugs.  The Impugned Testimony, though
perhaps logically relevant, was not legally relevant because the guilt or
innocence of accused persons that Sgt. Arsenault had encountered in the past is
legally irrelevant to the guilt or innocence of Mr. Sekhon (see Mohan,
at pp. 20-21).  In other words, the Impugned Testimony was of no probative
value in determining whether Mr. Sekhon knew about the cocaine in the
hidden compartment.  It is trite to say that a fundamental tenet of our
criminal justice system is that the guilt of an accused cannot be determined by
reference to the guilt of other, unrelated accused persons.  Moreover, the
Impugned Testimony was not necessary because determining whether Mr. Sekhon
knew about the drugs is not beyond the knowledge and experience of the judge,
and it is certainly not a matter that is technical or scientific in nature. 

[50]                         
The lack of relevance or probative value is, in
my view, sufficient to justify the exclusion of the Impugned Testimony. 
However, it is worth noting the prejudicial effect that such evidence may have
on a trial.  I agree with Newbury J.A. to the extent that she found little to
no difference between the Impugned Testimony in this case and a homicide
investigator being permitted to testify that in all of the cases she or he has
worked on, the accused intended the death of his or her victim.  Nor do I see a
difference between the Impugned Testimony and a stolen goods investigator
testifying that he or she has never seen a case of innocent possession of
stolen property, or an experienced fraud investigator testifying that he or she
has never seen a case where a senior manager was not aware of fraudulent
conduct occurring within the company (A.F., at para. 60).  The inherent danger
of admitting such evidence is obvious — as Newbury J.A. pointed out:

         Anecdotal evidence of this kind
is just that — anecdotal.  It does not speak to the particular facts before the
Court, but has the superficial attractiveness of seeming to show that the
probabilities are very much in the Crown’s favour, and of coming from the mouth
of an “expert”.  If it can be said to be relevant to the case of a particular
accused, it is also highly prejudicial.  [para. 27]

This type of anecdotal
evidence would appear to require the accused to somehow prove that, regardless
of a particular expert’s past experience, the accused’s situation is
different.  Such a result is contrary to another fundamental tenet of our
criminal justice system — that it is the Crown that bears the burden of
proving the mens rea of an offence beyond a reasonable doubt.  As the
appellant points out, “such evidence would logically trigger a defence need to
call evidence to refute such opinions, such as a retired investigator who did
experience an innocent person in similar circumstances, or a witness who could
testify that he or she was in the same circumstances of the accused and was
innocent” (A.F., at para. 61).  At that point, the trial would become a battle
of experts — and a completely irrelevant battle at that. 

[51]                         
For these reasons, I conclude that the Impugned
Testimony was inadmissible. 

C.           
The Curative Proviso Is Appropriate in These
Circumstances

[52]                         
Section 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code , known as the curative proviso, states:

   686. (1)  On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction or against a
verdict . . . the court of appeal

 

   (a)  may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that

. . .

 

(ii)
the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong
decision on a question of law, or

. . .

 

   (b)  may dismiss the appeal where

. . .

 

(iii)
notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned
in subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided in favour of the
appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has occurred; . . .

[53]                         
As this Court has repeatedly asserted, the
curative proviso can only be applied where there is no “reasonable possibility
that the verdict would have been different had the error . . . not been made” (R.
v. Bevan, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599, at p. 617, aff’d in R. v. Khan, 2001
SCC 86, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823, at para. 28).  Flowing from this principle, this
Court affirmed in Khan that there are two situations where the use of
s. 686(1) (b)(iii) is appropriate: (1) where the error is harmless
or trivial; or (2) where the evidence is so overwhelming that, notwithstanding
that the error is not minor, the trier of fact would inevitably convict (paras.
29-31).

[54]                         
In my view, this case falls squarely within the
latter category.  As the trial judge ably demonstrated, Mr. Sekhon’s evidence
is a contrivance from beginning to end and need not be considered.  With his
evidence off the table, had the Impugned Testimony been excluded, the remaining
admissible evidence pointing towards Mr. Sekhon’s guilt is overwhelming.  I
have reviewed this evidence earlier and need not repeat it.  Suffice it to say
that the circumstantial evidence bearing on Mr. Sekhon’s knowledge can lead to
only one rational conclusion — that Mr. Sekhon was aware of the cocaine
secreted in the truck. 

[55]                         
The fob evidence on its own was devastating.  As
noted earlier, Mr. Sekhon himself testified that when he was given the fob, it
was attached to the ignition key.  As the trial judge noted, correctly in my
view, “[t]he only logical conclusion to be drawn from [Mr. Sekhon’s deliberate
act of separating the fob from the keys] is that the accused did this to
distance the fob from the truck because he knew that the fob controlled access
to the hidden compartment which he would not want discovered” (A.R., vol. I, at
p. 31).  Standing alone, that finding was all but conclusive of Mr. Sekhon’s
guilt.

[56]                         
But of course, it does not stand alone.  It is
part of a web of circumstantial evidence enveloping Mr. Sekhon from which he
cannot escape.  In this regard, it is important to note that when considering
the second branch of the proviso in the context of a circumstantial case, it is
necessary to look at the whole of the admissible evidence in assessing the
strength of the case.  It is not the task of an appellate court to parse each
item of evidence in search of a possible innocent explanation.  If that were
so, it would be virtually impossible to ever satisfy the second branch of the
proviso in a circumstantial case. 

[57]                         
In conclusion, the thoughts expressed by Binnie
J. in R. v. Jolivet, 2000 SCC 29, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 751, at para. 46, and
restated in R. v. Sarrazin, 2011 SCC 54, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 505, at para.
24, are in my view, apposite to the case at hand:

Ordering a new trial raises significant
issues for the administration of justice and the proper allocation of resources. 
Where the evidence against an accused is powerful and there is no realistic
possibility that a new trial would produce a different verdict, it is
manifestly in the public interest to avoid the cost and delay of further
proceedings.  Parliament has so provided.  

VI.       
Disposition

[58]                         
For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal. 

                    The reasons of McLachlin C.J.
and LeBel J. were delivered by

                    LeBel J.  (dissenting) — 

I.             
Overview

[59]                         
Ajitpal Singh Sekhon appeals from convictions
for unlawfully importing cocaine into Canada and unlawfully possessing cocaine
for the purpose of trafficking. The appellant was stopped at a border crossing
between the United States and Canada, and the vehicle he was driving had a
hidden compartment in which 50 kg of cocaine was found. The sole issue at trial
was whether the appellant knew the cocaine was there. The appellant’s defence
was that he had been asked to drive the vehicle over the border for an
acquaintance and had not known about the cocaine. 

[60]                         
To rebut this defence, the Crown called an
experienced RCMP investigator to give expert evidence on the customs of the
drug trade. In his evidence, this officer stated that he had never encountered
a case involving a “blind courier”, that is, a person who transported cocaine
without knowing what it was, or that it existed (A.R., vol. III, at p. 144).

[61]                         
I agree with my colleague Moldaver J. that the
Crown’s expert witness should not have been permitted to give opinion evidence
concerning the guilt of other individuals he had investigated for drug
importation. And the trial judge should not have relied on the comments in
question in assessing the Crown’s case against the appellant. Given the nature
and the impact of these errors, I do not agree that this is an appropriate case
for applying the curative proviso: Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C-46 , s. 686(1) (b)(iii). The Crown’s case against the
appellant was circumstantial, the errors of law were very serious, and I do not
believe the evidence would inevitably have resulted in a verdict of guilt
despite these errors. I would order a new trial.

II.          
Background Facts

[62]                         
On January 25, 2005, the appellant drove a
pickup truck to the Aldergrove border crossing between British Columbia and
Washington State. A search of the truck by customs officers uncovered 50 kg of
cocaine hidden in a concealed compartment beneath the truck bed.

[63]                         
The appellant testified at trial that he had
driven to Washington earlier that day with his nephew Mike Grewal. Mr. Grewal
had to return to Canada, but the appellant stayed behind in Washington and met
with a school acquaintance from British Columbia named Chris. Chris told the
appellant he had left his truck in Washington the previous evening because he
was too drunk to drive it home and that he had now driven back to Washington to
retrieve it. According to the appellant, Chris asked him to drive the truck
back to Canada but did not tell him that there were drugs in it. Mr. Grewal
also testified and he corroborated the appellant’s evidence up to the point of
his own return to Canada.

[64]                         
The Crown called an RCMP officer,
Sgt. Vincent Joseph Arsenault. Sgt. Arsenault was qualified, with the
consent of defence counsel, as an expert on the importation of cocaine into the
Lower Mainland of British Columbia by vehicle and on foot, and on the
trafficking and possession of cocaine in that part of British Columbia,
including distribution routes, chain of distribution, means of transportation,
methods of concealment, packaging, values, cost and profit margins, usage
patterns and rates of consumption.

[65]                         
Sgt. Arsenault expressed the opinion that
individuals who imported controlled substances would be part of a close-knit
criminal organization and that they would negotiate a fee based on the volume
of drugs being transported. He stated that he had participated in over 1,000
investigations into cocaine importing and that none of them had involved a
“blind courier”.

[66]                         
The appellant was convicted. His appeal was
dismissed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal, with Newbury J.A.
dissenting. He appeals to this Court as of right.

III.       
Judgments

A.          
Provincial Court

[67]                         
The only issue at trial was whether the
appellant knew the cocaine was in the truck. Judge Dohm rejected the
appellant’s evidence and held that it did not raise a reasonable doubt.

[68]                         
The Crown’s case was circumstantial. After
finding that the appellant was not credible, Judge Dohm turned to the Crown’s
case, highlighting three key pieces of evidence: (i) the amount of cocaine
involved, which suggested that a known and trusted courier would have been
used; (ii) Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence that an individual trusted with large
amounts of cocaine would be part of a closely knit organization, that his or her
fee would be negotiated on the basis of the amount being transported, and that
in over 1,000 cases, he had never encountered a “blind courier”; and (iii) the
appellant’s possession of an electronic key fob that he must have detached from
the ignition key before handing the key to the customs officer, which suggested
that he knew the fob controlled access to the hidden compartment and did not
want the compartment to be discovered. The judge also found support for his
conclusions in some other pieces of evidence, including the fact that the
appellant’s cell phone rang at the time of his arrest, certain information
written on an envelope and his nervous behaviour in the customs office (A.R.,
vol. I, at pp. 31-32). Judge Dohm accordingly found the accused guilty.

B.           
Court of Appeal, 2012 BCCA 512, 331 B.C.A.C. 170

[69]                         
Lowry J.A., with Finch C.J.B.C. concurring,
dismissed the appeal. Lowry J.A. noted that Sgt. Arsenault had many years’
experience in the investigation of drug trafficking and had participated in
some 1,000 cocaine importing cases. He was qualified as an expert, and his
status as such had not been challenged.

[70]                         
On the admissibility of Sgt. Arsenault’s
evidence and the weight it should be given, Lowry J.A. noted that defence
counsel had not objected to it at trial. The evidence was necessary and
relevant to the issue of mens rea, and the trial judge’s reliance on it
was well reasoned and was not inconsistent with the purpose for which it had
been adduced without objection.

[71]                         
The appellant had also challenged Judge Dohm’s
reliance on the evidence with respect to the key fob, arguing that the judge
had placed too much weight on it and had engaged in speculative reasoning.
Lowry J.A. found no error in the trial judge’s reliance on this evidence. The
issue is not raised in this Court.

[72]                         
Newbury J.A., dissenting, found that Sgt.
Arsenault’s evidence should have been excluded. She noted that defence counsel
had conceded that Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence met the criteria laid down in R.
v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9, but had also stated that such evidence can
tend to become anecdotal and to stray into inference drawing. Newbury J.A.
concluded that the officer’s evidence that blind couriers are not used was
objectionable and should have been excluded or, at least, not relied on by the
trial judge in reaching his verdict. She stated that this was not “custom of the
trade” evidence, but was purely anecdotal and not amenable to cross-examination
in any meaningful sense (para. 26). Further, she noted that it “tended to
short-circuit” the mens rea inquiry and essentially allowed the Crown to
have its theory of the case come from the mouth of an expert witness (ibid.).

IV.       
Issues

A.          
Legitimate Scope of a Police Officer’s Expert
Evidence on the Drug Trade

[73]                         
In argument before us, the appellant did not
challenge the use of a police officer’s expert evidence as such. A substantial
body of case law supports the admission of evidence from experienced police
officers on such subjects as the organization of the illegal drug trade,
methods of transporting and selling drugs, methods for avoiding the detection
of drugs, and drug jargon: R. v. Joyal (1990), 55 C.C.C. (3d) 233 (Que.
C.A.); R. v. Ballony-Reeder, 2001 BCCA 293, 88 B.C.L.R. (3d) 237; R.
v. Klassen, 2003 MBQB 253, 179 Man. R. (2d) 115.

[74]                         
Although the admissibility of expert evidence
must be assessed by the trial judge on a case-by-case basis, I am satisfied
that Judge Dohm made no error in principle in finding that the expert evidence
of experienced drug investigators is capable of satisfying the criteria —
relevance, necessity, absence of any exclusionary rule, and a properly
qualified expert — identified in Mohan. The customs of the illegal drug
trade will generally be relevant to the matters at issue in drug trials. Such
customs are likely to be outside the knowledge of the trier of fact, so
evidence about them will be necessary to assist him or her in assessing the
other evidence that has been adduced. Moreover, it is open to a trial judge to
conclude that a police officer is qualified to give expert evidence on the
basis of the officer’s experience and training in the investigation of
drug-related crimes.

[75]                         
At the same time, this Court has repeatedly
cautioned that expert evidence must not be allowed to usurp the role of the
trier of fact. The trier of fact, whether a judge or a jury, is responsible for
deciding the questions in issue at trial. Judges must be especially cautious
where the testimony of police expert witnesses is concerned, as such evidence
could amount to nothing more than the Crown’s theory of the case cloaked with
an aura of expertise. The courts have clearly recognized the risk that expert
evidence could usurp the role of the trier of fact in the assessment of
credibility, and even in the decision on the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.
I see no reason to believe that this danger is less real where the evidence is
given by a state agent like a police officer rather than by a scientific
expert.

[76]                         
The Mohan requirement of necessity is the
primary safeguard against the inappropriate proliferation of expert evidence.
But even where the expert’s evidence is broadly necessary, as in this case, it
should be assessed with special scrutiny as it approaches the “ultimate
issue”: Mohan, at p. 24; R. v. J.-L.J., 2000 SCC 51, [2000] 2
S.C.R. 600, at para. 37. The decision to qualify an expert witness does not end
the need for scrutiny of the expert’s evidence. A properly qualified expert
could stray into expressing inadmissible opinions about the guilt of an
accused, and the trial judge must ensure that the expert’s testimony stays
within the proper boundaries of such evidence and maintain the integrity and
independence of his or her own fact-finding function as regards the credibility
of witnesses and the guilt or innocence of the accused.

B.           
Application of These Principles to Sgt.
Arsenault’s Evidence

[77]                         
Sgt. Arsenault was qualified as an expert,
without being challenged, on the basis of his extensive experience and
training, and most of his evidence was unobjectionable. He described the
general background of cocaine importation schemes, including manufacturing
sources and distribution chains, the primary importation routes, and points of
entry into British Columbia from the United States. He noted that importers
commonly use off-road, four-wheel-drive vehicles to transport cocaine over land
and that the cocaine is usually packaged in one-kilogram bricks when brought
into Canada. He also explained typical methods of concealment, including the
use of sophisticated hidden compartments. He described common methods of
payment for cocaine shipments, the reasons why drug couriers are used, and
common practices in their recruitment. He talked about the instructions that
would typically be given to a drug courier, including the development of cover
stories, and stated that the courier’s fee is typically negotiated with
reference to the nature and size of the shipment. Sgt. Arsenault described the
risks associated with cross-border transportation of cocaine, and in particular
the risk of losing a shipment either because it is detected by the authorities
or because it is stolen by a rival group. The appellant’s trial counsel did not
object to any of this evidence, and it was not challenged on appeal.

[78]                         
At issue in this appeal is the following
exchange between Crown counsel and Sgt. Arsenault (A.R., vol. III, at p. 144):

Q  Officer, you described earlier that you’ve been involved in
approximately 1,000 investigations involving the importation of cocaine over
your 33-year career?

 

A  That is correct, Your
Honour, yes.

 

Q  In approximately how many of those investigations were you able
to determine that the person importing the cocaine did not know about the
commodity that they were importing?

 

A  I have never encountered
it, personally.

 

Q  Have you ever heard of a -- the use of a blind courier or a
courier who doesn’t know about the commodity that he is driving?

 

A  I -- I’ve certainly heard that argument being raised on -- on
occasion, primarily in court, not during my investigations.

[79]                         
In my view, Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence that he
had never, in over 1,000 investigations, personally encountered a blind courier
and that he had never heard of one outside of a courtroom strayed from what
would be admissible expert evidence. This testimony was equivalent to a
statement that individuals in the appellant’s position always know about the
drugs. It is a short step from such evidence to an inference that the appellant
must have known about the cocaine. Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence effectively
amounted to an opinion that the accused possessed the requisite mens rea
for the offence with which he was charged, which was the ultimate issue in this
trial. Whether it was admissible therefore requires special scrutiny.

[80]                         
Applying the Mohan criteria, I conclude
that this line of questioning should not have been permitted. The evidence was
not necessary, as it was open to the trier of fact to draw the necessary
inference concerning what the appellant knew or did not know. Nor was it
relevant. Sgt. Arsenault’s opinion invited the trier of fact to find that
the appellant knew about the cocaine on the basis that all people driving
vehicles containing hidden drugs know about the drugs. This appeared relevant
only because it depended on an improper inference. Sgt. Arsenault’s opinion
that other individuals he has encountered in his investigations knew they were
transporting illegal drugs does not logically establish that this accused
possessed the mens rea for the offences with which he was charged. In
addition to usurping the court’s role in resolving the issue of guilt or
innocence, the opinion depended on an unacceptable and unfair inference. 

C.           
Should the Curative Proviso Be Applied?

[81]                         
Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence concerning his lack of
personal experience with blind couriers should not have been admitted.
Regardless of the fact that counsel did not object to the questions, the trial
judge erred in law in admitting this evidence. He compounded this error by
expressly relying on it in convicting the appellant. He wrote this in his
reasons: 

Sgt. Arsenault also testified that in
the thousand or more cocaine-importing investigations he has been involved in
he has never encountered a blind courier, that being a person who does not know
the nature or existence of the commodity being moved from one location to
another. [A.R., vol. I, at pp. 30-31]

[82]                         
All that remains is to determine whether the
error occasioned a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, or whether
s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , known as the
curative proviso, should be applied to affirm the appellant’s convictions:

686.
(1) On the hearing of an appeal against a
conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand trial or
not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of appeal 

 

. . .

 

(b)
may dismiss the appeal where 

 

. . .

 

(iii)
notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned
in subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided in favour of the
appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
has occurred, . . . 

[83]                         
I respectfully disagree with my colleague’s
position. This is not an appropriate case for application of the proviso.

[84]                         
The proviso applies in two situations. The first
is where the error is so minor or harmless that it could not have had a serious
impact on the verdict. The second is where, although a serious error has been
made, the evidence is nevertheless so overwhelming that no other verdict would
have been possible (R. v. Sarrazin, 2011 SCC 54, [2011] 3 S.C.R.
505, at para. 25; R. v. Van, 2009 SCC 22, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 716, at
para. 34).

[85]                         
In the instant case, the Crown rightly concedes
that the error was not a harmless or minor one that would have no impact on the
verdict. The admission of improper evidence in this case cannot be considered
“an error that is harmless on its face or in its effect” (Van, at para.
35). Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence was a key piece of the Crown’s case, and his
statement that he had never encountered a blind courier was specifically relied
on by the trial judge in convicting the appellant (A.R., vol. I, at
pp. 30-31). The evidence of experts, like that of all witnesses, often
contains comments or observations that are inconsistent with the rules of
evidence. In this case, however, the impugned observations were not unprompted
or unanticipated. Crown counsel clearly directed Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence
toward this prejudicial and inadmissible topic. This could not have helped but
increase its impact, as the trial judge’s reasons show.

[86]                         
If the curative proviso is to be applied,
therefore, it can only be on the basis that “the case against the accused was
so overwhelming that a reasonable and properly instructed jury would inevitably
have convicted” (Van, at para. 36; see also P.
Béliveau and M. Vauclair, Traité général de preuve et de procédure
pénales (20th ed. 2013), at pp. 1294‑95; Sarrazin, at
para. 25). Where this criterion is met, denying the
accused the benefit of a retrial will be justified, because there is no
realistic possibility of any result other than conviction. The standard of this
branch of the test is a high one, as Deschamps J. explained in R. v. Trochym,
2007 SCC 6, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 239, at para. 82:

This standard should not be equated
with the ordinary standard in a criminal trial of proof beyond a reasonable
doubt. The application of the proviso to serious errors reflects a higher
standard appropriate to appellate review. The standard applied by an appellate
court, namely that the evidence against an accused is so overwhelming that
conviction is inevitable or would invariably result, is a substantially higher
one than the requirement that the Crown prove its case “beyond a reasonable
doubt” at trial. This higher standard reflects the fact that it is difficult
for an appellate court, in particular when considering a jury trial, since no
detailed findings of fact will have been made, to consider retroactively the
effect that, for example, excluding certain evidence could reasonably have had
on the outcome.

[87]                         
The Court has constantly refused to lower this
standard, even upon being invited to do so, as it was in Sarrazin. In
that case, it strongly reaffirmed the need to safeguard the integrity of the
criminal justice system (paras. 25-26). The language of the curative proviso
reflects Parliament’s concern to prevent the risk of a substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice. The high standard the Court has set reflects this
purpose.

[88]                         
The error in Trochym occurred in the
context of a jury trial, but even in a case involving a trial by judge alone,
an appellate court must acknowledge that it is difficult to speculate on what
effect exclusion of the evidence might have had on the judge’s findings of
fact. This is especially true in cases such as the one at bar in which the
evidence is circumstantial.   

[89]                         
I cannot say with certainty that the result in
this case would have been the same without Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence. Judge
Dohm rejected the appellant’s evidence in its entirety and found that it did
not raise a reasonable doubt. His reasons accordingly focused on whether the
Crown’s evidence was sufficient to prove the appellant’s guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt. This Court must do the same, applying the higher standard of
an inevitable verdict.

[90]                         
The trial judge in this case gave
well-articulated reasons. They underline the importance he attributed to Sgt.
Arsenault’s testimony. He referred to three “very significant pieces of
evidence” in his decision to convict the appellant (A.R., vol. I, at p. 30).
The first of these was the amount of cocaine involved. He found it unlikely
that the owners of the cocaine would have taken the risk of using a blind
courier to transport it into Canada. The second was Sgt. Arsenault’s evidence,
and in particular his testimony that he had never encountered a blind courier
in over 1,000 investigations involving cocaine importing (pp. 30-31). The third
key piece of evidence in the Crown’s case related to the appellant’s possession
of the key fob.

[91]                         
I have already concluded that the trial judge
erred in making use of the second of these pieces of evidence. As to the first
one, although the value of the cocaine might support an inference that the
drugs would not have been entrusted to a stranger, that is not the only
conclusion that could be drawn from it.

[92]                         
Turning to the third piece of evidence, when the
appellant was detained, he was in possession of the key fob. This fob was
identified at trial as a remote control for a “Clifford” alarm system installed
on the truck. According to the evidence of Det. Shawn Robson, it could be used
to lock and unlock the vehicle’s doors, and to arm and disarm the alarm system
(A.R., vol. III, at p. 122). If the buttons on the fob were pressed in a
specific sequence, the compartment between the bed and the frame of the truck
in which the cocaine was found would open.

[93]                         
When the appellant was initially detained, he
handed the ignition key over to the customs officers. He produced the fob only
when subsequently asked to empty his pockets. At that time, he immediately
admitted that it was for the truck. The trial judge found that the fob and the
ignition key “obviously go together” and that they had been attached by a chain
until the appellant detached them when he turned off the ignition in the
secondary inspection area (A.R., vol. I, at p. 31). He concluded that the
appellant detached the key from the fob at that time in an attempt to hide the
fob or conceal its connection with the truck, because he knew the fob opened
the compartment.

[94]                         
In the Court of Appeal, the appellant challenged
the trial judge’s use of the evidence about the fob, arguing that the judge had
placed too much weight on it and had engaged in speculative reasoning with
respect to it. The Court of Appeal dismissed this argument, and the point was
not raised in this Court. Moldaver J. finds that this inference was open to the
trial judge and that it was essentially conclusive of guilt (para. 55).

[95]                         
In my view, however, the issue in applying the
curative proviso is not whether the trial judge could make the inference he did
or whether that inference was determinative of guilt, but whether it was the
only rational conclusion. I agree that the trial judge did not err in using
this evidence as he did, but this was not the only conclusion supported by the
evidence with respect to the fob. The appellant testified that the key and the
fob had been attached when he received them from Chris, and the trial judge
found that he had detached the key from the fob moments before handing the key
over to the secondary inspection officer. But it does not inevitably follow
that the judge’s finding of guilt depended primarily on these additional
inferences as to when and how the fob came to be detached from the key. There
was no evidence on these points, and the trial judge could just as well have
drawn no inference from the fact that the appellant had not produced the fob
immediately. Moreover, it is simply not possible for an appellate court to say
that the judge’s assessment of this evidence was not affected by his reliance
on the inadmissible evidence that blind couriers are never used. I cannot
accept that the conclusion drawn by the trial judge was inevitable or that this
evidence was therefore determinative of the appellant’s guilt.

[96]                         
There was of course other evidence capable of
supporting a verdict of guilt, including a chewed-up piece of paper, the
envelope mentioned above and the appellant’s ringing cell phone. As with the
key fob, although the trial judge was entitled to draw the inferences he did
from each of these pieces of evidence, each such inference undeniably involved
some speculation. There was no evidence concerning the identity of the person
who called the appellant’s cell phone, nor was there evidence with respect to
the meaning of the information written on the envelope. Again, this evidence
was capable of supporting a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but in
my view it would not inevitably lead to such a finding.

[97]                         
At the same time, there was also evidence
favourable to the accused. For instance, he was not the registered owner of the
truck and there was no evidence that he had ever previously been in possession
of the truck. Furthermore, Sgt. Arsenault testified that drug couriers
typically do not have criminal records, but the appellant did in fact have a
prior conviction for dangerous driving.

[98]                         
I agree that ordering a new trial places demands
on judicial resources, but, with respect, this cannot override the appellant’s
right to a fair trial based solely on admissible evidence. The trial judge
relied expressly on inadmissible evidence, and I cannot untangle his other
inferences unfavourable to the appellant from his acceptance of that evidence,
as he attached great importance to it. As we have seen, this was a serious
error. If this Court excludes evidence described by the trial judge as one of
the foundations of his conclusion that the appellant was guilty, it cannot then
hold that the evidence against the appellant was nonetheless overwhelming without
engaging in pure speculation. Such a conclusion would contradict what the trial
judge himself wrote and would rest on an improper reweighing of the remaining
evidence. With respect, the curative proviso does not permit this Court to deny
a retrial in such circumstances.

V.          
Conclusion

[99]                         
For these reasons, I cannot agree that no
substantial injustice would result from affirming the convictions. I would
accordingly allow the appeal and order a new trial.

                    English version of the judgment of
the Court delivered orally by

[1]               The
Chief Justice — We all agree, essentially for the reasons given by Doyon
J.A. of the Quebec Court of Appeal, that this appeal should be dismissed. 
However, we would also like to stress the extraordinary and unique nature of
the circumstances faced by Brunton J. of the Superior Court as a result of the
proceedings brought against the accused by the Crown. 

[2]               The cumulative effects of those
circumstances justified Brunton J.’s significant intervention in matters
usually left to the discretion of the prosecution, namely the selection of the
charges and the prioritization of the order in which they would proceed.  The
direct indictment before the judge at first instance set out 29 counts
involving more than 150 accused.  It also contained a number of counts that
could not lawfully be included in it.  This direct indictment, as preferred by
the Crown, did not lend itself to a trial, and it gave rise to serious
challenges with respect to disclosure of the evidence to the accused. 
Furthermore, the prosecution did not have a realistic plan for taking those
charges to trial and conducting the trial within a reasonable time. 

[3]               As
Doyon J.A. mentioned at paragraph 60 of his reasons, Brunton J. had observed
that [translation] “the
prosecution had been making things up as it went along and had shown a flagrant
lack of preparation, analysis and foresight in managing the case” (2013 QCCA
671, [2013] R.J.Q. 608).  The unique nature of these extraordinary
circumstances satisfies us that the approach taken by the trial judge was the right
one in this case.  In light of these circumstances, and of the ones referred to
by Brunton J. in his reasons and by the majority of the Court of Appeal in
theirs, we agree with the latter that Brunton J. did not err in exercising his
discretion in this case.  He exercised it to protect the rights of the accused
guaranteed by the Charter , and to further the public’s interest in
avoiding the total collapse of the prosecution that could have been caused by
unreasonable delays.

                    Judgment
accordingly.

on appeal from the court of appeal
for british columbia

                    Criminal law — Offences — Sexual assault — Evidence
— Consent — Accused stating to police that complainant consented to sexual
relations — Statement not admitted into evidence and accused maintaining that
he had virtually no recollection of events — Accused acquitted but new trial

police statement not forming part of record and should have taken into account
other circumstantial evidence.

                    APPEAL
from a judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal (Ryan, Smith and
Hinkson JJ.A.), 2013 BCCA 159, 336 B.C.A.C. 207, 574 W.A.C. 207, 297 C.C.C.
(3d) 106, [2013] B.C.J. No. 677 (QL), 2013 CarswellBC 856, setting aside the

B.C.J. No. 879 (QL), 2011 CarswellBC 1129, and ordering a new trial.  Appeal
dismissed.

                    Christopher Darnay and Michelle
Poulsen, for
the appellant.

                    Margaret A. Mereigh, for the respondent.

                    The judgment
of the Court was delivered orally by

[1]               Moldaver J. — We agree with the majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal
that there must be a new trial in this matter. 

[2]               In
assessing the crucial issue of consent, the trial judge found that the
complainant was suffering from some sort of memory loss at the time the
appellant claims that “she gave him her consent for sexual relations”
(2011 BCSC 612, 86 C.R. (6th) 107, at para. 45).

[3]               With
respect, the appellant gave no such evidence of consent.  Only in his statement
to the police did he claim that the complainant consented.  But that statement
was not admitted into evidence and formed no part of the record.  At trial, the
appellant maintained that he had virtually no recollection of the events on
that evening due to alcohol and drug consumption.  He did not testify that the
complainant consented to sexual relations. 

[4]               In
our view, the trial judge’s reliance on evidence that did not form part of the
record may have coloured his thinking on the issue of consent, particularly in
assessing whether the complainant may have consented to sexual relations but
forgot that she had done so due to memory blackout, or, as she claimed, that
she was unconscious at all material times and never consented to sexual
relations.

[5]               In
addition to this error, in assessing the issue of consent, the trial judge
failed to take into account the several occasions throughout the evening when
the complainant made it known to the appellant that she was not interested in
having sexual relations with him.  Her evidence in this regard was confirmed in
part by an independent witness found by the trial judge to be credible. 
Similarly, the trial judge failed to consider the complainant’s distraught
condition a short time after the event when she reported the alleged sexual
assault to the police.

[6]               For
these reasons, we agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that a new
trial must be ordered.  Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeal.

                    Judgment accordingly.

                    The judgment
of the Court was delivered orally by 

[1]               LeBel J. —
The Crown has conceded and we agree with the Alberta Court of Appeal that the
trial judge made an error in allocating the burden of proof. But we agree with
Fraser C.J., in dissent, that this error may have tainted the evaluation of the
evidence as to whether excessive force had been used by a police officer. In
the circumstances of this case, the proviso of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , could not apply. For these
reasons, the appeal is allowed and the appellant’s conviction is quashed. As
the parties have requested in such an event, a new trial is ordered on the same
charges.

on appeal from the court of appeal for nova scotia

                    Constitutional
law — Charter of Rights  — Search and seizure — Police responding to noise
complaint at accused’s residence — Accused answering door while concealing
loaded restricted firearm — Police pushing door open further to ascertain
concealment — Whether officer’s conduct constituted search and if so, whether
search reasonable — Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , s. 8 .

                    Criminal
law — Offences — Elements of offence — Mens rea — Possession of loaded
restricted firearm — Police responding to noise complaint at accused’s
residence — Accused answering door while concealing loaded restricted firearm —
Accused’s licence to possess firearm in Alberta not extending to Nova Scotia,
but accused believing it did — Whether Crown
required to prove accused knew or was wilfully blind to fact that possession of
firearm was unauthorized — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C‑46 , s. 95 .

                    Police
responded to a noise complaint at M’s home in Halifax.  When M opened the door,
an officer observed that M had an object in his hand, hidden behind his leg.  The officer twice asked M what was in his hand.  Because M did not
answer, the officer pushed the door open a few inches further to see.  A struggle ensued and M was disarmed of a loaded handgun.  M was
licensed to possess and transport the handgun in Alberta, but not in Nova
Scotia as he believed he was.  At trial, the judge concluded that M’s
possession of the gun was unauthorized.  He also concluded that the officer’s
pushing the door open further did not breach M’s s. 8  Charter  right
to be free from unreasonable search.  The trial judge convicted M of careless
handling of a firearm (under s. 86  of the Criminal Code ),
possessing a weapon for a dangerous purpose (s. 88 ), and possessing a
loaded restricted firearm (s. 95 ).  The trial judge sentenced M to a three‑year
imprisonment and a ten‑year weapons prohibition.  A majority of the Court
of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s decision that the officer did not breach M’s
s. 8  Charter  right.  It upheld M’s ss. 86  and 88  Criminal
Code  convictions, but significantly reduced the sentences.  However, the
Court of Appeal allowed M’s appeal of his s. 95  conviction and substituted
an acquittal. 

                    Held:  The appeal of the s. 8  Charter  issue should be
dismissed and the Crown’s appeal of the s. 95  Criminal Code  acquittal
should be allowed.  The matter is remitted to the Court of Appeal for
sentencing.

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Fish and Abella JJ.:  The officer’s action
of pushing the door open further constituted a “search” for purposes of s. 8 
of the Charter .  The action went beyond the implied licence to knock on
the door and constituted an invasion of M’s reasonable expectation of privacy
in his home.  Although the officer’s action constituted a search for s. 8 
purposes, that search was reasonable because both stages of the Waterfield
test were satisfied.  The first stage was satisfied because the warrantless search
falls within the scope of the common law police duty to protect life and safety
and the second, because the search constitutes a justifiable exercise of powers
associated with the duty. 

                    To
determine whether a safety search is reasonably necessary, and therefore
justifiable, a number of factors must be weighed to balance the police duty
against the liberty interest in question.  These factors include: the
importance of the duty to the public good; the necessity of the infringement
for the performance of the duty; and the extent of the infringement.  The duty
to protect life and safety is of the utmost importance to the public good, but
an infringement on individual liberty may be necessary when, for example, the
officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the individual is armed and
dangerous.  That infringement will be justified only to the extent that it is
necessary for the officer to search for weapons.  In
other words, and as this Court recognized in R. v. Mann, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59, the powers of the police are limited.  Courts must consider not
only the extent of the infringement, but how it was carried out.  Restraints on
safety searches are particularly important in homes, where such searches can
often give the police access to a considerable amount of very sensitive
personal information. 

                    In
this case, the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that there was an
imminent threat to public and police safety and that the search was necessary
to eliminate that threat.  The manner in which he carried out the search was
also reasonable.  The trial judge found that the officer pushed the door open no
more than was necessary to find out what M had behind his leg.  The officer
twice asked M what he had in his hand but received no answer.  In these
circumstances, it is hard to imagine a less invasive way of determining whether
M was concealing a weapon and thereby eliminating any threat.  It follows that
M’s rights under s. 8  of the Charter  were not violated.  

                    As
for a s. 95  Criminal Code  conviction, the Court of Appeal erred in requiring
the Crown to prove that M knew that his possession and acquisition licence and
authorization to transport the firearm did not extend to his Halifax home.  That
requirement is inconsistent with the rule, codified in s. 19 of the Code,
that ignorance of the law is no excuse.  Section 95  is a mens rea
offence, but does not include knowledge of unauthorized possession.  Rather,
knowledge of possession, together with intention to possess in a particular
place, is enough. 

                    In
this case, M’s subjective belief that he could possess the firearm in his
Halifax home is a mistake of law and that mistake is no defence.  Therefore, M’s
s. 95  conviction must be restored and the matter remitted to the Court of
Appeal both for sentencing and for assessing the constitutional validity of the
mandatory minimum sentence under s. 95 . 

                    Per Rothstein, Moldaver and Wagner JJ.:
 The majority concludes that the officer’s conduct in this case was only
justified because he had reasonable grounds to believe that M was armed and
dangerous.  In doing so, they effectively overturn the “safety search” power
recognized in Mann and a decade of subsequent jurisprudence.  

                    This Court decided in Mann that officers may conduct
protective searches when they have reasonable grounds to suspect that an
individual is armed and dangerous.  And that is why the search was justified in
this case.  Five reasons support this conclusion. 

                    First,
the language of Mann makes clear that it recognized a protective search
power predicated on reasonable suspicion.  Second, Mann relies on the
U.S. Supreme Court’s seminal decision in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1
(1968), a decision which recognized a directly analogous protective search
power on a reasonable suspicion standard.  Third, subsequent judgments from
this Court and courts of appeal have affirmed that Mann employed the reasonable
suspicion standard.  Fourth, the logical consequences of a reasonable grounds
to believe standard make little sense in this context; if Mann required
reasonable grounds to believe for a pat‑down search, it would seem that
all that Mann achieves is a power to search when there are
already grounds to arrest.  Fifth, the facts of this case do not support
a finding that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that M was armed
and dangerous.

                    These
five reasons — the language of Mann, the history from which Mann
emerged, the consequences of interpreting Mann as requiring reasonable
grounds to believe, the jurisprudence that has interpreted Mann, and the
facts of this case — all lead to the same unavoidable conclusion: Mann
recognized a protective search power predicated on reasonable suspicion. 

                    This
case ought to have been resolved by extending the logic of Mann.  First,
the officer, while lawfully engaged in his duties, had a reasonable suspicion
that M was armed and dangerous.  Second, in response to that reasonable
suspicion, the officer’s conduct — pushing M’s door open a few more inches —
was no more intrusive of M’s privacy interests than was reasonably necessary to
address the threat.  Accordingly, the search was reasonable for s. 8 
purposes.

                    The
consequence of the majority’s decision is to deprive officers of the ability to conduct protective searches except in circumstances where they already have grounds to
arrest.  As of today, officers are empowered to detain individuals they suspect
are armed and dangerous for investigatory purposes, but they have no power
to conduct pat‑down searches to ensure their safety or the safety of the
public as they conduct these investigations.  However, a police officer in the
field, faced with a realistic risk of imminent harm, should be able to act
immediately and take reasonable steps, in the form of a minimally intrusive
safety search, to alleviate the risk.

I.    Introduction

[1]                             
This case requires us to consider the scope of
police search powers in the context of everyday interactions with private
citizens at the doorsteps of their homes.  The police in this case responded to
a noise complaint and, without warning, became engaged in a dangerous situation
that, in their opinion, put their safety, and the safety of others, in
jeopardy.  The charges laid as a result of this incident afford us an
opportunity to consider the operation of s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  in this context, the mens rea required for
conviction under s. 95(1)  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 ,
and some corollary issues related to sentencing.

II.  Background Facts

[2]                             
In 2009, Mr. MacDonald was employed in the oil
and gas industry.  His employment required him to spend time in both Calgary
and Halifax.  On the evening of December 28, 2009, Mr. MacDonald entertained a
co-worker and his co-worker’s friend at his Halifax condominium (the “unit”). 
Some alcohol was consumed during the evening as Mr. MacDonald and his colleague
— who was about to replace him in Halifax — discussed work.

[3]                             
Later in the evening, the concierge of Mr.
MacDonald’s building, Mr. Sears, received a noise complaint regarding loud
music reverberating from the unit.  Mr. Sears went to the unit, heard the
loud music and knocked on the door.  He received no response.  Just as he was
about to leave, he saw Mr. MacDonald’s guests leaving the unit and saying good
night.  At this point, Mr. Sears asked Mr. MacDonald to turn down his
music.  Mr. MacDonald, swearing at him, refused to do so.

[4]                             
Mr. Sears contacted the Halifax Regional Police
and asked them to deal with the complaint about the noise issue.  Cst. Pierce
went to the building and, together with Mr. Sears, approached Mr. MacDonald’s
unit.  Cst. Pierce knocked on his door and asked him to turn his music down or
off.  Mr. MacDonald swore at her and slammed the door shut.

[5]                             
Cst. Pierce contacted her supervisor, Sgt. Boyd,
who arrived at the building approximately a half hour later.  Sgt. Boyd, Cst.
Pierce and Mr. Sears went to the unit.  Sgt. Boyd tried to get Mr.
MacDonald to answer the door by knocking on it and kicking it, and also shouted
that he was from the Halifax Regional Police.

[6]                             
About five minutes later, Mr. MacDonald opened
the door, but only about 16 inches — enough for the officers to see the
right side of his body and face.  Sgt. Boyd noticed something “black and
shiny” in Mr. MacDonald’s right hand that was in a shadow and was partially
hidden by his right leg (A.R., at p. 167).  He believed it might be a knife. 
He twice asked Mr. MacDonald what was behind his leg, gesturing toward his
right hand.  Mr. MacDonald did not respond.

[7]                             
Wanting to get a better look at what Mr.
MacDonald had in his hand, Sgt. Boyd pushed the door open a few inches
further.  The resulting light enabled him to identify it as a handgun.  He
yelled “gun!” and quickly forced his way into the unit.  After a brief
struggle, he was able to disarm Mr. MacDonald.

[8]                             
The gun that Mr. MacDonald was holding when he
opened the door was found to be a 9-mm Beretta — a restricted firearm.  It was
registered to him.  The gun was loaded.

[9]                             
Mr. MacDonald was charged with numerous
offences, three of which are relevant here:  handling a firearm in a careless manner
or without reasonable precautions for the safety of other persons, contrary to
s. 86(1) of the Code; unlawfully having in his possession a weapon for a
purpose dangerous to the public peace, contrary to s. 88(1); and possessing, in
a place, a loaded restricted firearm without being the holder of an
authorization or a licence under which he may possess the said firearm in that
place, contrary to s. 95(1) .

III. Judicial History

A.   
Nova Scotia Provincial Court

[10]                         
At trial, a voir dire was held to
determine whether Mr. MacDonald’s right to be secure against an unreasonable
search guaranteed by s. 8  of the Charter  had been violated when Sgt.
Boyd pushed the door to the unit open a few inches further to ascertain what he
was holding.  Judge Digby found that there is an exception that permits an
officer to enter a home to ensure his or her safety, particularly where, as
here, the intrusion is minor.  He concluded that “there is no Charter 
breach and the burden is on the accused to prove on a balance of probabilities
that there is a Charter  breach” (A.R., at p. 250).

[11]                         
After weighing all the circumstances, Judge
Digby found Mr. MacDonald guilty of the charges under ss. 86(1) and 88(1). 
Others could have been injured as a result of his conduct, which was out of
proportion to any threat, actual or reasonably perceived.  Before opening the
door, Mr. MacDonald knew the people there were police officers or people
claiming to be police officers.  He also knew that if they were in fact police
officers, they would react to his holding a handgun, and this would put his own
safety at risk as well as that of the officers themselves and of the public.

[12]                         
Judge Digby also found Mr. MacDonald guilty of
the charge under s. 95(1) .  In so finding, he noted that Mr. MacDonald and
the Crown agreed on the following facts:

. . . it is common ground that
Mr. MacDonald had a possession and acquisition license, that the Beretta
firearm was properly registered in Mr. MacDonald’s name and that he had a
right to possess it in his dwelling.  It was registered with the Canadian Firearms
Centre or another place approved for storage by the chief firearms officer.

 

. . .

 

It
is common ground that [Mr. MacDonald] had a loaded, restricted firearm in his
residence at Bishop’s Landing. . . . He had documentation which he submitted in
evidence from the Nova Scotia Rifle Association indicating that he was a member
and invited to use their facility.  I take it it is common ground, and
certainly the case has proceeded on the basis of common ground, that Nova
Scotia Rifle Association is an organization which falls under section 19(1) (a)
of the Firearms Act . [A.R., at pp. 19 and 21]

[13]                         
Mr. MacDonald had an authorization to transport
the firearm, but, the learned trial judge held, it entitled him to transport
the firearm only between his residence in Calgary and shooting ranges and
border crossings in Alberta.  He therefore had no right to take it to Halifax. 
Mr. MacDonald was guilty under s. 95(1)  because he had the firearm in the unit
without holding a licence which permitted him to possess it in that place.

[14]                         
Judge Digby sentenced Mr. MacDonald to three
years’ imprisonment.  He found that two years in a federal penitentiary was an
appropriate sentence for the offence under s. 86(1).  For the offence under s.
88(1), the proper sentence was three years in a federal penitentiary concurrent
with the first sentence.  As for the s. 95(1)  offence, he found that the
minimum sentence of three years in a federal penitentiary was appropriate and
ordered that it be served concurrently with the other two sentences.  Judge
Digby rejected Mr. MacDonald’s contention that the minimum three-year sentence
violated the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment
guaranteed by s. 12  of the Charter , finding, despite the consequences
for him and despite certain hypothetical scenarios, that it was not grossly
disproportionate.  He ordered that the firearm be forfeited and prohibited Mr. MacDonald
from possessing any weapons for 10 years and any restricted weapons for life.

B.    
Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, 2012 NSCA 50,
317 N.S.R. (2d) 90

[15]                         
MacDonald C.J.N.S. (Saunders J.A. concurring)
found that no Charter  violation had occurred on the evening in
question.  He noted that warrantless entry into a home is prima facie
illegal and that the onus was therefore on the Crown to justify the entry. 
Relying on this Court’s decision in R. v. Mann, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59, he concluded that there is a common law police power to search
without a warrant where the safety of the public or the police is at stake.  He
acknowledged, however, that this power is limited to situations in which, “in
addition to acting within the general scope of their authority, [the police]
have no other feasible less intrusive alternative”, and he added that “the
manner of carrying out the impugned activity must also be reasonable” (para.
31).  He found that Sgt. Boyd had exercised the power validly in the case at
bar.  The police were acting within the general scope of their authority by
going to Mr. MacDonald’s place of residence to deal with a noise complaint. 
Sgt. Boyd acted reasonably in the circumstances in pushing the door open
further to see what he was hiding.  Furthermore, no other action would have
been appropriate, as it was too late to simply retreat or issue a noise violation
ticket.

[16]                         
MacDonald C.J.N.S. upheld the convictions under
ss. 86  and 88 , but overturned the one under s. 95 .  On the latter conviction,
he acknowledged that pursuant to s. 17  of the Firearms Act, S.C. 1995,
c. 39 , Mr. MacDonald’s licence did not extend to his Halifax residence. 
However, he found that Mr. MacDonald should be acquitted on the basis of an
honest but mistaken belief that it did extend to the unit.  For the majority,
this belief was a mistake of fact which negated the mens rea of
the s. 95  offence.  The Crown had to prove that Mr. MacDonald knew or was
wilfully blind to the fact that his possession was unauthorized.  It had failed
to do so, as Mr. MacDonald genuinely believed that he was authorized to possess
the firearm in the unit.  MacDonald C.J.N.S. accordingly set aside the verdict
and substituted an acquittal on the s. 95  charge.

[17]                         
Finally, the majority reassessed the fitness of Mr.
MacDonald’s sentences for the convictions under ss. 86  and 88 .  The majority
found that a review of these sentences was warranted because, rather than
conducting an independent analysis for each offence, the trial judge had
considered the incident globally.  Because they had set aside the conviction
under s. 95 , they found it necessary to scrutinize the dispositions for the
other convictions.

[18]                         
MacDonald C.J.N.S. found the three-year sentence
for the conviction under s. 88  to be too harsh, since Mr. MacDonald’s actions
“did not involve the more typical scenario such as a highly volatile public
confrontation or a dangerous domestic dispute” and since “the gun was neither
fired, nor . . . intentionally pointed” (para. 117).  He reviewed a number of
cases which suggested that three years was outside the sentencing range for
this offence.  He found the sentence to be demonstrably unfit and concluded:

Considering
the principles of sentencing, the circumstances of this offence and Mr.
MacDonald’s individual circumstances, particularly his positive pre-sentence
report and his previous unblemished record, in my view a sentence of time
served would be appropriate.  This would represent 18 days in custody
(considering the 2 days following his arrest, his release on his own
recognizance and then the 16 days between his sentencing and his release on
bail pending appeal). [para. 123]

[19]                         
As for the sentence for the conviction under s.
86 , the majority found the imposition of the maximum two-year sentence to be
unduly harsh in comparison with other cases. They held this sentence to be
demonstrably unfit and imposed a sentence of 14 days concurrent with the
sentence imposed for the s. 88  offence.

[20]                         
Finally, MacDonald C.J.N.S. ordered a two-year
term of probation, a prohibition on possession of weapons for five years, and
forfeiture of the firearm.

[21]                         
Beveridge J.A., in dissent, held that Sgt. Boyd
had infringed Mr. MacDonald’s right under s. 8  of the Charter  by pushing
the door to the unit open further and extending his hand into Mr. MacDonald’s
home.  In Beveridge J.A.’s view, the authority of the police to enter an
individual’s home for the purpose of ensuring officer safety did not apply in
the circumstances of this case:

While I have no difficulty
with the premise that the officers were lawfully present and carrying out their
duties, they did not acquire any power to intrude into [Mr. MacDonald’s] home
as a result of Sgt. Boyd’s concern that [he] was concealing something. Sergeant
Boyd never suggested that he suspected, let alone had reasonable grounds to
believe, that it was a firearm. He said it was something black and shiny. At
best he said he “thought he might have a weapon in his hand”. In my view, this
is more akin to hunch or suspicion than reasonable grounds to believe. In fact,
the trial judge made no finding that reasonable grounds existed. Despite ample
opportunity to give evidence that he did, Sgt. Boyd said no such thing.

 

. . .

 

The
issue is not whether Sgt. Boyd acted reasonably in pushing open the door. The
issue is did he have lawful authority to do so. That would only materialize if
he had reasonable grounds to believe that his safety, or the safety of others,
was at risk and his search in pushing open the door was reasonably necessary in
the circumstances.

 

Absent
a new-found power to enter a private dwelling based on a suspicion that officer
safety concerns are triggered, the conclusion is inescapable that [Mr.
MacDonald’s] reasonable expectation of privacy protected by s. 8  of the Charter 
was infringed or denied. [paras. 156 and 173-74]

[22]                         
In light of all the circumstances, Beveridge
J.A. would have excluded the firearm as evidence at trial, because its
admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  He would
accordingly have set aside the convictions and directed acquittals on all three
of the charges.

IV. Analysis

A.  Issues

[23]                         
This case raises three issues, which I will
discuss in turn:

1.         Was Mr. MacDonald’s right under s. 8  of the Charter 
to be free from unreasonable search and seizure violated and, if so, what is
the appropriate remedy?

2.         Does the mens rea of the offence provided for in
s. 95(1) of the Code include knowledge that one’s licence does not extend
to the place where the firearm is possessed?

3.         Should the sentences imposed by the Court of Appeal for
the convictions under ss. 86(1) and 88(1) be varied?

B.  Mr. MacDonald’s Charter
Challenge

[24]                         
Mr. MacDonald’s central argument is that Sgt.
Boyd’s action of pushing the door open further constituted an unreasonable
search, contrary to s. 8  of the Charter .  He submits that the
evidence obtained by the police as a result of the search — namely the firearm
— ought to be excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter , as its admission
would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  I cannot accept this
argument.  As I will explain, although Sgt. Boyd’s action constituted a
“search” for the purposes of s. 8  of the Charter , that search was not
unreasonable.

      (1)     Did Sgt. Boyd’s
Action Constitute a Search?

[25]                         
R. v. Evans,
[1996] 1 S.C.R. 8, is a leading case on what constitutes a “search” for the
purposes of s. 8 .  The facts of that case were not dissimilar to those of the
instant case in that the search was carried out by police at the doorstep of
the accused person’s home.  Sopinka J. laid down the following test for
determining whether a police action constitutes a “search”:

. . . it is only where a person’s
reasonable expectations of privacy are somehow diminished by an investigatory
technique that s. 8  of the Charter  comes into play. As a result, not
every form of examination conducted by the government will constitute a
“search” for constitutional purposes. On the contrary, only where those
state examinations constitute an intrusion upon some reasonable privacy
interest of individuals does the government action in question constitute a
“search” within the meaning of s. 8 . [Emphasis added; para. 11.]

In other words, a s. 8  search “may
be defined as the state invasion of a reasonable expectation of privacy” (R.
v. A.M., 2008 SCC 19, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 569, at para. 8).

[26]                         
There is no question that individuals have a
reasonable, indeed a strong, expectation of privacy in their homes (R. v.
Godoy, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 311, at para. 19; R. v. Feeney, [1997] 2
S.C.R. 13; R. v. Silveira, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 297), as well as in the
approaches to their homes (Evans, at para. 21).  However, Evans
also established that the police have an implied licence to approach the door
of a residence and knock.  Doing so will not be considered an invasion of
privacy constituting a search if the purpose of the police is to communicate
with the occupant.  But “[w]here the conduct of the police . . . goes beyond
that which is permitted by the implied licence to knock, the implied
‘conditions’ of that licence have effectively been breached, and the person
carrying out the unauthorized activity approaches the dwelling as an intruder”
(Evans, at para. 15).  In such circumstances, the police action
constitutes a “search”.

[27]                         
Initially, Sgt. Boyd’s actions were compatible
with the implied licence to knock.  He approached Mr. MacDonald’s door, knocked
on it and kicked it for the purpose of communicating to the occupant that he
needed to turn his music down.  After Mr. MacDonald had opened the door,
however, Sgt. Boyd’s purpose in pushing it open further was to get a better
view of what was in his hand (A.R., at pp. 168-69).  Simply put, Mr.
MacDonald’s implied waiver of his privacy rights did not extend that far. 
Speaking or shouting through the door or knocking on it falls within the
waiver; pushing it open further does not. Sgt. Boyd’s action of pushing the
door open further constituted an intrusion upon Mr. MacDonald’s reasonable
privacy interest in his dwelling.

[28]                         
Having found that the police action constituted
a search of Mr. MacDonald’s home, I must now consider whether that search was
unreasonable, and therefore in violation of s. 8  of the Charter .  At
this stage, because the search was warrantless, the Crown has the burden of
showing that it was reasonable (R. v. Collins,
[1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 278).

      (2)     Was the Search
Unreasonable?

[29]                         
The framework for scrutinizing warrantless searches for Charter  compliance was
summarized by this Court in Mann:

[Warrantless] searches are presumed to
be unreasonable unless they can be justified, and hence found reasonable,
pursuant to the test established in R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265. 
Under Collins, warrantless searches are deemed reasonable if (a) they
are authorized by law, (b) the law itself is reasonable, and (c) the manner in
which the search was carried out was also reasonable (p. 278). The Crown bears
the burden of demonstrating, on the balance of probabilities, that the
warrantless search was authorized by a reasonable law and carried out in a
reasonable manner: R. v. Buhay, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 631, 2003 SCC 30, at
para. 32. [para. 36]

[30]                         
Applying the Collins test to the facts of
the instant case, I find that the search carried out by Sgt. Boyd was
reasonable.

(a)            
The Search Was Authorized by Law and the Law Itself Is Reasonable

[31]                         
Where the first prong of the Collins test
is concerned, a search will be authorized by law if it is authorized by a valid
police power.  In Godoy, Lamer C.J. affirmed that the police have a
common law duty to protect life and safety.  Nevertheless, “[p]olice powers and
police duties are not necessarily correlative” (Mann, at para. 35).
Indeed, the police power to search is not unlimited.  This power is constrained
by a requirement of objectively verifiable necessity (para. 26). In Mann,
Iacobucci J. accepted the need for a general police power to conduct pat-down
searches, but solely in appropriate circumstances. He was mindful of the risks
of abuse of such a power, as he observed that “[s]uch a search power does not
exist as a matter of course: the officer must believe on reasonable grounds that
his or her own safety, or the safety of others, is at risk” (para. 40).

[32]                         
A search that is reasonably necessary to eliminate
threats to the safety of the public or the police — which I will term a “safety
search” — will generally be conducted by the police as a reactionary measure. 
In other words, although such searches may arise in a wide variety of contexts,
they will generally be unplanned, as they will be carried out in response to
dangerous situations created by individuals, to which the police must react “on
the sudden”.  Binnie J.’s observation in A.M. in relation to sniffer-dog
searches that “the police are generally required to take quick action guided by
on-the-spot observations” (at para. 90) is equally applicable to safety
searches.  Thus, safety searches will typically be warrantless, as the police
will generally not have sufficient time to obtain prior judicial authorization
for them. In a sense, such searches are driven by exigent circumstances.  Even
if exigent circumstances exist, however, “safety searches” must be authorized
by law. 

[33]                         
In arguing that Sgt. Boyd’s search was
authorized by law, the Crown relies on the test from R. v. Waterfield,
[1963] 3 All E.R. 659 (C.C.A.), as set out by this Court in Dedman v. The
Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 2.  It will be recalled that in Waterfield,
two police officers had attempted to detain personal property (a car)
belonging to the accused.  The court set down a two-part test to determine
whether the officers were acting in the execution of their duties when
they sought to stop the accused from removing his property.  As Professor P.
Healy notes, the Waterfield test served in Dedman, as in earlier
Canadian cases in which it had been applied (R. v. Stenning, [1970]
S.C.R. 631, and Knowlton v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 443), to mark “the
limits of liability when there [was] some question whether a police officer
[had] acted in the execution of his or her duty”:  “Investigative Detention in
Canada”, [2005] Crim. L.R. 98, at p. 102.  It was of assistance in the
determination of whether a police officer who had been assaulted was acting as
an officer at the time of the assault, in which case the accused would be
guilty of assaulting a police officer and not a regular citizen. Waterfield
is therefore an imperfect authority on the question whether police have a common
law power to search an individual in a safety search.

[34]                         
Instead, we must consider this Court’s
jurisprudence.  This Court has elaborated on and applied the two-step Waterfield
test in a variety of contexts comparable to safety searches in assessing
whether an action constituting prima facie infringement of an
individual’s liberty falls within an officer’s power (Dedman and Mann).


[35]                         
At the first stage of the Waterfield test,
the court must ask whether the action falls within the general scope of a
police duty imposed by statute or recognized at common law.  For safety
searches, the requirement at this first stage of the analysis is easily
satisfied.  In the case at bar, the police action falls within the general
scope of the common law police duty to protect life and safety that I mentioned
above.  This duty is well established (Mann, at para. 38; R. v.
Clayton, 2007 SCC 32, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 725, at paras. 20-21; Dedman).

[36]                         
At the second stage, if the answer at the first
is affirmative, as it is in this case, the court must inquire into whether the
action constitutes a justifiable exercise of powers associated with the duty. 
As this Court held in Dedman,

[t]he interference with liberty must be
necessary for the carrying out of the particular police duty and
it must be reasonable, having regard to the nature of the liberty
interfered with and the importance of the public purpose served by the
interference. [Emphasis added; p. 35.]

Thus, for the
infringement to be justified, the police action must be reasonably necessary
for the carrying out of the particular duty in light of all the
circumstances (Mann, at para. 39; Clayton, at paras. 21 and 29). 

[37]                         
To determine whether a safety search is
reasonably necessary, and therefore justifiable, a number of factors must be
weighed to balance the police duty against the liberty interest in question. 
These factors include: 

1.         the importance of the performance of the duty to the
public good (Mann, at para. 39); 

2.         the necessity of the interference with individual liberty
for the performance of the duty (Dedman, at p. 35; Clayton, at
paras. 21, 26 and 31); and

3.         the extent of the
interference with individual liberty (Dedman, at p. 35). 

If these three factors,
weighed together, lead to the conclusion that the police action was reasonably
necessary, then the action in question will not constitute an “unjustifiable
use” of police powers (Dedman, at p. 36).  If the requirements of
both stages of the Waterfield test are satisfied, the court will then be
able to conclude that the search in question was authorized by law.

[38]                         
As can be seen, the Dedman-Mann line of
cases does not stand for the proposition that all acts related to an officer’s
duties are authorized by law. Quite the opposite, only such acts as are
reasonably necessary for the performance of an officer’s duties can be
considered, in the appropriate circumstances, to be so authorized. The English
Court of Appeal was clear on this point in Waterfield, in a
passage quoted by this Court in Dedman: 

Thus, while it is no doubt right to say
in general terms that police constables have a duty to prevent crime and a
duty, when crime is committed, to bring the offender to justice, it is also
clear from the decided cases that when the execution of these general duties
involves interference with the person or property of a private person, the
powers of constables are not unlimited. [Emphasis added; p. 33.]

Likewise, Dickson J., in
a powerful dissent in the Wiretap Reference, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 697,
stressed the critical importance of a narrow reading of the Waterfield
test:

The fact
that police officers could be described as acting within the general scope of
their duties to investigate crime cannot empower them to violate the law
whenever such conduct could be justified by the public interest in law
enforcement. Any such principle would be nothing short of a fiat for illegality
on the part of the police whenever the benefit of police action appeared to
outweigh the infringement of an individual’s rights. [pp. 718-19] 

Such restraints on safety
searches are particularly important in the context of a search in a private
home, as in the case at bar, which concerns a serious invasion of Mr. MacDonald’s
privacy in his home. Moreover, safety searches can often give the police access
to a considerable amount of very sensitive personal information. 

[39]                         
With this clarification in mind, we must
sensitively weigh the factors of the second stage of the Dedman-Mann
test. The factors assist both in determining whether a police power exists and
in defining the limits of that power: 

1.         Importance of the duty:  No one can reasonably dispute
that the duty to protect life and safety is of the utmost importance to the
public good and that, in some circumstances, some interference with individual
liberty is necessary to carry out that duty.  

2.         Necessity of the infringement for the performance of the
duty:  When the performance of a police duty requires an officer to interact
with an individual who they have reasonable grounds to believe is armed and
dangerous, an infringement on individual liberty may be necessary.  

3.         Extent of the infringement:  The infringement on
individual liberty will be justified only to the extent that it is necessary to
search for weapons.  Although the specific manner (be it a pat-down, the
shining of a flashlight or, as in this case, the further opening of a door) in
which a safety search is conducted will vary from case to case, such a search
will be lawful only if all aspects of the search serve a protective function.
In other words, the authority for the search runs out at the point at which the
search for weapons is finished.  The premise of the Collins test — a
warrantless search is presumed to be unreasonable unless it can be justified —
must be borne in mind in determining whether the interference with individual
liberty involved in a safety search is reasonable. 

[40]                         
On balancing these factors, I am convinced that
the duty of police officers to protect life and safety may justify the power to
conduct a safety search in certain circumstances.  At the very least, where a
search is reasonably necessary to eliminate an imminent threat to the safety of
the public or the police, the police should have the power to conduct the
search. 

[41]                         
But although I acknowledge the importance of
safety searches, I must repeat that the power to carry one out is not
unbridled. In my view, the principles laid down in Mann and reaffirmed
in Clayton require the existence of circumstances establishing the
necessity of safety searches, reasonably and objectively considered, to address
an imminent threat to the safety of the public or the police. Given the high privacy
interests at stake in such searches, the search will be authorized by law only
if the police officer believes on reasonable grounds that his or her safety is
at stake and that, as a result, it is necessary to conduct a search (Mann,
at para. 40; see also para. 45). The legality of the search therefore turns
on its reasonable, objectively verifiable necessity in the circumstances of the
matter (see R. v. Tse, 2012 SCC 16, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 531,
at para. 33). As the Court stated in Mann, a search cannot be justified
on the basis of a vague concern for safety. Rather, for a safety search to be
lawful, the officer must act on “reasonable and specific inferences drawn from
the known facts of the situation” (Mann, at para. 41).

[42]                         
A safety search is a physical search that could
uncover a broad array of information about an individual.  In the instant case,
even though all Sgt. Boyd did was push the door open slightly further, this had
the potential to reveal to the officers any number of things about Mr.
MacDonald, as they could now see more of the interior of the unit. However,
because Sgt. Boyd had reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. MacDonald was
armed and dangerous, the further opening of the door was authorized by law.

[43]                         
As for the second prong of the Collins
test, it cannot be disputed that the lawful authority underlying safety
searches outlined above is reasonable.  Indeed, the execution of the police
duty to protect life and safety lies at the very core of the existence of the
police as a social entity. Further, the law will justify the exercise of this
police power only if exercising it is reasonably necessary in order for
the police to conduct the safety search in question (Clayton, at paras.
21, 26 and 31). As I explained above, it is only when police officers have
reasonable grounds to believe that there is an imminent threat to their safety
that it will be reasonably necessary to conduct such a search.  This limit
guarantees that the lawful police power is not excessively broad.  In so doing,
it ensures that the law itself is reasonable and can be reasonably delineated. 

[44]                         
This common law power to conduct searches for
safety purposes is the reasonable lawful authority for the search carried out
by Sgt. Boyd.  The power was engaged because Sgt. Boyd had reasonable grounds
to believe that there was an imminent threat to the safety of the public or the
police and that the search was necessary in order to eliminate that threat. 
More specifically, the trial judge found that Sgt. Boyd had observed the
following when Mr. MacDonald answered the door:

1.         Mr. MacDonald had his hand behind his leg and was clearly
holding an object;

2.         what he was holding was “black and shiny” and therefore
could have been a weapon; and

3.         when twice asked what he had behind his back, he refused
to answer or to provide any explanation.

[45]                         
In my opinion, the search conducted by Sgt. Boyd
was authorized by law and the law itself, in the form of a well-established
common law principle, is reasonable.  As I will explain below, the manner in which he carried out the search
was also reasonable.

(b)      The Manner in Which the
Search Was Carried Out Was Reasonable

[46]                         
Two aspects of this prong of the Collins
test must be addressed.  First, as we have seen, an officer must have
reasonable grounds to believe that there is an imminent threat to the safety of
the public or the police before a safety search will be deemed reasonable.  I
agree that Sgt. Boyd had such grounds in the circumstances of this case.

[47]                         
Second, the actions of the police in conducting
the search must be scrutinized to determine whether the search was carried out reasonably.  To a certain
extent, this analysis relates to the second stage of the Waterfield test.
If the extent of the infringement is greater than what is required to search
for weapons, the search will not be authorized by law. At this point, however,
the overall reasonableness of the search must be assessed in light of the
totality of the circumstances (Mann, at para. 44).  It is necessary to
consider not only the extent of the interference, but how it was
carried out. This inquiry turns on whether the search was minimally intrusive
on the privacy interest at stake.  In other words, the manner in which the
search was carried out must have been reasonably necessary
to eliminate any threat. 

[48]                         
In the instant case,
the trial judge found that Sgt. Boyd had, in pushing the door open further,
done no more than was necessary to find out what Mr. MacDonald had behind his
leg.  His action was therefore reasonably necessary in order to determine
what was behind Mr. MacDonald’s leg and in so doing eliminate any threat to the safety of the public or the police.  In fact, one
could go further and state that there was no less intrusive way to do so.  Sgt.
Boyd twice asked Mr. MacDonald what he had in his hand but received no answer. 
In these circumstances, it is hard to imagine a less invasive way of
determining whether Mr. MacDonald was concealing a weapon (and thereby
eliminating any threat in that regard).

[49]                         
Indeed, when the officer’s evidence is read as a
whole, it appears that he had reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. MacDonald
had a weapon in his hands. He simply was not sure what kind of weapon it was
(see, for example, A.R., at p. 180).

[50]                         
On this basis, Sgt. Boyd’s pushing the door to
the unit open further constituted a reasonable search.  It was authorized by a
reasonable law and was carried
out in a reasonable manner.  It follows that Mr.
MacDonald’s rights under s. 8  of the Charter  were not violated.  As a
result, I need not consider the issue of a remedy under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .

C.  Appeal of the Acquittal on the
Charge Under Section 95 of the Code

[51]                         
The Crown is appealing Mr. MacDonald’s acquittal
on the charge under s. 95 of the Code.  It submits that the Court of
Appeal erred in interpreting the mens rea requirement of the offence of
possession of a loaded restricted firearm provided for in s. 95  and imposed a
nearly insurmountable burden on the Crown which is inconsistent with the principle
that ignorance of the law is no excuse.  Mr. MacDonald takes the position that
the Court of Appeal correctly interpreted the mens rea requirement of
that offence and correctly held that the mens rea had not been made
out.  I agree with the Crown that the Court of Appeal made an error in
requiring the Crown to prove, in order to secure a conviction under s. 95 , that
the accused knew his possession and acquisition licence and authorization to
transport the firearm did not extend to the place where he unlawfully had it in
his possession.  As I will explain, such a requirement is inconsistent with the
rule, codified in s. 19 of the Code, that ignorance of the law is no
excuse.

[52]                         
Section 95(1) of the Code reads as
follows:

95. (1) Subject to subsection (3), every person commits an offence who,
in any place, possesses a loaded prohibited firearm or restricted
firearm, or an unloaded prohibited firearm or restricted firearm together
with readily accessible ammunition that is capable of being discharged in the
firearm, unless the person is the holder of

 

(a)   an
authorization or a licence under which the person may possess the firearm in
that place; and

 

(b)   the
registration certificate for the firearm. 

[53]                         
In this Court, Mr. MacDonald’s argument on his
conviction under s. 95  relates to the mens rea of the offence.  He does
not dispute that he possessed a loaded restricted firearm in the unit.  Nor
does Mr. MacDonald deny that he possessed the firearm there without being the
holder of an authorization or a licence that entitled him to possess it in that
place.  Rather, he argues that s. 95  is a mens rea offence and that, to
secure a conviction, the Crown must show that he knew his possession of the
firearm in the unit was unauthorized.  This, Mr. MacDonald says, the Crown
failed to do, whereas he testified at trial that he had a subjective belief
that the authorization he had obtained in Alberta extended to his condominium
in Halifax.

[54]                         
In my view, the offence provided for in s. 95  is
a mens rea offence.  As this Court recognized in Lévis (City) v.
Tétreault, 2006 SCC 12, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 420, at para. 16, classifying an
offence as either a mens rea offence, a strict liability offence or an
absolute liability offence is a question of statutory interpretation.  The
Crown agreed at the hearing of this case that the offence at issue is a mens
rea offence, and in any event, we may validly rely on the presumption that
an offence should be classified as a mens rea offence where, as here,
nothing in the statute indicates a contrary intention (The Queen v. Sault
Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, at pp. 1309-10; Beaver v. The Queen,
[1957] S.C.R. 531).

[55]                         
The mens rea the Crown is required to
prove under s. 95(1)  does not, however, include knowledge that possession in
the place in question is unauthorized.  Rather, knowledge that one
possesses a loaded restricted firearm, together with an intention to possess
the loaded firearm in that place, is enough.  An individual who knowingly
possesses a loaded restricted firearm in a particular place with an intention
to do so will be liable to punishment for the offence provided for in s. 95(1) 
unless he or she holds an authorization or a licence under which the firearm
may be possessed in that place.  Thus, a proper authorization or licence serves
to negate the actus reus of the offence, thereby allowing someone who
legitimately possesses a restricted firearm in a given place to avoid
liability.

[56]                         
With respect, the Court of Appeal erred in law
by improperly reading a defence of ignorance of the law into s. 95(1) .  In the
majority’s view, the Crown had to prove that Mr. MacDonald knew or was wilfully
blind to the fact that his possession was unauthorized.  Such a burden would
compel the Crown to prove that an accused knew the conditions of his or her
authorization or licence.  This amounts to requiring the Crown to prove that
the accused knew the law.

[57]                         
The following example illustrates the point that
an error made by an accused in interpreting his or her authorization or licence
is a mistake of law and not one of fact.  Suppose the Code provided that
restricted firearms could be possessed only in the province of Alberta, and
nowhere else in Canada.  Surely, if that were the case, there could be no
dispute that Mr. MacDonald’s possession of such a firearm in Halifax
contravened this rule, and any suggestion that he thought he could lawfully
possess it there would have to be considered a mistake of law and would
therefore afford no defence to a charge of unlawful possession.  For my part, I
find no distinction when such a rule is expanded to an individual’s
authorization and the applicable section of the Code merely refers to
such a document.  Mr. MacDonald’s subjective belief that he could possess the
firearm in Halifax is therefore nothing other than a mistake of law.

[58]                         
I therefore find that a requirement that an
accused knew or was wilfully blind to the fact that his possession was
unauthorized would be grounded on the acceptance of mistake of law as a defence
to a charge under s. 95(1) .  It is trite law that, except in the case of an
officially induced error, a mistake of law is no defence in our criminal
justice system.  Section 19 of the Code states:

19. Ignorance of the law by a person who commits an offence is not an
excuse for committing that offence.

[59]                         
In R. v. Forster, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 339,
Lamer C.J. accurately and succinctly explained this as follows:

It is a
principle of our criminal law that an honest but mistaken belief in respect of
the legal consequences of one’s deliberate actions does not furnish a defence
to a criminal charge, even when the mistake cannot be attributed to the
negligence of the accused: Molis v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 356. 
This Court recently reaffirmed in R. v. Docherty, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 941,
at p. 960, the principle that knowledge that one’s actions are contrary to the
law is not a component of the mens rea for an offence, and consequently
does not operate as a defence. [p. 346]

[60]                         
In sum, the Court of Appeal erred by treating Mr.
MacDonald’s mistake of law as a mistake of fact which exonerated him of the
charge resulting from his actions.  I would allow the Crown’s appeal on this
issue and restore the conviction under s. 95(1) .

[61]                         
Although I am of the view that the conviction
must be restored, I nevertheless appreciate the Court of Appeal’s concern that Mr.
MacDonald may as a result of this conviction be sentenced to a mandatory
three-year term of imprisonment despite the fact that, in ordinary
circumstances, his mistake of law would be a mitigating factor to be considered
in fashioning a sentence that is proportionate to his crime (C. C. Ruby, G. J.
Chan and N. R. Hasan, Sentencing (8th ed. 2012), at pp. 319-21). 
Whether the mandatory minimum three-year term of imprisonment provided for in
s. 95(2)(a)(i) is constitutional will now be a matter for the Court of
Appeal to decide.

D.  Appeal Against the Sentence
Imposed by the Court of Appeal

[62]                         
Having restored Mr. MacDonald’s conviction under
s. 95(1) , this Court is not in a position to consider the Crown’s appeal
against the sentences imposed by the Court of Appeal on the charges under ss.
86(1) and 88(1).  Because the Court of Appeal acquitted Mr. MacDonald on the
charge under s. 95(1) , it did not consider his argument that the mandatory
minimum three-year sentence provided for in s. 95(2)(a)(i) is
unconstitutional.  Given the decision to restore Mr. MacDonald’s conviction on
this count, the matter should be remitted to the Court of Appeal for
consideration of this argument.  Because of the close factual tie between the
sentences imposed for the convictions under ss. 86  and 88  and the one imposed
for the conviction under s. 95 , the Court of Appeal should reconsider all the sentences
together after deciding whether s. 95(2)(a)(i) is constitutionally
valid.

V.  Disposition

[63]                         
For the reasons set out above, I would dismiss Mr.
MacDonald’s appeal on the s. 8  issue and allow the Crown’s appeal on the charge
under s. 95(1) .  Mr. MacDonald’s acquittal on that charge is set aside, and his
conviction is restored.  This matter will be remitted to the Court of Appeal
for sentencing, and it will be necessary for that court to determine whether
the mandatory minimum sentence applicable under s. 95(2)(a)(i) of the Code
is constitutionally valid.  

                    The reasons of Rothstein, Moldaver and
Wagner JJ. were delivered by

[64]                         
Moldaver and
Wagner JJ. — Every day, throughout this country, police
officers put their lives and safety at risk in order to preserve and protect
the lives and safety of others.  In return, they are entitled to know that when
potentially dangerous situations arise, the law permits them to conduct
minimally intrusive safety searches to alleviate the risks they face.  That is
the fundamental bargain we, as a society, have struck with the police — and it
is a fundamental commitment upon which the police are entitled to rely.  

[65]                         
The commitment of which we speak was
acknowledged by this Court in R. v. Mann, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R.
59.  Mann recognized a limited police power to search without a warrant
solely for protective purposes where a police officer has reasonable grounds to
suspect a threat to his or her safety or the safety of others.  The majority in
this case purports to apply Mann.  Respectfully, however, it does not. 
Instead, it renders Mann redundant, depriving police officers of the
limited search powers they need to protect themselves and the public in fluid
and often unpredictable situations of potential danger. 

[66]                         
In the instant case, while we agree with the
majority on all three issues in this case, including Mr. MacDonald’s claim
under s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , we part
company with our colleagues on the proper interpretation of Mann.  Our
colleagues assert, relying on Mann, that officers are only empowered to
conduct “safety searches” where they have reasonable grounds to believe an
individual is armed and dangerous (paras. 39 and 44).  With respect, we do not
agree with that conclusion.  In our view, Mann decided that officers may
conduct safety searches when they have reasonable grounds to suspect an
individual is armed and dangerous.  The balance of these reasons will focus on
explaining why.  

[67]                         
The case law reveals that the rationale
justifying the police power to perform protective searches is the protection of
public or officer safety. It seems to us that such a power is a necessary
corollary of the duties imposed on the police, two of which include the duty to
preserve the peace and to protect life and property.  Police officers cannot be
asked to intervene in dangerous or fluid situations and, at the same time, be
denied the authority to take protective measures when they reasonably suspect
their own safety is at risk, especially when there is a suspicion weapons are
present.

[68]                         
Mann affirmed as
much.  Our starting point then is the language of the case itself: 

. . . where a police officer has
reasonable grounds to believe that his or her safety or that of others
is at risk, the officer may engage in a protective pat-down search of
the detained individual.  [Emphasis added; para. 45.]

[69]                         
Read in isolation, the “reasonable grounds to
believe” language connotes the “reasonable and probable grounds” standard. See Baron
v. Canada, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 416, at p. 447.  But one cannot stop reading
there, because the concept of being “at risk” inherently builds in the concept
of possibility.  See, e.g., the Oxford English Dictionary (online), sub
verbo “risk” (“the possibility of loss, injury, or other adverse or
unwelcome circumstance; a chance or situation involving such a possibility”
(emphasis added)). 

[70]                         
The language of Mann thus appears to
stack a probability on top of a possibility — a chance upon a
chance.  In other words, Mann says a safety search is justified if it is
probable that something might happen, not that it is probable that
something will happen.  As this Court only recently explained, the
former is the language of “reasonable suspicion” (R. v. MacKenzie,
2013 SCC 50, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 250, at para. 74).  The latter is the language of
“reasonable and probable grounds”. 

[71]                         
Admittedly, the language of Mann could
have been clearer.  Indeed, the ambiguity in the key paragraph of Mann has
led at least one authority in this field to suggest that the Court simply
“misspoke”:  J. Stribopoulos, “The Limits of Judicially Created Police Powers:
Investigative Detention after Mann” (2007), 52 Crim. L.Q. 299, at
p. 311.  While it would have been helpful if the Court in Mann had
simply said either “reasonable grounds to believe an individual
is armed and dangerous” or “reasonable grounds to suspect an
individual is armed and dangerous”, the fact is that it did not.  Fortunately,
however, we are able to resolve any lingering doubt about the meaning of Mann
with the tools available to us.  As we will explain, each of these tools points
away from the majority’s interpretation.  

[72]                         
Since legal terms of art are not always
self-defining, we begin with how the Mann Court actually described the
standard it was adopting.  A close reading leaves no doubt it was describing
reasonable suspicion.  For example, Mann held that “[t]he search must be
grounded in objectively discernible facts to prevent ‘fishing
expeditions’ on the basis of irrelevant or discriminatory factors”
(para. 43 (emphasis added)).  As we recently held in R. v. Chehil, 2013
SCC 49, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220, reasonable suspicion must be grounded in “objectively
discernible facts, and . . . prevents the indiscriminate and discriminatory
exercise of police power” (para. 3 (emphasis added)).  Similarly, Mann spoke
of a “logical possibility that the [suspect] . . . was in
possession of break-and-enter tools, which could be used as weapons” (para. 48
(emphasis added)).  Again, Chehil makes clear that “reasonable suspicion
. . . engages [a] reasonable possibility, rather than
probability” (para. 27 (emphasis added)). Finally, Mann required that an
officer “not be acting solely on a hunch” (para. 41 (emphasis added)). 
And again, Chehil cautioned “hunches . . . will [not] suffice”
(para. 47 (emphasis added)).  We know of no case that has described the
reasonable and probable grounds standard using this language.

[73]                         
To look at the matter another way, had Mann intended
to adopt a reasonable and probable grounds standard, these detailed
elaborations would have been unnecessary since reasonable and probable grounds
was at the time a well-known standard.  Indeed, it was and remains the presumptive
standard under the Charter  (see Hunter v. Southam Inc.,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 145).  In contrast, Mann represented one of the first
attempts by this Court to define the standard of reasonable suspicion (see also
R. v. Kang-Brown, 2008 SCC 18, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 456; R. v. A.M.,
2008 SCC 19, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 569; Chehil; MacKenzie).

[74]                         
Second, we look at the history from which Mann
emerged.  In recognizing a power of investigative detention and a related
power to search for protective purposes incidental to that detention, Mann explicitly
relied on the U.S. Supreme Court’s seminal decision in Terry v. Ohio,
392 U.S. 1 (1968).  Significant for present purposes, Mann quoted the
following passage from Terry (at p. 27) when articulating the
standard upon which an officer safety search must be measured:

     . . . there must be a narrowly
drawn authority to permit a reasonable search for weapons for the protection of
the police officer, where he has reason to believe that he is dealing
with an armed and dangerous individual, regardless of whether he has
probable cause to arrest the individual for a crime.  [Emphasis added;
para. 41.]

[75]                         
As the excerpt makes clear, Chief Justice Warren
clearly distinguished the Terry standard from the “probable cause”
standard — the equivalent of our reasonable and probable grounds — traditionally
used for arrests.  And though there has never been any serious debate about
what Terry meant, in speaking of a “reason to believe”, the language of Terry
risked being “confusing and contradictory” because “it is precisely the
language the [U.S. Supreme] Court has used time and again to define the
probable cause requisite for arrest” (W. R. LaFave, Search and Seizure:  A
Treatise on the Fourth Amendment (5th ed. 2012), vol. 4, at §9.6(a)).  As
our American colleagues only recently affirmed, however, under Terry,
“the police must harbor reasonable suspicion that the person . . . is
armed and dangerous” (Arizona v. Johnson, 129 S. Ct. 781 (2009), at p.
784 (emphasis added)).  It is surely ironic, then, that in borrowing from Terry’s
diction, Mann inadvertently imported the same confusion and
contradiction into Canada.  

[76]                         
That brings us to our third point.  Until today,
it was thought that the subsequent interpretation and application of Mann by
this Court and others had put that confusion to rest.  Most significantly, in R.
v. Clayton, 2007 SCC 32, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 725, as Abella J. explained, the
two accused were detained because the police had a “reasonable suspicion” they
were in possession of firearms and “as a result, the lives of the police
officers and of the public were at risk” (para. 46).  Those very safety
concerns — without more — justified searches of the accused incidental to their
detention (para. 48).  In other words, the officers were entitled to conduct a
minimally intrusive search for safety purposes because they had reason to
suspect that the accused were armed and dangerous.

[77]                         
Beyond Clayton, this Court has on at
least three distinct occasions expressed, albeit in obiter, that Mann
authorized a protective search incidental to investigative detention on the
basis of reasonable suspicion.  First, Binnie J., writing for himself and the
Chief Justice in Kang-Brown, referred to “the Court’s decision in Mann
to lower the bar from reasonable and probable cause to reasonable suspicion
in the context of a warrantless search” (para. 62 (emphasis added)).  In
R. v. Aucoin, 2012 SCC 66, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 408, at para. 44, n.
3, the majority expressly declined to endorse the minority’s assertion that Mann
required a reasonable and probable grounds standard for pat-down searches. 
And, lastly, only a few months ago — in an opinion joined by every member of
today’s majority — we noted that Mann authorized “limited searches
accompanying investigative detentions” on the basis of “reasonable suspicion” (Chehil,
at para. 22, n. 1).  With respect, the majority does not explain why these
comments were mistaken. 

[78]                         
Beyond our own cases, lower courts have relied
on this Court’s jurisprudence and have, unsurprisingly, concluded that Mann
adopted a reasonable suspicion standard.  For example, in R. v. Crocker,
2009 BCCA 388, 275 B.C.A.C. 190, leave to appeal refused, [2010] 1 S.C.R. viii,
the court held that “[a] lawful protective safety search . . . need only meet
the legal standard of reasonable suspicions . . . required by Mann”
(para. 72 (emphasis added)).  Just a few months ago, the same conclusion was
reached in R. v. Atkins, 2013 ONCA 586, 310 O.A.C. 397:  “The pat-down search
that followed the detention was justified on officer safety grounds” because
“[t]he officers reasonably suspected that the appellant was in
possession of a weapon” (para. 15 (emphasis added)).  

[79]                         
Fourth, the logical consequences of a reasonable
and probable grounds standard in the context of Mann make little sense. 
Had the officer possessed reasonable grounds to believe that the accused in Mann
was armed and dangerous, he could have arrested him.  See, e.g., Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , s. 88  (possession of a weapon for a purpose
dangerous to the public peace).  In other words, if Mann required
reasonable and probable grounds for a pat-down search, it would seem all that Mann
achieves is a power to search when there are already grounds to arrest. 
See also Stribopoulos, at p. 311.  Manifestly, this is an anomalous result.  

[80]                         
An officer who has reasonable grounds to believe
an individual is armed and dangerous will always have an immediate need to
assert control over that person.  That need will inevitably entail arresting
the individual, and, as soon as it is safe to do so, subjecting that person to
a search incident to arrest, predicated on a lower standard (see R. v.
Caslake, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 51, at para. 25).  Indeed, it defies common sense
to suggest that an officer confronted with an individual who is reasonably
believed to be armed and dangerous would forgo the lawful option of arresting
the individual in favour of a mere pat-down search.  Notably, a search incident
to arrest is far more intrusive than the minimally intrusive search recognized
under Mann.  A search incident to arrest would include a search
of the person, but could also include a search of his or her belongings or
automobile (see Caslake, at para. 15). 

[81]                         
Against that background, it is worth recalling
that each time this Court has asked itself whether it should recognize a new
common law police power, it has been “because of perceived gaps in the
law” (Kang-Brown, at para. 6, per LeBel J. (emphasis
added)).  The identification of such gaps has quite rightly been a prerequisite
to doing so given this Court’s reluctance to take upon itself the task of
creating new police powers under the common law.  We fail to understand then
why the Court in Mann would recognize a protective search power on a
standard that renders the power unnecessary.  Put simply, on the majority’s
interpretation, Mann fills no gap.  With respect, that result
cannot be what Mann intended.  

[82]                         
Fifth, and turning to the facts of this case, the majority’s conclusion that Sgt. Boyd
had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that Mr. MacDonald was armed and
dangerous does not conform with the evidence.  Of greater concern, the
majority’s approach appears to appreciably lower the standard for what
constitutes reasonable and probable grounds. 

[83]                         
To be sure, on the
facts as found by the trial judge, Sgt. Boyd’s suspicion that Mr.
MacDonald was armed and dangerous was reasonable.  The
context of the encounter with him indicates a degree of hostility toward the
building staff and police.  To begin, Mr. MacDonald dismissed the building
concierge’s attempts to turn down the music in what the trial judge
diplomatically characterized as an “undiplomatic manner” (trial reasons,
MacDonald’s A.R., at p. 5).  He showed “some evidence of intoxication” (ibid.). 
When Cst. Pierce attended on the scene, Mr. MacDonald “proceeded to shut the
door requiring the constable to remove her foot from the threshold, telling the
constable to fuck off or words to that effect” (p. 6).  The trial judge
accepted that Sgt. Boyd saw a “black and shiny” object in Mr. MacDonald’s hand
(voir dire reasons, MacDonald’s A.R., at p. 248).  Significantly, “[i]t
was concealed behind [his] right leg” (ibid.).  Moreover, Sgt.
Boyd thought “it might be a knife” (p. 249).  In these circumstances, Sgt. Boyd
had reason to suspect that Mr. MacDonald, who had been acting in a hostile and
aggressive fashion, was armed and dangerous — but he surely did not have
reasonable grounds to believe that he was armed and dangerous.  

[84]                         
Our colleagues do not give effect to the
officer’s clear evidence and find instead that Sgt. Boyd had reasonable grounds
to believe that Mr. MacDonald was armed and dangerous.  With respect, we
cannot accept this conclusion.  This is the first time such a finding has been
made.  The trial judge made no such finding, nor did any justice of the Court
of Appeal reach this conclusion.  Second, no party before this Court advances
such a claim.  Indeed, the Crown submits that a reasonable and probable
grounds standard is “completely unrealistic” in this context (R.F., at para.
46).

[85]                         
Overstating Sgt. Boyd’s evidence is not just
inconsistent with the evidence in this case; it also significantly lowers the
reasonable grounds to believe threshold by eliminating the subjective
requirement that the standard demands (R. v. Storrey, [1990] 1 S.C.R.
241, at pp. 250-51).  The law is clear that an officer must subjectively believe
he has reasonable and probable grounds; it is not enough that he objectively
did.  In this case, however, Sgt. Boyd’s testimony of his “concern” that Mr.
MacDonald “might” have had a weapon does not fit with the majority’s conclusion
that Sgt. Boyd himself believed he had reasonable and probable grounds.  Sgt.
Boyd believed in a possibility, not a probability.[1]  In other words, he
subjectively suspected that Mr. MacDonald had a weapon, and this
suspicion was objectively reasonable.  

[86]                         
These five reasons — the language of Mann,
the history from which Mann emerged, the logical consequences of
interpreting Mann as requiring reasonable grounds to believe, the
jurisprudence that has interpreted Mann, and the facts of this case —
all lead to the same unavoidable conclusion:  Mann recognized a
protective search power predicated on reasonable suspicion.  

[87]                         
This case could have been — and ought to have
been — resolved by extending the logic of Mann.  First, Sgt. Boyd, while
lawfully engaged in his duties, had a reasonable suspicion that Mr. MacDonald
was armed and dangerous.  Second, in response to that reasonable suspicion,
Sgt. Boyd’s conduct — pushing Mr. MacDonald’s door open a few more inches — was
“no more intrusive of liberty interests than [was] reasonably necessary to
address the risk” (Aucoin, at para. 36, quoting Clayton, at para.
31).  Accordingly, the search was reasonable for purposes of s. 8 .

[88]                         
It must be stressed that in cases such as the
one at hand, the “Mann standard” for protective searches, as properly
understood, does not empower an officer to engage in random searches based on a
whim or a hunch.  Rather, the officer’s suspicion that the individual is armed
and dangerous must be reasonable having regard to the totality of the
circumstances.  As this Court said recently in Chehil, the belief must
be derived from “objectively discernible facts, which can then be subjected to
independent judicial scrutiny” (para. 26). 

[89]                         
Nor is the proposition of a reasonable suspicion
standard — even where it authorizes entry into a home — unfaithful to the Charter . 
Though Hunter established a presumption of reasonable and probable
grounds, Dickson J. (as he then was) was careful to observe that in some
circumstances “the relevant standard might well be a different one” (p. 168). 
That is to say, the purpose of a search matters.  While the general rule is
that a warrant secured on reasonable and probable grounds is required for entry
into a home to effect an arrest (R. v. Feeney, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 13), the Criminal
Code  provides for warrantless entry in “exigent circumstances” where there
are “reasonable grounds to suspect that entry into the dwelling-house is
necessary to prevent imminent bodily harm or death to any person” (see, e.g.,
ss. 487.11  and 529.3(2) ).  Moreover, this Court has recognized that warrantless
entry into a home is authorized by a 911 distress call, as it reveals a
potential threat to life (see R. v. Godoy, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 311). 
Similarly, in R. v. Golub (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 743, leave to appeal
refused, [1998] 1 S.C.R. ix, the Ontario Court of Appeal recognized a power to
search a home without a warrant incidental to arrest on the basis of “a
reasonable suspicion” that a threat to safety existed (pp. 758-59).

[90]                         
In the end, this case illustrates the danger of
leaving police powers to be developed in a piecemeal fashion by the courts. 
Today, our colleagues impose a standard requiring that an officer have
reasonable grounds to believe an individual is armed and dangerous before a
“safety search” is authorized, effectively overturning the search power
recognized in Mann and a decade of subsequent jurisprudence in the
process.  

[91]                         
We should be clear about the consequences of the
majority’s decision:  officers are deprived of the ability to conduct protective
searches except in circumstances where they already have grounds to arrest.  As
of today, officers are empowered to detain individuals they suspect are
armed and dangerous for investigatory purposes, but they have no power to
conduct pat-down searches to ensure their safety or the safety of the public as
they conduct these investigations.  In our view, a police officer in the field,
faced with a realistic risk of imminent harm, should be able to act immediately
and take reasonable steps, in the form of a minimally intrusive safety search,
to alleviate the risk. 

[92]                         
Subject to this disagreement with the majority,
we join the balance of Justice LeBel’s reasons and would dispose of the case as
he proposes.

from a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal (O’Connor A.C.J. and MacPherson

                    The judgment
of the Court was delivered orally by 

[1]               Moldaver J. — The sole issue in this appeal is whether the appellant’s trial
counsel provided him with ineffective assistance, thereby resulting in a
miscarriage of justice.  The appellant challenges the competence of his trial
counsel on a number of grounds, the most serious being that she prevented him
from testifying at trial.

[2]               The Court of Appeal
rejected the appellant’s submissions (2012 ONCA 776 (CanLII)).  While the court
did not specifically address all of the appellant’s many, and continually
growing list of ineffective assistance claims, it found that they either lacked
an evidentiary foundation or did not result in prejudice.  In so concluding,
the court carefully considered the record at trial, along with the fresh
evidence filed on the appeal, and applied the correct legal principles.  It
made findings of fact based on this record.  In making these findings, the
Court of Appeal acted as a court of first instance.  Its findings, like those
of a trial judge, are entitled to deference (see R. v. Yumnu, 2012 SCC
73, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 777, at para. 17).

[3]               The Court of
Appeal’s findings are supported by the record.  Contrary to the appellant’s
submissions, the court found that he had agreed with counsel that he would not
testify.  The court also rejected the appellant’s argument that trial counsel
had acted incompetently by failing to prepare him to testify.  The court noted
that the appellant could have been granted an adjournment had there been any
suggestion he wanted to testify, and that extensive preparation was
unnecessary.  Moreover, the court found that trial counsel had not acted
ineffectively in failing to call the father of one of the complainants as a
witness because there was no evidence before the court, other than the
appellant’s assertion, indicating what this witness would say or how he could
be located.  Finally, the Court of Appeal found that while counsel’s
cross-examination of one of the complainants was “perhaps not stellar” (at
para. 24), it did not fall outside the realm of reasonable professional
assistance.

[4]               In
sum, we see no error in the Court of Appeal’s analysis or conclusion.  For
these reasons, we would dismiss the appeal.

on appeal from the court
of appeal for alberta

                    Criminal law — Appeals — Powers of Court of Appeal —
Accused charged with possession of cocaine and possession of currency obtained
by crime — Court of Appeal raising new issues on appeal — Whether appeal court
erred in ordering new trial on basis of improper cross-examination — Whether
appeal court erred in raising new issue on appeal.

                    Constitutional
law — Charter of Rights  — Right to be informed of reasons for arrest — Right to
counsel — Accused charged with possession of cocaine and possession of currency
obtained by crime — Police delaying in advising accused of reasons for arrest
and of his rights to retain and instruct counsel — Whether trial judge erred in
law in concluding that police infringed accused’s right to be informed of
reasons for arrest and his right to counsel — Whether trial judge erred in law
in excluding evidence — Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , ss. 10 , 24(2) .

                    The
accused was charged with possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking
and possession of currency obtained by the commission of an offence.  The trial
judge determined that the accused’s rights under s. 10 (a) and (b)
of the Charter  were breached because the constables waited 22 minutes to
inform him of the reasons for his arrest and an extra 2 to 5 minutes to inform
him of his right to retain and instruct counsel.  The trial judge noted that
defence counsel cross-examined the detective who instructed constables to
arrest and search the accused.  During this cross-examination, defence counsel
confronted the detective about the testimony of another Crown witness, which
differed from the detective’s concerning the grounds to arrest and search the
accused.  Ultimately, all evidence was excluded and the accused was acquitted. 
The Crown appealed.  After the Crown and defence counsel filed their written
submissions, the Court of Appeal provided the parties with a list of cases and
called their attention to two issues for comment during oral argument:  (1) what
is a question of law on an appeal from an acquittal; and (2) the limits of
cross-examination and consequences of exceeding the limits.  During the oral
hearing, both counsel made submissions on whether the defence had conducted an
improper examination of the detective by asking him to comment on the veracity
of another officer’s testimony.  The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on the
basis that the trial judge erred in law by relying on the impermissible cross-examination
of the police detective.  The acquittals were set aside and a new trial
ordered.

                    Held:  The appeal should be allowed and the acquittals
restored.

                    An
appellate court has the jurisdiction to raise new issues and invite submissions
on an issue neither party has raised.  An issue is new when it raises a new
basis for potentially finding error in the decision under appeal beyond the
grounds of appeal as framed by the parties.  Issues that are rooted in or are
components of an existing issue are not new issues nor are issues that form the
backdrop of appellate litigation.  Furthermore, not all questions asked by an
appeal court will constitute a new issue.  Questions raised during the oral
hearing may properly touch on a broad range of issues, which may be components
of the grounds of appeal put forward by the parties, or may go outside of those
grounds in an aim to understand the context, statutory background or larger
implications.  Absent any concerns about bias, questions raised during the oral
hearing, whether linked directly or by extension to the grounds of appeal or
not, are not improper. 

                    While
appellate courts have the discretion to raise a new issue, this discretion
should be exercised only in rare circumstances.  An appellate court should only
raise a new issue when failing to do so would risk an injustice.  At all times
the discretion is limited by the requirement that raising the new issue cannot
suggest bias or partiality on the part of the court.  Courts cannot be seen to
go in search of a wrong to right.  Where there is good reason to believe that
the result would realistically have differed had the error not been made, this
risk of injustice warrants the court of appeal’s intervention.  The standard of
“good reason to believe” that a failure to raise a new issue “would risk an
injustice” is a significant threshold which is necessary in this context in
order to strike an appropriate balance between the role of appellate courts as
independent and impartial arbiters with the need to ensure that justice is
done.  In order to raise a new issue, the court should also consider whether it
has the jurisdiction to consider the issue, whether there is a sufficient
record on which to raise the issue and whether raising the issue would result
in procedural prejudice to any party.

                    When
an appellate court raises a new issue, there must be notification and
opportunity to respond.  The court of appeal must make the parties aware that
it has discerned a potential issue and ensure that they are sufficiently
informed so they may prepare and respond.  Requiring that strict procedural
standards be followed would fail to recognize that the issue may arise in
different circumstances in different cases.  The court should raise the issue
as soon as is practically possible after the issue crystallizes so as to avoid
any undue delay in the proceedings.  However, notification of the new issue may
occur before the oral hearing, or the issue may be raised during the oral
hearing.  The notification should not contain too much detail, or indicate that
the court of appeal has already formed an opinion, however it must contain
enough information to allow the parties to respond to the new issue.  The
requirements for the response will depend on the particular issue raised by the
court.  Counsel may wish to simply address the issue orally, file further
written argument, or both.  The underlying concern should be ensuring that the
court receives full submissions on the issue.  If a party asks to file written
submissions before or after the oral hearing, there should be a presumption in
favour of granting the request.  Recusal of a judge or panel should be rare and
should be governed by the overriding consideration of whether the new issue or
the way in which it was raised could lead to a reasonable apprehension of bias.

                    In
this case, the Court of Appeal erred in raising the new issue of improper cross-examination. 
The impugned question on cross-examination did not impact the trial judge’s
decision.  The error was not material and the result would not have been
different had the trial judge not allowed the impugned cross-examination.  Even
if the trial judge had relied on the impugned question, it had no material
bearing on the outcome so as to raise a realistic risk of an injustice.  It is
also significant that the improper question was put to a Crown witness, rather
than the accused.  Furthermore, the Crown neither objected to the impermissible
question nor raised it as an issue on appeal which suggests that the question
did not have a serious effect on the outcome of the voir dire.  As not
raising the issue of the impugned cross-examination would not have risked an
injustice, it follows that the Court of Appeal erred in raising the issue.

                    There
is also no basis to overturn the trial judge’s conclusion that the accused’s s.
10  Charter  rights were breached.  The trial judge found as a fact that
there was insufficient evidence to support the assertion that immediate
compliance with s. 10  of the Charter  would have compromised the ongoing
investigation.  As Crown appeals from acquittals are restricted to questions of
law, findings of fact can only be undermined in limited situations, not
applicable in this case.  There were no exceptional circumstances to justify
the delay by the police in complying with their s. 10  informational duties and
therefore no reason to disturb the trial judge’s conclusion that s. 10 (a)
and (b) of the Charter  were infringed.  Furthermore, in view of
the deferential standard of review on appeal and because the Crown’s arguments
with respect to the trial judge’s s. 24(2)  findings amount to an attack on the trial
judge’s findings of fact, the trial judge’s order to exclude the evidence under
s. 24(2)  of the Charter  should also not be interfered with.

judgment of the Court was delivered by

                    Rothstein J. — 

I.             
Overview

[1]                             
The primary question on this appeal centres on
the issue of an appellate court’s ability to raise new grounds of appeal and
the considerations which should guide the court in doing so. At the heart of
this appeal are two potentially competing tensions: (1) the adversarial system,
which relies on the parties to frame the issues on appeal, and reserves the
role of neutral arbiter for the courts; and (2) the need for an appellate court
to intervene in order to prevent an injustice. The question on this appeal is
at what point can an appellate court disrupt the adversarial system and raise a
ground of appeal of its own? 

[2]                             
This appeal arose in the context of a voir
dire to exclude evidence. The secondary issue therefore concerns the trial
judge’s findings with respect to infringements under s. 10 (a) and (b)
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and the exclusion
of evidence under s. 24(2) .

II.          
Facts

A.          
The Chelmick Investigation

[3]                             
This case began with an investigation by the
Edmonton Police Service into a number of homicides and attempted homicides in
the city of Edmonton. Under the leadership of Detective Werth (then Constable
Werth), the investigation team obtained a wiretap authorization allowing them
to intercept the private communications of one of their principal targets,
Robin Flynn Chelmick. 

[4]                             
Between the night of January 5, 2009 and the
afternoon of January 6, 2009, the police intercepted calls from Chelmick’s line
related to a drug transaction for the purchase of a half a kilogram of cocaine.
Chelmick was acting as the middle man for an unidentified supplier for a
transaction scheduled to occur at 4:30 p.m. at Duke’s Bar and Grill. 

[5]                             
Visual surveillance of Chelmick on January 6,
2009 revealed interactions between Chelmick and the driver of a rented grey
Chevrolet Malibu in the parking lot of Duke’s Bar. The driver of the Malibu was
believed by Detective Werth to be the supplier of the cocaine. The driver was
later identified as the appellant, Mohammad Mian.

[6]                             
Three separate meetings took place between
Chelmick and the driver of the Malibu. Intercepted communications revealed that
the buyer of the cocaine was dissatisfied with the quality of the first
delivery of cocaine. After the third meeting which took place in the parking
lot of Duke’s Bar, the Malibu drove away and headed south. 

B.           
The Arrest and Search

[7]                             
While the surveillance of Chelmick was ongoing,
Detective Werth contacted two officers not connected with the homicide
investigation, Constables McGill and Dalziel. At a meeting at police
headquarters, Detective Werth advised Constables McGill and Dalziel that
surveillance was in place with respect to an individual involved in a drug
transaction who was believed to have drugs in his vehicle. Constables McGill
and Dalziel were provided with a surveillance radio so that they could listen
to surveillance reports and Detective Werth advised that at some point he would
instruct them to stop the target vehicle, the grey Chevrolet Malibu.

[8]                             
Constables McGill and Dalziel were instructed by
Detective Werth to make a routine traffic stop of the Malibu. Detective Werth
instructed Constables McGill and Dalziel that, once they were instructed to
stop the vehicle, they were to use every effort to find appropriate grounds to
search the Malibu without having to rely on the information provided by
Detective Werth so that the ongoing homicide investigation would not be
compromised. Nonetheless, the constables were told that there were already
grounds to arrest the driver which could be relied upon if other grounds could
not be found. 

[9]                             
After the meeting with Detective Werth,
Constables McGill and Dalziel went to the area of Duke’s Bar. As the Malibu
left Duke’s, it was followed by a surveillance vehicle, with Constables McGill
and Dalziel following behind in a police vehicle. At Detective Werth’s
instructions, at approximately 7:40 p.m. the overhead lights of the police
vehicle were activated and the Malibu was pulled over to the side of the road
with the police vehicle stopped about 40 feet behind. When the constables
approached the Malibu, Constable McGill recognized the driver as Mohammad Mian
from prior dealings with the police. 

[10]                         
As the pretence of the routine traffic stop was
underway, Detective Werth listened to reports from Constable Drynan, a member
of the surveillance team, who reported his observations that the driver of the
Malibu was reaching over the front passenger seat area and doing something with
his hands. At the voir dire, Constable McGill testified that he also
noticed Mr. Mian reaching in this way and that he had officer safety concerns
when he saw this. After hearing the reports from Constable Drynan, Detective
Werth then telephoned Constable Dalziel and informed Constable Dalziel that Mr.
Mian was reaching under the seats of the vehicle and that the officers should
go to the vehicle, remove Mr. Mian and arrest him. 

[11]                         
Constables McGill and Dalziel removed Mr. Mian
from the vehicle. Mr. Mian had a cell phone in his hand, which Constable McGill
removed. A pat-down search of Mr. Mian revealed $2,710 in cash on his person.
After Mr. Mian was placed in the back of the police vehicle, searches of the
Malibu led to the discovery of a large amount of cocaine and a smaller baggie
of cocaine, an additional $1,340 in cash, another cell phone and Mr. Mian’s
wallet.  Following the searches, a call was made for a tow truck to attend and
seize the Malibu.

[12]                         
Twenty-two minutes passed between the time when
the officers pulled over the Malibu and when Mr. Mian was advised that he was
being arrested for the possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. A
further two to five minutes passed before Mr. Mian was advised of his Charter 
rights to retain and instruct counsel. 

[13]                         
Mr. Mian was charged with possession of cocaine
for the purpose of trafficking and possession of currency obtained by the
commission of an offence. He applied to exclude all evidence on the basis that
he was arbitrarily detained and arrested by the police contrary to s. 9  of the Charter ,
that the police performed an unreasonable search and seizure contrary to s. 8 ,
and that the police failed to advise Mr. Mian of the reason for his detention
and his right to counsel contrary to s. 10 (a) and (b). Mr. Mian
asserted that the admission of the evidence seized would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute and should therefore be excluded
pursuant to s. 24(2)  of the Charter . 

III.       
Judicial History

A.          
Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench, 2011 ABQB 290,
516 A.R. 368

[14]                         
In his decision on the Charter voir dire to
exclude the evidence, Macklin J. found Constable Drynan to be a credible
witness and accepted his evidence that he did not indicate a concern about
officer safety, but simply reported his observations to the investigative team.


[15]                         
Macklin J. did not accept the evidence of either
Detective Werth or Constable McGill that there was a concern for officer safety
in the context of the search, detention or arrest caused by Mr. Mian reaching
under the seat of the Malibu. He found that Detective Werth gave his evidence
in a “very cavalier fashion and in a manner intended to justify a direction he
gave for the purpose of providing McGill and Dalziel with grounds to search the
Malibu while disguising the true purpose for stopping and searching the vehicle
in the first place” (para. 68). Macklin J. held that Detective Werth was
“intentionally misleading the Court with a view to justifying his instructions
to Dalziel” (para. 68). Macklin J. noted that when defence counsel confronted
Detective Werth about Constable Drynan’s testimony with respect to Mr. Mian’s
movements in the vehicle, Detective Werth responded that he did not care what
Constable Drynan said and that Constable Drynan was mistaken. 

[16]                         
However, although Macklin J. did not accept that
officer safety concerns could be relied on as grounds for Mr. Mian’s search and
arrest, he did find that there were other valid grounds based on Detective
Werth’s belief that the Malibu contained a significant quantity of cocaine. 

[17]                         
After determining that Mr. Mian’s ss. 8  and 9  Charter 
rights had not been breached in the course of the search and arrest,
Macklin J. turned to whether Mr. Mian’s s. 10 (a) Charter  right on
detention to be informed promptly of the reasons therefor and s. 10 (b)
right on arrest or detention to be informed of his right to retain and instruct
counsel without delay had been breached. Macklin J. noted that there must be
exceptional circumstances to justify suspending the rights protected under s. 10 (a)
and (b). There was no satisfactory reason for not advising Mr. Mian of
these rights immediately upon arrest. Macklin J. held that, in waiting 22
minutes to inform Mr. Mian of the reason for his arrest and his right to retain
and instruct counsel, Constables Dalziel and McGill breached Mr. Mian’s rights
under s. 10 (a) and (b). 

[18]                         
Macklin J. then went on to consider whether the
evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter  pursuant to
the analysis as set out by this Court in R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32,
[2009] 2 S.C.R. 353. Under the first Grant factor, Macklin J. found that
the breaches were serious and deliberate, and thereby egregious. This factor
weighed in favour of excluding the evidence. Under the second factor, Macklin
J. held that there was a lack of causal connection between the Charter 
breaches and the obtaining of the evidence. As such, the breaches did not have
a significant impact on Mr. Mian’s privacy interests, which weighed in favour
of inclusion of the evidence. Finally, under the third Grant factor,
Macklin J. determined that, while the offence was serious and the evidence
highly reliable and probative, the Charter  breaches were also serious.
In addition, Detective Werth’s and Constable McGill’s continued reliance on
alleged officer safety concerns was an attempt to undermine the truth-seeking
function of the criminal trial process. Constable McGill’s questioning of Mr. Mian
in the back of the police vehicle prior to Mr. Mian being advised of the reason
for his detention and arrest was a further aggravating factor.  Macklin J. concluded
that this factor favoured excluding the evidence. 

[19]                         
Ultimately, Macklin J. held that, on balance,
the Grant factors favoured exclusion of the evidence. 

[20]                         
Mr. Mian was acquitted.

B.           
Alberta Court of Appeal, 2012 ABCA 302, 536 A.R.
308

[21]                         
The Crown appealed Mr. Mian’s acquittal,
advancing two grounds of appeal: (1) that “[t]he trial judge erred in law by
failing to find [that] exceptional circumstances justified the suspension of
[Mr. Mian’s] s. 10  Charter  rights”; and (2) that “[t]he trial judge
erred in law by excluding ‘essential and reliable evidence on account of Charter 
violations that had no causal connection with the discovery of the evidence,
were not otherwise egregious, and had no significant impact on Mr. Mian’s Charter -protected
interests’” (C.A. reasons, para. 27).

[22]                         
After the Crown and defence counsel filed their
written submissions, the Court of Appeal provided the parties with a list of
cases and called their attention to two issues for comment during oral
argument: (1) what is a question of law on an appeal from an acquittal; and (2)
the limits of cross-examination and consequences of exceeding the limits.

[23]                         
During the oral hearing, both counsel made
submissions on whether the defence had conducted an improper cross-examination
of Detective Werth by asking him to comment on the veracity of Constable
Drynan’s testimony. Following the hearing, defence counsel asked to file
further written submissions on the improper cross-examination issue. The Court
of Appeal allowed this request, and both parties submitted supplemental written
submissions in accordance with the timelines set out by the court. Defence
counsel was required to file written submissions before the Crown. 

[24]                         
The Court of Appeal held that a review of a
trial judge’s decision under s. 24(2)  of the Charter  requires deference
and is generally subject to a standard of palpable and overriding error.
However, the Court of Appeal was satisfied that the appeal should be allowed
“on the basis that the trial judge erred in law by relying on the impermissible
cross-examination of Detective Werth” (para. 32).

[25]                         
The impugned cross-examination occurred when
Detective Werth was questioned about the veracity of evidence given by Constable
Drynan:

Q.  All right. Now, I know you set out - - I’m going to use your
words, I don’t care what Drynan said about - - about the vehicle. I’m going to
tell you now what Drynan said. Okay? Under oath in these proceedings. Is that
he never - - never communication to anyone, anyone, to go and arrest the
subject of the roadside stop as a result of those observations that - - that
is, the reaching under the seat. I’m going to tell you he took it further, and
he said under oath that he never told or communicated to anyone to go and
extract the person from the motor vehicle at the roadside. He never told anyone
to do anything as a result of his observations.

 

A. 
I don’t agree with that. You just suggested to me that he didn’t tell me. My
evidence is that he did tell me, and I will not change that. I don’t care what
he said. I know what happened.

 

Q. So Drynan is . . . is he wrong, or is he lying?

 

A.  I think possibly he forgot.

 

Q.  So you don’t care what he says. He called you.

 

A. 
I’ll go back to my evidence, because I remember it quite clearly. I said one of
the members of surveillance - - and I still believe that it was Drynan. I still
believe that. If he can’t remember it, that’s fair. But you can tell me what he
said and what I said, but don’t tell me he didn’t say it because you weren’t
there.

 

(C.A.
reasons, at para. 33, quoting from trial transcript (emphasis added by Court of
Appeal).)

[26]                         
On appeal, defence counsel conceded that this
questioning was impermissible and offended the rule against cross-examining on
the veracity of another witness. The Court of Appeal found that the trial judge
erred in law by admitting and considering irrelevant and inadmissible evidence.
In particular, the Court of Appeal held that, in rejecting Detective Werth’s
testimony, the trial judge appeared to have relied upon the impugned
cross-examination. This resulted in a failure by the trial judge to give due
consideration to all the evidence relevant to the s. 24(2)  issue. The Court of
Appeal concluded that the trial judge’s mistake was material and that the
verdict would not necessarily have been the same if the trial judge had not
allowed the impugned cross-examination and admitted the evidence. The Court of
Appeal ordered a new trial on this basis. The Court of Appeal did not analyze
the grounds of appeal advanced by the Crown.

IV.       
Issues

[27]                         
This appeal raises the following issues:

(1)              
Did the Alberta Court of Appeal err in raising a
new ground of appeal? 

(2)              
Did the Alberta Court of Appeal err in ordering
a new trial on the basis of the improper cross-examination issue?

(3)              
Did the trial judge err in law in concluding
that the police infringed the rights of the accused under s. 10 (a) and (b)
of the Charter ?

(4)              
Did the trial judge err in law in excluding the
evidence under s. 24(2)  of the Charter ?

V.          
Analysis

A.          
When Can an Appellate Court Raise a New Issue?

[28]                         
It is not disputed that an appellate court has
the jurisdiction to invite submissions on an issue neither party has raised.
This appeal raises the questions of how broad this jurisdiction is, when it
should be exercised, and what procedures should be followed when it is invoked.


(1)        
What Is a “New Issue”?

[29]                         
This case turns on whether and how an appellate
court can raise a new issue on appeal. It is therefore important to first
define what a “new issue” is. 

[30]                         
An issue is new when it raises a new basis for
potentially finding error in the decision under appeal beyond the grounds of
appeal as framed by the parties. Genuinely new issues are legally and factually
distinct from the grounds of appeal raised by the parties (see Quan v.
Cusson, 2009 SCC 62, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 712, at para. 39) and cannot
reasonably be said to stem from the issues as framed by the parties. It follows
from this definition that a new issue will require notifying the parties in
advance so that they are able to address it adequately.

[31]                         
In defining what a new issue is, it is important
to recognize what will not constitute a new issue raised on appeal. First, not
all questions asked by an appeal court will constitute a new issue. The
jurisdiction of appellate courts to ask questions during the oral hearing is
well established. This jurisdiction is broad and is limited only by the
requirement that questions not be “raised in a manner which suggests bias or
partiality on the part of the appeal court” (R. v. W. (G.), [1999] 3
S.C.R. 597, at para. 17, per Lamer C.J.). Nothing in these reasons
should be construed as limiting the ability of appellate judges to ask any
question in the course of the oral hearing. 

[32]                         
 Questions raised during the oral hearing may
properly touch on a broad range of issues, which may be components of the
grounds of appeal put forward by the parties, or may go outside of those
grounds in an aim to understand the context, statutory background or larger
implications. For example, an appellate court may pose questions as to the
practical workings of a statutory regime. Absent any concerns about bias,
questions raised during the oral hearing, whether linked directly or by
extension to the grounds of appeal or not, are not improper (see W. (G.),
at para. 17). Such questions may be necessary for the court to gain a more
complete understanding of the issues at hand. 

[33]                         
Second, issues that are rooted in or are
components of an existing issue are also not “new issues”. Appellate courts may
draw counsel’s attention to issues that must be addressed in order to properly
analyze the issues raised by the parties. For example, in a case involving a
claim of self-defence, the parties may argue exclusively over whether the
accused’s belief that his life was in danger was reasonable, but it may be
necessary for the court to first analyze the issue of whether the accused
subjectively believed that he was at risk of death. This is not a “new issue”,
but a component of the overall analysis of the grounds as raised by the
parties. However, where appropriate, the court may have to be prepared to grant
even a brief adjournment to allow the parties to consider and canvass the
issue. 

[34]                         
Finally, issues that form the backdrop of
appellate litigation, such as jurisdiction, whether a given error requires a
remedy and what the appropriate remedy is, or as discussed below, the standard
of review, are not new issues and parties should not require notice to address
them. 

[35]                         
In summary, an appellate court will be found to
have raised a new issue when the issue was not raised by the parties, cannot
reasonably be said to stem from the issues as framed by the parties, and
therefore would require that the parties be given notice of the issue in order to
make informed submissions. Issues that form the backdrop of appellate
litigation will typically not be “new issues” under this definition. Exercising
the jurisdiction to ask questions during the oral hearing will not constitute
raising a new issue, unless, in doing so, the appellate court provides a new
basis for reviewing the decision under appeal for error. 

(2)        
What Considerations Should Guide an Appellate
Court in Determining Whether to Raise a New Issue on Appeal?

[36]                         
The parties do not dispute that appellate courts
have the jurisdiction to raise new issues. Indeed, this jurisdiction is an
extension of the power of appellate courts to ask questions of the parties (see
W. (G.), at para. 17). The issue on this appeal is not whether appellate
courts can raise new issues, but when and in what circumstances will it be
appropriate for an appellate court to do so.  

[37]                         
There are two potentially competing
considerations at the heart of the issue in this case. First, the adversarial
system, which is a fundamental tenet of our legal system. Second, the role of
the courts to ensure that justice is done. 

[38]                         
Our adversarial system of determining legal
disputes is a procedural system “involving active and unhindered parties
contesting with each other to put forth a case before an independent
decision-maker” (Black’s Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009), sub verbo “adversary
system”). An important component of this system is the principle of party
presentation, under which courts “rely on the parties to frame the issues for
decision and assign to courts the role of neutral arbiter of matters the
parties present” (Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U.S. 237 (2008), at p. 243,
per Ginsburg J.).

[39]                         
A fundamental reason for maintaining this system
is to ensure that judicial decision-makers remain independent and impartial and
are seen to remain independent and impartial. When a judge or appellate panel
of judges intervenes in a case and departs from the principle of party
presentation, the risk is that the intervention could create an apprehension of
bias. This kind of departure from the usual conduct of an appeal could lead the
court to be seen to be intervening on behalf of one of the parties, thus
impugning the impartiality of the court. As this Court has said, “[it] is of
fundamental importance that justice should not only be done, but should
manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” (Brouillard v. The Queen,
[1985] 1 S.C.R. 39, at p. 43, citing R. v. Sussex Justices, Ex parte
McCarthy, [1924] 1 K.B. 256, at p. 259). It is for this reason that an
important tenet of our appellate system is for the court to respect the
strategic choices made by parties in framing the issues (see W. (G.), at
paras. 17-18).  

[40]                         
On the other hand, courts also have the role of
ensuring that justice is done. As Lord Denning explained in the context of
trial judges in the United Kingdom: “. . . a judge is not a mere
umpire to answer the question ‘How’s that?’ His object above all is to find out
the truth, and to do justice according to law . . .” (Jones
v. National Coal Board, [1957] 2 All E.R. 155 (C.A.), at p. 159 (emphasis
added)). This proposition is no less true of appellate judges. Meaningful
appellate review assesses the correctness of a lower court decision, both on
errors of law and palpable overriding errors of fact (see R. v. Sheppard,
2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, at paras. 25 and 28; and Housen v.
Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at paras. 1 and 4). I accept
the submission of the intervener the Attorney General of Alberta that “for
‘justice in fact to be done,’ judges must sometimes ‘intervene in the
adversarial debate’” (I.F., at para. 16, citing Brouillard, at p. 44). 

[41]                         
The question then is how to strike the
appropriate balance between these competing principles.  Appellate courts
should have the discretion to raise a new issue, but this discretion should be
exercised only in rare circumstances. An appellate court should only raise a
new issue when failing to do so would risk an injustice. The court should also
consider whether there is a sufficient record on which to raise the issue and
whether raising the issue would result in procedural prejudice to any party. 
This test is sufficiently flexible while also providing for an appropriate
level of restraint to address the tensions inherent in the role of an appellate
court. 

[42]                         
At all times this discretion is limited by the
requirement that raising the new issue cannot suggest bias or partiality on the
part of the court. Of essence here is that courts cannot be seen to go in
search of a wrong to right. This jurisdiction should be exercised with caution.
Appellate courts have the discretion to raise a new issue where justice
requires it, but this discretion is restrained in order to maintain the
impartiality of the decision-maker as required by our adversarial system.

(a)         
Whether Failing to Raise the Issue Would Risk an
Injustice

[43]                         
The fundamental consideration for an appellate
court in determining whether to raise a new issue is whether the failure to do
so would risk an injustice. 

[44]                         
There are some situations where the potential
for injustice will be more self-evident. As Mr. Song, counsel for Mr. Mian
submits, there are a number of situations where it will be appropriate for an
appellate court to raise an issue in order to prevent or rectify an injustice.
Indeed, the parties to this appeal agree that appellate courts can intervene to
assist self-represented litigants to ensure that the proceedings are fair (see W.
(G.), at para. 18), although this assistance has neutrality-based
limits and a judge “must exercise great care not to descend from the bench and
become a spectre at the accused’s counsel table, placing himself ‘in the
impossible position of being both advocate and impartial arbiter’” (R. v.
Phillips, 2003 ABCA 4, 320 A.R. 172, at para. 24, per Fruman J.A.,
aff’d 2003 SCC 57, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 623, citing R. v. Taubler (1987), 20
O.A.C. 64, at para. 30). In the criminal context, other examples may include
where a miscarriage of justice may have occurred (see R. v. E.M.W., 2011
SCC 31, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 542, at paras. 4-5) or where a verdict or sentence
appears to be clearly unreasonable (see W. (G.), at para. 19). It should be noted, however, that while these
examples generally apply, they are inapplicable to this case, which was a Crown
appeal from an acquittal.

[45]                         
However, attempting to precisely define the
situations which “would risk an injustice” would unduly limit the ability of
appellate courts to intervene to ensure that justice is in fact done. Where
there is good reason to believe that the result would realistically have
differed had the error not been made, this risk of injustice warrants the court
of appeal’s intervention.  

[46]                         
The determination of whether there is good
reason to believe that a failure to raise a new issue “would risk an
injustice” requires performing a preliminary assessment of the issue. The
standard of “good reason to believe” that a failure to raise a new issue “would
risk an injustice” is a significant threshold which is necessary in this
context in order to strike an appropriate balance between the role of appellate
courts as independent and impartial arbiters with the need to ensure that
justice is done.  

[47]                         
At this stage, the merits of the issue will not
yet have been argued or decided. As such, the assessment of the issue is not a
“full-fledged review”, but rather is preliminary (W. (G.), at para. 20).
In all cases where an appellate court is considering whether to raise a new
issue, it would be inappropriate for the court to engage in any in-depth
assessment of the merits of an issue at a stage where the parties remain
ignorant of the issue.  However, a court’s failure to raise a new issue will
not risk an injustice in the absence of a preliminary indication that there is
good reason to believe that an identified potential error would have affected
the result. 

[48]                         
It is likely that issues identified by appellate
courts will often fail to meet this “risk an injustice” factor. This will
particularly be so where both parties are represented by counsel. It will only
be in rare cases that counsel on both sides will have failed to identify an
issue that would realistically have affected the result.

(b)        
Other Considerations

[49]                         
Although consideration of whether the failure to
raise a new issue in a given case would risk an injustice is left to the discretion
of appellate courts, this discretion is not unlimited. 

[50]                         
First, it should go without saying that an
appellate court cannot raise a new issue unless the court has the jurisdiction
to consider the issue. Courts of appeal are statutory bodies and there is no
inherent jurisdiction in any appeal court (see Kourtessis v. M.N.R.,
[1993] 2 S.C.R. 53, at p. 69, per La Forest J.; and W. (G.), at
para. 8). For example, an appellate court’s jurisdiction on Crown appeals from
acquittals is restricted to consideration of questions of law (Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , ss. 676(1) (a) and 686(4) ). If an appellate court
would not have the jurisdiction to consider an issue raised by one of the
parties, then the court cannot raise the issue as a new issue on appeal.

[51]                         
Second, in order to raise a new issue, an
appellate court must be satisfied that there is a sufficient basis in the
record on which to resolve the issue.  “[T]here is always the very real danger
that the appellate record will not contain all of the relevant facts, or the
trial judge’s view on some critical factual issue, or that an explanation that
might have been offered in testimony by a party or one or more of its witnesses
was never elicited” (Performance Industries Ltd. v. Sylvan Lake Golf &
Tennis Club Ltd., 2002 SCC 19, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 678,
at para. 32). The new issue must be “manageable on the evidentiary record”
(para. 33). 

[52]                         
Finally, an appellate court should consider
whether there would be any procedural prejudice to either party. The procedures
which should be followed when an appellate court exercises its discretion to
raise a new issue are detailed further below. At this stage, it suffices to say
that it will often be possible for appellate courts to ensure procedural
fairness by adjusting the course of the appellate process, including granting
an adjournment when an issue is identified at or in advance of a hearing or
providing an opportunity for the parties to file written submissions. However,
if the issue is raised in a way or at a stage that could result in procedural
prejudice to either party, and such prejudice cannot be addressed through
adjustments to the process, the appellate court cannot raise the issue. 

(3)        
What Procedures Should Be Followed When an
Appellate Court Exercises Its Discretion to Raise a New Issue?

[53]                         
The risk of appellate courts appearing biased or
partial will be reduced by the cautious exercise of the discretion to raise new
issues, particularly when coupled with appropriate procedural safeguards.
Requiring such safeguards ensures that there is no unfairness to the parties
and no appearance of judicial partiality.

[54]                         
The Crown submits that when an appellate court
raises a new issue, there must be notification and opportunity to respond. I
agree. With respect to notification, the court of appeal must make the parties
aware that it has discerned a potential issue and ensure that they are
sufficiently informed so they may prepare and respond. It goes without saying
that all parties should be provided with proper notice. With respect to the
response, there is no single model. As the Crown submitted, “the nature of the
judicial issue and its relationship to the issues raised by the parties will
determine whether counsel wishes to file further written argument, address the
issue orally, or both” (R.F., para. 60).

[55]                         
This approach is practical and recognizes that
the appropriate procedure will vary depending on the context and the
circumstances in a given case. For example, appellate courts may become aware
of potential new issues at different points in time throughout the appeal
process, including before, during or after the oral hearing. Requiring that
strict procedural standards be followed would fail to recognize that the issue
may arise in different circumstances in different cases.

[56]                         
In my view, the following guidelines should be
used to assist an appellate court in determining what the appropriate procedure
should be on a case-by-case basis.

[57]                         
First, notification of the new issue may occur before the oral hearing,
or the issue may be raised during the oral hearing. If the issue is raised
during the oral hearing, it may be necessary to grant an adjournment to ensure
a full and fair hearing (E.M.W., at para. 4). If the issue is
raised prior to the oral hearing, the parties may request an adjournment of the
hearing and an extension of the filing deadlines for further written argument. 
At all times, the court should raise the issue as soon as is practically
possible after the issue crystallizes so as to avoid any undue delay in the
proceedings. 

[58]                         
Second, I agree with the submission of the Crown that the notification
should not contain too much detail, or indicate that the court of appeal has
already formed an opinion; however, it must contain enough information to allow
the parties to respond to the new issue. Ultimately, the adequate content of
notice will have to be determined on a case-by-case basis. It will be dependent
on a number of factors, including the complexity of the issue and the
obviousness of the issue on the face of the record.

[59]                         
Finally, I agree with the submission of the
Crown that the requirements for the response will depend on the particular
issue raised by the court. Counsel may wish to simply address the issue orally,
file further written argument, or both. As the Crown in this case says, this
determination is properly in the hands of both the court and the parties. In my
view, the underlying concern should be ensuring that the court receives full
submissions on the new issue. If a party asks to file written submissions before
or after the oral hearing, in my view, there should be a presumption in favour
of granting the request. The overriding consideration is that natural justice
and the rule of audi alteram partem will have to be preserved. Both
sides will have to have their responses considered. 

[60]                         
The intervener the Attorney General of Alberta
argues that, where a new issue is raised, the judge or panel that raised the
new issue should recuse itself and the panel should be reconstituted as
necessary. I cannot agree. Requiring recusal in all cases would be an onerous
procedural requirement that would result in significant delay and would not be
economical for the parties or the courts. Recusal is not necessary in every
case and the need for a new judge or reconstituted panel should be determined
on a case-by-case basis. Recusal should be rare and should be governed by the
overriding consideration of whether the new issue or the way in which it was
raised could lead to a reasonable apprehension of bias. 

(4)        
Did the Court of Appeal Err in Raising a New
Issue in This Case?

[61]                         
In this case, the Court of Appeal raised a new
issue on the question of improper cross-examination. This was a new issue on
appeal because it was not raised by the parties, required notice of the issue
in order to make informed submissions and was a new basis for potentially
finding error in the decision under appeal. The Court of Appeal also invited
comment on whether the grounds of appeal exposed an error of law enabling the
Crown to appeal the acquittal. As Mr. Mian concedes, the question of
jurisdiction was not a new issue because it went to the issue of the appellate
court’s jurisdiction and it was therefore properly raised. As discussed above,
issues of jurisdiction form the backdrop of appellate litigation and will never
constitute a new issue. The Court of Appeal did not comment on the “error of
law” issue in its decision and dealt with the appeal entirely on the basis of
the improper cross-examination issue. 

[62]                         
I conclude that the Court of Appeal erred in
raising the new issue of improper cross-examination. Although appellate courts
have the jurisdiction to raise new issues, the Court of Appeal did not
appropriately raise the issue of improper cross-examination in this case.

[63]                         
The raising of the new issue in this case fails
at the second step: whether failing to raise the new issue would risk an
injustice. I do not agree with the Court of Appeal that the impugned question
on cross-examination impacted the trial judge’s decision. The error was not
material and the result would not have been different had the trial judge not
allowed the impugned cross-examination. The basis for the issue was one
question asked in the course of the cross-examination of Detective Werth. The
impugned exchange comprised two lines in the trial transcript. The question was
not objected to at trial.

[64]                         
First, there is nothing to indicate that the
improper cross-examination factored into the decision-making process at all.
Detective Werth’s answer to the impugned question is not found in the trial
judge’s reasons. The trial judge’s assessment of Detective Werth’s credibility
was based on several factors, including his “very cavalier” demeanour and the
trial judge’s impression that Detective Werth gave his evidence “in a manner
intended to justify a direction he gave for the purpose of providing McGill and
Dalziel with grounds to search the Malibu while disguising the true purpose for
stopping and searching the vehicle in the first place” (para. 68). 

[65]                         
Second, even if the trial judge had relied on
the impugned question, I am not convinced that this had any material bearing on
the outcome so as to raise a realistic risk of an injustice. It is significant
that the improper question was put to a Crown witness, rather than Mr. Mian. As
he argues, this was not a case where an accused was asked to testify before a
jury as to the veracity of another witness’s evidence, thus undermining the
presumption of innocence. It is difficult to see how this single question put
to a Crown witness created a realistic risk of injustice. 

[66]                         
Finally, the question was not objected to at the
time. As the Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in R. v. Kociuk, 2011 MBCA
85, 270 Man. R. (2d) 170, per Chartier J.A. (as he then was):

. . . the fact that experienced
counsel at trial, and on appeal, were of the view that it was not sufficiently
important to warrant an objection at trial or to be a ground on appeal is not
an irrelevant consideration. Not only does it speak to the overall
satisfactoriness of the jury charge on this issue, it also says something about
the gravity of any omissions in the eyes of defence counsel . . . .
[para. 86]

In the present case, the
fact that the Crown neither objected to the impermissible question nor raised
it as an issue on appeal suggests that the question did not have a serious
effect on the outcome of the voir dire. 

[67]                         
As not raising the issue of the impugned
cross-examination would not have risked an injustice, it follows that the Court
of Appeal erred in raising the issue. 

[68]                         
As the Court of Appeal erred in raising the new
issue, it is not necessary to go on to determine whether the procedure it
followed was unfair. However, as Mr. Mian argued the issue of procedural
fairness before this Court, a few comments are warranted. 

[69]                         
Mr. Mian bases his argument on the fact that the
Court of Appeal required Mr. Mian, the respondent in the appeal, to file his
supplementary factum on the new issues before the Crown, the appellant.
Although in the usual course, the appellant will be required to file
submissions first, I am of the view that the procedure adopted by the Court of
Appeal was fair. The parties were notified of the issues in advance of the oral
hearing and the notice called the parties’ attention to the issues and provided
a list of authorities for comment. Both parties had the opportunity to address
the issues and neither sought to adjourn the oral hearing. When counsel for Mr.
Mian requested the opportunity to file written submissions on the issues raised
by the Court of Appeal, the request was granted. Counsel for Mr. Mian did not
complain about the filing requirements set out by the Court of Appeal. 

[70]                         
Having the respondent file submissions first was
unorthodox, particularly in view of the fact that the Crown had the burden to
show a legal error that had a material bearing on the acquittal. I would not
endorse this approach. However, it is difficult to say that prejudice resulted.
The Court of Appeal received full submissions from both parties, both orally
and in writing. The procedure adopted, while not perfect, was fair (see Canada
(Citizenship and Immigration) v. Harkat, 2014 SCC 37, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 33,
at para. 43; and Ruby v. Canada (Solicitor General), 2002 SCC 75, [2002]
4 S.C.R. 3, at para. 46). 

B.           
The Exclusion of Evidence

[71]                         
As the Court of Appeal erred in allowing the
appeal against acquittal and ordering a new trial on the basis of one of the
new issues raised by the court, it must be determined whether there should be a
new trial on the grounds of appeal advanced by the Crown before the Court of
Appeal — namely, that the trial judge erred in finding violations of s. 10 (a)
and (b) of the Charter  and that the trial judge erred in his s.
24(2)  Charter  analysis and ultimate decision to exclude the evidence. 

(1)        
Were Mr. Mian’s Section 10  Rights Breached?

[72]                         
In my view, there is no basis to overturn the
trial judge’s conclusion that Mr. Mian’s s. 10  Charter  rights were
breached.

[73]                         
The Crown argues that the police officers’
22-minute delay in complying with the informational duties under s. 10  of the Charter 
was justified by exceptional circumstances. Specifically, the Crown submits
that a more transparent drug arrest would have compromised the integrity of the
separate ongoing wiretap investigation into gang violence. 

[74]                         
The Crown concedes that to accept this argument
would constitute an extension of the circumstances in which s. 10  rights may be
suspended. As the Crown in this case recognizes, “[n]one of the jurisprudence
has considered the precise situation presented here” (R.F., at para. 81).  I
accept that the jurisprudence does recognize that compliance with the s. 10 (b)
informational rights may be suspended in exceptional circumstances (see R.
v. Manninen, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1233, at p. 1244; and R. v. Strachan,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 980, at pp. 998-99). However, it is not necessary to decide in
this case whether the need to protect the integrity of a separate, ongoing
investigation is an exceptional circumstance which may justify the suspension
of the s. 10 (b) rights. Nor is it necessary to determine whether
exceptional circumstances can delay the implementation of s. 10 (a)
rights. Even if they could, exceptional circumstances do not arise on the facts
as found by the trial judge in this case.  

[75]                         
The trial judge found as a fact that there was
insufficient evidence to support the assertion that immediate compliance with
s. 10  of the Charter  would have compromised the broader investigation.
The trial judge acknowledged that Detective Werth testified that the delay was
due to concerns about compromising the ongoing investigation. However, the
judge went on to find that there was no evidence about why simply advising Mr.
Mian of the reason for his arrest or informing him of his right to counsel
would have frustrated the ongoing investigation of Chelmick and other gang
members. Ultimately, the trial judge found that there was no evidence of a
“real and present danger that the operation would be frustrated or compromised”
(para. 86). The Crown has not established a legal basis for assailing these
factual findings. Crown appeals from acquittals are restricted to questions of
law. Findings of fact can only be undermined in limited situations, not
applicable in this case, where the trial judge’s alleged shortcomings in
assessing the evidence give rise to an error of law (see Criminal Code ,
s. 676(1) (a); and R. v. J.M.H., 2011 SCC 45, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 197,
at paras. 24-39, per Cromwell J.).

[76]                         
Accordingly, there were no exceptional
circumstances to justify the delay by the police in complying with their s. 10 
informational duties. There is no reason to disturb the trial judge’s
conclusion that s. 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter  were
infringed. 

(2)        
Did the Trial Judge Err in Excluding the
Evidence Under Section 24(2)?

[77]                         
It is well established that the determinations
of trial judges as to what would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute having regard to all of the circumstances will be reviewed
deferentially: “Where a trial judge has considered the proper factors and has
not made any unreasonable finding, his or her determination is owed
considerable deference on appellate review” (R. v. Côté, 2011 SCC 46,
[2011] 3 S.C.R. 215, at para. 44, per Cromwell J.). Applying that
standard in this case, there is no basis for overturning the trial judge’s
decision to exclude the evidence under s. 24(2)  of the Charter . Although
the Crown argues that the trial judge committed serious legal errors in his s.
24(2)  analysis, the Crown’s arguments amount to attacks on the trial judge’s
findings of fact and his ultimate assessment under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .
It is significant that this case involved a Crown appeal from an acquittal,
which limits the Crown’s challenge to the decision of the trial judge to
questions of law.

(a)         
The Grant Test for Exclusion of Evidence Under
Section 24(2)

[78]                         
Under s. 24(2) of the Charter , evidence
obtained in a manner that infringed or denied Charter  rights will be
excluded if it is established that, having regard to all of the circumstances,
the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute. In Grant, this Court held that a s. 24(2)  analysis requires
the court to assess and balance the following factors: (1) the seriousness of
the Charter  breach; (2) the impact of the breach on the protected
interests of the accused; and (3) society’s interest in the adjudication of the
case on its merits (para. 71). The trial judge applied this test and, as
detailed below, did not make any unreasonable findings. 

(i)          
The Seriousness of the Charter  Breach

[79]                         
The Crown argues that the seriousness of the
breach was lessened because of the extenuating circumstances of an ongoing
investigation. The Crown argues that the police delayed informing Mr. Mian of
the reason for his arrest and his right to counsel in order to avoid
compromising an investigation, thus mitigating the seriousness of the Charter 
breach. 

[80]                         
The Crown emphasizes the fact that the delay was
“only 22 minutes” and describes this delay as “minor” (R.F., at para. 99). 
Although 22 minutes may be “minor” in some circumstances, in the context of
this case it was significant.  In this case, there was evidence that Mr. Mian
was questioned while in the police vehicle at a point in time at which his s.
10  rights still had not been complied with (voir dire reasons, at para.
98). Although the Crown did not seek to introduce any statements that Mr. Mian
may have made at that time, the questioning of Mr. Mian indicates the
seriousness of the delay. The significance of the passage of time is heightened
in the circumstances of this case, where the trial judge found that there was
no valid reason for the delay and that there were numerous opportunities for
the police officers to advise Mr. Mian of the reason for his detention and his
right to retain and instruct counsel (ibid., at para. 94).

[81]                         
This does not mean that the seriousness of a
delay will never be mitigated by extenuating circumstances. Indeed, in an
appropriate case, where a Charter  breach has been found, a delay of more
than 22 minutes may well be justified. In this case, however, these arguments
are impermissible attempts to undermine the factual findings of the trial
judge. 

[82]                         
First, in Grant, this Court recognized
that “[e]xtenuating circumstances, such as the need to prevent the
disappearance of evidence, may attenuate the seriousness of police conduct that
results in a Charter  breach” (para. 75). However, in this case, the
trial judge found that once Mr. Mian was out of his vehicle, there could not
have been any concern for the destruction or loss of any evidence in the
vehicle. Second, the trial judge found that Detective Werth had instructed
Constables McGill and Dalziel that if they could not establish their own
grounds to arrest the driver of the Malibu, there were already grounds to
arrest the driver which they could rely upon. Finally, the trial judge found as
a fact that “[t]here was no evidence of a real and present danger that the
operation would be frustrated or compromised if Mian was immediately advised of
the reason for his arrest” or of “his right to retain and instruct counsel”
(para. 86). In view of these factual findings which were open to the trial
judge, I am unable to accept the Crown’s argument that the extenuating
circumstances of the ongoing investigation were sufficiently significant to
lessen the seriousness of the breach.

[83]                         
The Crown further submits that the breach was
not serious because there was a lack of a causal connection between the
breach and the discovery of the evidence. However, a causal connection
or lack thereof is not determinative.  This Court has confirmed that a causal
connection is not necessary in order to engage s. 24(2)  of the Charter  (Strachan,
at pp. 1000-1002). Indeed, the Crown concedes that a temporal connection
is in theory sufficient to engage s. 24(2) .  Moreover, the first line of
inquiry in the Grant analysis is concerned with the police conduct, and
is not focused on the connection or lack thereof between the police conduct and
the evidence (Grant, at paras. 72-73; see also Côté, at para.
71).  

[84]                         
At the stage of assessing the seriousness of the
breach, deliberate and egregious state conduct favours the exclusion of the
evidence: “In order to determine the effect of admission of the evidence on
public confidence in the justice system, the court on a s. 24(2)  application
must consider the seriousness of the violation, viewed in terms of the
gravity of the offending conduct by state authorities whom the rule of law
requires to uphold the rights guaranteed by the Charter ” (Grant,
at para. 73 (emphasis added)). In this case, the trial judge found that the Charter 
breaches were “extremely serious and deliberate” (para. 96) due to the “number
of opportunities” (para. 94) that Constables McGill and Dalziel had to advise
Mr. Mian of the reason for his detention and because “[t]here was no evidence
. . . as to how simply providing Mian with this information would
have created a real and present danger of compromising the ongoing
investigation” (para. 96).  These were findings of fact, entitled to
deference.  

[85]                         
In my view, the trial judge did not consider
improper factors, or ignore proper factors, at the first stage of the Grant
analysis.  There is no reason to disturb his findings that this first stage of
the analysis weighs in favour of excluding the evidence.

(ii)        
The Impact of the Breach on the Protected Rights
of the Accused

[86]                         
The Crown argues that “the trial judge erred by
overstating the impact of the breach on the Charter -protected interests
of the accused” (R.F., at para. 100). The basis for this argument is that Mr.
Mian “had to wait for constitutionally required advice for 22 minutes, not
several hours. He was not subjected to any lengthy interrogation” (R.F., at
para. 103). 

[87]                         
However, as explained above, the trial judge’s
assessment of the Grant factors in light of the facts of the case is to
be afforded considerable deference by an appellate court. The Crown’s arguments
are an attack on the judge’s assessment of the facts and do not point to an
error of law. In addition, while the trial judge found that the impact on Mr.
Mian’s rights with respect to the failure to advise him of the reason for his
detention or of his right to counsel would have weighed in favour of excluding
any statements that the Crown may have tried to introduce, the Crown did not
seek to introduce such evidence. Moreover, with respect to non-bodily physical
evidence, the trial judge found that the s. 10  Charter  violations had
little impact on Mr. Mian’s privacy interest in the contents of his car, in
part because of the lack of causal connection between the breach and the
evidence. It was appropriate to consider the causal connection at this stage (Grant,
at para. 122). In this context, it is difficult to see how the trial judge
could be said to have overstated the impact of the breach on Mr. Mian’s Charter -protected
interests. I do not see any reason to disturb the trial judge’s findings with
respect to the second Grant factor.

(iii)       Society’s Interest in the Adjudication of the Case on Its Merits

[88]                         
The Crown argues that the trial judge erred by
concluding that the reliability and importance of the evidence were offset by
Detective Werth’s attempt to mislead the court. I agree that misleading police
testimony is properly considered under the first Grant factor. However,
the Grant test is a flexible and imprecise balancing exercise (see Grant,
at paras. 85-86). The question is whether the trial judge considered the proper
factors. In this case, the trial judge did exactly that. The trial judge held
that the lack of a causal connection between the breach and the evidence, the
minimal impact of the breach on Mr. Mian’s privacy rights, the reliability of
the evidence, and the seriousness of the offence favoured admission of the
evidence. He also held that the egregious and deliberate state conduct, the
lack of a valid reason for the Charter  breach, and the misleading state
conduct favoured exclusion of the evidence. On balance, the judge concluded
that society’s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits was
outweighed by the wilful and flagrant state conduct and the attempts to mislead
the court. This conclusion was not unreasonable.

(b)        
Conclusion on the Admissibility of the Evidence

[89]                         
In view of the deferential standard of review on
appeal and because the Crown’s arguments with respect to the trial judge’s s.
24(2)  findings amount to an attack on the trial judge’s findings of fact, this
Court cannot interfere with the trial judge’s s. 24(2)  analysis. 

VI.

verdict acquitting Mr. Mian is restored.

on appeal from the court
of appeal for alberta

                    Criminal
Law — Evidence — Admissibility — Confessions — “Mr. Big” confessions — Charge
to jury — Accused confessing to murdering his roommate during Mr. Big operation
— Whether accused’s confessions should be excluded under s. 24(2) of Charter —
If not, whether trial judge’s jury charge adequate on evidentiary concerns of Mr.
Big confessions — Whether trial judge’s jury charge also adequate on reliability
of Crown witness’ testimony — Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , s. 24(2) .

                    After
a murder victim was reported missing, the police received information that his
roommate M had confessed to killing him and initiated an investigation. The
investigation had two components:  a Mr. Big operation and a wiretap
authorization to intercept M’s phone calls. During the Mr. Big operation, M
twice admitted to undercover police officers that he shot the victim and burned
his body. That information led police to conduct a search of a firepit where
they located fragments of bones and teeth later identified as belonging to the
victim, and shell casings later determined to have been fired from a gun seized
from M’s apartment. M was arrested and charged with first degree murder. At the
time of M’s arrest, the Mr. Big operation had been in progress for four months
and M had participated in 30 “scenarios” with undercover officers. He had been
paid approximately $5,000 for his work, plus expenses. At trial, the Crown
conceded that its wiretap authorization did not comply with the Criminal
Code  and therefore, violated s. 8  of the Charter . As a result of
this violation, the Crown did not adduce any of M’s calls, but did adduce his
two confessions to the undercover police officers during the Mr. Big operation.
However, M argued that the wiretap authorization was so intertwined with the Mr.
Big operation that the illegality of the authorization necessitated excluding
his confessions under s. 24(2)  of the Charter . The trial judge rejected
this argument and determined that s. 24(2)  was not engaged. The trial judge
provided instructions to the jury in relation to the evidence arising from the Mr.
Big operation. He also cautioned the jury about the testimony of the Crown’s
principal witness and provided a Vetrovec warning in relation to his
evidence. The jury found M guilty of first degree murder and his appeal from
conviction was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.

                    Held: 
The appeal should be dismissed.

                    Section
24(2)  of the Charter  was not engaged because M’s confessions to the
undercover officers were not obtained in a manner that infringed M’s rights.
Whether evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed an accused’s rights depends
on the nature of the connection between the infringement and the evidence
obtained. While a causal connection is not required, the nature and extent of the
connection remains an important factor for the trial judge’s consideration. In
this case, M confessed to the undercover officers while the illegal wiretap was
in place. Although the trial judge found a temporal connection between M’s confessions
and the wiretap, its significance was undermined by a tenuous causal connection.
That finding was open to the trial judge and there is no basis for interfering
with it.

                    Neither
the courts below nor the parties had the benefit of this Court’s decision in R.
v. Hart, 2014 SCC 52, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 544, under which framework a Mr. Big
confession will be excluded where its prejudicial effect outweighs its
probative value, or where it is the product of an abuse of process. This poses
no difficulty, however, as M’s confessions would clearly be admissible under
that framework. 

                    The
probative value of M’s confessions was high because there was an abundance of
evidence that was potentially confirmatory. First, M’s purported confessions to
his acquaintances A and L describe the same motive for killing the victim as
M’s confessions to the undercover officers. They also made reference to burning
the victim’s body. Second, immediately after confessing to one of the
undercover officers, M led him to the firepit in which the victim’s remains lay
undiscovered. And third, shell casings fired from a gun found in M’s apartment
were found in the same firepit. On the other hand, the confessions’ prejudicial
effect was limited. The operation did not reveal unsavoury facts about M’s
history, nor did M participate in any scenarios that involved violence. 

                    Nor
did the undercover officers engage in any improper conduct that could ground an
application for abuse of process. M was not presented with overwhelming
inducements. He had prospects for legitimate work that would have paid even
more than the undercover officers were offering. Nor did the officers threaten
M with violence if he would not confess. The most that can be said is that the
officers created an air of intimidation by referring to violent acts committed
by members of the organization. M, however, was not coerced into confessing.

                    While
the Hart framework was intended to respond to the evidentiary concerns
raised by Mr. Big confessions, it does not erase them. Rather, it falls to the
trial judge to adequately instruct the jury on how to approach these
confessions. The nature and extent of the instructions required will vary from
case to case. However, there is some guidance — short of a prescriptive formula
— that can be provided. The trial judge should tell the jury that the
reliability of the accused’s confession is a question for them. The trial judge
should then review with the jury the factors relevant to the confession and the
evidence surrounding it. For example, the trial judge should alert the jury to the
length of the operation, the number of interactions between the police and the
accused, the nature of the relationship between the undercover officers and the
accused, the nature and extent of the inducements offered, the presence of any
threats, the conduct of the interrogation itself, and the personality of the
accused. Moreover, the trial judge should discuss the fact that the confession
itself may contain markers of reliability (or unreliability). Jurors should be
told to consider the level of detail in the confession, whether it led to the
discovery of additional evidence, whether it identified any elements of the
crime that had not been made public, or whether it accurately described mundane
details of the crime the accused would not likely have known had he not
committed it. 

                    With
respect to the bad character evidence, the challenge is a more familiar one.
The trial judge must instruct the jury that this sort of evidence has been
admitted for the limited purpose of providing context for the confession. The
jury should be instructed that it cannot rely on that evidence in determining
whether the accused is guilty. Moreover, the trial judge should remind the jury
that the simulated criminal activity was fabricated and encouraged by agents of
the state.

                    In
this case, the trial judge instructed the jury adequately and no error has been
shown. The trial judge told the jury that it had to “carefully consider whether
the themes of violence and the level of inducements may reasonably have compromised
the reliability” of M’s confessions. He specifically instructed the jury that
it had to “assess the environment, the themes of easy money, violence, the
importance of honesty and integrity, any offers of exit points, and any threats
or intimidation”. Ultimately, the trial judge left the final assessment of the
reliability of M’s confessions to the jury. With respect to the bad character
evidence, although the trial judge did not address it specifically, he provided
the jury with a standard limiting instruction on the use that could be made of
any evidence that bore on M’s character. Undoubtedly, the trial judge could
have said more, but this does not mean his instructions were deficient.     

                    Finally,
the trial judge conveyed to the jury the reliability concerns with the evidence
of A, the Crown’s principal witness. He reminded the jury that the defence
position was that A was the killer. He told them that M’s knowledge of the
murder could have come from A. He brought up A’s apparent lie to the police and
cautioned the jury that it left open the question of whether they could rely on
anything he said. And he told the jury that it would be dangerous to accept A’s
evidence in the absence of confirmatory evidence. Nothing more was required.

Introduction

[1]                             
A jury convicted the appellant of the first
degree murder of his roommate, Robert Levoir.  His appeal from conviction was
dismissed by the Alberta Court of Appeal.  He now appeals to this Court, with
leave, seeking to have his conviction overturned and a new trial ordered.  This
appeal was heard in conjunction with R. v. Hart, 2014 SCC 52, [2014] 2
S.C.R. 544.

[2]                             
The appellant advances three grounds of appeal. 
First, he contends that the trial judge should have excluded the confessions he
made to undercover officers during a Mr. Big operation.  Second, if the
confessions were admissible, he argues that the trial judge did not adequately
instruct the jury on the dangers associated with them.  Third, he submits that
the trial judge failed to properly instruct the jury on the dangers associated
with the evidence of a central Crown witness, Michael Argueta.

[3]                             
For reasons that follow, I would not give effect
to any of these grounds and would dismiss the appeal. 

II.          
Background Facts

A.          
The Police Investigation into the Death of
Robert Levoir

[4]                             
Mr. Levoir went missing in November 2002.  At
the time of his disappearance, he was living with the appellant in Fort
McMurray, Alberta.  

[5]                             
About a month after Mr. Levoir’s disappearance,
the police received a call from Jay Love, a friend of the appellant. Mr. Love
told the police that the appellant had confessed to killing Mr. Levoir and
burning his body. Acting on Mr. Love’s tip, the police began investigating the
appellant to determine if he was responsible for Mr. Levoir’s disappearance. 
The investigation had two components: a Mr. Big operation, and a wiretap
authorization to intercept the appellant’s phone calls.

[6]                             
The Mr. Big operation commenced in January 2004,
approximately one year after the police received the call from Mr. Love. An
undercover officer, whom I will refer to as Ben,[1]
was introduced to the appellant at a nightclub in Fort McMurray.  The appellant
was working at the club as a D.J.  

[7]                             
A week after their introduction, Ben asked the
appellant to help him repossess a vehicle.  The appellant did so and was paid
$200.  During a conversation with Ben a few days later, the appellant mentioned
his missing roommate. He told Ben that Mr. Levoir was a “crack head” and a
“drug addict”, and accused him of stealing from his son’s piggy bank.  He added
that “[a]s far as he was concerned”, Mr. Levoir was “pushing up daisies”.  

[8]                             
Early on in the Mr. Big operation, the appellant
began to suspect that Ben was involved in criminal activity.  Ben told the
appellant that he worked for an organization headed up by a man named Liam who
“had his fingers into a lot of things”.  Throughout January and February 2004,
the appellant did several more “jobs” for the organization.  In early February,
for example, the appellant was asked to pick up a package from a bus depot in
Edmonton.  When he returned to his hotel room where Ben was waiting, Ben opened
the package and it contained $30,000 in cash.  

[9]                             
Later in February 2004, during a conversation
between the appellant and Ben, Ben mentioned that he had once been attacked by
two men while working for the organization.  Ben told the appellant that Liam
had “looked after [the] two guys” in what Ben called the “weekend of
reckoning”.  Ben then asked the appellant if he had ever “beat[en]” anyone. The
appellant replied that there were two occasions, once when he was in a fist
fight, and another time that he could not talk about.  Ben expressed his hope
that the appellant would one day tell him about his “secre[t]”.  

[10]                         
Ben brought up the appellant’s secret again in
early March.  He suggested that the person the appellant was talking about
“[wasn’t] walking anymore”.  The appellant nodded his head in agreement and
added that “every man has a breaking point”.  

[11]                         
In mid-March, the appellant drove to Vancouver
at Ben’s behest to have a meeting with Liam.  The appellant and Liam met at an
apartment in the city.  Liam brought up the appellant’s missing roommate and
attempted to question him about the disappearance.  The appellant asked Liam if
he could “decline” to speak about the matter.  Liam told the appellant that it
was his choice, but that refusing to speak meant he would remain on the
organization’s “third line”.  The only way to advance to the “first line” was
by talking about his roommate and revealing his secret.  The appellant again
refused, explaining that “loose lips sink ships”.  

[12]                         
After the appellant’s meeting with Liam, three
weeks went by before Ben and the appellant met again in person.  On April 9,
2004, Ben asked the appellant if he wanted to work.  The appellant said that he
did, and that he would “do what it took”.  Ben asked the appellant if he would
be willing to sit down with Liam to talk about how his roommate had been
killed. The appellant agreed to do so.  Ben then asked the appellant why he
killed Mr. Levoir, and the appellant responded that his former roommate had
been “a liar, a thief, and a piece of shit drug dealer”.  The appellant told
Ben that he shot Mr. Levoir five times — four times in the chest and once in
the back — with a .223 rifle.  The appellant also said that there was “nothing
left” of Mr. Levoir because he had burned his body.  

[13]                         
The appellant initially offered to show Ben
where Mr. Levoir’s body had been burned.  However, he quickly backtracked,
telling Ben that “everything” he had just said was “bullshit” and that he had
been “lying”.  Ben replied that he “really hope[d]” the appellant had been
telling the truth.  In response, the appellant changed his mind and took Ben
out to a firepit on his father’s property.  The appellant told Ben that he had
taken the ashes out of the firepit and that there was “nothing left” of Mr.
Levoir.  

[14]                         
A few days later, the appellant was flown to
Edmonton for a second meeting with Liam.  That meeting took place on April 15,
2004.  At the outset, the appellant described Mr. Levoir as a “crack head” and
accused him of stealing from his son’s piggy bank.  When Liam asked the
appellant how he had killed Mr. Levoir, the appellant replied that he shot him
five times with a .223 rifle — four times in the chest and once in the back. 
He added that there had been a “big fire” at his dad’s place, and that there
was “nothing left” of Mr. Levoir.  

[15]                         
The next week, on April 21, 2004, the appellant
was arrested and charged with first degree murder.  The police searched his
father’s property, and Mr. Levoir’s remains were found in the firepit that the
appellant had pointed out to Ben.  Shell casings fired by a rifle found in the
appellant’s apartment were also discovered in the firepit. 

[16]                         
At the time of his arrest, the Mr. Big operation
had been in progress for four months and the appellant had participated in 30
“scenarios” with undercover officers.  He had been paid approximately $5,000
for his work with the organization, plus expenses. 

B.           
The Evidence of Jay Love 

[17]                         
Jay Love, the man who initially brought the
appellant to the attention of the police, testified as a witness for the Crown
and recounted the appellant’s December 2002 confession.  Mr. Love testified
that he and the appellant went to a bar with another man named Michael Argueta
on December 21, 2002.  The appellant told Mr. Love that he was his best friend,
and he asked Mr. Love if he could trust him.  The appellant was intoxicated at
the time.  Mr. Love testified that the appellant was unhappy with Mr. Levoir
because the appellant thought Mr. Levoir had stolen from his son’s piggy bank,
that he was taking drugs in the house, and that he was using the appellant’s
phone without permission. 

[18]                         
The appellant then told Mr. Love that “Robbie”
was dead.  Mr. Love asked if the appellant had “outsource[d]” the killing, and
the appellant replied “no, I did it myself”.  The appellant also added that he
burned Mr. Levoir’s body.  

C.           
The Evidence of Michael Argueta

[19]                         
Michael Argueta was also called as a Crown
witness. Mr. Argueta was a friend of the appellant and he too testified that
the appellant had confessed to him about killing Mr. Levoir.  This confession
was said to have occurred at a bar in Edmonton, where the appellant told Mr.
Argueta that he had “gotten rid” of Mr. Levoir.

[20]                         
Mr. Argueta and the appellant did not talk again
until they were driving home to Fort McMurray the next day.  Mr. Argueta
testified that, during the drive, the appellant told him he shot Mr. Levoir. 
Mr. Argueta did not believe the appellant, and the appellant added that he
burned Mr. Levoir’s body on his father’s property.  Mr. Argueta also testified
that the appellant had been “[v]ery agitated” by Mr. Levoir because Mr. Levoir
owed the appellant money, had stolen from his son’s piggy bank, and had used
his phone without permission.  

[21]                         
Mr. Argueta’s credibility was a central issue at
trial.  Prior to testifying, he had been interviewed by the police a
number of times and he had never mentioned the appellant’s second confession
during the car ride home.  Indeed, in a statement given to
police under oath, Mr. Argueta expressly denied talking to the appellant about
Mr. Levoir’s disappearance during the drive home to Fort McMurray.   In his
testimony, Mr. Argueta admitted knowing that drug dealers from Vancouver had
put a “price on Robbie Levoir’s head” back in 2002, before he disappeared. 
Ultimately, the defence took the position that Mr. Argueta had killed Mr.
Levoir in order to collect on this bounty. 

D.          
The Appellant’s Evidence 

[22]                         
The appellant testified and denied killing Mr.
Levoir.  According to the appellant, he and Mr. Argueta had plans to go hunting
on November 6, 2002.    They invited Mr. Levoir to come along, and he did.  The
three men drove to the property owned by the appellant’s father, intending to
hunt on his land.

[23]                         
The appellant testified that after the group
arrived at his father’s property, Mr. Levoir and Mr. Argueta separated from
him.  Several minutes later, the appellant heard a series of gun shots.  He
returned to the road and encountered Mr. Argueta.  According to the appellant,
he asked “[w]here’s Robbie?”, and Mr. Argueta responded “[t]hat’s what you get
for the price on his head for pissing off the big boys”.  The appellant then
looked over and saw Mr. Levoir’s body lying in the grass.  Mr. Argueta then
told the appellant to “[j]ust shut up, and don’t worry about it”, stating that
he would “come back and look after it”.  The appellant also claimed that Mr.
Argueta told him, in a conversation at a bar approximately one month later,
that he had burned the body for two days in a firepit at the same property.

[24]                         
As for his purported confession to Jay Love, the
appellant claimed that Mr. Love had misheard him at the bar on December 21,
2002.  He said that what Mr. Love had heard as a confession was actually an
attempt on his part to tell Mr. Love that Mr. Argueta had killed the deceased. 
With respect to Mr. Argueta’s evidence, the appellant said it was untrue.  And
while he admitted to making admissions to the undercover officers, he explained
that he made those statements out of a desire for money, protection, a belief
that the confessions were necessary for self-preservation, and to “sound big
and tough and bad like them”.  

[25]                         
The appellant also called two other witnesses
who testified that, on separate occasions, Mr. Argueta made statements in which
he suggested he was involved in Mr. Levoir’s death.   

III.       
The Courts Below

A.          
Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta, 2007 ABQB
182, 458 A.R. 52

[26]                         
At the appellant’s trial, the Crown conceded
that the wiretap authorization it had obtained to intercept the appellant’s
phone calls did not comply with the requirements of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , and had therefore been obtained in violation of s. 8  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .[2]  As a result of this
violation, the Crown did not adduce any of the conversations that had been
intercepted pursuant to the wiretap authorization.  Nonetheless, the appellant
moved to have all of the statements he made during the Mr. Big operation — none
of which were recorded on the wiretaps — excluded as well.  The appellant
argued that the illegal wiretap was being used to design the undercover
operation and that the operation would not have been conducted without it.  As
a result, the wiretap authorization was so intertwined with the Mr. Big
operation that the illegality of the authorization necessitated excluding his
statements to the undercover officers under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  

[27]                         
The trial judge, Mr. Justice Hillier, rejected
this argument.  He concluded that s. 24(2)  of the Charter  was not
engaged because the appellant’s incriminating statements to undercover officers
had not been “obtained in a manner” that violated any of his rights under the Charter 
(para. 187).  Although the appellant made his incriminating statements to
the undercover officers while the illegal wiretap was in place, there was no
causal connection between the existence of the illegal wiretap and the
appellant’s confessions to the undercover officers (para. 184).  The most that
could be said was that the wiretaps were “helpful” to the undercover officers
during the Mr. Big operation, because they provided the officers with
assurances that their “cover” had not been “blown” (para. 175).  The trial
judge did not accept that the wiretaps were used to design and carry out the
Mr. Big operation.

B.           
Alberta Court of Appeal (Côté, McFadyen and
O’Brien JJ.A.), 2012 ABCA 42, 66 Alta. L.R. (5th) 377

[28]                         
On appeal, the appellant submitted that the
trial judge erred in concluding that s. 24(2)  of the Charter  was not
engaged, and that his instructions to the jury in relation to the evidence
arising from the Mr. Big operation and Mr. Argueta’s credibility were
deficient. 

[29]                         
The Court of Appeal rejected these arguments. 
It noted that a trial judge’s decision under s. 24(2)  of the Charter  is
entitled to deference, and it could see no basis for interfering with the trial
judge’s determination that the s. 8  violation and the accused’s statements to
the undercover officers were not sufficiently related to trigger s. 24(2) .  In
relation to the Mr. Big operation, the trial judge instructed the jury against
engaging in propensity reasoning and pointed out the reliability concerns
raised by the operation.  In the Court of Appeal’s view, nothing further was
required.  Similarly, regarding Mr. Argueta’s testimony, the Court of Appeal
observed that the trial judge had reminded the jury of the defence position
that Mr. Argueta was the killer, and he had warned them of the reliability
dangers associated with Mr. Argueta’s evidence.  Here, too, the Court of Appeal
could find no error. 

IV.       
Issues

[30]                         
The appellant raises three issues on appeal:

(a)         Did the trial judge err
in concluding that s. 24(2)  of the Charter  was not engaged?

(b)         Did the trial judge err
in his instructions to the jury on the Mr. Big confessions? 

(c)         Did the trial judge err
in his instructions to the jury relating to Mr. Argueta’s testimony? 

V.          
Analysis

A.          
Did the Trial Judge Err in Concluding That
Section 24(2) of the Charter  Was Not Engaged?

[31]                         
At the outset, it bears
mentioning that the appellant’s only challenge to the admissibility of the
confessions he made to undercover officers during the Mr. Big operation came
under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  The appellant did not have the benefit
of this Court’s decision in Hart, in which a two-pronged framework for
assessing the admissibility of Mr. Big confessions was set out.  Under the Hart
framework, a Mr. Big confession will be excluded where its prejudicial
effect outweighs its probative value, or where it is the product of an abuse of
process.  In this context, the confession’s probative value is a function of
its reliability.  Its prejudicial effect stems from the harmful character
evidence that necessarily accompanies its admission (see Hart, at paras.
84-86).  

[32]                         
Neither the courts
below nor the parties before this Court have considered whether the appellant’s
confessions would be admissible under the two-pronged framework set out in Hart. 
In my view, however, this poses no difficulty as these confessions would clearly
be admissible under that framework.[3] 


[33]                         
To begin with, the
probative value of the appellant’s confessions is high.  The inducements
provided by the undercover officers were modest — the appellant was paid
approximately $5,000 over a four-month period, at a time when well-paying,
legitimate work was readily available to him.  He was not threatened by the
officers.  And he was told, in his first meeting with Liam, that he could
decline to say anything and remain on the organization’s “third line” — an option
he initially accepted.

[34]                         
Moreover, there was an
abundance of evidence that was potentially confirmatory.  First, the
appellant’s purported confessions to Mr. Argueta and Mr. Love described the
same motive for killing Mr. Levoir as his confessions to the undercover
officers.  They also made reference to burning Mr. Levoir’s body.  Second,
immediately after confessing to Ben, the appellant led him to the firepit in
which Mr. Levoir’s remains lay undiscovered.  And third, shell casings fired
from a gun found in the appellant’s apartment were found in the same firepit.  All of this made for a confession that was highly probative.

[35]                         
On the other hand,
while the confessions were accompanied by bad character evidence, the prejudice
was limited.  The appellant was not involved in any scenarios that involved
violence, nor did the operation reveal prejudicial facts about the appellant’s
past history.  The appellant’s involvement with the organization was primarily
limited to assisting with repossessing vehicles and delivering packages.  In my
view, any prejudicial effect arising from the Mr. Big confessions is easily
outweighed by their probative value.

[36]                         
Nor did the undercover
officers engage in any improper conduct which could ground an application for
abuse of process.  The appellant was not presented with overwhelming
inducements.  He had prospects for legitimate work that would have paid even
more than the undercover officers were offering.  Nor did the officers threaten
the appellant with violence if he would not confess.  The most that can be said
is that the officers created an air of intimidation by referring to violent
acts committed by members of the organization.  But the appellant was not
coerced into confessing.  This much is evidenced by the appellant’s initial
refusal to speak with Ben and Liam about Mr. Levoir’s disappearance.  Indeed,
the undercover officers explicitly made clear to the appellant that he did not
have to speak with them about Mr. Levoir, and that he could remain in his
current role within the organization.  None of the undercover officers’ conduct
approaches abuse.  

[37]                         
These comments aside, I
return to the appellant’s attack on the admissibility of his confessions under
s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  Under s. 24(2), evidence will be
excluded where: (1) the evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed or
denied any of the rights or freedoms guaranteed by the Charter ; and (2)
admitting the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute
(R. v. Wittwer, 2008 SCC 33, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 19).

[38]                         
Whether evidence was “obtained in a manner” that
infringed an accused’s rights under the Charter depends on the nature of
the connection between the Charter  violation and the evidence that was
ultimately obtained.  The courts have adopted a purposive approach to this
inquiry.  Establishing a strict causal relationship between the breach and the
subsequent discovery of evidence is unnecessary.  Evidence will be tainted if
the breach and the discovery of the impugned evidence are part of the same
transaction or course of conduct.  The required connection between the breach
and the subsequent statement may be temporal, contextual, causal, or a
combination of the three.  A “remote” or “tenuous” connection between the
breach and the impugned evidence will not suffice (Wittwer, at para.
21).

[39]                         
The strength of the connection between a piece
of evidence and a Charter  breach is a question of fact (see R. v.
Goldhart, [1996] 2 S.C.R 463, at para. 40).  A trial judge’s decision under
s. 24(2)  of the Charter  is entitled to considerable deference on
appeal.  Such a decision will only be interfered with where the trial judge has
failed to consider the proper factors or has made an unreasonable finding (R.
v. Côté, 2011 SCC 46, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 215, at para. 44, and R. v. Grant,
2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, at para. 86).  

[40]                         
The appellant submits that the trial judge erred
in concluding that the statements he made to undercover officers were not
“obtained in a manner” that violated his Charter  rights.  According to
the appellant, the trial judge applied too stringent a test in reaching this
conclusion.  In particular, the trial judge mistakenly believed that a causal
relationship between the breach and the acquisition of the evidence was
required in order to engage s. 24(2)  of the Charter . 

[41]                         
This ground of appeal is fact-driven and I would
not give effect to it.  Distilled to its essence, the appellant is effectively
inviting the Court to reweigh the factors the trial judge considered in
deciding that s. 24(2)  was not engaged.  The trial judge was aware that a
causal relationship between the Charter  breach and the acquisition of
the evidence was not required.  He noted that “the entire relationship” between
the breach and the impugned evidence had to be considered, and that causation
was not the “sole touchstone” of the analysis (para. 182).  The trial judge
acknowledged that there was a temporal relationship between the s. 8  breach and
the appellant’s statements to the undercover officers.  He went on to consider
the causal relationship between the wiretap authorization and the appellant’s
statements to undercover officers, and found that it was “so remote as to be
insignificant” (para. 185).  When he considered the temporal and causal
relationships together, he was of the view that the statements had not been
obtained in a manner that infringed the Charter .

[42]                         
While it is true that the lack of a causal
relationship played an important role in the trial judge’s analysis, this can
only carry the appellant’s argument so far.  A causal relationship is not
required to support a finding that evidence was obtained in a manner that
violated the Charter , but the nature and extent of the causal
relationship remains an important factor for the trial judge’s consideration. 
In the trial judge’s view, the tenuous causal connection between the breach and
the statements undermined the significance of the temporal relationship.  That
finding was open to him, and I see no basis for interfering with it.

B.           
Did the Trial Judge Err in his Instructions to
the Jury on the Mr. Big Confessions?

[43]                         
In Hart, this Court identified two
evidentiary concerns with confessions that are the product of a Mr. Big
operation.  The first is that the confessions may be unreliable.  Mr. Big
operations are intended to induce confessions, and the inducements offered to a
suspect may incentivize the suspect to falsely confess.  Second, Mr. Big
confessions are invariably accompanied by bad character evidence in which the
accused has shown a willingness to commit crimes to gain entry into a criminal
organization (see Hart, at paras. 68-77). 

[44]                         
The common law rule of evidence that was set out
in Hart was intended to respond to the evidentiary concerns raised by
Mr. Big operations.  However, while this rule responds to these two evidentiary
concerns, it does not erase them.  The focus of the rule is to determine
whether a Mr. Big confession should be admitted into evidence.  It does not
decide the ultimate question of whether the confession is reliable, nor does it
eliminate the prejudicial character evidence that accompanies its admission. 
Thus, even in cases where Mr. Big confessions are admitted into evidence,
concerns with their reliability and prejudice will persist.  It then falls to
the trial judge to adequately instruct the jury on how to approach these
confessions in light of these concerns.  

[45]                         
The appellant agrees that reliability and
prejudice are the two evidentiary concerns that must be addressed in a trial
judge’s charge to the jury.  With respect to reliability, the appellant submits
that a “very strict” caution must be given about “danger” presented by Mr. Big
confessions (A.F., at para. 95).  The appellant points to the jury charge
delivered in R. v. Bonisteel, 2008 BCCA 344, 259 B.C.A.C. 114, and
argues that a similar instruction should be given in “most, if not all” cases
involving Mr. Big confessions (A.F., at para. 96).  In Bonisteel, the
trial judge provided a strong caution regarding the reliability concerns raised
by Mr. Big confessions.  The jury was told that people sometimes “confess to
[crimes] they have not committed” (para. 66 (emphasis deleted)).  Moreover, the
jury was told that “confessions produced by an undercover operation such as
this are viewed as inherently unreliable” (ibid.).  Without independent
confirmation, the trial judge described the Mr. Big confessions as “highly
suspect” (ibid.). 

[46]                         
As for the bad character evidence that is
admitted, the appellant submits that trial judges must provide a “strong and
specific” limiting instruction that includes “specific directions” focused
on the “significant efforts [the] police employed to cause and encourage” the
accused’s participation in misconduct (A.F., at paras. 102-103 (emphasis in
original)).  

[47]                         
With those considerations in mind, the appellant
submits that the trial judge’s charge in this case — which addressed the
concerns with reliability and prejudice — was deficient because it did not go
far enough in warning the jury about the dangers inherent in this evidence and
the need to proceed with extreme caution in relying upon it to convict.

[48]                         
With respect, I disagree.  The instructions
given to the jury were, in my view, adequate in the circumstances.  In so
concluding, it bears repeating what this Court has said on numerous occasions:
an accused is entitled to a jury that is properly — not perfectly — instructed
(R. v. Jacquard, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at para. 2).  In reviewing the
trial judge’s charge, what counts is its substance, not its adherence to or
departure from prescriptive formulas (R. v. Luciano, 2011 ONCA
89, 273 O.A.C. 273, at para. 69).  The order of the charge and the words
chosen by the trial judge are within his or her discretion (R. v. Daley,
2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, at para. 30).

[49]                         
The functional approach to reviewing jury
charges that this Court has repeatedly endorsed cuts against the appellant’s
contention that trial judges must, in all Mr. Big cases, give the jury a Bonisteel
instruction.  Indeed, the British Columbia Court of Appeal has rejected
such an approach, preferring instead to subject these instructions to a
contextual, case-by-case review (see, e.g., R. v. Terrico, 2005
BCCA 361, 214 B.C.A.C. 135, at paras. 42-43, and R. v. Fry, 2011 BCCA
381, 311 B.C.A.C. 90, at paras. 82-83 and 87).  

[50]                         
I agree with the approach of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal.  In my view, there is no magical incantation that
must be read to juries by trial judges in all Mr. Big cases.  Instead, trial
judges are required to provide juries with the tools they need to address the
concerns about reliability and prejudice that arise from these confessions. 
The nature and extent of the instructions required will vary from case to
case.    

[51]                         
However, there is some guidance — short of a
prescriptive formula — that can be provided to trial judges who must instruct
juries in cases where a Mr. Big confession has been admitted into evidence.  

[52]                         
With respect to the reliability concerns raised
by a Mr. Big confession, the trial judge should tell the jury that the
reliability of the accused’s confession is a question for them. The trial judge
should then review with the jury the factors relevant to the confessions and
the evidence surrounding it.  As explained in Hart, the reliability of a
Mr. Big confession is affected by the circumstances in which the confession was
made and by the details contained in the confession itself.  Thus, the trial
judge should alert the jury to “the length of the operation, the number of
interactions between the police and the accused, the nature of the relationship
between the undercover officers and the accused, the nature and extent of the
inducements offered, the presence of any threats, the conduct of the
interrogation itself, and the personality of the accused” — all of which play a
role in assessing the confession’s reliability (see Hart, at para. 102).

[53]                         
Moreover, the trial judge should discuss the
fact that the confession itself may contain markers of reliability (or
unreliability).  Jurors should be told to consider the level of detail in the
confession, whether it led to the discovery of additional evidence, whether it
identified any elements of the crime that had not been made public, or whether
it accurately described mundane details of the crime the accused would not
likely have known had he not committed it (see Hart, at para.
105).  

[54]                         
This is not to suggest that trial judges are
required to provide a detailed catalogue of every piece of evidence that might
bear on the reliability of the confession.  The task is simply to alert the
jury to the concern about the reliability of the confession, and to highlight
the factors relevant to assessing it.

[55]                         
With respect to the bad character evidence that
accompanies a Mr. Big confession, the challenge is a more familiar one.  The
trial judge must instruct the jury that this sort of evidence has been admitted
for the limited purpose of providing context for the confession.  The jury
should be instructed that it cannot rely on that evidence in determining
whether the accused is guilty.  Moreover, the trial judge should remind the
jury that the simulated criminal activity — even that which the accused may
have eagerly participated in — was fabricated and encouraged by agents of the
state.

[56]                         
In this case, the trial judge addressed the
concerns about reliability and prejudice in his charge to the jury.  The trial
judge told the jury that it had to “carefully consider whether the themes of
violence and the level of inducement may reasonably have compromised the
reliability” of the appellant’s confessions.  He specifically instructed the jury
that it had to “assess the environment, the themes of easy money, violence, the
importance of honesty and integrity, any offers of exit points, and any threats
or intimidation”.  Ultimately, the trial judge left the final assessment of the
reliability of the appellant’s confessions to the jury:

Overall, it’s your
responsibility to decide whether the statements attributed to Mr. Mack are
reliable in whole or in part, bearing in mind Mr. Mack’s testimony that he was
given pep talks every day . . . that he felt indebted . . . and very insecure,
especially after he heard about the day of reckoning for the ice pick attack. 
Also that Mr. Mack felt out of his league, and whenever he started a story he
felt pushed in a direction that he had done it.

 

When a statement may have
arisen partly out of fear and partly from an inducement to easy money, it’s
important to assess carefully how reliable it is, if at all.  You need to
assess that against all of the evidence in order to decide not only what was
said, but whether what was said was truthful. 
[Emphasis added.]

[57]                         
With respect to the bad character evidence that
was admitted along with the Mr. Big confessions, although the trial judge did
not address it specifically, he provided the jury with a standard limiting instruction
on the use that could be made of any evidence that bore on the accused’s
character: 

You’ll recall in my opening
remarks I alerted you that we would likely hear evidence that does not reflect
Mr. Mack in a positive light, including views and conducts which are
unfavourable to him. You have now heard some evidence of that type, and I
remind you not to rely upon or use that evidence to conclude that Mr. Mack is
guilty or even that he is more likely to be guilty of the crime with which he
is charged based on that evidence.

 

In Canada people are not
prosecuted or judged as guilty because they have certain beliefs or values. Evidence
about things Mr. Mack may have said or acts he may have committed which you
find objectionable, it has been provided to you for the very limited purpose of
ensuring that you know the context for the other things that are said or done
that relate directly to the offence with which he is charged. Background
evidence, which we sometimes refer to as the narrative, is provided to you so
you understand more accurately the overall circumstances and can then better
assess what and whom to believe.

 

So I also repeat that you’re
not to decide this case based on your personal views of what you might consider
to be Mr. Mack’s value system or his opinions or even whether he might have
committed some other wrongful acts or offences. We are concerned with only
one charge: the murder of Robert Levoir.  [Emphasis added.]

[58]                         
When these instructions regarding reliability
and bad character evidence are viewed through a functional lens, I am satisfied
that they reveal no error.  The trial judge plainly addressed the two concerns
raised by the appellant’s confessions to undercover officers.  He directed the
jury to “assess carefully” how reliable the appellant’s confessions were, and
pointed specifically to the police deception, the level of inducements, the
“themes of easy money”, and the presence of any threats or intimidation. 
During the trial and in his final instructions, the trial judge directed the
jury to disregard the prejudicial character evidence that had been admitted in
reaching a verdict.

[59]                         
Undoubtedly, more could have been said by the
trial judge in his discussion of the reliability of the Mr. Big confession. 
The trial judge, for example, could have specifically reviewed the payments
received by the appellant during the operation, or the encouragements to
confess that were provided by Ben and Liam.  Equally, however, the trial judge
could have detailed the evidence that was capable of supporting the reliability
of the appellant’s confessions, including the fact that the appellant had
gainful employment available to him at the time the cash inducements were
offered to him, that he correctly pointed out the location of Mr. Levoir’s
remains during his confession to Ben, and that shell casings fired by a rifle
found in the appellant’s apartment were discovered in the firepit.  The trial
judge did not do so, but this does not mean his charge was deficient.  A
failure to say all that could have been said does not amount to a legal error:

. . . I cannot emphasize
enough that the right of an accused to a properly instructed jury does not
equate with the right to a perfectly instructed jury. An accused is entitled to
a jury that understands how the evidence relates to the legal issues. This
demands a functional approach to the instructions that were given, not an
idealized approach to those instructions that might have been given.

 

(Jacquard,
at para. 32, per Lamer C.J.)

[60]                         
It must also be mentioned that trial counsel was
provided a draft of the trial judge’s charge in advance of it being delivered
to the jury, and no objection was taken to the trial judge’s handling of the
Mr. Big confessions.  While it is the trial judge’s job to ensure that the jury
is properly instructed, trial counsel are expected to “assist the trial judge
and identify what in [his or her] opinion is problematic with the judge’s
instructions to the jury” (Daley, at para. 58).  A failure to object at
trial “may be indicative of the seriousness of the alleged violation” (ibid.). 
Here, although not determinative, trial counsel’s failure to object supports my
conclusion that the instructions on reliability and bad character evidence were
adequate in the circumstances.

[61]                         
In my view, the trial judge’s charge left the
jury equipped to deal with the concerns of reliability and prejudice that
emerged from the Mr. Big confessions.  No error has been shown.  Accordingly, I would reject this ground of appeal.

C.           
Did the Trial Judge Err in his Instructions to
the Jury Relating to Mr. Argueta’s Testimony?

[62]                         
In his charge, the trial judge instructed the
jury to consider Mr. Argueta’s evidence in light of the defence position that
it was Mr. Argueta who killed Mr. Levoir.  The trial judge referred to the possibility
that the appellant’s knowledge of the murder may have come from Mr. Argueta. 
In addition, he pointed out to the jury that even on Mr. Argueta’s own account,
he had lied to the police under oath when he told them that he and the
appellant had not discussed Mr. Levoir’s death on the drive back to Fort
McMurray from Edmonton.  The trial judge noted that Mr. Argueta had provided
“no explanation” for this lie and that he appeared “quite unapologetic” about
it.   He cautioned the jury that Mr. Argueta’s apparent lack of concern for the
seriousness of the oath “leaves open the question of whether you may rely on
anything he says”.

[63]                         
Because of these concerns, the trial judge
provided a Vetrovec[4]
warning in relation to Mr. Argueta’s evidence, instructing the jury that
it would be “dangerous” for them to accept his testimony in the absence of
other evidence that confirmed his account.  The trial judge provided two
examples of evidence that might be capable of supporting Mr. Argueta’s
evidence.  The first was Mr. Argueta’s testimony that the appellant was angry
with Mr. Levoir because he suspected Mr. Levoir had stolen from his son’s piggy
bank and had “run up telephone bills at [the appellant’s] place”.  The second
was that the appellant “separately testified to what he knew about the price on
[Mr.] Levoir’s head”, which was “similar to what Mr. Argueta said on that
matter, but was not attributed as having come to [the appellant] from Mr.
Argueta”.  

[64]                         
The appellant contends that these instructions
were deficient.  In particular, he submits that the trial judge’s instructions
on the importance of Mr. Argueta’s admitted lie to the police under oath was
confusing, because the appellant’s position at trial was that Mr. Argueta’s statement
to police was truthful and his testimony was a lie.  Moreover, the appellant
contends that the Vetrovec caution and the related instruction to seek
out confirmatory evidence before relying on Mr. Argueta’s evidence was
misplaced, because if Mr. Argueta provided information about the murder that
turned out to be true, this did not bolster the Crown’s theory that the
appellant was guilty of murder. Rather, it supported the defence position that
Mr. Argueta, and not the appellant, had killed Mr. Levoir.  

[65]                         
I would not give effect to the appellant’s
submissions.  In my view, the trial judge’s warning about Mr. Argueta’s
admitted lie to the police was not confusing.  The appellant’s submission to
the contrary flows from a technical reading of the instruction.  Read fairly
and in context, the impugned instruction conveyed to the jury that, even on Mr.
Argueta’s own account, he had lied under oath without explanation.  Thus, it
was questionable whether the jury could rely on anything he said.  When this
instruction is read in conjunction with the trial judge’s warning that it would
be dangerous to rely on Mr. Argueta’s evidence in the absence of confirmatory
evidence, it cannot be understood as having endorsed Mr. Argueta’s testimony
over the previous version of events he gave to the police.  The trial judge was
merely conveying to the jury that Mr. Argueta’s evidence was highly suspect and
that it would be dangerous to use it to convict in the absence of confirmatory
evidence.  Had he not given such an instruction, his failure to do so would most
assuredly have formed a ground of appeal.

[66]                         
Second, I cannot accept the contention that the
trial judge erred by instructing the jury to search for confirmatory evidence
before relying on Mr. Argueta’s testimony.  Admittedly, the trial judge
provided an example of evidence that was not capable of confirming Mr.
Argueta’s evidence.  The appellant did not separately testify that he knew
about the price on Mr. Levoir’s head, as stated by the trial judge in his
charge.  Rather, he testified that he heard about the price on Mr. Levoir’s
head from Mr. Argueta.  It is possible the trial judge simply misspoke, and
meant to refer to the fact that both Mr. Argueta and the appellant testified
that they knew the deceased was involved in the drug trade in British Columbia. 
No matter, the ultimate message left with the jury was clear, namely that it
would be dangerous to rely on Mr. Argueta’s evidence without confirmation. 
Importantly, the jury was told that it was for them to decide whether there was
any evidence capable of confirming his testimony.  The jury would clearly have
understood that in order to acquit the appellant, it did not have to believe
that Mr. Argueta was the killer; rather, it had to be satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the appellant was the killer and that if they had a
reasonable doubt, they must acquit.

[67]                         
Putting aside the appellant’s specific qualms,
this ground of appeal can also be resolved with the help of common sense.  The
problems with Mr. Argueta’s evidence were clear and obvious.  The defence
position was that Mr. Argueta was the killer and that he was lying in order to
frame the appellant.  There was evidence he had a motive to kill Mr. Levoir. 
And even taking his testimony at its highest, Mr. Argueta had committed
perjury.

[68]                         
At the end of the day, these were the problems
the trial judge had to convey to the jury in his charge.  In my view, that is
exactly what he did.  He reminded the jury that the defence position was that
Mr. Argueta was the killer.  He told them that the appellant’s knowledge of the
murder could have come from Mr. Argueta.  He brought up Mr. Argueta’s apparent
lie to the police, and cautioned the jury that his lack of concern for the oath
left open the question of whether they could rely on anything he said.  And he told
the jury that it would be dangerous to accept Mr. Argueta’s evidence in the
absence of confirmatory evidence.  Nothing more was required.  Trial counsel
was apparently of the same view.  He made no objection to the trial judge’s
instructions regarding Mr. Argueta’s testimony.  In my view, given that Mr. Argueta was, apart from the
appellant, the most critical witness from the perspective of the defence, trial
counsel’s failure to object to the charge reinforces my conclusion that the
trial judge adequately addressed the concerns raised by Mr. Argueta’s
testimony.

[2]   Specifically, the Crown conceded that “investigative necessity”
could not be established.  A Part VI authorization is only available where
“other investigative procedures have been tried and have failed, other
investigative procedures are unlikely to succeed or the urgency of the matter
is such that it would be impractical to carry out the investigation of the
offence using only other investigative procedures” (s. 186(1)(b)).  In
the Crown’s view, this requirement could not be met in the face of an ongoing
Mr. Big operation.





[3]   The appellant has had ample time since the release of this
Court’s decision in Hart to have the appeal reopened, with a view to
contesting the admissibility of his confessions under the Hart framework.
 He has made no attempt to do so.

                    C was charged with sexual assault.  When he
appeared in court, he was in a psychotic state and was declared unfit to stand
trial.  Crown counsel recommended a treatment order.  The Crown stated that a
bed would be available in a facility at one hospital six days after the
hearing.  The hearing judge issued a “forthwith” treatment order, specifying C
be treated at a second hospital or its “designate” (preferably the facility at
the first hospital).  Court services delivered C to the first hospital and left
him in a hallway.  The hospitals appealed this decision.  The Court of Appeal
held that the hearing judge erred by acting on the basis that the consent
requirement of the Criminal Code  provision relating to treatment had
been satisfied.  The Court of Appeal also determined that the applicable
provisions of the Criminal Code  (ss. 672.58  and 672.62(1) (a))
engage the rights to liberty and security of the person guaranteed under s. 7 
of the Charter , but do not violate the principles of fundamental
justice. 

                    Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

                    Per LeBel, Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell and Gascon JJ.: Consent is
required for the disposition order in its entirety, not simply to the treatment
aspect of it.  A court may not make a disposition order directing that
treatment begin immediately if the hospital or treating physician does not
consent to that disposition unless the situation is a rare
case in which a delay in treatment would breach the accused’s rights under the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and an order for immediate treatment is an
appropriate and just remedy for that breach.

                    The
hospital or person in charge of treatment must consent to all the terms of a
disposition ordering treatment and, if there is no consent, the order cannot be
made.  The starting point is the text of the provisions in their grammatical
and ordinary sense according to the modern principle of statutory
interpretation.  The Criminal Code  provides that no court shall make a “disposition”
under s. 672.58  without the consent of the hospital or person in charge of
treatment.  “Disposition” is a technical term, used throughout Part XX.1.  While
a disposition ordering treatment may be referred to as a “treatment order” in
colloquial language, there is no such thing provided for in the Criminal
Code .  It is clear that a “disposition” under s. 672.58  necessarily
has a temporal aspect both as to its beginning and its ending and may include
other conditions that the court considers it appropriate to impose.  Thus
consent is required to the disposition which the court makes under s. 672.58 ,
not simply to certain aspects of it.  This is supported by the meaning of the
word “consent” and the context in which it is used in these provisions. Where
the Criminal Code  intends to differentiate between consent to treatment
and consent to a disposition order, it does so expressly.

                    An
order under s. 672.58  is extraordinary in that it directs that treatment
of an accused be carried out without the accused’s consent and by necessary
implication, it authorizes medical personnel to carry out that treatment
against the accused’s wishes.  The provisions recognize the importance of the
treatment provider’s clinical judgment, not only as to the particular treatment
but as to the location at which it is to be carried out.  This broad
understanding of the scope of the required consent is reinforced by the practical
realities of providing involuntary treatment to potentially dangerous
individuals.  The timing of a treatment order for an accused who has been found
unfit to stand trial must be an element of the hospital’s consent because, from
the hospital’s perspective, the time at which treatment is to be provided is
inextricably linked to the hospital’s ability to provide treatment safely and
effectively.  The ability of the hospital to administer the suitable treatment
is inextricably linked to whether it has the facilities and personnel available
to do so.  Timing is therefore an essential element of suitability and not
distinct from it.  Consent under s. 672.62(1) of the Code must
therefore include timing. 

                    The
consent requirement does not deprive the accused of procedural fairness and is
not unconstitutionally vague or arbitrary.  Any potential violation of s. 7 
rights would result from the exercise of the hospital’s discretion to withhold
consent in a particular case, and is not inherent in the section itself.  No
such breach was established in this case.  That said, a judge proposing to make
a disposition is entitled to consider, in an appropriate case, whether a
refusal of consent will have the effect of unconstitutionally limiting the
accused’s rights to life, liberty or security of the person in a fashion that
does not accord with the principles of fundamental justice.  If so persuaded,
the judge would be entitled to consider whether ordering an immediate admission
would constitute an appropriate and just remedy for that breach.

                    Per McLachlin C.J. and Moldaver, Karakatsanis and Wagner JJ.:  The
treatment order regime in Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code  is intended to
bring mentally ill accused persons to the cognitive threshold required to
proceed to trial.  A court’s discretion under s. 672.58  to order treatment
to render an individual fit for trial is subject to stringent safeguards and
timelines.  Given the potential for involuntary medical treatment, one such
safeguard is the requirement for hospital consent set out in s. 672.62(1) (a). 
However, when the consent requirement is read in its proper statutory context,
it is clear that hospital consent is not required to all the terms and
conditions of the treatment order.  The hospital’s consent is required only to
the treatment itself.  Bed shortages and patient wait lists do not permit a
hospital to refuse, or defer, consent.  Consent may be withheld only for
medical reasons and cannot be withheld on the basis of efficient management of
hospital resources.  

                    Treatment
orders seek to render the accused fit to stand trial, in order to protect the
rights to a timely trial and procedural fairness, as well as to safeguard the
public interest in accused persons standing trial.  They also serve to ensure
that the accused’s liberty is minimally impaired.  While the medical and legal
interests of accused persons are both at stake, the ultimate purpose of
treatment orders is to protect the legal interests of the accused. 

                    Interpreting
the provisions in light of (1) the purposes of Part XX.1, the
treatment order regime and the consent requirement, (2) the scheme of
strict judicial control and oversight with strict timelines, and (3) the
appeal and automatic stay provisions, the requirement for hospital consent
relates only to a hospital’s willingness to deliver a particular treatment.  Requiring
hospital consent to all terms of a treatment “disposition” would effectively
give them a broad veto over whether a treatment order could be issued, without
regard to the accused’s legal interests.  If hospitals may refuse consent, or
dictate the timing of a treatment order, for any reason, including its internal
operations and wait lists, it would be a significant derogation from Part XX.1’s
comprehensive scheme of judicial controls and tight timelines.  Only judges
will be able to assess the risks that would flow from failing to immediately
treat an unfit accused because many of the greatest dangers will result not
from the “medical urgency” of this treatment as seen by hospitals, but rather
from the risks that such an accused would face in jail.  Furthermore, the
automatic stay of a treatment order upon appeal by the institution would be
meaningless if the treatment order could not be issued absent hospital consent
to all its terms and conditions.  Rather, the scheme provides a stay and
contemplates a hospital appeal precisely because certain “conditions” of the
treatment order ― including the timing ― are decided by the court. 


                    Thus
while bed shortages are not a basis for the hospital to refuse consent, they
are part of the circumstances in which the judge exercises her discretion in
deciding the start date of a treatment order.  If the hospital is concerned
about bed unavailability, or its ability to safely carry out the treatment
immediately, the discussion about triage can take place before the judge. In
setting the start date for treatment, the judge will consider bed shortages,
but she does so along with the liberty, security and procedural fairness
interests of the accused, as well as assessing the impact on the accused of
waiting in jail and the delays to the trial.  If the court attaches what the
hospital considers to be unreasonable conditions to a treatment order, the
hospital may exercise its statutory right of appeal, and benefit from the
automatic stay.

                    The
Court of Appeal was correct in deciding that the “forthwith” order in this case
should not have been issued; however, this is not because the trial judge
lacked jurisdiction to issue a treatment order.  Rather, the hearing judge’s
decision regarding the timing of the treatment order was not reasonable.

I.         
Introduction

[1]                             
When an accused person has been found unfit to
stand trial and the other statutory requirements have been met, the court may
make a disposition order directing that treatment be carried out for a
specified period not exceeding 60 days and on such conditions as the judge
considers appropriate for the purpose of making the accused fit to stand trial.
The disposition order may not be made, however, without the consent of either
the person in charge of the hospital where the accused is to be treated or the
person to whom responsibility for the treatment of the accused has been
assigned. (For ease of reference, we will refer to this as the hospital’s
consent.)

[2]                             
The main issue on appeal is whether, as the
appellant contends, the court may make a disposition order directing that
treatment begin immediately even though the hospital or treating physician does
not consent to that disposition.  In our view, the answer to this question is
“no” in all but the rare case in which a delay in treatment would breach the
accused’s rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and
an order for immediate treatment is an appropriate and just remedy for that
breach. 

[3]                             
Thus, while we would dismiss the appeal, we
respectfully disagree with our colleague Karakatsanis J. that the hospital’s
consent relates only to the treatment ordered in the disposition and not to the
disposition order itself. As we see it, that reading of the relevant provisions
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , cannot be reconciled
with its unambiguous text. The Code specifically distinguishes between
consent to treatment and consent to the disposition and explicitly requires
that a disposition may not be made without the hospital’s consent. The hospital
consent is required for the disposition order in its entirety, not simply to
the treatment aspect of it. Read any other way, the appeal provisions relating
to dispositions are incoherent. Moreover, the interpretation that we favour is
consistent with the purpose of the scheme and the broader context in which it
exists.

[4]                             
The specific provisions of the Criminal Code 
dealing with UST accused that are relevant to this appeal are ss. 672.58  and
672.62 . As we shall see, these provisions make clear that while the court may
not make a disposition — which may include not only the treatment, but also the
period of treatment and other conditions which the court considers appropriate
— without the hospital’s consent, the accused’s consent is dispensed with in
relation only to the treatment to “be carried out pursuant to a
disposition”.

      672.58 [Treatment disposition] Where a verdict of unfit to stand
trial is rendered and the court has not made a disposition under section 672.54
in respect of an accused, the court may, on application by the prosecutor, by
order, direct that treatment of the accused be carried out for a specified
period not exceeding sixty days, subject to such conditions as the court
considers appropriate and, where the accused is not detained in custody,
direct that the accused submit to that treatment by the person or at the
hospital specified.

 

      672.62 (1) [Consent of hospital required for treatment] No court shall
make a disposition under section 672.58  without the consent of

 

(a)
the person in charge of the hospital where the accused is to be treated; or

 

(b)
the person to whom responsibility for the treatment of the accused is assigned
by the court.

 

      (2)
[Consent of accused not required for treatment] The court may direct that
treatment of an accused be carried out pursuant to a disposition made under
section 672.58  without the consent of the accused . . . .

Other relevant provisions
referred to in these reasons are set out in the Appendix. 

II.      
Facts, Proceedings and Issues

[5]                             
The appellant was charged with sexual assault. 
When he appeared in court, he was in a psychotic state and was declared unfit
to stand trial (“UST”).  Crown counsel recommended a treatment order.  When
asked about security concerns, a psychiatrist testified that treatment at Oak
Ridge, a facility at the Mental Health Centre Penetanguishene (“MHCP”), would
make more sense than the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (“CAMH”),
another hospital with which he had experience.  The Crown stated that a bed
would be available at Oak Ridge no later than the 19th of April which was six
days after the date of the hearing. The hearing judge, Hogan J., issued a
“forthwith” treatment order pursuant to s. 672.58  of the Criminal Code  directing
that the appellant shall be treated at “CAMH or designate (preferably Oakridge
[sic]”, he shall remain in custody at “CAMH or designate”, and he shall
“be taken directly from court to the designated hospital and from hospital
directly back to court” and not to “a jail or correctional facility under any
circumstances” (A.R., vol. I, at p. 2).

[6]                             
Reasons for judgment were not issued but during
the proceedings, the hearing judge said:

When I
made a determination that as of today this individual needs to have a treatment
order[,] I have based that on expert psychiatric opinion.  I would be negligent
and derelict in my duty and my responsibilities [i]f I were to say, well it is
okay, he has — you know he is the subject of a treatment order which I consider
to be an extreme measure . . . .

 

. .
.

 

      . . .
I make orders that people [are] against sometimes, not always, but essentially
against their will have drugs administered to them. That is extraordinarily
serious and we do that because we feel it is absolutely necessary and that
means now, not a week from now and I understand that, as I said, and I do not
do it lightly when I do things like this, but I understand it does create
disruption. But, you know, it would probably be better if he is in a bed in the
hall of a psychiatric hospital than if he is in the medical unit not getting
what I have been told is absolutely necessary treatment for, you know, a week. 

 

. . .

 

      . .
. if it is okay to have him wait a week then we should not be asking for
treatment orders today and I should not be making them; it is not okay.

 

. .
.

 

      . . .
if we are prepared to do something as serious as make treatment orders and then
say, but it is okay they can sit in a jail bed.  That is not appropriate.  We
have a mental health system here that is supposed to treat people and you know
ordering treatment orders is one of the most serious things we can do in terms
of the mental health system and yet we cannot seem to provide a bed for them to
get treated in and that is totally unacceptable.  And I understand the argument
but it is not an argument that carries any weight with
me . . . .

 

. .
.

 

      . . .
I am prepared to be flexible where he goes as long as it is a hospital.  I know
Oak Ridge is preferable but in these circumstances I can be flexible about
that. 

 

      . . . so if I say CAMH or
designate; I will ask that the order say preferably Oak Ridge, but I think
getting him to a hospital at least, initially, is probably the most important
thing . . . . [A.R., vol. I, at pp. 7-11]

[7]                             
Court services delivered the appellant to the
Mental Health Centre Penetanguishene and left him in a hallway.

[8]                             
The respondent hospitals appealed the timing
aspect of the disposition under s. 672.72(1) which provides for appeals
“against a disposition . . . by a court”.  (We note that if
the appellant is right that a “disposition” does not include timing, there
would be no right of appeal of the timing aspect of the disposition order under
this provision. No one has ever taken this position.) Notwithstanding that the
appellant thereafter was treated, eventually returned to court, and the charge was
stayed by the time the appeal began, the Court of Appeal proceeded to determine
that ss. 672.58  and 672.62(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  engage the
rights to liberty and security of the person guaranteed under s. 7  of the Charter ,
but do not violate principles of fundamental justice. 

[9]                             
The Court of Appeal held that Hogan J. erred by
acting on the basis that the consent requirement had been satisfied.  It held
that there was never any doubt that CAMH or its designate, MHCP, would admit
the appellant. It noted that a memorandum of understanding between CAMH and 102
Mental Health Court provided a form of general consent to the placement and
treatment of accused persons.  It held that this memorandum implicitly provided
that hospitals would have the necessary facilities, personnel, and resources
for effective and safe treatment.  It held that this implied that admission
would be withheld when a bed was not available for safety reasons. It held that
consent to treat a patient when a bed becomes available is not consent to
accept a patient forthwith.

[10]                         
The Court of Appeal accepted that a mentally
unfit accused person’s right to liberty and security of the person is engaged but that the consent requirement in s. 672.62(1) (a)
does not violate the principle of fundamental justice requiring procedural
fairness because the consent requirement responds to a general reluctance in
law to compel a medical practitioner or hospital authorities to administer
treatment; it responds to the common law’s unwillingness to compel someone to
submit involuntarily to medical treatment by assuring that “the treatment order
process is initiated and . . . likely to produce positive
results” (para. 52); it responds to the significant risks to patients and
to medical personnel, hospital staff and others when potentially violent
psychotic patients are detained in settings where proper facilities are not
available; and it permits Ontario’s forensic psychiatric facilities to
co-operate in triaging the needs of UST and NCR accused, matters not within the
knowledge of the courts. The Court of Appeal concluded that it is not unreasonable that
a UST accused may have to wait on some occasions for a short period of time
until a bed becomes available in a designated psychiatric facility and there
was no evidence that a six-day delay in starting treatment might impair the
likelihood of the appellant becoming fit to stand trial. 

[11]                         
The Court of Appeal also held that s. 672.62(1) (a)
is not void for vagueness or arbitrariness.

[12]                         
On the further appeal to this Court, the
appellant raises two main questions concerning the scope of the hospital’s
required consent:

1.           
Does the consent requirement relate to the
timing of carrying out the order or just to the treatment itself?

2.           
If the consent requirement relates to the timing
of carrying out the order, does the s. 672.58  order violate s. 7  of the Charter ?


III.    Analysis

A.       Does the Consent Requirement Relate to Timing?

(1)        
The Approach to Statutory Interpretation

[13]                         
In our view, the meaning of the relevant
provisions, supported by an understanding of their full context, leads to the
conclusion that the hospital or person in charge of treatment must consent to
all the terms of a disposition ordering treatment and, if there is no consent,
the order cannot be made. The terms of the order include when it is to be
carried out and therefore consent relates to timing.

[14]                         
This issue raises a question of statutory
interpretation which must be resolved according to the modern principle of
statutory interpretation: “the words of an Act are to be read in their entire
context, in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme
of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament” (R.
Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (5th ed. 2008), at p.
1, citing E. A. Driedger, The Construction of Statutes (1974), at
p. 67). We underline that the starting point is the text of the provisions
in their grammatical and ordinary sense. This is especially the case where, as
here, the key term “disposition” is expressly defined in the statute. In our
view, the appellant fails to do this.

(2)        
Statutory Context and Statutory Text

[15]                         
It is helpful to begin by putting the most
relevant provisions in their wider statutory context. The relevant provisions
are found within Part XX.1 of the Code which deals with mental disorder.
The twin purposes of this Part of the Code are protection of the public
and fair treatment, in the sense of procedural fairness, of the accused:  Winko
v. British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625,
at paras. 20, 21 and 44; see also Mazzei v. British Columbia (Director of
Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services), 2006 SCC 7, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 326, at
para. 27. 

[16]                         
The Code provides that no court shall
make a “disposition” under s. 672.58  without the consent of the hospital
or person in charge of treatment. The provisions respecting “dispositions” are
central to the legislative scheme set out in Part XX.1 of the Code. Several
provisions give both a court and a Review Board the authority to make various
dispositions in relation to persons falling within the ambit of Part XX.1. 
Under the scheme, courts reach a “verdict” (respecting fitness to stand trial
and criminal responsibility), both courts and Review Boards make a
“disposition” (in relation to persons found UST and not criminally responsible)
and Review Boards make a “placement decision” (with respect to a “dual status
offender”, that is, a person who is both serving a sentence of imprisonment and
is subject to a custodial disposition under Part XX.1). 

[17]                         
The key point is that “disposition” is a
technical term, used throughout Part XX.1. While a disposition ordering
treatment may be referred to as a “treatment order” in colloquial language,
there is no such thing provided for in the Code.  “Disposition” is a
defined term.  In the context of dispositions made by courts, a “disposition”
is defined by s. 672.1 as meaning “an order made by a court” under
s. 672.54  or s. 672.58 , the latter being the provision that concerns us
here.  

[18]                         
As s. 672.58 makes clear, a “disposition”
ordering treatment under that section necessarily includes aspects relating to
timing:  it must set out a “specified period not exceeding sixty days”
and it may be made “subject to such conditions as the court considers
appropriate”, including presumably conditions related to timing.  Moreover, a
disposition comes into force on the day on which it is made or on any later day
that the court specifies: s. 672.63.  

[19]                         
All of this makes it clear that a “disposition”
under s. 672.58 necessarily has a temporal aspect both as to its beginning and
its ending and may include other conditions that the court considers it
appropriate to impose. 

[20]                         
The Code provides that “[n]o court shall make a
disposition under section 672.58 without the consent of (a) the
person in charge of the hospital where the accused is to be treated; or (b)
the person to whom responsibility for the treatment of the accused is assigned
by the court”: s. 672.62. At paragraph 109, our colleague suggests that s.
672.62 provides for hospital consent with respect to only the “treatment”
aspect of the disposition, and not the “disposition” generally. With respect,
this is not how we read s. 672.62. If “[n]o court shall make a disposition
. . . without . . . consent”, then the consent relates to
the disposition. Further, as just discussed, a “disposition under section
672.58” necessarily has a temporal element. The hospital must consent to the
“disposition”; there is nothing in the text to suggest that this requirement
should be given anything other than its defined meaning in the Code.
Consent is required to a “disposition” and “disposition” is defined to mean “an
order made by a court under section 672.58”: s. 672.1. Thus the hospital’s
consent is required to the disposition which the court makes under s. 672.58,
not simply to certain aspects of it.

[21]                         
This conclusion is supported by the meaning of
the word “consent” and the context in which it is used in these provisions.

[22]                         
The ordinary meaning of the word “consent” in
the context of medical treatment is understood to be voluntary agreement to a
medical course of action made with an appreciation of all material information
and risks. The starting date of treatment is a material fact, going to the
availability of the necessary bed and staff ready to execute the treatment
order safely.

[23]                         
The context in which the word “consent” is used
in this scheme supports this broad understanding of the term.  Where the Code
intends to differentiate between consent to treatment and consent to a
disposition order, it does so expressly.  For example, in s. 672.62 , subsection
1  deals with the hospital’s consent to “a disposition” whereas subsection 2
deals with the accused’s consent to “treatment . . . pursuant to a
disposition”.  Had the intention been to simply require the hospital’s consent
to the proposed treatment, language similar to that used in subsection 2, which
links consent only to the treatment, could have made that intent clear. 
Instead, subsection 1 links the hospital’s consent to the “disposition” not
merely to the “treatment of an accused . . . carried out pursuant to
a disposition” as in subsection 2. This demonstrates that Parliament, which
took care to define the term “disposition”, used the term in its defined sense
— as it did in relation to hospital consent under s. 672.62(1)  — and used
different language to refer only to the treatment component of a disposition —
as it did in relation to the accused’s consent in s. 672.62(2). 

[24]                         
Given that “disposition” is a defined term
meaning the “order made by a court under section 672.58” and the Code
explicitly requires the hospital’s consent to a disposition under that section,
we see no possible ambiguity in the text of these provisions. Any possible
doubt is dispelled by the clear distinction in s. 672.62 between, on the one
hand, the hospital’s consent to the “disposition” which is required under s.
672.62(1)  and, on the other hand, the accused’s consent to “treatment
. . . carried out pursuant to a disposition” which is not required.
We do not see how Parliament could have more clearly expressed its intent that
the hospital’s consent in s. 672.62(1)  relates to all the provisions of the
disposition, including when treatment will begin as well as what is to be done.


[25]                         
Our colleague Karakatsanis J. reads the appeal
provisions in Part XX.1 as supporting the appellant’s view that consent to a
disposition order does not require consent to the timing aspects of the
disposition order. We respectfully disagree.  As we see it, the interpretation
that we propose is reinforced, not weakened, by the
appeal provisions in Part XX.1. Under s. 672.72(1), “[a]ny party may appeal
against a disposition made by a court . . . on any ground of appeal
that raises a question of law or fact alone or of mixed law and fact.”  This,
of course, is the provision that allowed the hospital in this case to appeal
the judge’s “forthwith” disposition order.  However, the appellant contends
that the “disposition” under s. 672.58 does not include the timing of the
treatment which is ordered. It follows that, on the appellant’s reading of the Code,
the term “disposition” means something different in ss. 672.58 and 672.62 than
it does in s. 672.72.  If, as the appellant contends, consent to a
“disposition” as required by s. 672.62 does not require consent as to timing of
treatment, it must follow that an appeal under s. 672.72 from a “disposition”
cannot relate to the timing of the treatment either. Respectfully, this simply
cannot be the case. “Disposition” is a defined term: it means an “order made by
a court under section 672.58”.  The term “disposition” must bear this meaning
everywhere it is used in Part XX.1 of the Code. The appellant offers no
explanation as to why the express definition of the term applies in the appeal
provisions but not in the treatment disposition provisions even though both the
consent requirement and the right of appeal relate to a disposition under s.
672.58. 

[26]                         
We also, respectfully, cannot agree that if the
hospital’s consent were required to the timing aspect of a disposition, there
would be no point in providing the hospital with a right of appeal as it could
simply refuse to consent. This case shows that this line of argument is
incorrect. The appeal process under Part XX.1 permitted
the judge’s forthwith order in this case to be appealed and her legal error in
making it to be corrected on appeal.   

[27]                         
The appellant argues that consent in relation to
a s. 672.58 disposition order must not include timing because the institutions
do not have any right to refuse to accept immediately patients on other
court-ordered placements as, for example, under s. 672.11 (psychiatric
assessments) and s. 672.54(c) and s. 672.46(2)  (transfers to a
psychiatric institution or to a hospital). In effect, the appellant urges us to
infer from the fact that hospital consent to timing is not required in these
situations that it similarly should not be required under s. 672.62. We cannot
agree.  

[28]                         
Section 672.58 is unique in that it requires an
accused to be subject to treatment and authorizes medical personnel to
administer it without the accused’s consent. The section is not concerned
simply with admission but with treatment upon admission. Thus, the provision
deals with distinct situations and this argues against drawing any inference
from distinct and different provisions about the meaning of this one. Moreover,
any potential inference that might otherwise be drawn from the absence of a
consent requirement in these other provisions is negated by the language in s.
672.62. It expressly makes the hospital’s consent relate to the disposition
order itself, not simply to the treatment to be carried out pursuant to it.

(3)        
The Broader Context

[29]                         
The interpretation that we arrive at looking at
the text of the provisions in their statutory context is reinforced by other,
broader contextual considerations. We will refer to the purpose of the scheme
and the artificiality of separating “treatment” from “timing” in this context.

[30]                         
We agree with the respondent Attorney General of
Ontario that the purposes of this scheme point to a broad understanding of the
requirement for hospital consent.

[31]                         
An order under s. 672.58 is extraordinary in at
least two respects. First, it directs that treatment of an accused be carried
out without the accused’s consent. The exceptional nature of this power was
noted by the then Justice Minister Kim Campbell when she introduced the
legislation in 1991:

At
present, there is no power to order a person detained pursuant to a
Lieutenant-Governor’s warrant to submit to treatment involuntarily.  Apart from
emergency, there is no power to treat an accused without obtaining consent. We
have concluded that the general rule preventing the involuntary treatment of
mentally disordered accused ought to be preserved.  However, subject to
stringent safeguards, the bill permits a court to order involuntary
treatment to make the accused fit to stand trial, thereby avoiding a
potentially lengthy period of detention. [Emphasis added.] 

 

(House
of Commons Debates, vol. 3, 3rd Sess., 34th Parl., October 4, 1991, at pp.
3297-98)

[32]                         
The Code establishes a number of special
protections that highlight the unusual nature of this power. As provided for in
s. 672.59, the order may only be made if the court is satisfied on the basis of
testimony from a medical practitioner that a specific treatment should be
administered for the purpose of making the accused fit to stand trial. That testimony
must fulfill the detailed criteria set out in s. 672.59(2), including that the
treatment is the least restrictive and least intrusive that could be specified
for the purpose and that the risk of harm to the accused is not
disproportionate to its anticipated benefit.  The accused has important
procedural rights including notice, and the right to challenge the application
and certain treatments including the performance of psychosurgery or
electro-convulsive therapy are not permitted: ss. 672.6 and 672.61.

[33]                         
Second, by necessary implication, it authorizes
medical personnel to carry out that treatment against the accused’s wishes.
This is a remarkable provision, given that informed consent of the patient is
generally the sine qua non of medical treatment. However, s. 672.62, by
requiring consent of the hospital or the person responsible for the accused’s
treatment, makes it clear that this provision does not oblige them to carry out
the court’s disposition order without their consent.  As the Court noted in Mazzei,
doing so “would constitute interference with the authority and responsibility
of hospital authorities to provide medical services to persons in their custody
according to their view of what is appropriate and effective”: para. 34
(emphasis in original).

[34]                         
That understanding serves the purpose of
safeguarding the accused; hospital consent is one of the “stringent safeguards”
referred to by Minister Campbell and is designed to ensure that the order can
be carried out safely, both with regard to the accused, other patients and
medical personnel. Parliament also intended to respect the important role of
the treatment provider and to acknowledge how intrusive these provisions are,
not only in relation to the accused but in relation to the institutions and personnel
who are called on to administer treatment against the patient’s will.  The
provisions recognize the importance of the treatment provider’s clinical
judgment, not only as to the particular treatment but as to the location, among
those designated by the Minister of Health, at which it is to be carried out.

[35]                         
This broad understanding of the scope of the
required consent is reinforced by the practical realities of providing
involuntary treatment to potentially dangerous individuals. The timing of a
treatment order for UST accused must be an element of the hospital’s consent
because, from the hospital’s perspective, the time at which treatment is to be
provided is inextricably linked to the hospital’s ability to provide treatment
safely and effectively. The context of the involuntary treatment of a UST
accused involves a number of safety considerations. Special precautions must be
made when treating these individuals in order to protect the accused, other
patients, staff and the public at large. These measures include all rooms being
designed for single occupancy only, double air locking doors, furniture
specially designed so it cannot be used as a weapon, specially trained staff,
perimeter security, sally ports and specialized automated locking doors. If these
facilities are not available at a given time, these safety concerns cannot be
adequately met and the treatment cannot be provided safely. 

[36]                         
The appellant would have us draw a line between
“suitability of treatment” — that is, whether a specific UST accused will
benefit from the type of treatment recommended to which the hospital must
consent — and “timing of treatment” as to which its consent is not required.
However, this is an artificial distinction in the real world of involuntary
hospital treatment. It ignores the fact that the ability of the hospital to
administer the suitable treatment is inextricably linked to whether it has the
facilities and personnel available to do so. A treatment is not suitable if it
cannot be administered. 

[37]                         
The artificiality of the distinction between
“suitability” and “timing” can be seen by looking at the difference between a
hospital that does not have the facilities at all and a hospital that does not
have the facilities available “forthwith”. Not all hospitals are equipped to
handle the most dangerous offenders; they simply do not have the appropriate
facilities. Surely, a hospital can refuse to consent to treat a very dangerous
offender if it does not have the appropriate facilities to handle him or her.
This would not be considered a question of timing. Similarly, a hospital can
acknowledge that a UST accused needs specific treatment, but recognize it does
not have the proper facilities to treat him or her immediately. In both these
cases, the hospital would be unable to provide safe treatment and therefore
would be entitled to withhold consent under s. 672.62(1)  because the hospital
is not suited to safely treat the UST accused at that time. Timing is therefore
an essential element of suitability and not distinct from it. Consent under s.
672.62(1) of the Code must therefore include timing.

[38]                         
Interpreting consent to exclude the element of
timing, as the appellant would have us do, leaves allocation of scarce medical
and hospital resources to those needing treatment squarely in the hands of the
courts. This undermines the ability of hospitals to make medical triage
decisions, which could not have been the intent of Parliament in enacting s.
672.62(1) of the Code. In making a “forthwith” treatment order, judges
are necessarily deciding who will not get treatment forthwith just as
they are deciding who will.  Judges would be deciding who should get medical
treatment first, but without any overall sense of the needs and priorities of
others who their “forthwith” orders are displacing. Judges would, in effect, be
making medical triage decisions but without the benefit of being informed about
the other patients awaiting attention. 

[39]                         
This scheme requires a co-operative and mutually
respectful approach if it is to function, and we encourage that approach.
However, our colleague’s suggestion at paras. 118 and 122 of her reasons that
judges should routinely inquire into matters of bed availability or the
hospital’s ability to safely carry out treatment immediately cannot have been
Parliament’s intent in enacting the hospital consent provision. It does not
strike us as likely that this scheme intended that the scarce resources of both
the courts and the health care system should be devoted to judges micromanaging
medical triage decisions and health care providers defending their triage
decisions in court. Moreover, a judge’s decision to overrule the hospital on
these matters may well affect the important rights and interests of other
people needing treatment.  Quite apart from the impracticality of seeing the
judge’s role in this way, it also undermines rather than furthers the broader
objectives of protecting the rights of the accused as well as those of others
needing treatment and the broader public. We do not think, with respect, that
these are matters that Parliament intended should routinely be decided by
judges making disposition orders under s. 672.58  of the Criminal Code .  

(4)        
Conclusion 

[40]                         
We conclude that the text, context and purpose
of the provisions show that the hospital’s consent is required in relation to
all the aspects of the disposition order made under s. 672.58  and, absent that
consent, the court may not make the order.  This conclusion is subject only to
what we will say in the next section of our reasons in relation to circumstances
in which a judge is convinced that the hospital’s refusal of consent breaches
the accused’s Charter  rights and that an order for immediate treatment
is an appropriate and just remedy for that breach.

B.       The Consent Requirement and Section 7  of the Charter 

[41]                         
We agree with the Court of Appeal that the
consent requirement does not deprive the accused of procedural fairness and
that it is not unconstitutionally vague or arbitrary. To the extent that it has
any potential to infringe the accused’s s. 7  rights, we agree with the
respondent CAMH that any potential violation of s. 7  rights results from the
exercise of the hospital’s discretion to withhold consent conferred in s.
672.62(1)  in a particular case, and is not inherent in the section itself.

[42]                         
No such breach was established. As the Court of
Appeal pointed out, there is no evidence that a six-day delay in starting
treatment might impair the likelihood of the appellant becoming fit to stand
trial within the 60-day statutory window provided in s. 672.59(2), and there is
no suggestion that the six-day delay in any other respect infringed the
appellant’s right to life, liberty or security of the person. There is,
accordingly, no basis on which to find that the hospital’s exercise of
discretion not to consent to immediate admission for treatment had any
unconstitutional effects on the appellant. 

[43]                         
That said, although we think it would be
exceedingly rare, we would not rule out this possibility in other cases. A
judge proposing to make a disposition is entitled to consider, in an
appropriate case, whether a refusal of consent will have the effect of
unconstitutionally limiting the accused’s rights to life, liberty or security
of the person in a fashion that does not accord with the principles of
fundamental justice. If so persuaded, the judge would also be entitled to
consider whether ordering an immediate admission would constitute an
appropriate and just remedy for that breach. While we think the circumstances
under which this inquiry is appropriate will be rare, the Charter 
assures that judges and not the person in charge of the hospital where the
accused is to be treated will have the last word in terms of the disposition
order where the accused’s Charter  rights would otherwise be
compromised.  That, however, is not this case.

IV.    Disposition

[44]                         
We would dismiss the appeal without costs. 

                    The
reasons of McLachlin C.J. and Moldaver, Karakatsanis and Wagner JJ. were
delivered by

                     Karakatsanis J.  — 

I.         
Overview 

[45]                         
When an accused person is found unfit to stand
trial under Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , the
court may order involuntary treatment to render that person fit for trial,
provided that the hospital administering the treatment consents.  Often, the
hospital withholds its consent until mental health beds become available. 
Consequently, treatment cannot always start immediately.

[46]                         
As a result, the unfit accused waits in line
― typically in jail ― for a bed to become free, and both treatment
and the trial are delayed.  Bed shortages in mental health hospitals thus
create an ongoing tension between medical resource constraints and the
accused’s medical, legal and liberty interests.

[47]                         
In this case, the accused was found unfit to
stand trial.  The hospital indicated that it would not have a bed available for
six days, but the hearing judge nonetheless issued a treatment order directing
that the accused be taken to hospital “forthwith”.  The hospital appealed, and
the Court of Appeal concluded that since the hospital had not consented to the
start date of the order, the judge did not have the jurisdiction to issue the
treatment order.  Further, the Court of Appeal found that the consent
provisions did not violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

[48]                         
The issue in this case is whether it is the
court or the hospital that has the final say about when treatment shall
commence when faced with bed shortages.  Can a valid treatment order issue,
absent hospital consent as to the timing of the order?  The answer depends on
the scope of hospital consent required before a treatment order can be made
under Part XX.1 of the Code.

[49]                         
The respondents, the Centre for Addiction and
Mental Health (CAMH), the Mental Health Centre Penetanguishene (MHCP), and the
Attorney General of Ontario, say that the hospital’s right to consent means
that it must agree to all the terms and conditions of the treatment order
before it can be issued.  When there are bed shortages, hospitals have
the right to determine when treatment will commence.  Orders for treatment to
start “forthwith” can result in overcrowding, compromising the safety of
patients and staff, and the priority of other patients.  Hospitals are in the
best position to triage patients, and they can withhold consent on that basis.

[50]                         
The appellant, Mr. Conception, says that the
judge must have the final say as to when treatment will commence.  The hospital
would only be able to assess the medical interests of the accused, in relation
to other (waiting) patients, whereas the judge is able to consider all the
interests at stake, including the alternative detention or release arrangements
for the accused.

[51]                         
For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the
hospital’s consent is not required to all the terms and conditions of the treatment
order.  When the consent requirement is read in its proper statutory context,
it is clear that hospital consent is required for the specified treatment.  The
hospital must be willing, on medical grounds, to administer the particular
treatment.

[52]                         
Bed shortages and patient wait lists ― the
need to manage general resource pressures ― do not permit a hospital to
refuse, or defer, consent.  It is the judge who will consider bed availability,
along with the accused’s liberty and security interests and the need for
procedural fairness, in determining the timing of the treatment order.  The
hospital can advise the judge of any concerns about its ability to safely carry
out the treatment on the date specified by the judge, even if it were to give
the accused priority.  Should the hospital consider the timing unreasonable, it
may appeal the judge’s decision and the treatment order will be automatically
stayed.

[53]                         
I agree with the Court of Appeal that the order
in this case should not have been issued.  However, while the Court of Appeal
reasoned that consent is an “umbrella” term, requiring agreement with all
aspects of the treatment order, including timing, I conclude that consent is
focussed only on the specified treatment.  Because of my conclusions on the meaning
of “consent”, I need not consider the parties’ arguments regarding the Charter .

II.          
History of the Proceedings

[54]                         
Mr. Conception was arrested on a charge of
sexual assault after grabbing the breast of a staff
member at the CAMH while receiving treatment there.  He appeared in court on
April 13, 2010, the day after his arrest, and Hogan J. found him unfit to stand
trial.  Following the testimony of the CAMH forensic psychiatrist and the
recommendation of Crown counsel, the judge decided to issue a treatment order.

[55]                         
Crown counsel raised the issues of bed
availability and safety.  The psychiatrist testified that treatment would be
more appropriate at MHCP because the accused’s charge related to a staff member
at CAMH.  Crown counsel then relayed the information, received from CAMH’s bed
coordinator, that a bed would be available at MHCP within six days.[1]

[56]                         
The judge asked why she should leave it to
hospital administrators to determine priority.  Crown counsel submitted that
the result of ordering that the accused receive a bed today would be to
displace someone else on the waiting list.  Not persuaded, the judge noted:

. . . I make
orders that people against . . . their will have drugs administered to them. 
That is extraordinarily serious and we do that because we feel it is absolutely
necessary and that means now, not a week from now and I understand that, as I
said, and I do not do it lightly when I do things like this, but I understand
it does create disruption.  But, you know, it would probably be better if he is
in a bed in the hall of a psychiatric hospital than if he is in the medical
unit [of a jail] not getting what I have been told is absolutely necessary
treatment for, you know, a week.  [A.R., vol. I, at pp. 8-9]

[57]                         
The judge issued a treatment order which directed
that Mr. Conception “be taken directly from court to the designated hospital
and from hospital directly back to court.  Accused is not to be taken to a jail
or correctional facility under any circumstances.”[2]  Court Services
personnel delivered the appellant to MHCP and left him in a hallway.

[58]                         
The hospitals, CAMH and MHCP, appealed the
treatment order pursuant to s. 672.72 of the Code.  The order was
automatically stayed when the appeal was launched, pursuant to s. 672.75 of the
Code.  The appellant was eventually treated starting April 26, 2010, and
his charges were stayed in June 2011.[3] 
While the validity of the treatment order is now moot, all parties agreed that
the underlying issues require resolution.

[59]                         
In May 2012, the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed
the appeal and set aside the treatment order.[4] 
The court concluded that the judge did not have the jurisdiction to issue the
treatment order without the consent of the hospital and that the hospital had
the right to withhold consent to any term and condition including the
commencement of the treatment period.

III.       
The Statutory Regime

A.          
Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code 

[60]                         
Part XX.1 of the Code deals with persons
in the criminal justice system who are experiencing a mental health disorder. 
It authorizes courts to order assessments of accused persons who may be unfit
to stand trial, or not criminally responsible for an offence, and to make appropriate
dispositions in each case.  It gives courts or Review Boards oversight of
mentally ill accused who have been conditionally released or detained.

B.           
Unfit to Stand Trial Regime

[61]                         
The cognitive threshold for fitness to stand
trial is very low.  A person could be ill enough to require civil commitment,
but still be considered fit.[5] 
The treatment order regime in Part XX.1 is intended only to bring mentally ill
accused persons to the cognitive threshold required to proceed to trial.

[62]                         
The issue of fitness may arise at any stage of
the proceedings if the court has reasonable grounds to believe the accused is
unfit to stand trial.  The court may order an assessment (ss. 672.11 and
672.12) to determine whether the accused is unfit to stand trial; subject to
some exceptions, the assessment must be completed within five days (s.
672.14).  Subsequent to the assessment, the court may direct a trial of the
accused’s fitness (s. 672.23).

[63]                         
When an accused is found to be unfit to stand
trial, the court may make a treatment order under s. 672.58  to render the
accused fit for trial.

C.           
Treatment Order Regime

[64]                         
A court’s discretion under s. 672.58  to order
treatment to render an individual fit for trial is subject to stringent
safeguards and timelines.

[65]                         
Given the potential for involuntary medical
treatment, one such safeguard is the requirement for hospital consent set out
in s. 672.62(1) (a).  Relevant provisions are as follows:

672.58 [Treatment disposition] Where a
verdict of unfit to stand trial is rendered and the court has not made a
disposition under section 672.54 in respect of an accused, the court may, on
application by the prosecutor, by order, direct that treatment of the accused
be carried out for a specified period not exceeding sixty days, subject to such
conditions as the court considers appropriate and, where the accused is not
detained in custody, direct that the accused submit to that treatment by the
person or at the hospital specified.

 

. . .

 

672.62 (1) [Consent of hospital required
for treatment] No court shall make a disposition under section 672.58  without
the consent of

 

(a) the person in charge of the hospital where the accused is
to be treated; or

 

(b) the person to whom responsibility for the treatment of
the accused is assigned by the court.

 

(2) [Consent of accused not required for treatment] The court may
direct that treatment of an accused be carried out pursuant to a disposition
made under section 672.58  without the consent of the accused or a person who,
according to the laws of the province where the disposition is made, is
authorized to consent for the accused.

 

672.63 [Effective date of disposition] A
disposition shall come into force on the day on which it is made or on any
later day that the court or Review Board specifies in it, and shall remain in
force until the Review Board holds a hearing to review the disposition and
makes another disposition.

[66]                         
Pursuant to s. 672.1, both the person in charge of
the affected hospital and the accused are “party” to s. 672.58  treatment orders,
and may therefore appeal against a treatment order to the Court of Appeal (ss.
672.1 and 672.72).  Filing of such an appeal automatically suspends the
application of the order pending the determination of the appeal (s. 672.75).

IV.       
The Broader Factual Context

A.          
The 102 Court-CAMH System

[67]                         
The 102 Court is a specialized Mental Health
Court in Toronto.  It applies the provisions of Part XX.1 of the Criminal
Code  to mentally disordered accused persons.

[68]                         
Most unfit accused suffer from a psychotic
illness.  The treatment required to make an individual fit to stand trial is
generally antipsychotic medications provided in a safe context.[6]

[69]                         
Toronto’s CAMH works cooperatively with 102
Court to admit and treat accused persons subject to treatment orders.  A
psychiatrist from CAMH attends 102 Court five afternoons per week to conduct
on-site assessments of mentally ill accused persons’ fitness to stand trial.  A
provincial forensic bed registry tracks the availability of beds and is
available to Crown counsel and the hospitals.  CAMH’s Court Liaison is usually
present in 102 Court to assist with locating bed placements and predicting wait
times,[7]
and has the delegated authority to give the hospital’s consent to the treatment
order, typically by stating the estimated day that the hospital will be able to
admit the person.[8]

[70]                         
Concerned about mentally ill accused waiting in
jail until a treatment bed became available, some 102 Court judges began
issuing “forthwith” orders, ordering that the accused be sent to hospital
immediately without a stop-over in jail.[9]

[71]                         
Despite substantial increases in the number of
forensic beds and reductions in wait times, bed shortages mean that the
hospitals are not always able to accommodate the needs of the criminal justice
system on the timelines expected by the courts.

B.           
Current Consent Protocols

[72]                         
CAMH’s Statement of Principles and Practices for
Admission Prioritization was introduced in October 2010, several months after
Mr. Conception’s treatment order was issued.[10]  It applies to all
admissions and is a response to the constraints of waitlists and frequent
over-capacity of inpatient units.

[73]                         
The first Principle is “[n]o one waits who
cannot”.[11] 
This is explained: “If the accused is acutely mentally unwell and requires
immediate hospitalisation, or if the accused is subject to Court orders or
Dispositions of the [Ontario Review Board] which do not permit other placements,
admission is arranged expeditiously” (emphasis added).[12]  Under Principle 2,
“less seriously unwell persons” are generally admitted according to the date of
the order or request, “while allowing flexibility for clinical need”.[13]

[74]                         
With respect to Principle 4, the Statement
says:  “It will be presumed by the court that [the hospitals] will consent to
treat (s.672.62) all accused who have been found ‘unfit to stand trial’” where
the criteria specified in the Code (under s. 672.59) are met.  Dr.
Simpson, the Person in Charge of CAMH, testified that this presumption of
consent is qualified, subject to bed availability.[14]

[75]                         
However, Dr. Simpson also emphasized that
“clinical emergency trumps all other things”[15]
and “[n]o one waits who cannot”.[16] 
If there is no bed available for a clinical emergency, CAMH may use one of its
seclusion rooms, provided doing so does not endanger other patients.[17]

C.           
Consequences of Delay:  Waiting in Jail

[76]                         
In the 102 Court-CAMH system, where a forensic
bed is unavailable or is being held for another patient, unfit accused persons
awaiting treatment are usually remanded to wait in jail.[18]

[77]                         
Mentally disordered patients do not typically
fare well as inmates.  They are frequently victims of intimidation and violence
and are more likely than the general prison population to attempt suicide,
self-harm, or self-destructive behaviour.  An experienced correctional officer
testified in this case that the mental health care needs of mentally ill
accused persons in provincial jail are frequently neglected due to lack of
special units and trained personnel.[19] 
Fewer than one-third of Ontario provincial jails have special units for inmates
with mental illness or developmental disability.[20]  Where there is no
special unit, or where the unit is full, mentally ill accused persons are
typically held in segregation cells.[21]

V.          
Analysis

A.          
Overview

[78]                         
No court shall make a treatment order without
the consent of the treating hospital: s. 672.62(1) .  The dispute in this case
centers on the scope of that consent requirement.  In particular, which aspects
of a treatment order require hospital consent?  Can a valid treatment order be
issued absent hospital agreement to the specified start date?

[79]                         
The respondent hospitals, as well as the
Attorneys General, say that the hospital’s consent is required for all aspects
of the treatment order.  For the order to be valid, the hospital must agree not
only to perform the treatment, but also to the timing and any other conditions
of the “disposition”.  A treatment order cannot issue without the hospital’s
agreement to all aspects of the order.

[80]                         
The appellant says that the hospital’s consent
need only extend to its willingness to administer the specified treatment.  The
hospital cannot use the consent requirement to control the timing or other
conditions of treatment, particularly based on bed shortages and waiting lists.

[81]                         
In my view, the hospital’s consent is required
only to the treatment itself, and cannot be withheld on the basis of efficient
management of hospital resources.  The hospital consent requirement must be
read in the context of Part XX.1 of the Criminal Code .  A contextual
reading makes clear that the consent provisions do not permit the hospitals to
make decisions about the timing of the treatment (and by extension, the timing
of the trial and the interim detention conditions of the accused) based on the
medical priority of an accused against other patients on the waiting list for a
bed.  In setting the start date for treatment, the judge will consider bed
shortages, but she does so along with the liberty, security and procedural
fairness interests of the accused, as well as assessing the impact of waiting
in jail and the delays to the trial.

[82]                         
Before a judge can make a treatment order, the
consent provision under s. 672.62(1)  requires that a hospital indicate it
is willing to administer the treatment.  The hospital may only refuse consent
if it objects to the specified treatment on medical grounds.  In exceptional
circumstances, the lack of a bed, or other alternative, may mean that the
hospital is not able to safely carry out the treatment ― even if the
hospital gives the accused priority for the date chosen by the judge.  In such
cases, if the hospital believes that the judge has acted unreasonably in
setting the date, it can appeal and the decision can be reviewed.

[83]                         
I will first explain why, in my view, the scope
of the consent requirement is limited to the treatment itself, and consent is
not required to the associated timing and conditions.  I will then discuss how
bed shortages are relevant to the treatment order.  Finally, I will outline an
efficient process for dealing with concerns about the timing of the treatment
order.

B.           
The Scope of Consent

[84]                         
The respondents say that because s. 672.62(1) 
directs that “[n]o court shall make a disposition under section 672.58 
without the consent of (a) the person in charge of the hospital where
the accused is to be treated”, and because the “disposition” under s. 672.58 
permits an order directing that “treatment of the accused be carried out for a
specified period not exceeding sixty days, subject to such conditions as the
court considers appropriate”, hospital agreement to all aspects of the
treatment order is required.  The hospital must agree not only to perform the
treatment, but also to the timing, duration, and any other conditions of the
“disposition”.

[85]                         
The appellant says that the treatment order
provisions separate the medical appropriateness of the treatment from its
timing.  Consent is required only with respect to the treatment.  While s.
672.58 refers to the court making an order directing that “treatment . . . be
carried out for a specified period” (this is the “disposition”), s. 672.63
separately directs that “[a] disposition shall come into force on the day on
which it is made or on any later day that the court or Review Board specifies
in it”.  Thus, the disposition itself ― which requires hospital consent,
according to s. 672.62(1) (a) ― may be separate from the date that
it comes into force, or commences, which s. 672.63 authorizes the court to
specify.

[86]                         
There is no doubt that s. 672.62(1)  makes
hospital consent a prerequisite to any treatment disposition.  However, the
issue remains: to what does the consent relate?  Is consent required to all
terms and conditions of the “disposition”?  Or is consent merely required to the
specified treatment?

[87]                         
I do not find the respondents’ submissions on
the language of s. 672.62 determinative.  Section 672.62(1)  does not provide
that the consent is required for all aspects of the disposition; rather, it
says that the disposition under s. 672.58 cannot be made without the consent of
the hospital or person treating the accused.  Further, the judge may fix the
timing of the disposition pursuant to s. 672.63.  The disposition under s.
672.58 is an order directing the treatment of the accused for a specified
period (a maximum duration of 60 days), together with any conditions the judge
considers appropriate.  Obviously, if consent to the treatment is not provided,
there can be no disposition ordering such treatment.

[88]                         
In my view, the language of these provisions,
read in isolation, does not provide a clear answer to the scope of a hospital’s
discretion to withhold consent.  However, the modern rule of statutory
interpretation requires that “the words of an Act are to be read in their
entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with
the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament”:
E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87. 
Here, interpreting the provisions in light of (1) the purposes of Part XX.1,
the treatment order regime and the consent requirement, (2) the scheme of
strict judicial control and oversight with strict timelines, and (3) the appeal
and automatic stay provisions, leads to the conclusion that the requirement for
hospital consent relates only to a hospital’s willingness to deliver a
particular treatment.  It does not provide the hospital with a veto over the
terms and conditions of the treatment order, nor one that can be exercised for
any reason.

(1)     
Legislative Purpose

(a)      
Purpose of the Part XX.1 Regime; Protecting the
Interests at Stake

[89]                         
This Court identified the purposes of Part XX.1
in Mazzei v. British Columbia (Director of Adult Forensic Psychiatric
Services), 2006 SCC 7, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 326:

. . . the
new legislative scheme retains the former’s overall purpose and its emphasis on
the medical treatment of the NCR [not criminally responsible] accused as merely
an effect or an incident of Parliament’s primary objective of protecting the
public and managing an accused’s safety risk, pursuant to its criminal law
power.  The new element added in Part XX.1 is an assurance of procedural
fairness and dignity for the NCR accused, and a commitment to ensure that
the NCR accused’s liberty interests are to be infringed as minimally as
possible.  [Emphasis added; para. 27.]

[90]                         
Consideration of the significant Charter -protected
s. 7  liberty interests at stake in the regime is “built into the [Part XX.1]
statutory framework” at “every step of the process”:  Penetanguishene Mental
Health Centre v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2004 SCC 20, [2004] 1 S.C.R.
498, at para. 53.  See also Winko v. British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric
Institute), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625, at paras. 16 and 42.

[91]                         
When the Bill enacting Part XX.1 was under
discussion in the House of Commons, the Minister of Justice, Kim Campbell, in
describing the treatment order power, stated that “subject to stringent
safeguards, the bill permits a court to order involuntary treatment to
make the accused fit to stand trial, thereby avoiding a potentially lengthy
period of detention”.[22]

[92]                         
Treatment orders serve at least two purposes. 
First, they seek to render the accused fit to stand trial, in order to protect
the rights to a timely trial and procedural fairness, as well as to safeguard
the public interest in accused persons standing trial.  Second, they serve to
ensure that the accused’s liberty is minimally impaired.  While the medical and
legal interests of accused persons are both at stake, the ultimate purpose of treatment
orders is to protect the legal interests of the accused.

[93]                         
The timing of a treatment order directly impacts
the timing of the trial.  And since the alternative to a treatment order is
usually detention in a jail that is ill-equipped to accommodate the mental
health issues of unfit individuals, the timing of the order also affects the
interim detention conditions of the accused.  The timing therefore also affects
the dignity, security and liberty interests of the accused ― interests
that Part XX.1 seeks to protect.

[94]                         
The interpretation of the consent requirement
advanced by the respondents, which gives the hospital control over timing and
other conditions, is difficult to reconcile with the purposes of the regime. 
Requiring consent to all terms of a treatment “disposition” would effectively
give the hospitals a broad veto over whether a treatment order could be issued,
and control over the timing of the treatment, without regard to the
accused’s legal interests.

[95]                         
Nothing in the Code, or any other
legislation, requires hospitals to consider the detention conditions of unfit
accused that are not in their charge when making admission decisions, and they
are not in a position to properly do so.  Nor are designated hospitals under
any legal duty to provide procedural protections to the accused when
determining the timing of a treatment order.  The triage process conducted by
the hospital is only a determination of priority between the medical interests
of the accused and other patients ― it does not account for the liberty
or other legal and Charter  interests of the accused.

[96]                         
Therefore, it would not be consistent with the
purposes of Part XX.1 for hospitals to control the timing and conditions of a
treatment order.  Hospitals must continually manage for the most effective use
of their resources and patient intake protocols.  It is for a judge to weigh
the accused’s liberty, security and legal interests against the hospital’s
challenges in giving priority to the accused.  As I discuss later, the judge
will consider any bed shortages in setting the start date of any treatment. 
The purposes of Part XX.1 support a more limited scope for the consent
provision, focused on the hospital’s willingness to administer the specified
treatment.

(b)     
Purpose of the Consent Provision

[97]                         
Part XX.1 empowers judges to make various orders[23] requiring hospitals to
admit accused persons, without the hospital’s consent, even though they may
also cause administrative difficulties in immediately accommodating mentally
ill accused persons.  Thus, the scheme of the Code does not generally
require hospital consent simply because the treatment order makes demands on
hospital resources.

[98]                         
Consent is required only under the treatment
order regime.  This is no coincidence, given that the treatment order provision
is also the only provision in Part XX.1 that permits a court to order medical
treatment without the consent of the accused.

[99]                         
The reason hospital consent is required is to
protect the accused’s medical interests and to respect the hospital’s
professional right not to be forced to administer medical treatment.  It is one
of the “stringent safeguards” on court-ordered involuntary treatment of a
vulnerable accused.

[100]                     
Limiting the power to withhold consent to
concerns about the medical appropriateness of the treatment itself respects the
professional judgment of the hospital as to whether it should administer the
particular treatment.  It also acts as a safeguard to ensure that the medical
interests of the accused are not compromised by a treatment to which he does
not consent.  At the same time, it permits the judge to protect the legal
interests of the vulnerable accused when setting the timing of the order.  This
interpretation safeguards procedural protections, judicial supervision of the
detention, and the purposes of Part XX.1.

[101]                     
Thus, the consent requirement, examined
purposively in its legislative context, is limited to whether the hospital
would be willing to carry out the specified treatment.  It serves to ensure the
expert administration of medically appropriate treatment, rather than to
accommodate the hospital’s resource constraints.

(2)     
Scheme of the Treatment Order Regime

[102]                     
Through Part XX.1, Parliament sought to ensure
procedural fairness, and minimally infringe the liberty interests of the
accused, by setting detailed time limits and providing for judicial (or Review
Board) control and oversight of all aspects of the regime.

[103]                     
Pursuant to these controls, a treatment order
has maximum duration of 60 days (ss. 672.58 and 672.59); several pre-conditions
must be met before the order can be granted, based upon the evidence and
opinion of a medical practitioner who has assessed the accused (s. 672.59); the
accused has the right to challenge the application (s. 672.6); certain
treatments cannot be prescribed under the order (s. 672.61); consent to the
order is required from the treating hospital or doctor, but not from the
accused (s. 672.62); and the court can specify the effective date of the order
(s. 672.63).

[104]                     
If hospitals may refuse consent, or dictate the
timing of a treatment order, for any reason, including its internal operations
and wait lists, it would be a significant derogation from Part XX.1’s
comprehensive scheme of judicial controls and tight timelines.

(3)     
Appeal and Stay Provisions

[105]                     
A limited scope of the consent requirement also
gives effect to the appeal (s. 672.72) and the stay provisions (s. 672.75) in
the treatment order regime.  Section 672.75 provides for an automatic stay upon
appeal by any party.

[106]                     
The automatic stay of a treatment order upon
appeal by the institution would be meaningless if the treatment order could not
be issued absent hospital consent to all its terms and conditions.  If a
hospital could simply withhold consent when it objected to terms, there would
never be any need for it to appeal.  Rather, the scheme provides a stay and
contemplates a hospital appeal precisely because certain “conditions” of the
treatment order ― including the timing ― are decided by the court. 
An appellate court would be in a position to review the judge’s decision based
upon the information before the court.

[107]                     
Conversely, a delay caused by the hospital
withholding consent to a future date cannot easily be challenged.  Although an
accused can appeal against the treatment order under s. 672.72(1), this is an
onerous challenge for an unfit accused and the appeal is unlikely to be heard
before the commencement date of the order.  Moreover, because the order usually
issues when the treatment is involuntary, the accused is unlikely to seek its
earlier implementation.

[108]                     
In any event, the hospital’s decision would not
easily be susceptible to appellate review.  If consent can simply be withheld
by the hospital, there may well be little information before the court other
than a refusal to consent to an earlier date.

[109]                     
My colleagues contend that “[i]f . . . consent
to a ‘disposition’ as required by s. 672.62 does not require consent as to
timing of treatment, it must follow that an appeal under s. 672.72 from a
‘disposition’ cannot relate to the timing of the treatment either” (para. 25). 
To be clear, my conclusion is not that the timing of the treatment order is not
part of the disposition.  Rather, I conclude that the timing of the
order does not fall within the hospital consent requirement.  Nothing
prevents the hospital from appealing the disposition made by the judge ―
respecting its timing or any other aspect ― if it believes the judge’s
decision was unreasonable.

[110]                     
Thus, the appeal and stay provisions are
consistent with a more limited consent requirement under Part XX.1:  consent
relates only to the hospitals’ willingness to deliver the particular treatment.

C.           
The Role of Bed Shortages

[111]                     
The respondent hospitals argue that bed
shortages directly affect their ability to carry out treatment.  However,
designated hospitals under Part XX.1 take on a forensic role and are
presumptively equipped to treat unfit accused persons.

[112]                     
Usually, the management of bed shortages is more
closely tied to the efficient management of hospital resources.  The CAMH
Statement of Principles and Practices for Admission Prioritization suggests
that, barring medical emergency, priority is granted on a first come, first
served basis.  No doubt it is simpler to forecast bed availability in light of
the existing waiting list, subject only to medical emergencies.  But in the
context of Part XX.1, medical emergencies are not the only measure of urgency
or priority.

[113]                     
Even where an unfit accused’s treatment is not
“medically urgent” according to hospital criteria, denial of immediate
treatment may nevertheless put his physical safety and life in jeopardy for
reasons that are wholly unknown to the hospital and that are impossible for the
hospital to assess.  Only judges will be able to assess the risks that would
flow from failing to immediately treat an unfit accused because many of the
greatest dangers will result not from the “medical urgency” of this treatment
as seen by hospitals, but rather from the risks that such an accused would face
in jail.  Medical triage and hospital priority protocols do not account for the
legal interests of the unfit accused.

[114]                     
There may also be exceptional circumstances
where the lack of a bed means that the hospital cannot safely administer the
treatment, despite treating the accused as a priority.  Doctors should not be
ordered to provide treatment in circumstances that are unsafe to patients or
staff.

[115]                     
However, the record suggests such situations
will be rare.  Hospitals find the means to deal with medical emergencies, under
the principle that “[n]o one waits who cannot”.[24]  Dr. Simpson testified
that when the hospital deems it truly necessary, it finds room.[25]  When a judge makes a
treatment order, the hospital must take it to indicate that treatment is
necessary as of that date.

[116]                     
This may mean that the hospital will have to
move a less critical patient to a different ward, use emergency seclusion areas
or otherwise accommodate the accused, much as it would in order to accommodate
a medical emergency.  Under Part XX.1 of the Code, the designated
hospitals may have to accommodate the exigencies of the criminal justice
system.

[117]                     
Sometimes bed shortages will affect the ability
of a hospital to carry out treatment safely; but this is distinct from whether
the treatment is otherwise medically suitable.  These are important but
separable concepts.  Thus, while bed shortages are not a basis for the hospital
to refuse consent, they are part of the circumstances in which the judge
exercises her discretion in deciding the start date of a treatment order.

[118]                     
I would add this.  While the state must resource
its hospitals so as to accommodate a judge’s order under the Code, this
does not mean the courts can expect a perfect system, with treatment facilities
available immediately in all cases.  Nothing in the Code requires that
hospitals be resourced to ensure there is always an empty bed waiting.  If the
hospital is concerned about bed unavailability, or its ability to safely carry
out the treatment immediately, the discussion about triage can take place
before the judge.  The judge is in the best position to deal with the various
interests, in an informal and co-operative process.

D.          
The Treatment Order:  A Collaborative Process

[119]                     
Despite the tensions created by bed shortages,
the dedicated professionals who work daily in the mental health courts work
co-operatively in implementing Part XX.1.  In this case, for example, this
collaborative process resulted in numerous steps ― the assessment, the
fitness hearing, and the treatment order hearing ― being dealt with in a
single day, the day after Mr. Conception’s arrest.

[120]                     
Like all decisions of criminal court judges, the
decision to issue a treatment order must be reasonable, having regard to all
the circumstances.  The psychiatrist will have testified as to the need for
treatment.  The hospital, as a party to the proceedings, is entitled to
indicate its preferred timeline, to avoid disrupting other priority patients. 
The psychiatrist may give her opinion as to how the accused will fare in
prison, and whether his treatment prospects would be adversely affected by a
delay.

[121]                     
However, the timeline proposed by the hospital
may not meet the needs of the criminal justice system.  For example, the mental
(or physical) health of the accused may be jeopardized by waiting in jail
before being transferred to hospital; or the required detention in jail may be
disproportionate to the actual charges against the accused.  In such cases, the
court may make further inquiries of the hospital.  The hospital may provide
information about the current capacity and waiting list of the hospital and
whether, if measures were taken to admit the accused on an urgent basis, it
could safely provide treatment.

[122]                     
This enquiry is consistent with the judge’s role
under Part XX.1 and will not usually require a detailed examination of hospital
evidence, which would result in delays to treatment and trial.  An informal
exchange of information, as is current practice, should suffice.  This ensures
efficiency and is consistent with the direction under s. 672.5(2) of the Code,
which states that a hearing to make a disposition under Part XX.1 “may be
conducted in as informal a manner as is appropriate in the circumstances”.

[123]                     
The judge will aim to craft a realistic
treatment order accounting for the hospital’s resource constraints, the
interests of the accused and the needs of the criminal process.  This is
consistent with the judge’s broad power to set the conditions of a disposition
under s. 672.58 and to set the effective date of the disposition under s.
672.63.

[124]                     
Finally, if the court attaches what the hospital
considers to be unreasonable conditions to a treatment order (including for
example, where treatment cannot safely be provided), the hospital may, of
course, exercise its statutory right of appeal, and benefit from the automatic
stay.  The Court of Appeal is empowered to overturn a treatment order in such a
case.

E.           
Conclusions

[125]                     
For these reasons, I conclude that before a
judge can make a treatment order, the consent provisions under s. 672.62(1) 
require that a hospital must have indicated it would be willing to administer
the specified treatment.  When read in their full context, the consent
provisions do not permit hospitals to assess the priority of the accused
against others on the waiting list ― or to withhold consent on the basis
of its bed shortages or waitlists.  Consent may be withheld only for medical
reasons.

[126]                     
Judges are charged under Part XX.1 with ensuring
procedural fairness and minimal infringement of the accused’s liberty.  The
judge can consider bed shortages, in light of the medical and legal interests
of the unfit accused.  It is the court, and not the hospital, that is tasked
with fulfilling the ultimate goal of the treatment regime.  That goal is to
make the accused fit to stand trial, thereby avoiding a potentially lengthy
period of detention.

[127]                     
If there are exceptional circumstances at the
hospital such that, even if the accused is treated as a patient who “cannot
wait”, it would not be safe to admit and treat the accused, then the hospital
should bring that to the attention of the judge.  If the hospital is concerned
about the treatment order, its remedy is to launch an appeal, and receive an
automatic stay.

VI.       
The Treatment Order Issued in This Case

[128]                     
The validity of Hogan J.’s order is now moot. 
However, the parties agreed that the appeal should proceed.

[129]                     
Obviously, all those involved were acting in
good faith.  Indeed, in many respects, the 102 Court-CAMH system is a good
example of co-operation among the various institutions involved in implementing
Part XX.1.

[130]                     
The record indicates that the hospital’s refusal
to agree to the judge’s desired start date for the treatment order ― a
refusal they characterize as a denial of consent ― was based on its own
waitlists rather than the treatment of the accused.  Staff safety was a concern
at CAMH because of the sexual assault allegation, and a bed at MHCP would only
be available in six days.  The hospital argued that an earlier start date would
impact the priority of other patients waiting for an available bed.

[131]                     
I do not agree with the Court of Appeal that the
trial judge lacked jurisdiction to issue a treatment order in this case.  It is
obvious from the record that the hospital consented to provide the treatment,
subject to bed availability.  However, I conclude that the hearing judge’s
decision regarding the timing of the treatment order was not reasonable.

[132]                     
It is clear that the hearing judge was concerned
generally about unfit accused waiting in jail, and the impact of the delay upon
their mental health.  However, she did not base her decision upon the specific
circumstances of this case in issuing a “forthwith” treatment order.  There was
no discussion of the impact on the offender’s treatment prospects resulting
from a delay; the holding conditions in the jail where he would likely be sent
to wait; or any possible alternatives to detention while waiting for a bed. 
And there was no information about whether the hospital could safely administer
treatment immediately, if so ordered, or when safe treatment could be provided,
if he was given priority.  These are relevant factors that could have assisted
the judge in the exercise of her discretion to issue a treatment order in this
case.  Like many others at the time, the judge made the treatment order in good
faith, but out of frustration with the mental health system’s inability to
immediately accommodate patients under treatment orders.

[133]                     
As a result, I agree with the Court of Appeal
that the judge erred in issuing a “forthwith” treatment order.  I would dismiss
the appeal without costs.

hearing] Where the court does not make a disposition in respect of the accused
at a disposition hearing, any order for the interim release or detention of the
accused or any appearance notice, promise to appear, summons, undertaking or
recognizance in respect of the accused that is in force
at the time the verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental
disorder or unfit to stand trial is rendered continues in force, subject to its
terms, until the Review Board makes a disposition.

                  (2) [Variation of order] Notwithstanding
subsection (1), a court may, on cause being shown, vacate any order, appearance
notice, promise to appear, summons, undertaking or recognizance referred to in
that subsection and make any other order for the interim release or detention
of the accused that the court considers to be appropriate in the circumstances,
including an order directing that the accused be detained in custody in a
hospital pending a disposition by the Review Board in respect of the accused.

                  672.54 [Dispositions that may be made] Where a
court or Review Board makes a disposition under subsection 672.45(2) or section
672.47 or 672.83, it shall, taking into consideration the need to protect the
public from dangerous persons, the mental condition of the accused, the
reintegration of the accused into society and the other needs of the accused,
make one of the following dispositions that is the least onerous and least
restrictive to the accused:

 (a) where a verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder has
been rendered in respect of the accused and, in the opinion of the court or
Review Board, the accused is not a significant threat to the safety of the
public, by order, direct that the accused be discharged absolutely;

(b) by order, direct that the
accused be discharged subject to such conditions as the court or Review Board considers appropriate; or

(c) by order, direct that the accused be detained in custody in a hospital, subject to
such conditions as the court or Review Board considers appropriate.

                  672.58 [Treatment disposition] Where a verdict of unfit to stand trial is
rendered and the court has not made a disposition under section 672.54 in
respect of an accused, the court may, on application by the prosecutor, by
order, direct that treatment of the accused be carried out for a specified period
not exceeding sixty days, subject to such conditions as the court considers
appropriate and, where the accused is not detained in custody, direct that the
accused submit to that treatment by the person or at the hospital specified.

                  672.59 (1) [Criteria for disposition] No disposition may be made under
section 672.58 unless the court is satisfied, on the basis of the testimony of
a medical practitioner, that a specific treatment should be administered to the
accused for the purpose of making the accused fit to stand trial.

                  (2)
[Evidence required] The testimony required by the court for the purposes of
subsection (1) shall include a statement that the medical practitioner has made
an assessment of the accused and is of the opinion, based on the grounds specified,
that

(a) the accused, at the time of the assessment, was unfit to stand trial;

(b) the psychiatric treatment and any other related medical treatment specified by the medical
practitioner will likely make the accused fit to stand trial within a period
not exceeding sixty days and that without that treatment the accused is likely
to remain unfit to stand trial;

(c) the risk of harm to the
accused from the psychiatric and other related medical treatment specified is
not disproportionate to the benefit anticipated to be derived from it; and

(d) the psychiatric and other
related medical treatment specified is the least restrictive and least intrusive treatment that could, in the circumstances, be specified for the
purpose referred to in subsection (1), considering the opinions referred to in
paragraphs (b) and (c).

                  672.6 (1) [Notice required] The court shall not make a disposition under
section 672.58 unless the prosecutor notifies the accused, in writing and as
soon as practicable, of the application.

                  (2)
[Challenge by accused] On receiving the notice referred to in subsection (1),
the accused may challenge the application and adduce evidence for that purpose.

                  672.61 (1) [Exception] The court shall not direct, and no disposition made
under section 672.58 shall include, the performance of psychosurgery or
electro-convulsive therapy or any other prohibited treatment that is
prescribed.

                  (2)
[Definitions] In this section,

“electro-convulsive therapy” means a procedure for
the treatment of certain mental disorders that induces, by electrical
stimulation of the brain, a series of generalized convulsions;

“psychosurgery” means any procedure that by
direct or indirect access to the brain removes, destroys or interrupts the
continuity of histologically normal brain tissue, or inserts indwelling
electrodes for pulsed electrical stimulation for the purpose of altering
behaviour or treating psychiatric illness, but does not include neurological
procedures used to diagnose or treat intractable physical pain, organic brain
conditions, or epilepsy, where any of those conditions is clearly demonstrable.

                  672.62
(1) [Consent of hospital required for treatment] No
court shall make a disposition under section 672.58 without the consent of

(a) the person in charge of
the hospital where the accused is to be treated; or

(b) the person to whom responsibility for the treatment of the accused is assigned by the court.

                  (2)
[Consent of accused not required for treatment] The court may direct that
treatment of an accused be carried out pursuant to a disposition made under
section 672.58 without the consent of the accused or a person who, according to
the laws of the province where the disposition is made, is authorized to
consent for the accused.

                  672.63 [Effective date of disposition] A disposition shall come into force
on the day on which it is made or on any later day that the court or Review
Board specifies in it, and shall remain in force until the Review Board holds a
hearing to review the disposition and makes another disposition.

                  672.72 (1) [Grounds for appeal] Any party may appeal against a disposition
made by a court or a Review Board, or a placement decision made by a Review
Board, to the court of appeal of the province where the disposition or
placement decision was made on any ground of appeal that raises a question of
law or fact alone or of mixed law and fact.

 

                  (2)
[Limitation period for appeal] An appellant shall give notice of an appeal
against a disposition or placement decision in the manner directed by the
applicable rules of court within fifteen days after the day on which the
appellant receives a copy of the placement decision or disposition and the
reasons for it or within any further time that the court of appeal, or a judge
of that court, may direct.

                  (3)
[Appeal to be heard expeditiously] The court of appeal shall hear an appeal
against a disposition or placement decision in or out of the regular sessions
of the court, as soon as practicable after the day on which the notice of

on appeal from the court of appeal for manitoba

                    Criminal law — Sentencing — Dangerous
offender — Application for remand for assessment — Meaning of “serious personal
injury offence” — Whether robbery committed by using threats of violence to a
person falls within the meaning of “serious personal injury offence” — Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , ss. 343 (a), 752  “serious personal injury offence”,
752.1(1)

                    S
robbed a drugstore, telling the cashiers that he had a gun. There is no
evidence that he actually had a gun or that physical force was used. No one was
injured. One of the cashiers testified that she had been scared during the
robbery, while the other described her reaction as one of shock. S was
convicted of robbery under s. 343 (a) of the Criminal Code  on the
basis that he had “use[d] . . . threats of violence to a person”. The
Crown applied to the court to remand him for assessment pursuant to s. 752.1(1) 
of the Criminal Code . Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal found
that a threat of violence does not on its own constitute “the use or attempted
use of violence” in accordance with subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of
“serious personal injury offence” in s. 752  of the Criminal Code .

                    Held: 
The appeal should be allowed.

                    This case concerns the scope of the definition
of a “serious personal injury offence” (SPIO) and, consequently, the threshold
for entry into the dangerous and long-term offender system. A threat of
violence that suffices to ground a conviction for robbery under s. 343 (a)
does indeed constitute the use of violence against another person within the
meaning of subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an SPIO set out in s. 752 .


                    Indeterminate
detention and long-term supervision are exceptional sentences which are
reserved for individuals who pose an ongoing threat to the public. There are a
number of procedural steps and substantive requirements before a court can find
that an offender is a dangerous offender or a long-term offender. Before the
court remands an offender for assessment, it must be satisfied that the
offender has been convicted of an SPIO as defined in s. 752 . There also must be
reasonable grounds to believe that the offender might be found to be a
dangerous offender under s. 753 or a long-term offender under s. 753.1. Thus,
the SPIO requirement plays a crucial role in the operation of the dangerous and
long-term offender scheme.

                    The
primary rationale for both indeterminate detention and long-term supervision
under Part XXIV is public protection, and an overly narrow construction of the gateway
provision would indeed undermine this purpose. However, the specific purpose of
the SPIO requirement is to link the sentence to the predicate offence, and an
overly broad construction would undermine this purpose and violate the
fundamental principle of sentencing, that a sentence must be proportionate to
the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.
The SPIO requirement helps safeguard the constitutionality of the scheme. In
interpreting the definition of an SPIO, effect must be given to the overall
protective purpose of Part XXIV, while also furthering the specific purpose of
the SPIO requirement by tying the punishment to the predicate offence and
safeguarding the objective of proportionality.

                    Subparagraph
(a)(i) of the definition in s. 752  does not invite a court to assess the
seriousness of the violence the offender used or attempted to use; any level of
violence is sufficient. The words “use or attempted use of violence” must be
read in their grammatical and ordinary sense, having regard to their statutory
context. Neither the purpose of the SPIO requirement nor that of Part XXIV
warrants reading in a qualitative minimum level of violence. This
interpretation is consistent with the gatekeeper function of the SPIO requirement.

                    Unless
the context or the purpose of the statute suggests a different approach, the
prevailing definition of “violence” is a harm-based one that encompasses acts
by which a person causes, attempts to cause or threatens to cause harm and not
a force-based one. This is not to say that the definition of violence must be a
harm-based one in every case. Context will be paramount and there may be
situations in which the presumption of consistent expression is clearly
rebutted by other principles of interpretation and, as a result, the intended
meaning of violence may vary between statutes and even, in some circumstances,
within them. The scope of the expression “use or attempted use of
violence” must ultimately be determined having regard to the context in which
it is used. 

                    There is no
indication that the various parts of the definition of an SPIO in s. 752  are
mutually exclusive. The fact that a proposed interpretation would bring some
offences within the ambit of more than one part of the definition in s. 752 
should not, in itself, justify narrowing the definition to avoid such overlaps.
Subparagraph (a)(i) concerns violent acts — “the use or attempted use of
violence” — and requires violent intent on the offender’s part. This part of
the definition will apply to an offender who intentionally causes,
attempts to cause or threatens to cause harm. Threats are included by virtue of
the speaker’s intent that they be taken seriously. Subparagraph (a)(ii)
relates solely to the effects of the conduct and, as such, will include offences
involving negligence. Therefore, a harm-based approach to subpara. (a)(i)
according to which threatening violence constitutes a form of use of violence
is not inconsistent with the endangerment and psychological damage aspects of
the definition in subpara. (a)(ii).

                    The exclusion of
robbery from the offences listed in para. (b) of the definition is not
relevant to the determination of legislative intent. There is no indication
that Parliament intended to create an exhaustive list of all offences
constituting SPIOs in all cases. 

                    The Court
of Appeal relied on the presumption that the use of different language suggests
that the legislature intended different meanings and the principle that the
same words have the same meaning throughout a statute; however, it failed to
take into account the full context in which the expressions “uses violence” and
“use of violence” appear in s. 343  and subpara. (a)(i) of the
definition of an SPIO in s. 752 . The two provisions are in unrelated parts of
the Criminal Code , and they have distinct purposes and legislative
histories. The Court of Appeal’s approach is also inconsistent with the
principles of statutory interpretation and would result in untold difficulties
for trial judges seeking to establish the elusive dividing line between threats
that are inherently violent and those that are not. It is
moreover incompatible with the plain meaning and the purpose of the provision.
All threats of violence are themselves violent, even though the seriousness of
the violence may be quite limited. In seeking to distinguish violent from non-violent
threats, courts are in effect reading in an objective minimum level of
violence. The Court of Appeal’s interpretation is inconsistent with the clear
language of subpara. (a)(i) of the definition, which requires violence,
not serious violence, and it risks undermining the overall purpose of Part XXIV
by precluding courts from remanding potentially dangerous offenders for
assessment. 

                    Threats of violence
to a person that are sufficient to ground a conviction for robbery under s. 343 (a)
meet the “use . . . of violence” criterion in subpara. (a)(i)
of the definition of an SPIO in s. 752 . By threatening to harm his victims while committing robbery, S used
violence against them. Since the other requirements of the definition are
clearly met, his offence qualifies as an SPIO.

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
Indeterminate detention and long-term
supervision under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 ,
are exceptional sentences in our criminal justice system. They are reserved for
individuals who pose an ongoing threat to the public and accordingly merit
enhanced sentences on preventive grounds. Part XXIV outlines the process by
which an offender may be designated as a dangerous offender or a long-term
offender and be sentenced accordingly. Before either of these designations can
be made, a number of conditions must be met. One such condition is that the
offence that forms the basis for the dangerous offender or long-term offender
application must be a “serious personal injury offence” as defined in s. 752  of
the Criminal Code . 

[2]                             
The term “serious personal injury offence”
means, inter alia, an indictable offence involving “the use or attempted
use of violence against another person” for which the offender may be sentenced
to imprisonment for 10 years or more: s. 752 , subpara. (a)(i) of the
definition of “serious personal injury offence” (“SPIO”). On application by a
prosecutor, where an individual has been convicted of such an offence, and if
the court finds that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the
individual might be found to be a dangerous offender or a long-term offender,
the court must remand the individual for a psychological assessment: s. 752.1(1) .
This assessment then forms the basis for an application for a finding that the
individual is a dangerous offender or a long-term offender. 

[3]                             
This case concerns the scope of the definition
of an SPIO and, consequently, the threshold for entry into the dangerous and
long-term offender system. The offender, Mr. Steele, robbed a drugstore,
telling the cashiers that he had a gun. There is no evidence that he actually
had a gun or that physical force was used. Mr. Steele was convicted of robbery
under s. 343 (a) of the Criminal Code  on the basis that he had
“use[d] . . . threats of violence to a person”. The Crown, viewing
this as an SPIO, gave notice of its intention to apply to the court to remand
Mr. Steele for assessment pursuant to s. 752.1(1) . Mr. Steele’s offence
clearly meets two of the requirements of the definition of an SPIO referred to
above: robbery is an indictable offence for which the offender may be sentenced
to imprisonment for 10 years or more (see s. 344 ). The question is whether the
offence — which involved threats of violence to a person, but no physical force
— meets the other requirement of that definition: that of involving “the use or
attempted use of violence against another person”. 

[4]                             
Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal
answered this question in the negative. They found, in essence, that a threat
of violence does not on its own constitute “the use or attempted use of
violence”. For the reasons that follow, I respectfully disagree. 

[5]                             
A threat of violence that suffices to ground a
conviction for robbery under s. 343 (a) does indeed constitute the use of
violence against another person within the meaning of subpara. (a)(i) of
the definition of an SPIO set out in s. 752 . By threatening to harm his victims
while committing robbery, Mr. Steele used violence against them. Since the
other requirements of the definition are clearly met, his offence qualifies as
an SPIO. 

[6]                             
In the result, I would allow the Crown’s appeal.
The other requirements for the Crown’s application for remand for an assessment
have not been contested, which means that all the requirements are met. I would
therefore grant the application and order that Mr. Steele be remanded for
assessment pursuant to s. 752.1(1)  of the Criminal Code . 

II.          
Relevant Statutory Provisions

[7]                             
The dispute over the definition of an SPIO
arises in the context of the Crown’s application for remand for an assessment,
which is a step that must be taken before applying for a finding that an
offender is a dangerous offender or a long-term offender: 

752.1 (1) [Application for remand for assessment]
On application by the prosecutor, if the court is of the opinion that there are
reasonable grounds to believe that an offender who is convicted of a serious
personal injury offence or an offence referred to in paragraph 753.1(2)(a)
might be found to be a dangerous offender under section 753 or a long-term
offender under section 753.1, the court shall, by order in writing, before
sentence is imposed, remand the offender, for a period not exceeding 60 days,
to the custody of a person designated by the court who can perform an
assessment or have an assessment performed by experts for use as evidence in an
application under section 753 or 753.1.

[8]                             
The requirements of the definition of an SPIO
must be met both at the stage of the application for an assessment (s.
752.1(1) ) and, subsequently, at that of the application for a finding that the
offender is a dangerous offender (s. 753(1)). The definition reads as follows:

752. [Definitions] In this Part,

. . .

 

“serious personal injury
offence” means

 

(a)   an
indictable offence, other than high treason, treason, first degree murder or
second degree murder, involving

 

(i)
the use or attempted use of violence against another person, or

 

(ii)
conduct endangering or likely to endanger the life or safety of another person
or inflicting or likely to inflict severe psychological damage on another
person,

 

and
for which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for ten years or more,
or

 

(b)    an offence or attempt to commit an
offence mentioned in section 271 (sexual assault), 272 (sexual assault with a
weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm) or 273 (aggravated
sexual assault).

[9]                             
The offence of robbery under s. 343  encompasses
a number of different acts. Section 343  reads as follows:

343. [Robbery]
Every one commits robbery who

 

(a) steals, and for the purpose of extorting whatever is
stolen or to prevent or overcome resistance to the stealing, uses violence
or threats of violence to a person or property;

 

(b)
steals from any person and, at the time he steals or immediately before or
immediately thereafter, wounds, beats, strikes or uses any personal violence to
that person;

 

(c)
assaults any person with intent to steal from him; or

 

(d)
steals from any person while armed with an offensive weapon or imitation
thereof.

III.       
Background

[10]                         
The key facts are not in dispute. At
approximately 1:35 p.m. on May 28, 2010, Mr. Steele entered a drugstore with
his face concealed by a tightly drawn hoodie, as could be seen on a
surveillance videotape. He approached the checkout counter and said something
like, “Give me the money. It’s a robbery. I have a gun”. The cashier was unable
to open the register and requested the assistance of another cashier, who
opened it and positioned the cash tray so that Mr. Steele could reach it.  Mr.
Steele left the store approximately one minute and ten seconds after entering
it. He was at the checkout counter for 39 seconds. 

[11]                         
No weapon was seen in Mr. Steele’s possession
either inside or outside the store. No one was injured. One of the cashiers
testified that she had been scared during the robbery, while the other
described her reaction as one of shock. 

[12]                         
Mr. Steele was convicted of robbery, disguise
with intent and failure to comply with a probation order: 2011 MBQB 67. The
Crown then applied to the court to remand him for assessment pursuant to s.
752.1(1)  of the Criminal Code .  

A.          
Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench, 2011 MBQB 181, 267
Man. R. (2d) 91

[13]                         
McKelvey J. denied the Crown’s application. She
began her analysis by noting that the legislature has not specified that
robbery is an SPIO, as it has done in para. (b) of the definition of an
SPIO with respect to certain sexually based offences. She then said that there
was no evidence that Mr. Steele’s conduct had endangered or been likely to
endanger the lives or safety of the cashiers or that severe psychological
damage had been inflicted on them within the meaning of subpara. (a)(ii)
of the definition. The case therefore turned on subpara. (a)(i). Did Mr.
Steele’s conduct involve the use or attempted use of violence against the
cashiers?

[14]                         
On this question, McKelvey J. acknowledged two
lines of authority. According to the first, that of R. v. Neve, 1999
ABCA 206, 71 Alta. L.R. (3d) 92, the “use or attempted use of violence”
threshold requires that the violence be “objectively serious” (para. 76). The
second, that of R. v. Goforth, 2005 SKCA 12, 257 Sask. R. 123, and R.
v. Lebar, 2010 ONCA 220, 101 O.R. (3d) 263, rejects this requirement.
McKelvey J. noted (at para. 11) that “[t]he case law is trending towards an
acceptance of [the latter approach]”, according to which the expression “use or
attempted use of violence” encompasses all violent conduct irrespective of how
serious it is. 

[15]                         
McKelvey J. nevertheless found that the “implied
threat of violence” (para. 28) in the case at bar fell short of the subpara. (a)(i)
threshold. She noted that no one had been injured. Although Mr. Steele’s hands
were in his pockets when he uttered the threat, he had done nothing that could
be likened to pulling out a weapon. McKelvey J. accepted that the two cashiers
had experienced shock and fear as a result of Mr. Steele’s actions, but
nevertheless concluded that those actions had not constituted the use or
attempted use of violence. In reaching this conclusion, she relied on the
reasoning of other courts that had found that similar threats of violence
failed to meet the SPIO threshold:  e.g., R. v. Thompson, 2009 ONCJ 359
(CanLII); R. v. Roy, 2008 SKCA 41, 307 Sask. R. 276; R. v. Jolicoeur,
2011 MBQB 129, 265 Man. R. (2d) 225. 

B.           
Manitoba Court of Appeal, 2013 MBCA 21, 288 Man.
R. (2d) 304 (per Scott C.J.M. and Beard and Monnin JJ.A.)

[16]                         
The Manitoba Court of Appeal, per Scott
C.J.M., unanimously upheld McKelvey J.’s decision. The definition of robbery in
s. 343 (a) refers to a person who “uses violence” or “uses . . .
threats of violence”, whereas subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an
SPIO in s. 752  refers to the “use . . . of violence” or the
“attempted use of violence”. Scott C.J.M. reasoned that these differences in
language imply that not all robberies involve the use or attempted use of
violence. He discussed R. v. C.D., 2005 SCC 78, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 668, in
which this Court had adopted a definition of the expression “violent offence”
as used in s. 39(1) (a) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C.
2002, c. 1  (“YCJA ”), that included threats to cause bodily harm,
but found that that case should be distinguished. In his opinion, the fact that
s. 343 (a) refers to the use of both violence and threats of violence
means that there must be some difference between the two. 

[17]                         
After surveying the various types of threats
that might support a robbery conviction under s. 343 (a), Scott C.J.M.
noted that whether or not violence was used or attempted is a factual
determination, and a matter for the trial judge. He agreed with McKelvey J. in
endorsing the holding in Goforth and Lebar that the issue is not
whether the violence used in committing the predicate offence was objectively
serious. What must be determined, according to the court in Lebar, is
“whether the evidence proves that violence was actually used” (Scott C.J.M., at
para. 70, quoting Lebar, at para. 50). Although he agreed in substance
with this approach, Scott C.J.M. found that the court had sidestepped the
distinction between the concepts of use of violence and attempted use of
violence referred to in subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an SPIO in
s. 752 . The use of violence to a person in committing robbery will also
constitute a use of violence within the meaning of that provision. Where, on
the other hand, robbery is committed by the use of threats of violence
against a person, the question is whether those threats also constitute the attempted
use of violence within the meaning of subpara. (a)(i). 

[18]                         
In this regard, Scott C.J.M. approved the
approach adopted in Thompson, at para. 28:

In the myriad of factual circumstances
that can constitute criminal offences, there is often a threat of violence,
sometimes explicit and sometimes implicit. There may be instances when that
threat of violence is so real that one could reasonably characterize it as an
attempted use of violence. In other words, very little more need be done by
the offender before the threat becomes actual use. To try and distinguish an
attempt from a threat on such facts may be nothing more than semantics. However,
in other cases, the threat of violence may be so remote from any actual
perpetration of violence such that it cannot reasonably amount to an attempted
use. [Emphasis added.]

[19]                         
Scott C.J.M. proposed the following approach for
determining whether a given threat amounts to an attempted use of violence
(para. 85):

[S]ome degree of physical action must
be part of a threat for it to constitute the “attempted use of violence”. That
is, there needs to be some indication of imminent apparent danger to a person
or some overt act directed towards the actual use of violence against a person
for a threat of violence to also constitute the attempted use of violence. 

[20]                         
Finally, Scott C.J.M. noted that McKelvey J.’s
findings of fact had not been challenged, and because the threat of violence
was not associated with either imminent danger or “any, even minimal, overt
physical act”, he upheld the trial judge’s decision (para. 86). The threat,
while sufficient to ground a conviction for robbery under s. 343 (a), did
not constitute the use or attempted use of violence for the purposes of the
definition of an SPIO and did not trigger the sentencing procedures under Part
XXIV. 

IV.       
Issue

[21]                         
Does robbery committed by using threats of
violence to a person within the meaning of s. 343 (a) of the Criminal Code 
constitute an SPIO in accordance with subpara. (a)(i) of the
definition of that expression set out in s. 752 ?

V.          
Analysis

[22]                         
To determine whether an offence constitutes an
SPIO, it is necessary to review the elements of the offence, but it may also be
necessary, if that review is insufficient, to consider the factual
circumstances in which the offence was committed. Certain offences
automatically constitute SPIOs regardless of the manner in which they are
committed: s. 752 , para. (b) of the definition of “serious personal
injury offence”; see R. v. Currie,
[1997] 2 S.C.R. 260, at paras. 21-22. There are other offences that always
constitute SPIOs in that one of their elements automatically satisfies the
descriptive criteria set out in para. (a) of the definition of an SPIO. 
One example would be where personal violence or endangerment forms part of the
definition of the offence: see, e.g., R. v. Cepic, 2010 ONSC 561,
93 M.V.R. (5th) 129, at para. 18. Robbery is clearly not one of this second
type of offences, since it can involve the use of violence or threats of
violence to a person or property, whereas subpara. (a)(i) of the
definition of an SPIO refers only to the use or attempted use of violence against
another person: see Lebar, at para. 65. 

[23]                         
Thus, the question is whether a robbery
committed as in the instant case — by using threats of violence to a person,
but without using actual physical violence — satisfies the criterion of “use or
attempted use of violence against another person” set out in the definition. I
conclude that it does. I reach this conclusion in light of the modern principle
of statutory interpretation that the words of legislation must be read “in
their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously
with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of
Parliament”: E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at
p. 87. 

[24]                         
I will begin by discussing the purpose of the
SPIO threshold and its function within the scheme of Part XXIV. I will then
consider the plain meaning of the term “violence” in the context of the Criminal
Code  and other legislation. Finally, I will discuss the statutory context
of the provision in which the phrase “use or attempted use of violence”
appears, including the other provisions of the definition of an SPIO and the
provision that defines the offence of robbery. Taken together, these
considerations support the view that threats of violence to a person that
suffice to ground a conviction for robbery meet the violence criterion in the
definition of an SPIO. Because robbery is an indictable offence for which the
offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years or more, all the
criteria of subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an SPIO are satisfied. 

A.          
Purpose of the SPIO Requirement

[25]                         
The Crown emphasizes that the SPIO requirement
serves as a gateway in that it is applied before an offender is assessed for
dangerousness and before an application can be made for a finding that he or
she is a dangerous offender or a long-term offender. The “use or attempted use
of violence” criterion must therefore, the Crown argues, be interpreted broadly
to ensure that offenders who might meet the criteria are not excluded from
being assessed, which would undermine the goal of public protection. 

[26]                         
Mr. Steele counters that the SPIO requirement
performs an important function in Part XXIV by ensuring that offenders may only
be sentenced to indeterminate detention for sufficiently serious crimes. He
argues that an overly broad construction of this requirement would frustrate
the scheme’s objective of proportionality. 

[27]                         
As I will explain, both these purposive
arguments have merit. The general purpose of Part XXIV is public protection,
and an overly narrow construction of the gateway provision would indeed
undermine this purpose. However, the specific purpose of the SPIO requirement
is to link the sentence to the predicate offence, and an overly broad
construction would undermine this purpose and jeopardize the objective of
proportionality. My interpretive approach must be sensitive to both the general
and the specific purpose.  I will now discuss each of these purposes in detail
and will conclude that the seriousness requirement of subpara. (a)(i) of
the definition of an SPIO is satisfied by a textual and contextual
interpretation of the words “use or attempted use of violence”, and that it
would be wrong to read in an objective minimum level of violence. 

(1)        
General Purpose of the Dangerous and Long-term
Offender Provisions 

[28]                         
Part XXIV of the Criminal Code  authorizes
the indeterminate detention of individuals who are found to be “dangerous
offender[s]” on the basis that their past conduct and patterns of behaviour
show that they constitute a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental
well-being of other persons (s. 753(1) (a)), or that their failure to
control sexual impulses means that they are likely to cause injury, pain or
other evil to other persons (s. 753(1) (b)). It also authorizes the
long-term supervision of individuals who are found to be “long-term
offender[s]” where a sentence of imprisonment of two years or more would be
appropriate, there is a substantial risk that the individuals will reoffend,
and there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of that risk in the
community (s. 753.1(1) ). 

[29]                         
The primary rationale for both indeterminate
detention and long-term supervision under Part XXIV is public protection. Both
sentences advance the “dominant purpose” of preventive detention identified by
Dickson J. in Hatchwell v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 39, at p. 43,
namely “to protect the public when the past conduct of the criminal
demonstrates a propensity for crimes of violence against the person, and there
is a real and present danger to life or limb”. When the constitutionality of
the dangerous offender provisions came before this Court in R. v. Lyons,
[1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, La Forest J., wrote at p. 329, “[Part XXIV] merely enables the court to accommodate its sentence to
the common sense reality that the present condition of the offender is
such that he or she is not inhibited by normal standards of behavioural
restraint so that future violent acts can quite confidently be expected
of that person” (emphasis in original). Lamer C.J. subsequently explained this
rationale as follows in Currie, at para. 26: “Parliament has thus
created a standard of preventive detention that measures an accused’s present
condition according to past behaviour and patterns of conduct.” See also R.
v. Sipos, 2014 SCC 47, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 423, at para. 19. 

[30]                         
Parliament amended Part XXIV in 1997 to create
the category of “long-term offenders” and make it possible to supervise such
offenders in the community, thus establishing an alternative to the
indeterminate detention of persons designated as “dangerous offenders”.
Long-term offenders, those who meet the criteria specified in s. 753.1(1), may
be ordered to be subject to supervision in the community for a specified period
(maximum of 10 years) after the expiry of a determinate sentence, which must be
for a term of two years or more: s. 753.1(3). The purpose of the long-term
supervision provisions is twofold: to protect the public and to rehabilitate
offenders and facilitate their reintegration into the community: R. v.
Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 50. 

[31]                         
In R. v. Johnson, 2003 SCC 46,
[2003] 2 S.C.R. 357, Iacobucci and Arbour JJ. considered the purpose of the
long-term supervision provisions and the relationship between them and the
dangerous offender provisions. At the time, the use of the word “may” indicated
that, even if all the criteria were met, designation as either a long-term
offender or a dangerous offender was discretionary. The Court held that, in
light of the discretionary nature of a finding that an offender was a dangerous
offender and given the principles of sentencing in s. 718.2  of the Criminal
Code , a judge was required to consider finding an offender to be a
long-term offender — inquiring in particular into the possibility of eventual
control of the risk posed by the offender in the community — before imposing
the harsher punishment applicable to a dangerous offender (para. 28; Sipos,
at para. 22). Subsequent to the Court’s decision in Johnson,
Parliament acted in 2008 to eliminate the judge’s discretion in the context of
a dangerous offender application. The word “shall” now indicates that if a
court is satisfied that the criteria in s. 753(1)  have been met, it must find
the offender to be a dangerous offender. In eliminating this discretion,
however, Parliament built in a new flexibility regarding the consequences of
such a finding. Before 2008, a court that found an offender to be a dangerous
offender was obliged to (“shall”) impose a sentence of detention for an
indeterminate period (Johnson, at para. 5). Today, a court that
makes such a finding has the option of imposing an indeterminate sentence, a
determinate sentence of two years or more combined with long-term supervision
for up to 10 years, or a sentence for the offence for which the offender has
been convicted: s. 753(4) . It may impose one of the latter two sentences only
if it is satisfied that the sentence will adequately protect the public: s.
753(4.1) . 

(2)        
Specific Purpose of the SPIO Requirement in the
Dangerous and Long-term Offender Scheme

[32]                         
There are a number of procedural steps that must
be taken before a court can find that an offender is a dangerous offender or a
long-term offender. First of all, the prosecutor must apply to have the
offender remanded for assessment: s. 752.1(1) . An assessment report must then be
filed before the prosecutor can apply for a finding that the offender is a
dangerous offender or a long-term offender: ss. 753(1) or 753.1(1). The
prosecutor must give notice to the offender outlining the basis on which it is
intended to found the application: s. 754(1)(b). The Attorney General of
the province must consent to the application: s. 754(1)(a). All these
procedural protections enhance the overall fairness of the scheme. See Lyons,
at pp 362-63, for a discussion of the procedural safeguards provided
for in Part XXIV. 

[33]                         
There are also substantive requirements to be
met. Before the court remands an offender for assessment, it must be satisfied,
first, that the offender has been convicted of an SPIO as defined in s. 752 .
Second, there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the offender might be
found to be a dangerous offender under s. 753 or a long-term offender under s.
753.1. The SPIO requirement comes into play once again at the stage of the
application for a finding that the offender is a dangerous offender, as the
court must be satisfied that the offence is an SPIO before making such a
finding: s. 753(1). 

[34]                         
Thus, the SPIO requirement plays a crucial role
in the operation of the dangerous and long-term offender scheme. The sentences
that can be imposed under Part XXIV, including indeterminate detention and
long-term supervision, serve the purposes of both prevention and punishment. To
the extent that the sentence is based on a risk established in light of past
conduct and patterns of behaviour, it is preventive. As La Forest J. held in Lyons,
preventive detention under Part XXIV “represents a judgment that the
relative importance of the objectives of rehabilitation, deterrence and
retribution are greatly attenuated in the circumstances of the individual case,
and that of prevention, correspondingly increased” (p. 329). 

[35]                         
These sentences are also punitive, however, and
in this regard, the function of the SPIO requirement is twofold: first, it
serves as a “gatekeeper” for entry into the dangerous or long-term offender
system (s. 752.1(1) ); second, if the Crown applies for a finding that the
offender is a dangerous offender, it serves as a requirement for the making of
such a finding (s. 753(1)). If the punitive purpose of these sentencing options
were outweighed entirely by their preventive purpose, they might violate the
fundamental principle of sentencing, that a sentence must be proportionate to
the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.
The SPIO requirement helps safeguard the constitutionality of the scheme: Lyons,
at p. 338. As Lamer C.J. put it in Currie, “[t]he [SPIO] requirement
acts as a gatekeeper to ensure that the sentence is not disproportionate to the
offence” (para. 31; see also Goforth, at para. 44).

[36]                         
These two purposes, one of them general and the
other specific, are in conflict. In interpreting the definition of an SPIO, I
must give effect to the overall protective purpose of Part XXIV, while also
furthering the specific purpose of the SPIO requirement by tying the punishment
to the predicate offence and safeguarding the objective of proportionality.
Whereas an unduly narrow interpretation of the words “use or attempted use of
violence” could preclude courts from remanding potentially dangerous offenders
for assessment and thereby undermine the goal of public protection, an unduly
broad interpretation of those words would dilute the gatekeeper function of the
SPIO requirement and jeopardize the scheme’s objective of proportionality. 

[37]                         
The Crown relies on the Court’s statement in Currie
that the SPIO requirement “merely triggers the [s. 753(1)(b)]
application process. There remains a second stage to [s. 753(1)(b)], at
which point the trial judge must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the
likelihood of future danger that an offender presents to society before he or
she can impose the dangerous offender designation and an indeterminate
sentence” (Currie, at para. 25). This comment was made in the
context of a finding that an offender is a dangerous offender on the basis of
s. 753(1)(b) — that is, in relation to the commission of one of the
sexual offences enumerated in para. (b) of the definition of an SPIO in
s. 752  — but the same logic applies to a finding made under s. 753(1)(a),
which provides that the predicate offence must “for[m] a part” of a pattern of
behaviour underlying the threat the offender constitutes or be “associated
with” particularly brutal behaviour relied on as evidence of that threat. In
every case, the sentence is based on past conduct or patterns of behaviour, but
it cannot be divorced entirely from the predicate offence. 

(3)        
Words “Use or Attempted Use of Violence” Do Not
Include a Requirement of Objective Seriousness

[38]                         
This Court’s statement in Lyons (at p.
324) that the offences falling within the definition of an SPIO are “very
serious violent crimes” reflects the importance of the SPIO requirement in the
overall scheme. Some courts took this statement to mean that in every case the
predicate offence must on its own warrant the kind of punishment imposed under
Part XXIV, but this represents an incorrect reading of Lyons. As this
Court explained in Currie, at para. 28, the words “very serious
violent crime” were used in relation to the specific facts of Lyons and
did not require that all predicate offences fit that description. A predicate
offence must be serious, but the degree of seriousness intended by Parliament
is exhaustively set out in the definition of an SPIO in s. 752 . 

[39]                         
Paragraph (a) of the definition in s. 752 
requires, first, that the offence be an indictable offence, second, that the
maximum sentence for the offence be imprisonment for 10 years or more and,
third, that the offence involve (i) the use or attempted use of violence
against another person, or (ii) conduct endangering or likely to endanger the
life or safety of another person or inflicting or likely to inflict severe
psychological damage on another person. In subpara. (a)(i), the word
“violence” is not qualified, which means that the criteria may be satisfied even
if the violence in question is not in itself “serious” (see Goforth, at
para. 21; Lebar, at para. 67; R. v. Smith, 2012
ONCA 645 (CanLII), at para. 2). The degree of seriousness intended by
Parliament exists if all three requirements of the definition are met. Thus, an
offence that involves the use or attempted use of violence against another
person is not an SPIO under para. (a) of the definition if it is not an
indictable offence or if it is not punishable by a sentence of imprisonment for
10 years or more. Just as para. (b) of the definition does not invite
the court to assess the manner of commission of the enumerated offences,
subpara. (a)(i) does not invite it to assess the seriousness of the
violence the offender used or attempted to use; any level of violence is
sufficient. 

[40]                         
This interpretation is consistent with the
gatekeeper function of the SPIO requirement. An offender who commits an indictable
offence for which he or she may be sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years or
more and that involves the use or attempted use of violence against a person
commits what Parliament has defined as an SPIO; it is not necessary to further
inquire into the level of the violence in question. If the offender is remanded
for assessment and is then found, on the basis of past conduct and patterns of
behaviour, to be a dangerous offender or a long-term offender, it cannot be
said that the offender was “picked up off
the street because of his past criminality (for which he has already been
punished), or because of fears or suspicions about his criminal proclivities,
and then subjected to a procedure in order to determine whether society would
be better off if he were incarcerated indefinitely” (Lyons, at p.
328). Rather, the punishment “flows from the actual commission of a specific
crime, the requisite elements of which have been proved to exist beyond a
reasonable doubt” (ibid.). See also Johnson, at para. 23, in which
the Court mentioned that dangerous and long-term offender proceedings form part
of the sentencing process. 

[41]                         
This statutory framework enables courts to
properly sentence dangerous offenders who have committed SPIOs “without having
to wait for them to strike out in a particularly egregious way” (Currie,
at para. 26). For our purposes, the jurisprudence confirms that the words
“use or attempted use of violence” must be read in their grammatical and
ordinary sense, having regard to their statutory context. Neither the purpose
of the SPIO requirement nor that of Part XXIV warrants reading in a qualitative
minimum level of violence. 

B.           
Plain Meaning of the Term “Violence” in the
Context of the Criminal Code  and Other Legislation

[42]                         
The question of what constitutes violence is as
old as the criminal law itself. It is a moral question as much as a legal one,
and no doubt society’s answer to it has changed in tandem with evolving social
mores. I will not attempt — nor am I required — to answer it definitively. However,
in interpreting the words “use or attempted use of violence” in subpara. (a)(i)
of the definition of an SPIO, I must endeavour to ascertain their “plain
meaning”. In this regard, I am aided by dictionary definitions as well as by
judicial interpretations from a variety of contexts involving both the Criminal
Code  and other legislation. I will explain a conflict that exists between harm-based
definitions of violence that focus on acts by which a person causes, attempts
to cause or threatens to cause harm, and force-based definitions that
focus on the physical nature of the act. Building upon this Court’s reasoning
in C.D. and subsequent cases, I conclude that the prevailing definition
of violence is a harm-based one. 

[43]                         
In C.D., Bastarache J. began his discussion
of the definition of “violence” by noting that there is disagreement with
respect to its grammatical and ordinary meaning. After quoting one dictionary
definition of “violence”, namely “[t]he exercise of physical force so as to
inflict injury on, or cause damage to, persons or property” (The Oxford
English Dictionary (2nd ed. 1989), at p. 654), Bastarache J. noted that
violence is ordinarily understood not only in terms of the use of force, but
also in terms of the effects of that use. This conflict is reflected in
judicial definitions, as Prof. Teresa Scassa explains:

It
is significant that the Criminal Code , which one might assume to be the “bible”
of the control of violence in society, offers no definition of violence. It is,
surprisingly, perhaps the most “assumed” term within the entire Code. Offences
which one might consider the most “violent” of all crimes, such as murder and
assault, do not mention violence. Rather, they talk about concrete, measurable
things like “death” and “bodily harm.” 

 

(T. Scassa,
“Violence Against Women in Law Schools” (1992), 30 Alta. L. Rev.
809, at p. 816, cited in C.D., at para. 30.)

[44]                         
I would add that even dictionary definitions of “violence”
vary, reflecting both harm-based and force-based approaches. For instance, Le
Petit Robert dictionary (new ed. 2012) contains the following definition
of the French expression “faire violence” (do violence): “agir sur
[quelqu’un] ou le faire agir contre sa volonté, en employant la force ou
l’intimidation” ([translation]
“act so as to influence a person or to cause the person to act in a manner
contrary to his or her wishes, by using force or intimidation”) (p. 2717
(emphasis added)). The variance among definitions of violence — both those
found in dictionaries and those adopted by judges — highlights the need to
interpret the word in the context in which it is used. 

[45]                         
In C.D., the Court was being asked
to interpret the scope of the term “violent offence” as used in s. 39(1) (a)
of the YCJA  with respect to the imposition of custodial sentences on
young persons. Bastarache J. concluded that in the context of the YCJA ,
the term “violent offence” means “an offence in the commission of which
a young person causes, attempts to cause or threatens to cause bodily harm”
(para. 17). This definition is notable for its emphasis on the harmful effects
of violence rather than on the nature of the force that was applied. Thus,
threats of bodily harm are included even if physical force has not been used.
Bastarache J. explained that a harm-based approach encompasses both physical
and psychological harm, whereas a force-based approach would apply only to
those “harm-causing” offences that also involve the use, attempted use or
threatened use of force (para. 66). This definition of “violent offence” also
excludes certain acts that might otherwise fall within the ordinary meaning of
the word “violence”. For instance, it excludes crimes against property even
though such offences are generally considered to involve “violence” to property
(paras. 33 and 51). It also excludes relatively minor assaults committed
without causing, attempting to cause or threatening to cause bodily harm,
whereas a force-based definition would tend to encompass such assaults (para.
64). 

[46]                         
Some of the reasoning in C.D. was statute-specific.
For instance, Bastarache J. favoured a harm-based approach in part to include
certain offences — e.g. murder committed without the direct application of
physical force — that in his view ought to fall within the definition of
“violent offence” but that might not be included by a force-based approach
(paras. 58-65). However, he also made some general observations in support of
his adoption of a harm-based definition. He stated that such a definition
“better accords with . . . the ‘usual’ definition of violence, which
tends to focus on its effects (i.e. harm) rather than on the means employed to
produce the effects (i.e. force)” (para. 67). The inclusion of threats of
bodily harm in the definition of “violent offence” “accords with the commonly
held view that a threat to cause bodily harm is, at base, an act of violence”
(para. 85). He added the following:

The view that threats of bodily harm
are essentially acts of violence is likely based on the fact that threatening
to cause bodily harm can often perform the same function as actually causing
it, in that both can instill the level of fear in the victim that is needed to
achieve the offender’s goal: see [R. v. McCraw, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 72], at
pp. 81-82. In this sense, it can be said that irrespective of whether an
offender threatens to cause bodily harm or actually causes bodily harm, in both
cases he or she is “wielding violence” to satisfy his or her object(s). [para.
85]

I would endorse these
observations of Bastarache J. and would note that the harm-based approach he
articulated draws additional support from several recent decisions rendered by
this Court in a variety of contexts, including those of the offence of uttering
threats, the violence exception to freedom of expression, and the offence of
robbery. 

[47]                         
First, a recent case concerning the offence of
uttering threats provided for in s. 264.1(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  supports
the proposition that threats of violence are inherently violent, not
simply a means of communicating future violence. In R. v. McRae,
2013 SCC 68, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 931, the Court confirmed the elements of the
offence of uttering threats: 

[I]t is not necessary to prove that the
threats were conveyed to their intended recipients (prohibited act) or that the
accused intended the threats to be so conveyed (fault element). Further, it is
not necessary to prove that anyone was actually intimidated by the threats
(prohibited act) or that the accused specifically intended to intimidate anyone
(fault element). The concept of the “closed circle” is therefore legally wrong.
 Threats are tools of intimidation and violence.  As such, in any
circumstance where threats are spoken with the intent that they be taken
seriously, even to third parties, the elements of the offence will be made out.
[Emphasis added; para. 24.]

In other words, the act
of threatening harm can itself be an act of violence even if the threats are
not conveyed to their intended recipients or are not intended to be so
conveyed, so long as they are intended to be taken seriously. 

[48]                         
Incidentally, this does not mean that the
offence of uttering threats under s. 264.1(1) (a) is an SPIO. Even if the
offence were found to meet the violence requirement (“use or attempted use of
violence”) of subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an SPIO, it is not
punishable by a sentence of imprisonment for 10 years and therefore fails to
meet the seriousness requirement: s. 264.1(2) (a). 

[49]                         
Second, in C.D., Bastarache J. discussed
this Court’s decisions with respect to freedom of expression and the question
whether threats of violence fall outside the scope of constitutionally
protected speech (para. 31). In R. v. Keegstra, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697,
Dickson C.J. had held that only “expression communicated directly through
physical harm” could be considered violence and be excluded from the protection
of s. 2 (b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  on that
basis (p. 732). It was unclear from the early cases whether the “violence
exception” extended to threats of violence, but any lingering uncertainty was
eliminated in R. v. Khawaja, 2012 SCC 69, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 555, in which
McLachlin C.J. held: “This Court’s jurisprudence supports the proposition that
the exclusion of violence from the s. 2 (b) guarantee of free expression
extends to threats of violence” (para. 70). The same rationale for excluding
expression conveyed by physical violence from the protection of s. 2 (b)
also applies to threats of violence. 

[50]                         
Third, Bastarache J. in C.D. discussed
the different forms of robbery under s. 343. Regarding s. 343(b), he
mentioned that the expression “personal violence” in the phrase “wounds, beats,
strikes or uses any personal violence” had been interpreted to require something
more than a mere technical assault. On the other hand, the phrase “uses
violence or threats of violence” in s. 343(a) had been interpreted to
include simple assault (para. 32). Putting aside, for a moment, technical
arguments about the construction of each of the provisions, I would note that
Parliament included threats of violence among the violent acts that elevate the
offence of theft to that of robbery. In this regard, I agree with the comment
of Epstein J.A. in Lebar: “Section 343(a) applies to a robbery
committed with violence. It is categorically a crime of violence — violence is
an essential element of an offence under that section” (para. 33). 

[51]                         
This brief survey of judicial interpretations of
the term “violence” suggests that the focus is on the harm caused, attempted or
threatened rather than on the force that was applied. I do not suggest that the
definition of violence must be a harm-based one in every case. Context will be
paramount. As I mention below (see para. 65), there may be situations in which
the presumption of consistent expression is clearly rebutted by other
principles of interpretation and, as a result, the intended meaning of violence
may vary between statutes and even, in some circumstances, within them: R.
Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (5th ed.
2008), at p. 222. However, unless the context or the purpose of the
statute suggests a different approach, the prevailing definition of “violence”
is a harm-based one that encompasses acts by which a person causes, attempts to
cause or threatens to cause harm. 

C.           
Statutory Context Supports a Harm-Based
Definition That Encompasses Threats of Violence

[52]                         
Having established that the purposive arguments
are in conflict, that it is therefore necessary to consider the plain meaning
of the words as well as the statutory context, and that the plain meaning
generally favours a harm-based definition of violence that includes threats, I
will now discuss the context in detail. The scope of the expression “use or
attempted use of violence” must ultimately be determined having regard to the
context in which it is used: C.D., at para. 33; Lebar, at
para. 38. 

[53]                         
Currently, the definition of an SPIO is relevant
only to the dangerous and long-term offender scheme in Part XXIV of the Criminal
Code , but this was not always the case. Between 2007 and 2012, s. 742.1  of
the Criminal Code  referred to that definition for the purpose of
excluding certain offenders from the imposition of conditional sentences. In
interpreting the definition for this purpose, some courts reasoned that the
context of s. 742.1  called for a different interpretive approach: see, for
example, Lebar; R. v. Goulet, 2011 ABCA 230, 52 Alta. L.R.
(5th) 241. I mention this in passing because, although some of the SPIO
jurisprudence was developed in that context, the definition of an SPIO is no
longer relevant to the imposition of such sentences and must therefore be
interpreted solely in the context of its role in the dangerous and long-term
offender scheme. 

[54]                         
Mr. Steele relies heavily, as did the Court of
Appeal, on contextual arguments and the corresponding principles of statutory
interpretation, and in particular on the presumption against tautology and the
presumption of consistent expression. I must address the following arguments: 
First, it is argued that the words “conduct . . . inflicting or
likely to inflict severe psychological damage” in subpara. (a)(ii) of
the definition of an SPIO would be redundant if the words “use or attempted use
of violence” in subpara. (a)(i) are not interpreted narrowly. Second,
according to the Court of Appeal, the fact that robbery is excluded from the
offences enumerated in para. (b) of the definition of an SPIO indicates
that not every robbery is an SPIO. Third, the Court of Appeal stated that
because the definition of robbery in s. 343(a) refers to the use of both
violence and threats of violence, there must be some difference between the two
and that, in light of the presumption of consistent expression, the reference
to the use of violence in the definition of an SPIO therefore excludes threats
of violence. With respect, I disagree with each of these arguments, for the
following reasons.  

(1)        
Subparagraph (a)(ii) of the Definition of
an SPIO in Section 752 

[55]                         
Subparagraph (a)(ii) of the definition of
an SPIO refers to “conduct endangering or likely to endanger the life or safety
of another person or inflicting or likely to inflict severe psychological
damage on another person”. Mr. Steele argues that if subpara. (a)(i) of
the definition is interpreted more broadly, it would apply to less serious
instances of the very conduct to which subpara. (a)(ii) applies, thereby
rendering the “severe psychological damage” portion of the definition
redundant. If this argument is taken a step further, it might be argued that
subpara. (a)(ii) targets violent activity on the basis of its harm or
effects — i.e. danger to life or safety or severe psychological damage —
whereas subpara. (a)(i) targets violent activity on the basis of the
force that was applied — i.e. use or attempted use of violence. 

[56]                         
With respect, after considering the relationship
between subparas. (a)(i) and (a)(ii) of the definition, I am led
to the opposite conclusion. As a preliminary matter, there is no indication
that the various parts of the definition of an SPIO in s. 752  are mutually
exclusive: see R. v. J.Y. (1996), 141 Sask. R. 132 (C.A.), at para. 22.
On the contrary, I can think of many scenarios in which an offence causing the
harms outlined in subpara. (a)(ii) would clearly also involve “the use
or attempted use of violence”. The same can be said about para. (b) of
the definition, which lists a number of sexual offences to include them in the
definition of an SPIO. The offences enumerated in para. (b) will of
course often also meet the qualitative criteria of subparas. (a)(i) and
(a)(ii). The fact that a proposed interpretation would bring some
offences within the ambit of more than one part of the definition in s. 752 
should not, in itself, justify narrowing the definition to avoid such overlaps.


[57]                         
Furthermore, to the extent that redundancy is a
problem in the case at bar, I would suggest that the Court of Appeal’s
interpretation of subpara. (a)(i) adds to the redundancy rather than
reducing it. By confining the expression “use or attempted use of violence” to
physical action or danger, the Court of Appeal has rendered it largely
indistinguishable from the expression “conduct endangering or likely to
endanger the life or safety of another person” in subpara. (a)(ii). The
Court of Appeal held that there must be “some degree of physical action” for a
threat to amount to an attempted use of violence: “[T]here needs to be some
indication of imminent apparent danger to a person or some overt act directed
towards the actual use of violence against a person for a threat of violence to
also constitute the attempted use of violence” (para. 85). Scott C.J.M.
endorsed the reasoning in Thompson, in which a similar distinction was
made between violent and non-violent threats on the basis of proximity to the “actual
perpetration of violence” (para. 77). With respect, this interpretation
artificially limits the ordinary harm-based meaning of the “violence” concept
in subpara. (a)(i) and transforms that provision into a replication of
the dangerousness portion of subpara. (a)(ii). As Bastarache J. stated
in C.D., “[t]he fact that violent conduct is different from dangerous
conduct is made quite clear in . . . s. 752 ” (para. 79). 

[58]                         
I agree that the effect of my interpretation
will be to include certain offences causing less-than-severe psychological
damage within the scope of subpara. (a)(i). However, this does not
render the reference to “severe psychological damage” in subpara. (a)(ii)
redundant. In other words, the endangerment and severe psychological damage
referred to in subpara. (a)(ii) do not merely form a narrower subset of
“the use or attempted use of violence”. In my view, the two provisions are
qualitatively different owing, in part, to the required level of intent. 
Subparagraph (a)(i) concerns violent acts — “the use or attempted use of
violence” — and requires violent intent on the offender’s part. This part of
the definition will apply to an offender who intentionally causes,
attempts to cause or threatens to cause harm. Threats are included by virtue of
the speaker’s intent that they be taken seriously.  Subparagraph (a)(ii),
on the other hand, relates solely to the effects of conduct. It does not refer
to violence in general, or even to intent. Thus, numerous courts have properly
included offences involving negligence — for example, dangerous operation of a
motor vehicle, vessel or aircraft causing bodily harm (s. 249(3) ) — within the
scope of subpara. (a)(ii) on the basis that they caused one of the
effects in question: see, e.g., Cepic; R. v. O’Keefe, 2011 NLCA
41, 309 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 253. Conversely, although I will not decide this
issue, I would have difficulty concluding that a negligence-based offence
involves “the use or attempted use of violence”. 

[59]                         
I would note that in C.D., Bastarache
J. excluded offences for which bodily harm need merely be reasonably
foreseeable from the definition of “violent offence”. He reasoned: “. . . I do
not support the inclusion of a ‘reasonable foreseeability of bodily harm’
aspect in the definition of ‘violent offence’ because, in my view, whether
an offence is likely to result in bodily harm is really a question of whether
the offence is dangerous rather than whether it is violent, and these two
concepts are quite distinct from one another” (para. 79 (emphasis added)).
He relied on s. 752  in support of this proposition. 

[60]                         
In conclusion, a harm-based approach to subpara.
(a)(i) according to which threatening violence constitutes a form of use
of violence is not inconsistent with the endangerment and psychological damage
aspects of the definition in subpara. (a)(ii). 

(2)        
Paragraph (b) of the Definition

[61]                         
I have already briefly addressed the argument
that the exclusion of robbery from the offences listed in para. (b) of
the definition is relevant to the determination of legislative intent. With
respect, this argument is based on two false premises. First, robbery may be
committed by way of threats of violence to property and such threats are
clearly excluded from the definition of an SPIO, which means that Parliament
could not have categorically defined robbery as an SPIO even if it considered
the threats to be violent. Second, Parliament identified three sexual offences
each of which categorically qualifies as an SPIO in para. (b). There is
no indication that Parliament intended to create an exhaustive list of all
offences constituting SPIOs in all cases. Rather, as this Court stated in Currie,
para. (b) serves to make it clear that the enumerated sexual
offences, whatever form they may take, are inherently serious and may trigger a
dangerous offender application (para. 22).   

[62]                         
The reason why Parliament included a list of
sexual offences is surely not that sexual offences are not otherwise covered by
the expression “use or attempted use of violence”. The more reasonable view is
that Parliament included the list to make it clear that such offences will
constitute SPIOs in all circumstances, even those that are committed with
minimal physical force and that do not result in bodily harm. Furthermore, the
view that Parliament, in enacting para. (b) of the definition, was
rejecting a narrow approach that might exclude some sexual offences is
consistent with my interpretation of subpara. (a)(i), which rules out a
similarly narrow approach in the context of threats of violence. 

(3)        
Section 343(a)

[63]                         
The Court of Appeal relied heavily on the need
for consistency in the interpretation of s. 343(a) and subpara. (a)(i)
of the definition of an SPIO in s. 752 . This argument is appealing at first
glance. It can be summarized as follows: Section 343(a) refers to the
use of violence and the use of threats of violence. Subparagraph (a)(i)
of the definition refers to the use of violence and the attempted use of
violence. Threats of violence are not mentioned in subpara. (a)(i). If
s. 343(a) is read disjunctively, there must be some difference between
the use of violence and the use of threats of violence. As a result, the
question is whether the expression “uses . . . threats of violence”
in s. 343(a) is equivalent to the expression the “attempted use of violence”
in subpara. (a)(i) of the definition. The Court of Appeal cited the
presumption that the use of different language suggests that the legislature
intended different meanings and the principle that the same words have the same
meaning throughout a statute. 

[64]                         
With respect, I find this argument to be an
overly technical one that fails to take into account the full context in which
the expressions “uses violence” and “use of violence” appear in the two
provisions. First, the argument is based on a strictly disjunctive reading of
the words “uses violence or threats of violence” in s. 343(a) that
suggests that the expressions “violence” and “threats of violence” have
different meanings. But in s. 343(b), the list “wounds, beats, strikes
or uses any personal violence” is clearly not disjunctive — the words “uses any
personal violence” encompass the other acts in the list. In my view, the
contextual information from s. 343(b) suggests that Parliament may well
have included threats of violence in s. 343(a) as a way to make it clear
that threats of violence were to be included among the violent acts that would
be included in the definition of robbery (see Sullivan, at p. 214). 

[65]                         
Second, even a strictly disjunctive reading of
the words “uses violence or threats of violence” in s. 343(a) does not
lead inexorably to the conclusion that the expression “use . . . of
violence” in subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an SPIO means the same
thing as “uses violence” in s. 343(a). The two provisions are in
unrelated parts of the Criminal Code , and they have distinct purposes
and legislative histories. As Ruth Sullivan notes, “[s]ome statutes, like Insurance Acts or the Criminal
Code , are frequent[ly] amended decade after decade. It is not surprising,
then, that inadvertent variations occur within a single Act. It is even more
likely that they would occur within the statute book as a whole” (p. 222). If s. 343(a) were to be interpreted disjunctively, the use of
violence would have to be understood as the use of physical violence in
order to exclude threats of violence from the definition. As I mentioned above,
however, the meaning of the word “violence” is not limited to physical violence
everywhere it appears in the Criminal Code  or in other legislation. For
instance, as this Court stated in McRae (at para. 24), threats are
themselves “tools of intimidation and violence” in the context of s. 264.1(1) (a).
Thus, even if the word “violence” in s. 343 (a) is interpreted using a
force-based definition, that is, as meaning uses physical violence or
threats of physical violence, this need not preclude courts from
interpreting the same word in a contextually sensitive manner in subpara. (a)(i)
of the definition of an SPIO in s. 752 . 

[66]                         
In short, I find that threats of violence to a
person (and not threats to property) that are sufficient to ground a conviction
for robbery under s. 343(a) meet the “use . . . of violence”
criterion in subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an SPIO in s. 752 .
This approach is consistent with the broader understanding of robbery as the
crime of theft committed with violence. 

D.          
Conclusion: Robbery Committed by Using Threats
of Violence to a Person is a Serious Personal Injury Offence

[67]                         
Not all robberies are SPIOs. Robbery committed
by using violence or a threat of violence to property is clearly
excluded. Robbery committed by using violence to a person is clearly
included. In the case bar, in the context of a robbery committed by using a threat
of violence to a person, the trial judge and the Court of Appeal
attempted to draw a line. Although the Court of Appeal was not prepared to
conclude categorically that threats are not violent, it held that some, but not
all, threats are violent. Something more than a mere verbal threat is required:
“[T]here needs to be some indication of imminent apparent danger to a
person or some overt act directed towards the actual use of violence”
(para. 85 (emphasis added)).

[68]                         
I have rejected this view for the numerous
reasons given above. In short, a threat of violence is itself a form of
violence, and the respondent’s context-based arguments have not persuaded me to
depart from this premise in interpreting subpara. (a)(i) of the
definition of an SPIO. 

[69]                         
Finally, the Court of Appeal’s interpretation
would have undesirable consequences. In seeking to distinguish between violent
and non-violent threats, the Court of Appeal referred to a number of cases in
which courts have grappled with this very question. Threatening to “splat” the
clerk of a cheque cashing business (Thompson), raising a baseball bat in
a threatening manner in confronting two police officers (Roy), and
saying “[m]oney and cigarettes in the bag” while making an implied threat of
violence if this demand were not met (Jolicoeur, at para. 25), have all
been held not to satisfy the “use or attempted use of violence” criterion,
because they lacked the requisite physical act or danger. On the other hand, an
offender who had committed robbery by producing a knife and holding it close to
the victim satisfied the criterion despite the absence of physical injury (Lebar).
It would be possible to list other examples of cases in which trial judges have
endeavoured to distinguish violent from non-violent threats on the facts of the
cases before them. At the end of the day, however, I conclude that such an
exercise is not just difficult, but pointless. 

[70]                         
The Court of Appeal’s approach is inconsistent
with the principles of statutory interpretation I discussed above. It would
result in untold difficulties for trial judges seeking to establish the elusive
dividing line between threats that are inherently violent and those that are
not. Finally, in my view, it is incompatible with the plain meaning and the
purpose of the provision. All threats of violence are themselves violent, even
though the seriousness of the violence may be quite limited. In seeking to distinguish
violent from non-violent threats, courts are in effect reading in an objective
minimum level of violence. This is inconsistent with the clear language of
subpara. (a)(i) of the definition, which requires violence, not serious
violence, and it risks undermining the overall purpose of Part XXIV by
precluding courts from remanding potentially dangerous offenders for
assessment. 

[71]                         
When, in committing the robbery, Mr. Steele
threatened the cashiers by saying “I have a gun”, he used violence against another
person within the meaning of subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of an
SPIO. 

VI.       
Disposition

[72]                         
I would allow the appeal without costs. Mr.
Steele was convicted under s. 343(a) of robbery, an offence that
satisfies the criterion set out in subpara. (a)(i) of the definition of
a “serious personal injury offence” in s. 752 . Since the other requirements for
the Crown’s application for remand for an assessment have not been contested, I
would grant the application and order that Mr. Steele be remanded for assessment
pursuant to s. 752.1(1) .

                    The judgment
of the Court was delivered orally by 

[1]                             
Cromwell J. ― This
appeal as of right comes to us on the dissent of Berger J.A. in the Alberta
Court of Appeal. The question is whether the trial judge’s failure to identify
a s. 8  breach in addition to the admitted breach of s. 10 (b) justifies
considering the trial judge’s s. 24(2)  analysis afresh on appeal.

[2]                             
In our view it does not.  Assuming, without deciding, that there was a
s. 8  breach on these facts, it is clear that the trial judge conducted her s.
24(2)  analysis on the basis that the s. 10 (b) breach resulted in the
appellant producing the joint and lump of marihuana. As she put it, “While [the
police officer] gave evidence that she would have arrested Mr. Mohamed if he
had not got out of the car at her request, and I have found that she had
grounds to do so, it is not a certainty that the exhibits of marihuana would
have been discovered otherwise.  The production of the joint and the lump of
marihuana were clearly as a result of [the officer’s] prompting of Mr. Mohamed”
(A.R., vol. I, p. 57 (emphasis added)). It is thus clear that the trial judge’s
s. 24(2)  analysis would not have been different had she found an independent s.
8  breach.

[3]                             
In light of that conclusion, our view is that there is no basis to
interfere on appeal with the trial judge’s weighing of the various factors
under the s. 24(2)  analysis.

[4]                             
The appeal is dismissed.

                    Constitutional law — Charter of Rights  —

Exemption from offence of disclosing intercepted private communication without

be in the interests of the administration of justice in Canada or elsewhere —
Whether provision unjustifiably infringes s. 7 or 8 of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , s. 193(2) (e).

                    Criminal law —
Interception of communications — Disclosure of information — Exemption from
offence — Whether exemption provision which authorizes sharing of lawfully
obtained wiretap information between Canadian and foreign law enforcement
agencies is constitutional — Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , ss. 7 , 8 
— Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , s. 193(2) (e).

                    The
RCMP lawfully intercepted private communications between W and others that
revealed a plot to transport drugs into the United States of America. The
wiretap information was disclosed to U.S. authorities, who used it to seize a
large quantity of ecstasy pills at a border crossing. The U.S. requested W’s
extradition. At the extradition hearing, W submitted that legislation
authorizing the disclosure violates ss. 7  and 8  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms , and the intercepted communications should not be
admitted as evidence. The extradition judge rejected W’s arguments and issued a
committal order. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.

                    Held
(Abella, Cromwell and Karakatsanis JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be
dismissed.

                    Per
LeBel, Rothstein and Moldaver JJ.:  The ability to share information between law enforcement agencies
facilitates the effective investigation of domestic and multi-jurisdictional
crime. Part VI of the Criminal Code  sets out a comprehensive scheme intended
by Parliament to exclusively govern the interception and use of private
communications for law enforcement purposes. Therefore,
there is no need to consider the
constitutionality of s. 8(2) (f) of the Privacy Act . Section
193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code  is the governing provision in this
case. Although not structured as an explicit authorizing provision, it
implicitly authorizes cross-border disclosure of lawfully intercepted wiretap
information. Accordingly, the arguments raised by W properly go to the
constitutionality of s. 193(2) (e). 

                    Section 8  of the Charter  is
engaged. Although a disclosure is not a search within the meaning of s. 8 , s. 8 
protects wiretap targets at both the interception and disclosure stages under
Part VI of the Criminal Code . Wiretap interceptions are highly invasive and
pose heightened privacy concerns. There is a residual, albeit diminished,
expectation of privacy in wiretap information after it has been lawfully
collected. W’s s. 7  arguments need not be addressed. They are subsumed under the s. 8  analysis.

                    In order for a search to be
reasonable under s. 8 , it must be authorized by law, the law itself must be reasonable,
and the search must be carried out in a reasonable manner. This same framework
applies, mutatis mutandis, to disclosures made pursuant to s. 193(2) (e).
Applying this framework to the facts at hand, there is no violation of s. 8 . The disclosure in this case was lawfully authorized by s. 193(2) (e),
and the legislation, taken as a whole, is reasonable. Furthermore, there is no
evidence that the manner of disclosure was unreasonable. 

                    With respect to the first step of
the s. 8  framework, the disclosure in this case was authorized by law. A
disclosure will be authorized by law where it is carried out in accordance with
the procedural and substantive requirements the law provides. Section 193(2) (e)
requires that the recipient must be a person or authority with responsibility
in a foreign state for the investigation or prosecution of offences, and the
disclosure must be intended to be in the interests of the administration of
justice in Canada or elsewhere. The disclosure in this case was provided to
U.S. law enforcement authorities for the purpose of foiling a cross-border drug
smuggling operation. In making the disclosure, Canadian authorities intended to
advance the administration of justice in Canada and the United States.

                    Turning to the second step, s.
193(2) (e) is a reasonable law. First, it is not unconstitutionally
overbroad. It limits the type of information that may be disclosed, the purpose for which it may
be disclosed, and the persons to whom it may be disclosed. Second, it is not
unconstitutionally vague. While “the administration of
justice” as used in s. 193(2) (e) is a broad concept, it is not one that
so lacks in precision as to give insufficient guidance for legal debate. In
this context, the phrase “the administration of justice” means that the
disclosure must be for a legitimate law enforcement purpose.

                    Third, s. 193(2)(e) is not
unconstitutional for lack of accountability or transparency mechanisms. Part VI of the Criminal
Code  contains numerous privacy safeguards. The judicial authorization relating to the
initial interception requires privacy interests to be balanced with the
interests of law enforcement. The interception of communications is also
subject to notice and reporting requirements. Additionally, accountability has
been built into the disclosure scheme itself. A disclosure that fails to comply
with s. 193(2) (e) can lead to criminal charges against the disclosing
party or result in the exclusion of improperly disclosed evidence at a
subsequent proceeding. This provides a powerful incentive for Canadian
authorities to comply with s. 193(2) (e). Finally, although not
constitutionally mandated in every case, adherence to international protocols
and the use of caveats or information-sharing agreements may be relevant in
determining whether a disclosure was intended to advance the administration of
justice, and therefore was authorized by s. 193(2) (e).

                    As
regards the third step of the s. 8  framework, the use of protocols, caveats, or
agreements may also be relevant to assessing whether the disclosure was carried
out in a reasonable manner. The
disclosure in this case was carried out in a reasonable manner. Nothing
suggests that the police acted unreasonably. However,
in different factual contexts, there may be significant potential dangers posed
by the disclosure of intercepted communications to foreign authorities. Where a disclosing party knows or should
have known that the information could be used in unfair trials, to facilitate
discrimination or political intimidation, or to commit torture or other human
rights violations, s. 8  requires that the disclosure, if permissible at all, be
carried out in a reasonable manner. In the most serious cases, s. 8  will forbid
disclosure. In other cases, information-sharing protocols or caveats may
sufficiently mitigate the risks. 

                    Per
McLachlin C.J.:  The only issue on this appeal is whether the disclosure of the
intercepted communications violated s. 8  of the Charter , and, if so,
whether the evidence should have been excluded under s. 24(2) . It is not
necessary to consider the constitutionality of s. 193(2)(e), s. 193(2)(b)
or the Privacy Act  to answer that question. W has not shown an
infringement of his s. 8  rights. The individual whose communications are
lawfully intercepted under a valid and reasonably executed warrant cannot
complain that use of the information for law enforcement breaches his right to
privacy. This principle is not confined to the use of information in Canada.
Sharing the information for purposes of law enforcement does not violate s. 8 . Sections
7  and 8  of the Charter  protect against unreasonable uses of lawfully
intercepted information but in this case, where the information was disclosed
to U.S. authorities for law enforcement purposes, these residual concerns about
unreasonable use do not arise. W’s rights were not violated.

                    Section
193(2)(e) does not change this. It is not an authorizing
provision. It does not confer a power on Canadian authorities to share
information with foreign counterparts. The provision operates by exempting
officers from prosecution where they disclosed intercepted communications under
their common law powers. Section 193(1)  of the Criminal Code  makes it an
offence to disclose intercepted private communications without consent. Section
193(2)(e) is an exemption from that offence. It preserves the common law
power of law enforcement authorities to share lawfully obtained information for
purposes of law enforcement both domestically and abroad. The exception
prevents law enforcement officers from being convicted for using information
obtained under warrant for purposes of law enforcement. It is therefore
unnecessary to opine on the constitutionality of s. 193(2)(e). 

                    Per
Abella, Cromwell and Karakatsanis JJ. (dissenting):  Section 193(2)(e)
violates s. 8  of the Charter  in a manner that is not justified under s. 1 .
It permits disclosure of wiretapped information to foreign officials
without safeguards or restrictions on how the information may be used and
without accountability measures for this broad state power. Nothing restrains
foreign law enforcement officials from using this highly personal information
in unfair trials or in ways that violate human rights norms, from publicly
disseminating the information, or from sharing it with other states. The torture of Maher Arar in Syria provides a chilling example of
the dangers of unconditional information sharing. Section 8  requires that when
a law authorizes intrusions on privacy, it must do so in a reasonable manner. A
reasonable law must have adequate safeguards to prevent abuse. It must avoid intruding
farther than necessary. It must strike an appropriate balance between privacy
and other public interests. Section 193(2)(e) falls short on all three
counts. The permitted disclosure to foreign officials without safeguards
renders the Part VI wiretap regime of the Criminal Code  unconstitutional.
The appropriate remedy is to strike the words “or to a person or authority with
responsibility in a foreign state” from s. 193(2)(e). It is unnecessary
to consider the constitutionality of s. 8(2) (f) of the Privacy Act 
or arguments with respect to s. 7  of the Charter . 

                    Balancing
the state’s interest in a search and the public interest in protecting privacy
involves asking what level of privacy protection we are entitled to expect.
International cooperation and information sharing are essential to law
enforcement. Canadian interests are served by appropriate information sharing
with other jurisdictions. Timely disclosure will often be critical in the
investigation of serious transnational crimes. However, when information is
shared across jurisdictional lines, safeguards that apply in domestic investigations
lose their force. Section 193(2)(e) does nothing to prevent the use of
disclosed information in proceedings which fail to respect due process and
human rights. The requirement of prior judicial authorization does not provide
sufficient protection against inappropriate future use. The failure to require
caveats on the use of disclosed information is unreasonable. Caveats or
standing agreements would not undermine the objectives of the wiretap scheme. They
are commonplace in international law enforcement cooperation and provide some
assurance that disclosed information will only be used in accordance with
respect for due process and human rights. 

                    For
a law to provide reasonable authority for a search or seizure, it must include
some mechanism to permit oversight of state use of the power. Accountability
mechanisms deter and identify inappropriate intrusions on privacy. None of the
safeguards in Part VI apply to disclosure to foreign officials. Improper or
hazardous information sharing is unlikely to come to light without record-keeping,
reporting or notice obligations. It is for Parliament to decide what measures
are most appropriate, but, at a minimum, the disclosing party should be
required to create a written record and to make the sharing known to the target
or to government.

                    The
infringement of s. 8  of the Charter  is not justified under s. 1 . The
objective of international cooperation in law enforcement is pressing and substantial, and disclosure of wiretap information is
rationally connected to that objective. However, s. 193(2)(e) as it is
presently drafted interferes with privacy to a greater extent than necessary. The
inclusion of accountability mechanisms and limits on subsequent use would cure
the constitutional deficiencies without undermining Parliament’s goals.

                    Moldaver J. — 

I.             
Introduction

[1]                             
The ability to share information between law
enforcement agencies, including lawfully intercepted wiretap information,
facilitates the effective investigation of both domestic and
multi-jurisdictional crime. But the effective investigation of crime must
proceed in accordance with the rights guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms . The main issue in this appeal is whether federal
legislation which authorizes the sharing of lawfully obtained wiretap
information between Canadian and foreign law enforcement agencies is
constitutional — specifically, whether the legislation falls short of the
constitutional standards mandated by the Charter . 

II.          
Background

[2]                             
Andrew Gordon Wakeling was the subject of a
Canadian drug investigation. Over the course of the investigation, the RCMP
lawfully monitored and recorded communications between Mr. Wakeling and others.
These communications revealed a plot to transport drugs across the Canada-U.S.
border. Canadian authorities provided this information to U.S. authorities (the
“Impugned Disclosure”), who used it to intercept and seize 46,000 ecstasy pills
at the International Falls, Minnesota border crossing on April 5, 2006.

[3]                             
The U.S. sought Mr. Wakeling’s extradition from
Canada for his involvement in the ecstasy shipment. At the extradition hearing,
Mr. Wakeling submitted that the legislation authorizing the Impugned Disclosure
was unconstitutional. Specifically, he argued that the provisions breach ss.  7 
and 8  of the Charter , and that the wiretap information provided to U.S.
law enforcement authorities should therefore not be admitted as evidence
against him.

[4]                             
The extradition judge, Ross J., rejected Mr.
Wakeling’s arguments and issued a committal order. That order was upheld by the
British Columbia Court of Appeal. Before this Court, Mr. Wakeling requests that
the committal order be quashed and that a new extradition hearing be held.

[5]                             
For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss Mr.
Wakeling’s appeal. 

III.       
Statutory Provisions

and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the
principles of fundamental justice.

 

8. Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or
seizure.

Judicial History

A.          
Supreme Court of British Columbia, 2011 BCSC
165, 268 C.C.C. (3d) 295 (Ross J.)

[9]                             
At his extradition hearing, Mr. Wakeling
restricted his constitutional challenge to s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal
Code  and s. 8(2) (f) of the Privacy Act . He made a variety
of broad and sweeping submissions in support of his contention that the
impugned provisions do not pass constitutional muster. 

[10]                         
Mr. Wakeling submitted that transparency,
accountability and the rule of law are principles of fundamental justice under
s. 7  of the Charter  and that the provisions in question are
unconstitutional because the disclosure they authorize does not comply with
these principles (trial judgment, at para. 42). He also argued that both
provisions breach s. 7  of the Charter  because they are vague and overbroad.
With respect to s. 193(2) (e), he submitted that it “provides virtually
unlimited discretion to law enforcement” to disclose wiretap communications and
he criticized the subjective nature of the test it employs (ibid., at
para. 99). He further submitted that the phrase “the interests of the
administration of justice . . . elsewhere” is “incapable of framing
legal debate within Canada” and that it does not have a “constant and settled
meaning” (ibid.). In his view, the effect of these uncertainties is that
decision-makers are given “unrestricted latitude . . . to disclose
intercepted private communications or the substance of the communications, and
to be exempt from the application of the offence provisions of Part VI” (ibid.).


[11]                         
With respect to s. 8  of the Charter , Mr.
Wakeling submitted that the Impugned Disclosure re-engaged s. 8  such that a second
judicial authorization was needed before the disclosure could occur. In this
regard, he submitted that his privacy interests at the disclosure stage were
the same as those he enjoyed at the interception stage and deserved the same
protection (trial judgment, at para. 68). Hence, he argued that a second
judicial authorization should be required prior to disclosure, and that the
provisions in question are unreasonable because they do not provide for this. 
He also submitted that the provisions are unreasonable because they do not
contain sufficient accountability mechanisms such as a police record-keeping
requirement, a requirement to report to Parliament about the disclosures, or an
obligation to provide notice of the disclosure to the person whose
communications were intercepted. Finally, he took issue with the fact that
Canadian authorities have little control over the subsequent use of the
disclosed information (para. 116). 

[12]                         
The extradition judge considered and rejected
all of Mr. Wakeling’s arguments. In her view, the constitutionality of s. 8(2) (f)
of the Privacy Act  did not need to be considered because s. 193(2) (e)
of the Criminal Code  “expressly governs disclosure of private
communications intercepted under Part VI of the Criminal Code  to foreign
law enforcement authorities” and “[t]he more general information sharing rules
in the Privacy Act  are subject to the specific provisions of [the Criminal
Code ]” (para. 21). 

[13]                         
Turning to Mr. Wakeling’s constitutional
arguments, the extradition judge concluded that the Impugned Disclosure did not
re-engage s. 8  of the Charter , as the Impugned Disclosure was “not
conduct that interferes with a reasonable expectation of privacy in the
circumstances” (para. 75). Thus, the disclosure did not amount to “a search or
seizure that engages s. 8  of the Charter ” (ibid.). In the
alternative, she reasoned that if the Impugned Disclosure engaged s. 8 ,
s. 193(2) (e) is a reasonable law.

[14]                         
The extradition judge also rejected Mr.
Wakeling’s submission that transparency and accountability are principles of
fundamental justice that apply to s. 193(2) (e). In her view, “[e]ven if
these concepts could be characterized as principles of fundamental justice in
some contexts, they could not realistically be applied to the manner in which
police investigate criminal activity” (para. 48).

[15]                         
The extradition judge similarly rejected Mr.
Wakeling’s submission that s. 193(2) (e) is vague and overbroad, noting
that

in making
the arguments on vagueness and overbreadth that he does, the applicant demands
a level of drafting precision from Parliament that is neither constitutionally
mandated, nor realistic. By necessity, the wording of s. 193(2) (e) had to be
kept fairly broad to capture the myriad of ways in which a need to disclose “in
the interests of the administration of justice” might arise. The law must
retain flexibility since laws must of necessity govern a variety of different circumstances
and situations. [para. 108]

[16]                         
Lastly, the extradition judge rejected Mr.
Wakeling’s rule of law argument. Relying on this Court’s decision in British
Columbia v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2005 SCC 49,
[2005] 2 S.C.R. 473, she found Mr. Wakeling’s submissions to be “circular,
since the measures are themselves embodied in the law” (para. 53). 

[17]                         
Having rejected Mr. Wakeling’s legal arguments,
the extradition judge considered the evidence and found that it was sufficient
to warrant his committal. 

B.           
British Columbia Court of Appeal, 2012 BCCA 397,
328 B.C.A.C. 174 (Low, Groberman and MacKenzie JJ.A.)

[18]                         
On appeal, Mr. Wakeling reiterated his challenge
to the constitutionality of s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code  and
s. 8(2) (f) of the Privacy Act . The B.C. Court of Appeal, per
Low J.A., agreed with the extradition judge that s. 193(2) (e) was the
governing provision for the specific disclosure at issue. Hence, the court
found it unnecessary to consider the constitutionality of s. 8(2) (f) of
the Privacy Act . 

[19]                         
In addressing Mr. Wakeling’s s. 8  claim, Low
J.A. concluded that the state conduct did not interfere with any reasonable
privacy expectation to which Mr. Wakeling could lay claim. The court thus
rejected Mr. Wakeling’s s. 8  argument. As the Impugned Disclosure did not
re-engage s. 8  of the Charter , no second judicial authorization was
needed. 

[20]                         
Low J.A. similarly concluded that Mr. Wakeling’s
fundamental justice submissions pertaining to transparency and accountability
were without merit:

The impugned provision does not have to
be transparent by requiring prior notice and there is no need for a reporting
requirement of some sort after the fact.  The information gathered by lawful
electronic interception becomes law enforcement intelligence.  In my opinion,
it is no different than information obtained from a police informer or
information contained in documents that lawfully come into the hands of the
police.  If disclosure is in the interests of the administration of justice,
there is no need for prior judicial approval or for notice or for reporting.  Such
requirements would formalize and hamper the inter-jurisdictional investigation
of crime and sometimes the prevention of crime.  Control of the use of
lawfully-gathered police intelligence by foreign authorities is not practical
and would be presumptuous. What is practical and necessary for both crime
detection and crime prevention is the ability of police officers to lawfully
inform their counterparts in other jurisdictions about impending criminal
activity, as occurred in the present case, or past criminal activity. [para.
43]

[21]                         
Finally, the court rejected Mr. Wakeling’s
vagueness and overbreadth arguments, noting that “[t]he administration of
justice is a concept that is well understood and needs no clarification or
narrowing” (para. 44). In the result, the court dismissed the appeal. 

C.           
Issues

[22]                         
On appeal to this Court, Mr. Wakeling renews his
constitutional attack on s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code  and s.
8(2) (f) of the Privacy Act , relying on the same arguments he made
below. He also raises for the first time, with leave of the Court, the
constitutionality of s. 193(2)(b) of the Code.  He maintains that
all of these provisions infringe his rights under ss. 7  and 8  of the Charter ,
and that the infringements are not justified under s. 1 .

V.          
Analysis

[23]                         
I propose initially to explain why this appeal
turns on the constitutionality of s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code 
and not s. 193(2)(b) of the Code or s. 8(2) (f) of the Privacy
Act . I will then address Mr. Wakeling’s Charter  arguments as they
relate to s. 193(2) (e).

A.          
The Privacy Act  Does Not Apply 

[24]                         
The Privacy Commissioner of Canada, an
intervener, submits that contrary to the lower court decisions, the RCMP must
comply with both the Criminal Code  and the Privacy Act 
when disclosing intercepted private communications to a foreign state, as
“[n]othing in the Criminal Code  relieves the RCMP from their duty to
comply with the Privacy Act ” (factum, at para. 13). According to the
Privacy Commissioner, s. 193(2)(e) of the Criminal Code  “limits
the breadth of the criminal prohibition” set out in s. 193 , “[b]ut this
exemption neither authorizes a disclosure under the Privacy Act  nor is
itself a source of police power” (para. 14).

[25]                         
With respect, I do not agree. The federal Privacy
Act  is a statute of general application. Section 8(2) of the Act sets
out the circumstances in which personal information under the control of a
government institution may be disclosed. That section explicitly states that it
is “[s]ubject to any other Act of Parliament”. Therefore, prior to considering
the disclosure contemplated by s. 8(2) , it must first be determined whether
another Act of Parliament addresses the particular disclosure in issue. In this
case, the Impugned Disclosure (involving lawfully intercepted private
communications) is specifically addressed by another Act of Parliament —
the Criminal Code . 

[26]                         
Part VI of the Criminal Code  represents a
comprehensive scheme dealing with the interception of private communications.
The individual right to privacy stands in tension with our collective need for
effective law enforcement, and the safeguards layered into the wiretap
provisions show Parliament’s efforts to “reconcile these competing interests” (R.
v. Duarte, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30, at p. 45). As noted by the extradition
judge,

Part VI . . . creates a
specific regime for the protection of privacy interests in relation to
intercepted communications by creating specific offences, setting out
procedures for authorized interception of private communications in the
investigation of specific crimes, and delineating the circumstances under which
intercepted communications may be disclosed. [para. 22] 

This level of detail and
specificity in Part VI indicates that Parliament intended this framework to be
the exclusive regime governing the interception and use of private
communications for law enforcement purposes.[1]


[27]                         
Section 193(2)(e) deals directly with the
issue at hand — namely, the cross-border disclosure of wiretap information.
Admittedly, s. 193(2) is not structured as an explicit authorizing provision.
Rather, it takes the form of a series of exemptions to the criminal offence
identified in s. 193(1) . Nonetheless, I am satisfied that it represents
Parliament’s attempt to regulate the disclosure of intercepted communications
and specify the circumstances in which such disclosures may lawfully be made.
Succinctly put, s. 193(2)(e) implicitly authorizes the disclosure of
wiretap information in accordance with the conditions prescribed therein. 

[28]                         
For these reasons, s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal
Code , and not s. 8(2) (f) of the Privacy Act , is the
governing provision in this case. Accordingly, I need not consider the
constitutionality of s. 8(2) (f).

[29]                         
In concluding that s. 193(2) (e) is an
authorizing provision, I do not quarrel with the Chief Justice that, in
general, the police may look to the common law for authority to use the fruits
of a lawful search for legitimate law enforcement purposes, including
disclosures to foreign law enforcement agencies. However, adopting this
analysis in the wiretap context poses a problem. Finding that s. 193(2) (e)
is not an authorizing provision, but merely an exception to a criminal
offence, implies that none of the subparts of s. 193(2)  are authorizing
provisions, and that authorization for all of the listed disclosures must come
from some other source. This, however, does not accord with the Court’s recent
decision in Imperial Oil v. Jacques, 2014 SCC 66, [2014] 3 S.C.R.
287, in which the majority held that the exemptions in s. 193(2)  “give a person the right to disclose recordings that otherwise could
not be disclosed” (para. 43).[2] Therefore, in my view, s. 193(2) (e)
is properly read as an authorizing provision. 

B.           
Section 193(2) (b) Need Not Be Considered

[30]                         
As noted, Mr. Wakeling was granted leave to
challenge the constitutionality of s. 193(2) (b) of the Criminal Code 
before this Court. In contrast to s. 193(2) (e), which addresses the cross-border
disclosure of wiretap communications, s. 193(2) (b) authorizes the
disclosure of wiretap communications “in the course of or for the purpose of
any criminal investigation”.

[31]                         
Mr. Wakeling made only cursory mention of s.
193(2) (b) in argument. As his complaint is specific to the issue of
international, cross-border sharing of wiretap information for criminal law
purposes, it is properly considered under s. 193(2) (e). For that reason
— and the fact that Mr. Wakeling did not press s. 193(2) (b) in written
or oral argument — I see no need to address its constitutionality. 

C.           
Does the Impugned Disclosure Violate Section 8
of the Charter ?

(1)        
Is Section 8 Engaged?

[32]                         
Section 8 is typically invoked where police
perform a search or seizure and thereby infringe upon an individual’s
reasonable expectation of privacy. It is quite evident that the interception of
wiretap communications constitutes a search. However, the disclosure of
previously intercepted communications — which is what s. 193(2) (e)
implicitly authorizes — is not, in my view, a “search” within the meaning of s.
8. Therefore, as a preliminary matter, it is important to clarify precisely how
s. 8 is engaged in the present case. I now turn to that issue. 

[33]                         
Mr. Wakeling submits that s. 8 is engaged
because the disclosure of his intercepted communications pursuant to s. 193(2) (e)
amounted to a second search, such that a second judicial authorization was
necessary prior to the Impugned Disclosure. Absent such authorization, he
argues that the police violated his s. 8 rights.  

[34]                         
With respect, I disagree. As the intervener the
British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (“BCCLA”) observes, the plain
meaning of “search” does not include the disclosure of information by the
state. A disclosure is simply the communication to a third party of previously
acquired information. 

[35]                         
In sum, there was only one search that engaged
s. 8  of the Charter  on the facts of this case — the original lawful
interception of Mr. Wakeling’s private communications. For this reason, to
invoke s. 8 , the appellant must rely on some other analytical approach. 

[36]                         
The BCCLA frames the s. 8 analysis in a
different way. It submits that to the extent s. 193(2) (e) permits
disclosure of the fruits of a search, it forms “part of the context in which
courts must assess the reasonableness of the law authorizing the search”
(factum, at para. 3).

[37]                         
This submission warrants brief elaboration.
According to the BCCLA, s. 193(2)(e) is an integral part of a search
regime for wiretap interceptions set out in Part VI of the Criminal Code .
Like all laws authorizing searches, that regime — including any integral part
of that regime — must be reasonable in order to comply with s. 8  of the Charter .
Therefore, if s. 193(2) (e) is held to be unreasonable, this would taint
the overall regime for s. 8  purposes and render it unconstitutional. 

[38]                         
While I see some merit in the analytical
approach proposed by the BCCLA, my conclusion that s. 8 protects targets at
both the interception and disclosure stages under Part VI is more a
function of the special dangers associated with wiretaps. Parliament has
recognized that wiretaps pose heightened privacy concerns beyond those inherent
in other searches and seizures. Justice Karakatsanis describes (at para. 116)
the serious privacy implications of electronic surveillance, citing this
Court’s caution that “one can scarcely imagine a state activity more dangerous
to individual privacy” (Duarte, at p. 43). Given these implications, the
protections that Parliament has seen fit to fold into the wiretap regime
include s. 193  which provides that, other than for one of the delineated
purposes, the disclosure of wiretap information is not only unauthorized, it is
criminal. 

[39]                         
The highly intrusive nature of electronic
surveillance and the statutory limits on the disclosure of its fruits suggest a
heightened reasonable expectation of privacy in the wiretap context. Once a
lawful interception has taken place and the intercepted communications are in
the possession of law enforcement, that expectation is diminished but not extinguished.
This heightened and continuing expectation of privacy in the wiretap context is
further indication that s. 8 ought to apply to disclosures under Part VI. 

[40]                         
In sum, while I acknowledge the Chief Justice’s
concern that s. 193(2)(e) does not engage s. 8 simply by virtue of its
integral place in the search regime of Part VI, that is not the sole
reason — or indeed the main one — why I conclude that s. 8 is engaged in this
context. As I have emphasized, Parliament has recognized that wiretap
interceptions are an exceptional and invasive form of search, and it is
therefore perfectly appropriate, in my view, that s. 8 protections should
extend to wiretap disclosures by law enforcement. Furthermore, there is a
residual and continuing expectation of privacy in wiretap information that
persists even after it has been lawfully collected. Indeed, the Chief
Justice agrees that “residual privacy interests” remain at the time of
disclosure and that s. 8 protects against unreasonable uses of the information
by law enforcement (para. 95). I am therefore satisfied that s. 8 is properly
engaged.  

(2)        
The Analytical Framework Under Section 8 of the Charter 

[41]                         
In order for a search to be reasonable under s.
8  of the Charter , “[it] must be authorized by law, the law itself must
be reasonable, and the search must be carried out in a reasonable manner” (R.
v. Caslake, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 51, at para. 10; see also R. v.
Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 278). I reiterate that a disclosure is
not, standing alone, a “search” within the meaning of the Charter .
However, for the reasons outlined above, s. 8  is engaged. Therefore, in my
view, the s. 8  framework applies, mutatis mutandis, to disclosures made
by law enforcement pursuant to s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code .
 

[42]                         
Following the approach outlined above, I will
address each step of the s. 8 framework independently: (1) whether the Impugned
Disclosure was authorized by law; (2) whether the law authorizing the Impugned
Disclosure is reasonable; and (3) whether the Impugned Disclosure was carried
out in a reasonable manner. 

(3)        
Was the Impugned Disclosure Authorized by Law?

[43]                         
For ease of reference, I repeat s. 193(2) (e):

(2)
Subsection (1) does not apply to a person who discloses a private communication
or any part thereof or the substance, meaning or purport thereof or of any part
thereof or who discloses the existence of a private communication

 

. . .

 

(e)
where disclosure is made to a peace officer or prosecutor in Canada or to a
person or authority with responsibility in a foreign state for the
investigation or prosecution of offences and is intended to be in the interests
of the administration of justice in Canada or elsewhere . . . 

[44]                         
A disclosure will be authorized by law where it
is “carried out in accordance with the procedural and substantive requirements
the law provides” (Caslake, at para. 12). Section 193(2) (e)
imposes two essential requirements. First, with respect to cross-border
disclosures, the recipient must be “a person or authority with responsibility
in a foreign state for the investigation or prosecution of offences”. Second,
the disclosure must be “intended to be in the interests of the administration
of justice in Canada or elsewhere”. 

[45]                         
Under the second requirement, the relevant
intention is that of the disclosing party. For the disclosure to be authorized
by law, that party must subjectively believe that the disclosure will advance
the interests of the administration of justice in Canada and/or the foreign
state. The belief must be honestly and genuinely held. The credibility of the
disclosing party’s expressed intent can be tested against objective facts.

[46]                         
The disclosure in this case was authorized by
law. No one contends otherwise. The intercepted communications were provided to
U.S. authorities for the purpose of foiling a cross-border drug smuggling
operation. When Canadian authorities shared information about the operation
with their American counterparts, they intended to advance the administration
of justice in Canada and the United States. The requirements under s. 193(2) (e)
were therefore satisfied.

(4)        
Is Section 193(2)(e) a Reasonable Law?

[47]                         
The parties’ submissions focus on the second
step of the s. 8 framework, that is the reasonableness of s. 193(2)(e).
They argue, and Justice Karakatsanis agrees, that this provision is
constitutionally deficient. I do not share that view. As I will explain, s.
193(2)(e) is a reasonable law. 

(a)         
Overview of the Parties’ Charter Challenges

[48]                         
Mr. Wakeling and the BCCLA raise a host of Charter 
arguments challenging the constitutionality of s. 193(2) (e). For the
sake of clarity, these arguments can be broken down into three distinct (though
somewhat overlapping) categories: (1) s. 193(2) (e) is unconstitutionally
overbroad; (2) s. 193(2) (e) is unconstitutionally vague; and (3) s. 193(2) (e)
is unconstitutional because it lacks accountability mechanisms. Viewed
individually and collectively, these arguments challenge the reasonableness of
the law authorizing the Impugned Disclosure. As such, they are properly
considered under the second step of the s. 8  framework.

(i)          
Overbreadth

[49]                         
The BCCLA’s main line of attack on s. 193(2)(e)
is that it creates an almost “limitless” scope for disclosure of private
intercepted communications. In failing to place reasonable, or indeed any
limits on disclosure, the provision effectively grants police untrammeled
discretion and is ripe for abuse by both domestic and foreign authorities. This
argument strikes me as very similar to Mr. Wakeling’s submission that s.
193(2)(e) is unconstitutionally overbroad and thus contravenes the
principles of fundamental justice in violation of s. 7  of the Charter . I
am of the view that both of these arguments can be dealt with together under
the reasonableness framework of s. 8 . To put it simply, a law that suffers from
overbreadth will necessarily be unreasonable.  

(ii)        
Vagueness

[50]                         
Mr. Wakeling argues that the language of s.
193(2)(e) is so vague as to be unworkable. He makes this argument under
s. 7  of the Charter , asserting that the phrase “in the interests of the
administration of justice” does not have a constant and settled meaning. Like
the argument on overbreadth, I believe that this argument can be disposed of
under s. 8 . A provision that is unconstitutionally vague will necessarily be
unreasonable. 

(iii)      
Accountability Mechanisms

[51]                         
Mr. Wakeling and the BCCLA submit that s.
193(2)(e) is unconstitutional since it is devoid of mechanisms to hold
authorities accountable for their disclosures of intercepted communications. In
particular, they are concerned that the provision lacks sufficient safeguards,
including judicial pre-authorization, notice and record-keeping requirements,
Parliamentary reporting, as well as international protocols and caveats
limiting the use of disclosed information.

[52]                         
Mr. Wakeling’s accountability argument goes
somewhat further than that of the BCCLA. He claims that accountability — and
the related value of transparency — are principles of fundamental justice under
s. 7 . I find it unnecessary to finally decide that issue. The accountability
concerns identified by Mr. Wakeling and the BCCLA are best dealt with under s.
8. As this Court’s decision in R. v. Tse, 2012 SCC 16, [2012]
1 S.C.R. 531, notes, accountability forms part of the reasonableness analysis
under s. 8. 

[53]                         
Having outlined the three categories of
objections to s. 193(2)(e), I will now address each of them in greater
depth.

(b)        
Is the Scope of Disclosure Authorized by Section
193(2)(e) Unconstitutionally Overbroad?

[54]                         
Both Mr. Wakeling and the BCCLA take issue with
the extent of disclosure that s. 193(2)(e) authorizes for substantially
similar reasons. Both submit that s. 193(2)(e) permits “near-limitless
disclosure of private communications intercepted by wiretap” (BCCLA factum, at
para. 3; see also A.F., at paras. 129-30).

[55]                         
With respect, I believe that Mr. Wakeling and
the BCCLA overstate the nature and extent of the disclosure contemplated by s.
193(2)(e). A law may be broad without suffering from overbreadth. While
the provision authorizes a wide scope of disclosure, it does not permit
“near-limitless” disclosure of lawfully intercepted communications. On the
contrary, it limits the type of information that may be disclosed, the purpose
for which it may be disclosed, and the persons to whom it may be disclosed. 

[56]                         
Second, the BCCLA notes that the provision
allows disclosure where it is intended to be “in the interests of the
administration of justice in Canada or elsewhere” and submits that the
use of the word “or” means that disclosure could be in the sole
interests of the foreign state, and not Canada’s. According to the
BCCLA, “it is never reasonable to disclose an intercepted private communication
to a foreign state when to do so is only in the foreign state’s interests and
not Canada’s” (factum, at para. 33).

[57]                         
With respect, I reject this line of thinking.
Multi-jurisdictional cooperation between law enforcement authorities furthers
the administration of justice in all of the jurisdictions involved. It
must not be forgotten that Canada is often on the receiving end of
valuable information from foreign law enforcement authorities. The language of
s. 193(2)(e) appropriately captures the reciprocity inherent in this
practice. 

[58]                         
Third, the BCCLA submits that “on its face, s.
193(2)(e) permits disclosure even to support torture, or to prosecute an
offence in a foreign state that violates Canadian constitutional norms or
international law, provided only that someone intends that disclosure to
be in the interests of the administration of justice somewhere” (factum,
at para. 10 (emphasis in original)). It also contends that s. 193(2)(e)
“opens the door to disclosures to foreign states that are motivated by Canadian
authorities’ political, financial, personal, or other interests, as long as the
foreign state’s intention relates to the interests of its
administration of justice” (ibid., at para. 13 (emphasis in original)).

[59]                         
Once again, I disagree. Under s. 193(2)(e),
it is the disclosing party’s intention that matters. The provision
requires that the disclosing party must subjectively believe that disclosure
will further the interests of justice in Canada and/or the foreign state. The
belief must be an honest one, genuinely held. If the disclosing party’s
subjective belief is challenged, the reviewing judge may look at objective
indicators in deciding whether the disclosing party is to be believed.
Measuring the stated belief against objective facts is an accepted way of
separating beliefs that are honestly and genuinely held from those that are
not. 

[60]                         
A disclosing party who knows little or nothing
about the justice system in the foreign state or who does not know how or for
what purpose the foreign state intends to use the information will have a hard
time satisfying a court that he or she genuinely believed that disclosure would
further the interests of the administration of justice. The same holds true for
a disclosing party who knows or has reason to believe that the information will
be used to commit torture or other human rights violations, or for someone who
has sent the information for personal or partisan reasons. That a disclosing
party may have his or her credibility tested against objective indicators
incentivizes that person to proceed cautiously when disclosing information to a
foreign state. Given these limitations inherent in s. 193(2)(e), I am
not persuaded that the provision grants police a “limitless” power to
disclose.  

(c)         
Is Section 193(2)(e) Unconstitutionally Vague?

[61]                         
I will now address Mr. Wakeling’s objection that
s. 193(2)(e) is unconstitutionally vague. He contends that the phrase
“where disclosure . . . is intended to be in the interests of the
administration of justice in Canada or elsewhere” is “unworkable” because “the
decision maker would be required to have a full appreciation and understanding
of the laws of the country which will receive the disclosure” (A.F., at para.
126). He also argues that “the administration of justice” does not have a constant
and settled meaning (para. 129).

[62]                         
Like the extradition judge and the Court of
Appeal, I would not give effect to these submissions. This Court in R. v.
Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606, stated that “a law
will be found unconstitutionally vague if it so lacks in precision as not to
give sufficient guidance for legal debate” (p. 643). Section 193(2)(e)
does not offend in this regard. It sets out who must intend that the
disclosure be in the interests of the administration of justice (the person
disclosing the information) and to whom the information may be disclosed
(to a peace officer or prosecutor in Canada or to a person or authority with
responsibility in a foreign state for the investigation or prosecution of
offences). Moreover, while “the administration of justice” is a broad concept,
it is not one that so lacks in precision as to give insufficient guidance for
legal debate. As Borins Co. Ct. J. in R. v. Samson (1982), 37 O.R. (2d)
237, explained:

. . . “administration of justice”,
with particular reference to the criminal law, is a compendious term that
stands for all the complexes of activity that operate to bring the substantive
law of crime to bear, or to keep it from coming to bear, on persons who are
suspected of having committed crimes. It refers to the rules of law that govern
the detection, investigation, apprehension, interviewing and trial of persons
suspected of crime and those persons whose responsibility it is to work within
these rules. The administration of justice is not confined to the courts; it
encompasses officers of the law and others whose duties are necessary to ensure
that the courts function effectively. The concern of the administration of
justice is the fair, just and impartial upholding of rights, and punishment of
wrongs, according to the rule of law. [pp. 246-47]

In the context of s. 193(2)(e),
the phrase “the administration of justice” means that disclosure must be for a
legitimate law enforcement purpose, such as the prevention of cross-border drug
trafficking. It is not unconstitutionally vague.  

(d)        
Is Section 193(2)(e) Unconstitutional for Lack
of Accountability Mechanisms?

[63]                         
Mr. Wakeling and the BCCLA also make a variety
of submissions pertaining to accountability and the related value of transparency.
They take issue with the fact that s. 193(2)(e) contains no
record-keeping requirement, nor any requirement that would “attempt to
constrain the foreign state’s use and dissemination of the communications”
(BCCLA factum, at para. 2). The essence of these arguments is that s. 193(2)(e)
inadequately protects the privacy interests at stake and that, absent
procedural requirements such as notice to the target of the disclosure,
protocols or international agreements, police record keeping, and Parliamentary
reporting, s. 193(2)(e) is unconstitutional.  

[64]                         
In making these arguments, Mr. Wakeling and the
BCCLA rely on Tse, where the constitutionality of s. 184.4  of the Criminal
Code  was in issue. That provision permitted peace officers to intercept
certain private communications without judicial authorization if an officer
believed, on reasonable grounds, that the interception was immediately
necessary to prevent an unlawful act that would cause serious harm. In striking
it down, this Court held that “s. 184.4  falls down on the matter of
accountability because the legislative scheme does not provide any mechanism
to permit oversight of the police use of this power” (para. 11 (emphasis
added)). 

[65]                         
In my opinion, Tse is distinguishable
from the present case. First, the statutory scheme at issue in Tse
contained no accountability measures. As I will explain, that is not the
case with s. 193(2)(e). 

[66]                         
Second, the impugned provision in Tse
involved warrantless searches and seizures. Accountability measures,
including after-the-fact notice and reporting requirements, are of particular
importance in that context. The emergency wiretap provision, by its very
nature, allows the police to conduct a warrantless search in exigent
circumstances. No balancing of interests before a judge occurs. In contrast,
Mr. Wakeling’s private communications were intercepted pursuant to a judicial
authorization. Issuing the authorization required the judge to balance Mr.
Wakeling’s privacy interests with the interests of law enforcement. A variety
of procedural safeguards were adhered to. Unlike an emergency wiretap
situation, Mr. Wakeling’s privacy interests were afforded significant
protection at the interception stage.

[67]                         
Section 193(2)(e) must be considered in
context. In my view, it is inappropriate “to seize upon individual sections of
[the wiretap scheme] and to see if those sections, viewed in isolation,
contravene the provisions of the Charter ” (R. v. Finlay (1985),
52 O.R. (2d) 632 (C.A.), at p. 653). Rather, the proper approach is to consider
the “provisions and the safeguards contained therein in their entirety” (ibid.).
Section 193(2) (e) is part of a unique statutory scheme that contains
numerous privacy safeguards, including notice and reporting requirements.
Pursuant to s. 196(1)  of the Criminal Code , an individual who has been
wiretapped must be provided with written notification within three months of
the time the authorization was given or renewed, subject to judicially
authorized extensions. These extensions may be authorized, for instance, where
providing notice to the suspect would derail an ongoing police investigation. 

[68]                         
While Parliament could perhaps, as a matter of
policy, require a second notice relating specifically to a s. 193(2)(e)
disclosure, there are inherent difficulties with such a requirement. In order
to decide whether to apply for an extension of time in providing notice of
disclosure, Canadian authorities would have to keep abreast of all foreign
investigations involving the disclosed information. Without such knowledge, it
would be impossible for them to know whether providing notice of the disclosure
to the suspect would derail or otherwise compromise a foreign investigation. 

[69]                         
To require Canadian authorities to stay on top
of all foreign investigations that involve the disclosed information is surely
unreasonable. It would be highly burdensome, if not entirely impractical. In my
view, the absence of a requirement to provide a second notice does not render
the wiretap regime unconstitutional.   

[70]                         
As noted, the existing notice requirements
contained in Part VI of the Criminal Code  ensure that all individuals
who have been wiretapped are provided with notice of this fact. Once notified,
individuals may wish to know whether their intercepted communications have been
disclosed to a foreign authority. An individual may make a request pursuant to
the applicable access to information statute in an effort to obtain this
information. Justice Karakatsanis correctly notes that such efforts may not
always be successful, depending on the details of the applicable access to
information regime and the individual’s circumstances. I express no view on
whether a guaranteed right of access to this information would be advisable —
only that it is not constitutionally required.

[71]                         
As for Parliamentary reporting, the Minister of
Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness must prepare an annual report to
Parliament on the use of electronic surveillance pursuant to s. 195  of the Criminal
Code . Once again, Parliament could require that disclosures made under s.
193(2) (e) be included in an annual report. But that is a policy
decision, and it is important that this Court separate policy matters from
constitutional imperatives — especially in this context where international
relations are involved. As this Court stated in Tse, a reporting
requirement to Parliament is not a constitutional imperative (para. 89). 

[72]                         
Contrary to the submissions of Mr. Wakeling and
the BCCLA, s. 193(2)(e) is not devoid of accountability measures.
Rather, accountability has been built into the scheme for the disclosure of
wiretap communications. Section 193(1)  provides a powerful incentive for
Canadian authorities to comply with the dictates of s. 193(2)(e). The
failure to do so can lead to criminal charges against the disclosing party or
result in the exclusion of the improperly disclosed evidence at a subsequent
proceeding in Canada. The possibility of criminal sanction or the loss of
important evidence creates an incentive to maintain records about what
information was disclosed, to whom, and for what purpose. Indeed, according to
the evidence of the Deputy Commissioner of Canada West, Gary David Bass, who
testified with respect to certain RCMP practices and procedures, the RCMP have
a number of internal record-keeping policies that apply to the cross-border
sharing of information.

[73]                         
While police record keeping is not, in my view,
constitutionally required for disclosures made under s. 193(2)(e), I
should not be taken as discouraging the practice. Likewise, these reasons are
not intended to discourage Parliament from instituting reporting requirements
or establishing international agreements between Canada and foreign states to
address cross-border disclosure of wiretap communications. The record at hand
indicates that many agreements are in place between law enforcement agencies.
The record also shows that information is often disclosed with caveats as to
its subsequent use. 

[74]                         
Although not constitutionally mandated,
adherence to international protocols and the use of caveats or information-sharing
agreements may be highly relevant in determining whether a given disclosure was
authorized by law under s. 193(2)(e). These objective indicators may
assist a court in assessing whether disclosure was genuinely intended to
advance the interests of the administration of justice. Moreover, as I discuss
below in reference to the third step of the s. 8 framework, they will also
impact on whether the manner of disclosure is found to be reasonable. 

[75]                         
In considering the possible accountability and
transparency mechanisms that Parliament could enact, certain realities cannot
be ignored. Even where the information is disclosed to a foreign state with a
legal system much like our own, once the information is in the hands of the
foreign state, its use will, for the most part, be beyond our purview. Such is
a defining feature of state sovereignty. Caveats on disclosure and
information-sharing protocols may be desirable, and they may be relevant to
evaluating whether a disclosure is intended to be in the interest of the
administration of justice (as required at the first step of the s. 8 analysis)
or is carried out reasonably (as required at the third step). However, they are
not constitutionally required in every case, nor would they be a panacea if
they were — certainly not standard-form agreements or caveats accompanying
every disclosure, as Justice Karakatsanis’s proposal would likely generate.
There is always a risk that a foreign law enforcement agency may misuse
the information disclosed to it under s. 193(2)(e). This risk can never
be entirely eliminated, regardless of the nature and extent of the procedural
safeguards in place in Canada, and it must not be allowed to undermine the
vital interests served by the detection and prosecution of multi-jurisdictional
crime. In this regard, I re-emphasize that Canada is frequently on the receiving
end of such disclosures — and Canadians are safer for it. 

[76]                         
 I do not gainsay the possibility that a foreign
law enforcement agency could misuse the information provided to it by Canadian
authorities. In such cases, there are certain avenues Canada may pursue where
the subsequent use of information disclosed to a foreign state offends our own
notions of justice. For example, where the disclosed information is being used
to seek the extradition of an individual who faces a realistic prospect of
torture or other human rights violations in a foreign country, Canada can
refuse the extradition request to avoid a manifest violation of the Charter .
Likewise, if the information in question is found to have been unlawfully
obtained, its use in an extradition proceeding — or in any other legal venue —
could be challenged. In other contexts, Canada could exert pressure through
diplomatic channels. There are various ways that Canada pursues its objectives
on the international stage — founded on the principles of comity and state
sovereignty — which may have application in a particular case. 

[77]                         
It bears emphasizing that this Court’s task is
not to determine whether there may be better or additional accountability
measures or stricter language that could be put in place with respect to the
cross-border disclosure of wiretap communications. Any attempt to micromanage
Parliament in this context must be approached with great care. The task at hand
is to determine whether s. 193(2)(e) passes constitutional muster. As
discussed, there are a number of accountability measures contained within Part
VI and within s. 193(2)(e) itself, and the scope of the disclosure
contemplated by s. 193(2)(e) is, in my view, entirely reasonable. For
these reasons, I conclude that the impugned legislation does not fall short of
the constitutional standards mandated by s. 8  of the Charter .

(5)        
Was the Impugned Disclosure Carried Out in a
Reasonable Manner?

[78]                         
Having determined that s. 193(2)(e) is a
reasonable law and that it was complied with in this case, the remaining
inquiry is whether the manner of the Impugned Disclosure was
unreasonable, and therefore violates s. 8  of the Charter . Nothing in the
record suggests that the police acted unreasonably in disclosing Mr. Wakeling’s
intercepted communications to U.S. authorities. Neither the Chief Justice nor
Justice Karakatsanis suggest otherwise. Common sense would suggest that
similarly unremarkable and entirely reasonable instances of law enforcement
cooperation to combat cross-border criminal activity occur on a daily basis
between Canadian and U.S. authorities. Saddling police with the obligation of
imposing boilerplate caveats on even the most routine disclosures poses an
unnecessary burden. It would do little to safeguard the interests protected by
s. 8  while impeding legitimate law enforcement operations.

[79]                         
Nothing further is needed to dispose of the
instant case. However, in different factual contexts, there may be significant
potential dangers posed by the disclosure of intercepted communications to
foreign authorities. Given these dangers, a broader discussion of the third
step of the s. 8 framework is warranted. 

[80]                         
Where a disclosing party knows or should have
known that the information could be used in unfair trials, to facilitate
discrimination or political intimidation, or to commit torture or other human
rights violations — concerns rightly expressed by Justice Karakatsanis — s. 8
requires that the disclosure, if permissible at all, be carried out in a
reasonable manner. In the most serious examples, where there are no steps that
could be taken to mitigate the danger, s. 8 forbids disclosure entirely. I
should emphasize that this inquiry as to the manner of disclosure is distinct
from whether disclosure would be authorized by law pursuant to s. 193(2)(e)
— although, as a practical matter, the two inquiries may overlap. For example,
where the risks are so great that there is no manner of disclosure that
would be objectively reasonable, a disclosing party would find it difficult to
prove that he or she believed that the disclosure was “in the interests of the
administration of justice” under any plausible meaning of that term. 

[81]                         
In other cases, a disclosure could be reasonably
carried out where the use of information-sharing protocols or the imposition of
caveats would sufficiently mitigate the risks. An example may be useful to
illustrate this point. Suppose that Canadian authorities know or ought to know
that a foreign government, to which they are contemplating a disclosure, may
pass on the information to a third country that could exploit it to harm a
Canadian citizen. In that context, the failure to include a caveat limiting
subsequent use of the disclosed information, even where the disclosing party
intended to further the administration of justice, might render the disclosure
unreasonable under s. 8. In such cases, therefore, the existence of appropriate
safeguards will play a crucial role in determining the constitutionality of a
challenged disclosure. It is by mandating appropriate safeguards on a
case-by-case basis, rather than inflexibly requiring them in all situations,
that a proper balance is struck between protecting against unreasonable
disclosures of private communications and facilitating the effective
investigation of domestic and multi-jurisdictional crime. 

VI.       
Conclusion

[82]                         
Inter-agency cooperation is critical to the
prevention, detection, and punishment of cross-border crime. Recognizing this,
Parliament has authorized the cross-border sharing of wiretap communications
under s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code . The disclosure in this
case was lawfully authorized by that provision, and the legislation, taken as a
whole, does not violate s. 8  of the Charter . Furthermore, there is no
evidence that the manner of disclosure was unreasonable. Accordingly, I would
dismiss the appeal.

                    The following are
the reasons delivered by

[83]                         
The Chief
Justice — I have read the reasons of my colleagues Moldaver J. and
Karakatsanis J., who come to different conclusions about the constitutionality
of s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , and
the measures that should be in place to govern sharing information obtained
under warrant with law enforcement agencies in other countries.

[84]                         
I approach the matter differently.  In my view,
the question on this appeal is whether Mr. Wakeling’s rights under s. 8  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  were violated.  The constitutionality of s.
193(2) (e) becomes an issue only if Mr. Wakeling can show that s. 193(2) (e)
infringed his s. 8  rights.  In my view, he has not shown this.  Accordingly, I
would dismiss the appeal.

I.         
Background

[85]                         
Moldaver J. has set out the facts and judicial
history of the case.  Briefly put, Mr. Wakeling was the subject of a Canadian
drug investigation.  In the course of the investigation, the RCMP obtained a
warrant to monitor communications between Mr. Wakeling and others.  The
communications revealed a plot to transport drugs across the Canada-U.S. border. 
The RCMP shared information obtained from the communications with U.S.
authorities, who used it to intercept and seize 46,000 ecstasy pills at the
International Falls, Minnesota border crossing.

[86]                         
The U.S. sought Mr. Wakeling’s extradition from
Canada to face charges arising from the seizure of the ecstasy pills.  At the
hearing, Mr. Wakeling argued that the RCMP’s disclosure of the information
obtained from the intercepted communications violated his rights under s. 8  of
the Charter  and that the evidence should not be admitted against him.

[87]                         
The extradition judge held that there was no
violation of Mr. Wakeling’s s. 8  rights, admitted the evidence, and issued a
committal order for extradition.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed
Mr. Wakeling’s appeal.

II.          
The Issue

[88]                         
The main — and in my view the only — issue on
this appeal is whether the RCMP’s disclosure of the intercepted communications
to U.S. authorities violated Mr. Wakeling’s s. 8  rights and, if so, whether the
evidence should have been excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .

[89]                         
In my view, it is not necessary to consider the
constitutionality of s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code  to answer
that question.  I agree with my colleagues that it is unnecessary to consider
the Privacy Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-21 , or s. 193(2) (b) of the Criminal
Code .

III.       
Analysis

[90]                         
Section 8  of the Charter  protects
individuals against unreasonable search and seizure.  It provides:

     Everyone has the right to be
secure against unreasonable search or seizure.

[91]                         
Section 8  protects the individual’s privacy
interest against unreasonable state intrusion.  Here, Mr. Wakeling has a
reasonable expectation of privacy in his communications with others.   In order
to obtain private information by intercepting communications, the state must
obtain a judicial warrant, which requires the state to demonstrate that there
are reasonable grounds to believe the interception will show evidence of a
crime.  (Circumstances where the state can intercept without a warrant
are not relevant here, e.g., s. 184.4  of the Criminal Code .)  Where such
grounds exist, the individual’s privacy interest in the intercepted
communication gives way to the state’s interest in law enforcement.

[92]                         
The warrant allows the police to obtain the
information and to use it for purposes of law enforcement.  The individual
whose communications are lawfully intercepted under a valid warrant cannot
complain that this unreasonably breaches his privacy.  To put it
metaphorically, a valid warrant sanitizes the state intrusion on privacy, as
long as the execution of the warrant is reasonable and the information is used
for purposes of law enforcement.

[93]                         
It has never been suggested that this principle
is confined to the use of information in Canada.  The reality is that crime
does not stop at national borders, and police routinely share information that
they have lawfully obtained under warrant with their counterparts in other
countries.  Provided information is shared for purposes of law enforcement, the
individual cannot complain that the sharing violates his s. 8  right to privacy.

[94]                         
This Court has found that s. 8  is violated in
cases where the information was seized in a context outside law
enforcement and then passed along for the purpose of law enforcement:  R. v.
Colarusso, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 20;  R. v. Law, 2002 SCC 10, [2002] 1
S.C.R. 227; and R. v. Cole, 2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34.  In those
cases, the “sanitizing” effect of the warrant (or similar authorization
process) was absent; the individual’s privacy interest had not been balanced
against the state’s interest in law enforcement through judicial
pre-authorization.  Where, as here, that process has taken place, disclosure
for law enforcement purposes does not violate s. 8 .

[95]                         
Once information is obtained under warrant, s. 8 
protects against unreasonable uses of that information.  For example,
information obtained under warrant cannot be used for rendition to a foreign
country (the Maher Arar case discussed by Karakatsanis J.) or public
titillation.  Section 7  of the Charter  may also be engaged where
disclosure gives rise to a concern that the recipient country will use the
information to kill, torture or mistreat the target.  These concerns do not
arise on the facts of this case.  Where these residual privacy interests are infringed,
remedies may include prosecution of the disclosing officer under s. 193(1)  of
the Criminal Code  and remedies under s. 24(1)  of the Charter .

[96]                         
It follows that sharing information obtained
under warrant for law enforcement purposes with foreign law officers does not
violate s. 8 , absent the residual concerns just discussed.  Here, the
information was disclosed to the U.S. authorities for law enforcement purposes,
and none of the residual concerns arise.  It follows that Mr. Wakeling’s rights
were not violated, and his appeal must fail.

[97]                         
The question is whether s. 193(2) (e) of
the Criminal Code  changes this.  I do not think it does.  As I
state in Imperial Oil v. Jacques, 2014 SCC 66, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 287, at
para. 89, I am of the view that s. 193(2)  is not an authorizing provision.
Section 193(2) (e) does not confer a power on Canadian authorities to
share information obtained under warrant with foreign counterparts. Rather, it
operates by exempting officers from prosecution where they disclose intercepted
private communications under their common law powers.  Section 193(1) , the
offence provision, is intended to guard against the disclosure of intercepted
private communications by making it an offence to do so without the consent of
the individual concerned.  Section 193(2)  then lists a number of exemptions
from what otherwise would be an offence by virtue of s. 193(1) .  The exception
in s. 193(2) (e) demonstrates that the common law power to use
information obtained under warrant for law enforcement purposes is one of the
categories of disclosure protected from liability as an offence under s.
193(1) .  I agree with my colleague Moldaver J. when he says that “the
administration of justice” in s. 193(2) (e) refers only to use for
legitimate law enforcement purposes.  The provision therefore preserves the
common law power of law enforcement authorities to share lawfully obtained
information for purposes of law enforcement both domestically and abroad.  In a
nutshell, the exception prevents law enforcement officers from being convicted
for doing their job — using information obtained under warrant for purposes of
law enforcement.

[98]                         
It is therefore unnecessary to opine on the
constitutionality of s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code .  To do so
invites speculation, as the eloquent reasons of my colleagues demonstrate:  one
says the current legislative scheme provision is unconstitutional, the other
says it is eminently reasonable.  We should not send Parliament back to the
legislative drawing board on the basis of hypothetical speculation, where it is
not established that the law infringes anyone’s s. 8  rights.

[99]                         
For the same reasons, I find it unnecessary to
consider the constitutionality of the Privacy Act .  Assuming without
deciding that the Privacy Act  applies, it permits the disclosure of
personal information for the purposes of law enforcement.  It is specifically
permitted under s. 8(2) (f)[3]
and more generally as a use consistent with the purpose for which the
information was obtained under s. 8(2) (a).[4]  As discussed, this
alone does not violate ss. 7  or 8 .

[100]                     
Much is made of the need — or the absence of
need — for measures to address the risk that information shared with law
enforcement agencies in other countries will be abused.  Mr. Wakeling and
supporting interveners argue that the exclusion in s. 193(2) (e) from the
offence for improper disclosure is too broad to provide adequate protection. 
The Crown and supporting Attorneys General, on the other hand, emphasize the
risks associated with bureaucratic restrictions on the international sharing of
information and argue that it would be unrealistic and unworkable in today’s
interconnected world.  These are difficult questions more redolent of policy
than of law.  Parliament has considered them and answered with the offence
provisions and exemptions of s. 193 .  In the absence of a demonstrated breach
of s. 8  rights flowing from those provisions, Parliament’s choice must be
allowed to stand, in my respectful opinion.

IV.       
Conclusion

[101]                     
I would dismiss the appeal and confirm the order
for committal of Mr. Wakeling.

                    The reasons of Abella,
Cromwell and Karakatsanis JJ. were delivered by

[102]                     
Karakatsanis J. (dissenting) — Does the legislation permitting Canadian law
enforcement agencies to disclose wiretapped information to foreign law
enforcement officials violate s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms ?  I conclude that it does.

[103]                     
When police intercept an individual’s private communications without
consent, the information they obtain is of an extremely private and personal
nature.  Officers must obtain prior judicial authorization before conducting
these intrusive searches, except in exigent circumstances:  Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , ss. 184.2 , 185 , 186  and 487.01(5) ; R.
v. Duarte, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30.  Once the
information is obtained, there are strict limits on how officers can use the
information and to which Canadian officials it may be disclosed.

[104]                     
By contrast, s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal Code  permits
Canadian law enforcement officers to disclose wiretapped information to foreign
law enforcement officials without any restrictions on how the information may
be used and without any measures to permit oversight of when and how this broad
state power is used.  Nothing in the provision restrains recipients from using
the information outside Canada in unfair trials or in ways that violate human
rights norms.  Similarly, recipient officials are not prevented from publicly
disseminating the information or sharing it with officials in other states,
many of which do not share our legal and democratic values.  The torture of
Maher Arar in Syria provides a particularly chilling example of the dangers of
unconditional information sharing.

[105]                     
I would hold that the wiretap scheme set out in Part VI of the Criminal
Code  violates the Charter  “right to be secure against unreasonable
search or seizure” because s. 193(2) (e) permits the sharing of
intercepted information with foreign officials without meaningful safeguards. 
To render the scheme constitutional, Parliament must require the disclosing
party to impose conditions on how foreign officials can use the information
they receive, and must implement accountability measures to deter inappropriate
disclosure and permit oversight.

I.         
The Legislation

[106]                     
Part VI of the Criminal Code  is the
legislative scheme that governs wiretap interceptions and the use of
intercepted information.  In recognition of the profound invasion of privacy
associated with the interception of private communications, Part VI imposes
strict preconditions on such interceptions.  With narrow exceptions for exigent
circumstances (ss. 184.1  and 184.4 ), law enforcement officers may generally
only use wiretaps in the course of investigating enumerated crimes (s. 183 ),
must obtain prior judicial authorization (ss. 184(2) (b) and 184.2 ), and
must comply with notice and reporting requirements (ss. 195  and 196 ).  A number
of the safeguards contained in Part VI have been added to ensure the
constitutionality of this wiretapping regime:  An Act to amend the Criminal
Code, the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act  and the Radiocommunication Act,
S.C. 1993, c. 40; Response to the Supreme Court of Canada Decision in R. v.
Tse Act, S.C. 2013, c. 8.

[107]                     
While the basic scheme of Part VI has been found
to strike the balance between privacy and law enforcement interests required
under s. 8  of the Charter  (Duarte, at p. 45), this is the first
time that this Court has considered the effect of the disclosure provisions on
its constitutionality.  Section 193  of the Criminal Code  makes it an
indictable offence to disclose intercepted information without consent, except
where the disclosure falls into a permitted category such as disclosure for the
purpose of a criminal investigation.  Since 1988, the Criminal Code  has
permitted disclosure

(e)   where disclosure is made to a peace officer or
prosecutor in Canada or to a person or authority with responsibility in a
foreign state for the investigation or prosecution of offences and is intended to
be in the interests of the administration of justice in Canada or elsewhere . . .

 

(Criminal Code , s. 193(2) (e))

II.          
Section 8  of the Charter 

[108]                     
Section 8  of the Charter  protects against “unreasonable search or
seizure”.  A search or seizure is reasonable “if it is authorized by law, if
the law itself is reasonable and if the manner in which the search was carried
out is reasonable” (R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 278).  In
this case, the interception of the appellant’s communications was a search
authorized by law.  A warrant was obtained authorizing the wiretap.  The
communications were shared with U.S. police pursuant to s. 193(2) (e)
without any conditions or written record.

[109]                     
I agree with my colleague Moldaver J. that we need not consider the
constitutionality of s. 8(2) (f) of the Privacy Act, R.S.C. 1985,
c. P-21 .  For the reasons set out by my colleague, I also find it unnecessary
to address the arguments with respect to s. 7  of the Charter .  The issue
in this case is whether the foreign disclosure contemplated by s. 193(2) (e)
of the Criminal Code  is reasonable.  In particular, does s. 193(2) (e)
render the wiretap scheme set out in Part VI unreasonable by permitting
essentially unrestricted and unsupervised disclosure of the fruits of wiretap
interceptions to foreign law enforcement officials?

[110]                     
Whether a law provides reasonable authority for a search is a contextual
inquiry:  R. v. Rodgers, 2006 SCC 15, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 554, at para. 26. 
The question here is whether the wiretap provisions “strik[e] an appropriate
balance” between the state’s interest in the search and the public interest in
protecting privacy:  R. v. Tse, 2012 SCC 16, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 531, at
para. 10.

[111]                     
The assessment of this balance must be connected to the underlying
purposes of s. 8  itself.  Just as the expectation of privacy analysis asks what
we, as a society, should be able to expect will be kept private (R. v. Quesnelle, 2014 SCC 46, [2014]
2 S.C.R. 390, at para. 44), the assessment of whether a law provides reasonable
authority for a search involves asking what level of privacy protection we are
entitled to expect, given the state’s objective in seeking the information.

[112]                     
In order to determine whether s. 193(2)(e) of Part VI of the Criminal
Code  permits an “unreasonable search or seizure”, it is first necessary to
consider the interests that the disclosure regime was meant to serve and its
impact on the privacy rights of affected persons.  With those interests in
mind, I will then turn to the particular aspects of s. 193(2) (e) that,
in my view, render Part VI unconstitutional.

III.       
The Interests at Stake

[113]                     
There is no question that international cooperation and
information sharing are essential to law enforcement:  United States of
America v. Cotroni, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1469; R. v. Hape, 2007 SCC 26, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 292.  Crime does not stop at
state borders, nor should efforts to combat it.  Just as electronic
surveillance “plays an indispensable role in the detection of sophisticated
criminal enterprises” (Duarte, at p. 44), international dissemination of
the fruits of that surveillance is increasingly important for law enforcement.

[114]                     
When Canadian officials share information with
foreign officials, the foreign state is not the only beneficiary; the
importance of comity cannot be ignored.  Canadian interests are served when our
law enforcement agencies build appropriate information-sharing relationships
with law enforcement officials in other jurisdictions, and the disclosure of
wiretapped information in individual cases contributes to these relationships. 
Further, timely disclosure will often be critical in the investigation of
serious transnational crimes such as drug smuggling, human trafficking and
terrorism.  Often, the circumstances will require immediate police action to
protect public safety and prevent crimes.  This case is one such example.

[115]                     
The state’s interest in law enforcement and comity must
be balanced against the significant privacy and other interests engaged by
disclosure.  Wiretap interceptions gather private information that is likely
“to reveal intimate details of the lifestyle and personal choices of the
individual” (R. v. Plant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 281, at p. 293; and R. v.
Tessling, 2004 SCC 67, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 432, at para. 25).  This can include
information about an individual’s political and religious affiliations,
personal finances, intimate relationships, family problems, physical and mental
health, substance use, and encounters with police.

[116]                     
This Court recognized the invasiveness of wiretapping in Duarte,
where La Forest J. stated that “one can scarcely imagine a state activity more
dangerous to individual privacy than electronic surveillance” (p. 43).  He
warned that

[i]f the state may arbitrarily record
and transmit our private communications, it is no longer possible to strike an
appropriate balance between the right of the individual to be left alone and
the right of the state to intrude on privacy in the furtherance of its goals,
notably the need to investigate and combat crime.  [p. 44]

[117]                     
Law enforcement officers in Canada are therefore subject to strict
limits on the use of wiretapped information.  Section 193  of the Criminal
Code  makes it an indictable offence to disclose intercepted information,
subject to limited exceptions such as giving evidence in civil or criminal
proceedings (s. 193(2) (a)) or disclosing information for the purpose of
a criminal investigation (s. 193(2) (b)).  By contrast, courts have held
that information obtained by the state in other kinds of searches and seizures
may be shared with regulatory agencies for purposes outside of criminal
investigations and existing proceedings (see, for example, Brown v. The
Queen, 2013 FCA 111, 2013 D.T.C. 5094).

[118]                     
When information is shared across jurisdictional lines, the safeguards
that apply in domestic investigations lose their force.  This can create
serious risks to individual privacy, liberty and security of the person
interests.  As Commissioner O’Connor observed, when information is shared with
foreign authorities, “respect for human rights cannot always be taken for
granted”:  Commission of Inquiry into the Actions of Canadian Officials in
Relation to Maher Arar, Report of the Events
Relating to Maher Arar:  Analysis and Recommendations (2006) (“O’Connor Report”), at p. 321.

[119]                     
Wiretap information that is shared with foreign
officials may ultimately be used in unfair trials or to prosecute offences that
are not crimes in Canada.  Information obtained from wiretaps can lead to
discrimination on the basis of political or religious affiliation.  In the
wrong hands, wiretap information may even be used to intimidate or smear
political figures and members of civil society:  see, e.g., B. A. Franklin,
“Wiretaps reveal Dr. King feared rebuff on nonviolence”, The New York Times,
September 15, 1985; J. Sanchez, “Wiretapping’s true danger”, Los
Angeles Times, March 16, 2008.  Further, s. 193(2)(e)
permits the disclosure to foreign officials of both intercepted personal
information that may be completely unrelated to the criminal investigation or
to its target and information resulting from wiretaps that are later found to
be unlawful.

[120]                     
Professor Kent Roach writes that the expansion in international
information sharing since 2001 has exacerbated a number of problems:

. . . law enforcement
agencies are now more likely to undertake enforcement actions based on shared
information that is unreliable, and there is now a greater risk that
information shared by intelligence services will be disclosed in subsequent
legal proceedings.  Individuals are also at greater risk of having their
rights, especially their right to privacy, infringed.  Individuals will rarely
have the opportunity to challenge the accuracy of shared information because
they will often be unaware that information about them has been shared and will
not have access to the shared information.

 

(K.
Roach, “Overseeing Information Sharing”, in H. Born and A. Wills, eds., Overseeing
Intelligence Services:  A Toolkit (2012), 129, at p. 131)

[121]                     
The respondent the Attorney General of Canada submits
that the expectation of privacy in communications is diminished after they have
been lawfully intercepted.  Indeed, people should expect that police will
“share lawfully gathered information with other law enforcement officials,
provided the use is consistent with the purposes for which it was gathered” (Quesnelle,
at para. 39).

[122]                     
However, that does not mean that there is no
privacy interest in wiretap information; to the contrary, people have the right
to expect that such information will only be disclosed appropriately. 
In a well-known passage in R. v. Mills, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668, McLachlin and
Iacobucci JJ. stated:

Privacy is not an all or nothing right.  It does not
follow from the fact that the Crown has possession of the records that any reasonable
expectation of privacy disappears.  Privacy interests in modern society include
the reasonable expectation that private information will remain confidential to
the persons to whom and restricted to the purposes for which it was divulged. 
[para. 108]

[123]                     
This Court, per Charron J., also confirmed in R. v. McNeil,
2009 SCC 3, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 66, that “any number of persons and entities may
have a residual privacy interest in material gathered in the course of a
criminal investigation” (at para. 19; see also paras. 12 and 39).  The
“protective mantle of s. 8 ” shields information seized by the state “so long as
the seizure continues” (R. v. Colarusso, [1994] 1
S.C.R. 20, at p. 63).

[124]                     
Nor is the privacy interest in wiretap information reduced simply
because a subject of a wiretap might anticipate that law enforcement agencies
may share it pursuant to s. 193  of the Criminal Code .  A focus on
subjective expectations, which Professor L. M. Austin has described as the
“what did you expect” approach to privacy, would protect “an interest in being
unfairly surprised by state intrusions”, but would fail to guard against
“expected, though nonetheless problematic, invasions of privacy”
(“Information Sharing and the ‘Reasonable’ Ambiguities of Section 8  of the
Charter ” (2007), 57 U.T.L.J. 499, at p. 507 (emphasis added)).  As this
Court held in Tessling, a diminished subjective expectation of privacy
does not necessarily result in reduced constitutional protections:  the
“[e]xpectation of privacy is a normative rather than a descriptive standard”
(para. 42).

[125]                     
In light of the intrusive nature of wiretapping, the
highly personal nature of the information in question, and the very real risks
that may be created by disclosure to foreign officials, it is clear that a
substantial privacy interest remains in wiretapped information.  This restricts
how the information may be divulged and used.

IV.       
Challenges to Section 193(2)(e)

[126]                     
The appellant and interveners challenge a number of aspects of s. 193(2)(e),
including the breadth, alleged vagueness and subjective nature of the test for
disclosure.  They also point to a number of deficiencies:  of a warrant
requirement for the disclosure; of restrictions on how information may be used
once it is shared; and of accountability mechanisms such as record-keeping and
notice or reporting requirements.  I agree with my colleague Justice Moldaver’s
rejection of many of these challenges.  However, in my view, the last two
objections ― concerning the lack of restrictions on disclosed information
and the absence of any accountability measures ― each identify serious
constitutional problems.  For the reasons set out below, I conclude that to the
extent s. 193(2)(e) permits disclosure of wiretap
information to foreign authorities without restrictions on recipients’ use and
without accountability measures, it is unreasonable and
contrary to s. 8  of the Charter .

A.          
Limits on Use of Disclosed Information

[127]                     
The first failure is that s. 193(2)(e) does not impose any limits
on how the shared information will be used or further disclosed.  It simply
permits disclosure of wiretapped information as long as the disclosure “is
intended to be in the interests of the administration of justice in Canada or
elsewhere”.  In my view, it is not an answer to say that because police
officers can only share information that they genuinely believe would further
the interests of the administration of justice, in the context of law
enforcement, it is unlikely that s. 193(2)(e) would result in sharing
with foreign states that engage in torture or other human rights violations. 
While Canadian law enforcement officials are constrained in their use of
wiretapped information by the Charter  and s. 193  of the Criminal Code ,
these restrictions do not apply to foreign officials.

[128]                     
Of course, many foreign jurisdictions impose some form of legal
oversight on the use of wiretapped information or criminal intelligence
generally.  But s. 193(2)(e) itself does nothing to prevent those who
receive the information from using it in proceedings which fail to respect due
process and human rights, which may involve unjustified detention or torture,
or in which the accused has no access to counsel.  Even if the direct
recipients of the information respect human and fair trial rights, s. 193(2)(e)
does not stop them from disclosing the information to others who do not.  As my
colleague LeBel J. has observed, “[i]f the process is
irretrievably flawed, no amount of trust in the future good behaviour and
restraint of prosecutors and police will save it”:  Lavallee, Rackel &
Heintz v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 SCC 61, [2002] 3
S.C.R. 209, at para. 69 (dissenting in part).

[129]                     
One need only look to the case of Maher Arar to understand what is at
stake.  Although in that case the information provided was not obtained by way
of wiretap, Commissioner O’Connor found that “[t]he fact that [the RCMP] did
not attach written caveats to the information about Mr. Arar provided to
American agencies increased the risk that those agencies would use the
information for purposes unacceptable to the RCMP, such as removing him to
Syria” (O’Connor Report, at p. 23).  Although
disclosure by the state that compromises an individual’s life, liberty or
security of the person interests may well give rise to a remedy under s. 7  of
the Charter , s. 8  must be construed to prevent unreasonable intrusions
on privacy and their potential consequences before they occur:  Hunter v.
Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p. 160.

[130]                     
The failure to require any caveats on the use of disclosed information
is, in my view, unreasonable.  To the extent that s. 193(2)(e) permits
law enforcement officers to intercept private communications and then share the
results with foreign officials without any restrictions on what they may do
with them, Part VI does not achieve the balancing of interests required to
satisfy the demands of s. 8  of the Charter .

[131]                     
Further, the requirement of prior judicial
authorization for the wiretap itself does not provide sufficient protection
against inappropriate future disclosure of the information.  Authorizations to
intercept communications are granted with respect to specified times, places
and persons in the context of Canadian laws and protections.  At the time an
authorization is granted, the judge generally does not weigh the targeted
individual’s privacy interests (let alone those of third parties whose
communications are also intercepted) against a future hypothetical state
interest in disclosing the information to foreign law enforcement officials. 
Restrictions on the use of disclosed material would provide some protection of
individuals’ privacy and security interests.

[132]                     
Imposing restrictions on foreign use of Canadian wiretap information
would not undermine the objectives of the wiretap scheme.  Caveats on
information sharing are commonplace in international law enforcement and
intelligence cooperation:  O’Connor Report, at p. 150;
U.K. Intelligence and Security Committee, Rendition (2007), at p. 53. 
Indeed, according to the affidavit of RCMP Deputy Commissioner of Canada West,
Gary David Bass, such caveats are “normally” attached to wiretap disclosures as
a matter of course.  Further, the need for written caveats
need not hinder timely information sharing.  For example, police forces could
have standing agreements with certain foreign forces with whom they regularly
cooperate, or they could complete a standardized form each time information is
shared.

[133]                     
I do not propose any particular form for such
caveats or agreements.  The key is that a wiretap scheme which authorizes deep
intrusions on privacy with potentially life-changing consequences cannot permit
the unconditional disclosure of information to foreign authorities.  Written
caveats must provide some assurance to our law enforcement agencies that
disclosed information will only be used to advance legitimate law enforcement
objectives, in accordance with respect for due process and human rights, and
will not be shared further except as agreed to by the disclosing party.

[134]                     
My colleague Justice Moldaver suggests that where a particular
disclosure is challenged (as here, in an extradition proceeding), the existence
of caveats or protocols may be relevant to determining the disclosing officer’s
subjective intent ― whether the disclosing officer intended that the
disclosure be “in the interests of the administration of justice in Canada or
elsewhere”.  Thus, he says, caveats and protocols may be relevant to whether
the disclosure was authorized by s. 193(2)(e) or whether the disclosure
is carried out in a reasonable manner.  This, of course, rests upon the
uncertain assumption that an individual would have knowledge of the disclosure
and the opportunity to challenge it in a Canadian proceeding.  Further, such an
approach leaves the assessment and balancing of interests in the hands of the
disclosing officer.  Given the significant risks involved in the international
dissemination of such information, and the limited ability of an individual whose
rights have been violated to seek redress, such an approach does not provide
sufficient protections for the important privacy interests engaged.  As noted
above, for s. 193(2)(e) to be reasonable, the law itself must strike the
appropriate balance of interests.

B.           
Oversight and Accountability

[135]                     
In addition, for a law to provide reasonable authority for a search or
seizure, it must include some mechanism to permit oversight of state use of the
power:  see Tse, at paras. 11 and 82.  In my view, this need for accountability
applies not only to the search itself but also to the subsequent use of the
resulting information.  Written caveats alone generally do not provide
sufficient protection.  Without some accountability mechanism, no information
is available on what is being shared, with whom, for what purpose and what
subsequent use is made of the information.  The need for such accountability is
made even greater where information is being shared across borders, putting it
beyond the reach of Canadian legal protections.

[136]                     
The purpose of accountability mechanisms is to deter and identify
inappropriate intrusions on privacy.  None of the safeguards included in the
broader Part VI wiretap regime, such as judicial pre-authorization,
after-the-fact notification, record-keeping or reporting requirements, apply to
the disclosure of wiretap information to foreign officials.  Ensuring that the
wiretapping itself is appropriate does not guarantee that subsequent
disclosures will be.

[137]                     
Justice Moldaver finds that because s. 193(2)(e) is an exemption
to the criminal offence set out at s. 193(1) , law enforcement officers will
have ample incentive to comply with the terms of the exemption in order to
avoid criminal liability.  With respect, I am not convinced that the presence
of the criminal offence is ― on its own ― an adequate
accountability mechanism.  My chief concern is not that Canadian officers will
intentionally disclose the information for purposes unrelated to “the interests
of the administration of justice in Canada or elsewhere”.  Rather, it is the
potential use by foreign officials ― who do not face the risk of
prosecution under s. 193(1)  ― that raises concerns about Charter 
interests.

[138]                     
Canadian law enforcement officers may subjectively intend to serve
justice by sharing information.  However, improper or hazardous sharing is
unlikely to come to light without record-keeping, reporting or notice
obligations.  Moreover, accountability is not only about fostering compliance
with the letter of the law; it is about giving oversight bodies, legislators
and the public the information that they need to ensure that statutory powers
are necessary and are used appropriately.

[139]                     
Justice Moldaver’s suggestion that individuals subject to disclosure of
wiretapped information might find out through an access to information request
is far from adequate in achieving accountability, particularly since the
various privacy laws governing law enforcement across Canada generally include
an exception for records relating to law enforcement matters:  see, for
example, Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. M.56, s. 8(1).  Without any requirement that law enforcement
agencies maintain records, even a successful applicant may find there is little
or no record to obtain.

[140]                     
The case before us was likely an appropriate sharing of information.  It
related to drug crimes that spanned the Canada-United States border, was shared
with U.S. law enforcement, and was used to stop such a crime and to apprehend
the offender.  However, given the breadth of s. 193(2)(e) and of the
personal information that may be contained in a wiretap, it is not difficult to
imagine situations where disclosure would be inappropriate, even if it was
subjectively “intended to be in the interests of the administration of
justice”, as required by s. 193(2)(e).  Accountability mechanisms are
required to safeguard against disclosure in such cases.

[141]                     
Just as the reasonableness of a search power depends on context (Rodgers),
the exact accountability mechanism that will be required varies with the
circumstances.  In general, serious intrusions on a reasonable expectation of
privacy ― such as a search of a dwelling or interception of private
communications ― require prior judicial authorization:  R. v. Thompson,
[1990] 2 S.C.R. 1111.  In emergencies, after-the-fact notice can serve as a
substitute:  Tse.  Some kinds of searches, like searches incident to
arrest, may be immediately apparent to their targets, such that no formal
notice mechanism is required.

[142]                     
Notice of cross-border disclosure would permit individuals ― or
the executive branch of government ― to know which countries have
information and perhaps how it may be used.  After-the-fact reporting to the
legislature would create transparency, telling Canadians how often information
is disclosed to identified foreign law enforcement officials and for what
purposes.  I recognize that these choices involve practical and policy
considerations.  It is for Parliament to decide what measures are most
appropriate and how they should be implemented.  The Charter  does not
mandate a specific protocol; it requires only that the legislation authorizing
a search be reasonable.  Reasonableness, in this case, demands accountability
mechanisms that ensure an appropriate balance between privacy and the state
interest in the search.  At a minimum, the disclosing party should be required
to create a written record of what information is shared with whom, with some
obligation to make the sharing ultimately known to the target or to government.

[143]                     
To conclude, while the sharing of wiretapped information is an important
tool for law enforcement agencies, it must nonetheless be balanced against
adequate protections for the privacy interests at stake in order to pass Charter 
muster.  This balance requires that the disclosing party obtain assurances
that information will not be improperly used by foreign officials.  It also
requires the implementation of accountability measures to facilitate oversight
and to deter inappropriate disclosures.  Absent such protections, I find that
s. 193(2) (e) is contrary to s. 8  of the Charter .

V.          
Section 1 

[144]                     
In my view, s. 193(2)(e) infringes s. 8  of the Charter  in
a manner that is not justified under s. 1 .

[145]                     
To be upheld under s. 1 , legislation that limits a Charter  right
must meet the criteria set out in R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1
S.C.R. 103.  First, the legislation must serve a pressing and
substantial objective.  Second, the means chosen must be proportionate:  there
must be a rational connection between the legislation and the objective, the
legislation must limit the right as little as possible, and there must be
proportionality between the effects of the Charter  limitation and its
objectives.

[146]                     
In this case, the objective of international cooperation in law
enforcement is pressing and substantial, and disclosure of wiretap information
is rationally connected to that objective.  However, s. 193(2)(e) as it
is presently drafted interferes with privacy to a greater extent than
necessary.  The inclusion of accountability mechanisms and limits on subsequent
use would cure the constitutional deficiencies without undermining Parliament’s
goals.  Accordingly, I conclude that the disclosure to foreign officials
permitted without safeguards under s. 193(2)(e) renders the Part VI
regime unconstitutional.

VI.       
Conclusion

[147]                     
Section 8  requires that when a law authorizes intrusions on privacy, it
must do so in a manner that is reasonable.  A reasonable law must have adequate
safeguards to prevent abuse.  It must avoid intruding farther than necessary. 
It must strike an appropriate balance between privacy and other public
interests.  I conclude that s. 193(2)(e) falls short on all three
counts.

[148]                     
In my view, the appropriate remedy in this case
is to strike the words “or to a person or authority
with responsibility in a foreign state” from s. 193(2) (e) of the Criminal
Code .  Such a remedy respects Parliament’s intention to allow law
enforcement officials to collaborate within Canada, while invalidating those
aspects of the legislation that are inconsistent with the Charter . 
Severing the unconstitutional elements of this provision is also consistent
with this Court’s view that “when only a part of a statute or provision
violates the Constitution, it is common sense that only the offending portion
should be declared to be of no force or effect, and the rest should be spared”:
 Schachter v. Canada, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 679, at p. 696.  I would suspend
the effect of this order for 12 months to allow Parliament to amend Part VI to
comply with the Charter .

[149]                     
The Crown submitted that if this Court were to
suspend a declaration of invalidity, a new hearing should be ordered at which
the admissibility of the evidence under s. 24(2)  of the Charter  can be
addressed.  This Court has recognized that, where a suspended declaration of
invalidity is ordered, a constitutional exemption may be awarded “to relieve
the claimant of the continued burden of the unconstitutional law during the
period that the striking out remedy is suspended”:  R. v. Ferguson, 2008
SCC 6, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96, at para. 46; see also Corbiere v. Canada
(Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 203, at para.
22.  I would accordingly exempt the appellant from the suspension of the
declaration of invalidity.

[150]                     
I would answer the relevant constitutional
questions as follows:

Does s. 193(2)(e) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , infringe s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms ?

Answer: Yes.

If so, is the infringement a reasonable
limit prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and
democratic society under s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

Answer: No.

[151]                     
Thus, in the circumstances of this case, I would allow
the appeal and order a new hearing.

[1]   Even if Part VI was not intended by Parliament to
be the exclusive regime governing wiretaps, the Privacy Act  would still
have no application here. Section 8(2)(b) of the Act permits disclosure
of personal information “for any purpose in accordance with any Act of
Parliament . . . that authorizes its disclosure”. Given my conclusion
that the Criminal Code  implicitly authorizes the Impugned
Disclosure, even under the terms of the Privacy Act , the Code is
the applicable statute in this case.





[2]   As observed by LeBel and Wagner JJ. in Imperial Oil,
s. 193(2) merely authorizes the disclosure of intercepted communications in a number of

[1]                             
Karakatsanis J. — This is an appeal as of right on a question
of law.  We agree with the majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal that it was
open to the trial judge to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the
complainant would not have engaged in sexual relations had he known about the
appellant’s HIV positive status.  The fact that the trial judge also found that
it was possible that the sexual relationship continued after disclosure,
despite the complainant’s denial, does not necessarily render that first
finding unreasonable.  While it would have been preferable for the trial judge
to more fully explain his reasoning relating to the complainant’s credibility,
we are not satisfied that the trial judge erred in the analytical process set
out in R. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, or that he failed to analyze
the evidence as a whole relating to an ultimate issue.  The appeal is
dismissed.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

                    Constitutional law — Charter of Rights  — Right to liberty — Right to security
of person — Fundamental justice — Vagueness
— Criminal Code provision prohibiting disposing of dead
body of child with intent to conceal its delivery whether child died before,
during or after birth — Whether provision is impermissibly vague in its application to child that
died before birth — Whether provision infringes
rights to liberty and security of person — Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms , s. 7  — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 243 .

                    Criminal law — Offences — Concealing body of child — Whether phrase “child [that] died before . . . birth”
satisfies requirement of certainty —Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C‑46 , s. 243 .

                    While
cleaning a recently vacated apartment, a building superintendent discovered on
the balcony a bag containing the remains of a human baby.  According to the
Crown, the remains were of a female delivered “at or near full term”.  The
cause of death could not be determined and it was unknown whether there had
been a live birth.  The accused was charged under s. 243  of the Criminal
Code  with concealing the dead body of a child.  Before any evidence was
called, she challenged the constitutionality of s. 243  on the grounds that
the section infringes her right to liberty and security under s. 7  of the
Charter .  The trial judge concluded that the concept of a child that died
before birth is unconstitutionally vague because he could not identify the
moment on the gestational spectrum when a fetus becomes the body of a child for
the purpose of s. 243 .  He severed the word “before” from s. 243 .  The
Crown did not call evidence and the accused was acquitted.  The Court of Appeal
allowed an appeal and ordered a new trial on the grounds that the trial judge
applied an overly demanding standard of vagueness.  The Court of Appeal relied
on the “chance of life” standard from R. v. Berriman (1854), 6 Cox C.C.
388, to conclude that a fetus becomes a child for the purpose of s. 243  when
the fetus has reached a stage when, but for some external event or
circumstance, it would likely have been born alive.

                    Held:  The appeal
should be dismissed.

                    Impermissibly
vague laws mock the rule of law and scorn an ancient and well-established principle
of fundamental justice:  No one may be convicted or punished for an act or
omission that is not clearly prohibited by a valid law.  The issue on this
appeal is whether s. 243  of the Criminal Code  satisfies these
constitutional requirements.

                    The
risk of incarceration upon conviction clearly engaged the accused’s liberty
interest under s. 7  of the Charter .  It is thus unnecessary to
dispose of her submission that s. 243  infringes s. 7  because it
interferes with a decision of fundamental personal importance:  whether and how
to disclose the natural end of a failed pregnancy.  Furthermore, the accused’s
argument that s. 7  of the Charter  must hold s. 243  to a
heightened standard of precision because it interferes with every woman’s right
not to disclose a naturally failed pregnancy raises a challenge for vagueness
in form but overbreadth in substance.  Given that the accused’s overbreadth
arguments were rejected by both courts below and not raised on this appeal,
there is no proper basis to revisit the issue here.

                    In
accordance with s. 7  of the Charter , in a criminal context, a
statutory provision must afford citizens fair notice of the consequences of
their conduct and it must limit the discretion of those charged with its
enforcement.  A provision that fails to satisfy these essential requirements is
void for vagueness.  This is judicially determined by examination of both the
provision’s text and context.  Section 243  meets the minimum standard of
precision required by the Charter .  In its application to a child that
died before birth, it only captures the disposal of the remains of children
that were likely to be born alive.  A conviction will only lie where the Crown
proves that the child, to the knowledge of the accused, was likely to have been
born alive.  Section 243  gives fair notice of the risk of prosecution and
conviction and limits with sufficient clarity the discretion of those charged
with its enforcement.  There is thus no need to conduct a s. 1  analysis.  

                    A
court can conclude that a law is unconstitutionally vague only after exhausting
its interpretive function.  This requires considering prior judicial
interpretations of the provision, the legislative purpose of the provision, its
subject matter and nature, societal values and related legislative provisions. 
A plain reading of s. 243  makes clear that it is focused on the event of
birth.  The interpretation of s. 243  is informed by Berriman, which
sets out that an accused can only be convicted of child concealment if he or
she, with intent to conceal its birth, disposed of the body of a child that had
reached a point of development where, but for some accidental circumstances it
might have been born alive.  However, where Berriman required that the
fetus “might have been born alive”, a likelihood requirement is
to be preferred.  A likelihood standard best comports with the late term focus
of s. 243  and affords greater certainty in its application.  Moreover, a
likelihood standard is consistent
with the primary purpose of s. 243  in facilitating the investigation of
other Criminal Code  provisions: the homicide provisions that apply only
when the victim is a human being which, in the case of a child, requires that
the child has completely proceeded, in a living state, from the body of its mother;
ss. 238  and 242 , both of which focus on the event of birth; and, s. 662(4) 
which, on a charge of murder or infanticide, permits a conviction under s. 243 
where neither murder nor infanticide is made out.  Limiting
the pre-birth application of s. 243  to fetuses that were likely to have
been born alive is consistent with the clear late term focus of these offences. 


                    Section 243 
is not vague because an accused is dependent on expert medical evidence to know
whether a fetus would likely have been born alive.   Medical evidence would be
required even if s. 243  provided a detailed description of the precise
moment on the gestational spectrum where a miscarriage becomes a still birth.

                    Fish J. — 

I

[1]                             
Impermissibly vague laws mock the rule of law
and scorn an ancient and well-established principle of fundamental justice: No
one may be convicted or punished for an act or omission that is not clearly
prohibited by a valid law.  That principle is now enshrined in the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms . This has been recognized by the Court since
its earliest pronouncements on unconstitutional vagueness in the Charter 
era. 

[2]                             
In Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of
the Criminal Code (Man.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123, the Court cited with
approval two decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States[1] holding that
“impermissibly vague laws” violate “the first essential of due process of law”
(p. 1151), and continued as follows:

The principles expressed in these two
citations are not new to our law.  In fact they are based on the ancient Latin
maxim nullum crimen sine lege, nulla poena sine lege ― that there
can be no crime or punishment unless it is in accordance with law that is
certain, unambiguous and not retroactive.  The rationale underlying this
principle is clear.  It is essential in a free and democratic society that
citizens are able, as far as is possible, to foresee the consequences of their
conduct in order that persons be given fair notice of what to avoid, and that
the discretion of those entrusted with law enforcement is limited by clear and
explicit legislative standards . . . . This is especially important in the
criminal law, where citizens are potentially liable to a deprivation of liberty
if their conduct is in conflict with the law. [p. 1152]

[3]                             
And very recently, speaking for the Court in R.
v. Mabior, 2012 SCC 47, [2012] S.C.R. 584, Chief Justice McLachlin
reaffirmed the governing principle in these terms:

It is a fundamental requirement of the
rule of law that a person should be able to predict whether a particular act
constitutes a crime at the time he commits the act.  The rule of law requires
that laws provide in advance what can and cannot be done . . . .  Condemning
people for conduct that they could not have reasonably known was criminal is
Kafkaesque and anathema to our notions of justice.  After-the-fact condemnation
violates the concept of liberty in s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms  and has no place in the Canadian legal system. [para. 14]

[4]                             
Our concern here is with s. 243  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 , which is said by the appellant to be impermissibly vague, at least
in part.  For that reason and to that extent, the appellant submits, s. 243 
infringes her right to liberty and security of the person under s. 7  of the Charter . 
She submits as well that this infringement of s. 7  cannot be justified ―
or “saved” ― under s. 1  of the Charter .

[5]                             
Section 243  makes it a crime in Canada to
dispose of the dead body of a child with intent to conceal its delivery ―
whether the child died before, during, or after birth. 
The decisive issue on this appeal is whether s. 243  is impermissibly vague in
its application to a child that died before birth.  

[6]                             
The trial judge held that it is; the Ontario
Court of Appeal held that it is not.  With respect for the contrary conclusion
of the trial judge, I agree with the Court of Appeal. 

[7]                             
The appellant argues that s. 7  of the Charter 
must hold s. 243  to a more exacting standard of precision because it
interferes with what in her view is a constitutionally protected personal
autonomy and privacy interest: every woman’s right not to disclose a naturally
failed pregnancy. 

[8]                             
In fact, however, the appellant’s vagueness
challenge does not rest ultimately ― if at all ― on a woman’s
constitutionally protected autonomy and privacy interests.  On the contrary,
the appellant expressly recognizes Parliament’s right to criminalize the
concealment by a woman of the fact that she was delivered of a child that died
during, after and even before birth.  More particularly, she concedes
that Parliament may “enact legislation which has application to the concealment
of a fetus at some stages of development prior to live birth”.  Her
constitutional challenge relates exclusively to a woman’s “inability to
determine the conduct to which s. 243  applies in the context of a child that
dies before birth”: A.F., at para. 4. 

[9]                             
It seems to me that the appellant’s submission
regarding a woman’s right not to disclose a naturally failed pregnancy amounts
to a challenge for vagueness in form but overbreadth in substance.  A challenge
for overbreadth would require the Court to balance the impact of s. 243  on the
appellant’s constitutionally protected interests against the impact necessary
for s. 243  to achieve its justified legislative objectives.  The appellant’s
arguments regarding this balance were rejected by both courts below.  Moreover,
there is no challenge for overbreadth on this appeal.  And it is not open to
the appellant, in characterizing her privacy interest submission as a vagueness
challenge, to circumvent this balancing exercise that informs a proper
constitutional challenge for overbreadth.

[10]                         
There is otherwise no dispute regarding the
analytical framework for determining whether a statutory provision is void for
vagueness.  Nor is there any dispute as to the governing criteria: In a
criminal context, the impugned provision must afford citizens fair notice of
the consequences of their conduct and limit the discretion of those charged
with its enforcement.  

[11]                         
Whether the provision satisfies these essential
requirements will be judicially determined by examination of both its text and
context.  Normally, in making that determination, the court will first consider
the plain meaning of the words used by Parliament to define the essential
elements of the offence.  In this regard, the requirement of a specific intent,
as in this case, will often shed light on the intelligibility of the terms used
to describe the prohibited act or omission. 

[12]                         
I shall later have more to say about these
established rules of interpretation.  As we shall see, their application here
leads me to conclude that s. 243  of the Criminal Code  is not
impermissibly vague in its application to a child that dies before birth.  Only
that aspect of the provision is in issue on this appeal.  

[13]                         
Any ambiguity as to this element of the offence
is resolved in favour of the accused, as it must be, by restricting the
pre-birth application of s. 243  to the delivery of a child that would likely
have been born alive.  By this I mean, here and throughout, a child that has
reached a stage of development where, but for some external event or
circumstances, it would likely have been born alive. 

[14]                         
I recognize, of course, that provincial and
territorial legislation requires reporting of all stillbirths, generally
defined as “the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product
of conception either after the twentieth week of pregnancy or after the product
of conception has attained the weight of 500 grams or more [without signs of
life]”, or words to this effect: see, for example, Vital Statistics Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. V.4, s. 1.  

[15]                         
The unchallenged constitutionality of these
provisions may well negate the privacy and autonomy interests claimed by the
appellant in this case.  And they doubtless provide clear and specific
standards for provincial reporting purposes.  In my view, however, they cannot
be invoked ― by “harmonization”, analogy, or otherwise ― to expand
by judicial fiat the meaning of “child [that] died before . . .  birth” in s.
243  of the Criminal Code .  Section 243 , an enactment that falls squarely
within federal jurisdiction, has a distinct legislative history and creates a
crime for different legislative purposes.

[16]                         
Finally, a brief word regarding the fault
element of s. 243  in its application to a child that died before birth.  The
Crown concedes, properly in my view, that the burden of proof would be on the
prosecution to establish the accused’s awareness that the child died at a time
when it was likely to be born alive.  Any doubt in this regard would require an
acquittal.  In addition, as in cases where the child dies at or after birth, the
prosecution must prove that the accused disposed of its body “with intent to
conceal the fact that [the child’s] mother has been delivered of it”.  

[17]                         
For these reasons and the reasons that follow, I
would dismiss the appellant’s appeal to this Court, affirm the judgment of the
Court of Appeal, and remit the matter for trial. 

II

[18]                         
By agreement, the appellant’s constitutional
challenge to s. 243  was heard and decided by the trial judge before any
evidence was called.  Accordingly, the facts alleged by the Crown remain to
this day unproven and are thus conditionally relevant here as a matter of
context only. 

[19]                         
For present purposes, the following summary will
suffice. 

[20]                         
While cleaning a recently vacated apartment, a
building superintendent discovered on the balcony a bag containing the remains
of a human baby.  Post-mortem examination revealed that the remains were of a
female delivered “at or near full term”: R.F., at para. 8.  Due to the
decomposition of the remains, the cause of death could not be determined and it
was unknown whether there had been a live birth.  

[21]                         
Following media reports of the superintendent’s
discovery, Ivana Levkovic, the appellant in this Court, attended at a police
station and gave a statement to the police.  She gave birth to the baby, she explained,
after falling while alone in the apartment.  She then placed the baby in a bag,
deposited the bag on the balcony, and left the apartment.  Nothing in her
statement to the police suggests that the baby was alive at birth. 

[22]                         
Ms. Levkovic was charged with concealing the
body of a child under s. 243  of the Criminal Code .  She pleaded not
guilty and, before any evidence was called, challenged the constitutionality of
s. 243  on the ground that it is impermissibly vague in its application to a child
that died before birth.  To this extent, she submitted, s. 243  violates s.
7  of the Charter .  

[23]                         
The trial judge granted Ms. Levkovic’s
application: (2008), 235 C.C.C. (3d) 417.  He concluded that the concept of a
child that died before birth is unconstitutionally vague because he could not
identify the moment on the gestational spectrum when a fetus becomes the body
of a child within the meaning of s. 243 .  

[24]                         
To bring the provision into compliance with s. 7 
of the Charter , the trial judge severed the word “before” from the text
of the provision, thereby limiting its application to children that died either
during or after birth.  

[25]                         
The Crown elected to call no evidence and the
trial judge acquitted the appellant.  

[26]                         
The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal by the
Crown, set aside the decision of the trial judge, restored the pre-birth
application of s. 243 , and ordered a new trial: 2010 ONCA 830, 103 O.R. (3d) 1.


[27]                         
The Court of Appeal concluded that the trial
judge had erred by applying an overly demanding standard of vagueness and in
failing to apply R. v. Berriman (1854), 6 Cox C.C. 388 (Surrey Assizes),
to his interpretation of s. 243 .  Relying on Berriman, the Court of
Appeal held that a fetus becomes a child for the purpose of s. 243  upon
reaching a stage in its development when, but for some external event or other
circumstances, it would likely have been born alive.

[28]                         
Ms. Levkovic now asks this Court to overrule the
Court of Appeal and restore her acquittal.  She raises two main grounds:  (1)
that the Court of Appeal erred in conducting an insufficiently contextual
vagueness analysis, overlooking the full impact of s. 243  on her Charter -protected
right to liberty and security; and (2) that the Court of Appeal erred in
relying on the chance of life standard to uphold the constitutionality
of s. 243 .

III

[29]                         
Plainly, Ms. Levkovic’s prosecution under s. 243 
of the Criminal Code  engages her liberty interest under s. 7  of the Charter ,
given the risk of her incarceration upon conviction: Canada (Attorney
General) v. PHS Community Services Society, 2011 SCC 44, [2011] 3 S.C.R.
134, at para. 87.  

[30]                         
It is therefore unnecessary at this stage to
dispose of the appellant’s submission that s. 243  also infringes her
liberty and security under s. 7  of the Charter  because it interferes
with a decision of fundamental personal importance: whether and how to disclose
the natural end of a failed pregnancy.  

[31]                         
Accordingly, I now turn instead to consider
whether s. 243 , though it engages s. 7  of the Charter , nevertheless
passes constitutional muster because it accords with the principles of
fundamental justice. 

IV

[32]                         
The doctrine against vagueness is founded on two
rationales: a law must provide fair notice to citizens and it must limit
enforcement discretion.  Understood in light of its theoretical foundations,
the doctrine against vagueness is a critical component of a society grounded in
the rule of law:  R. v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, [1992] 2
S.C.R. 606, at pp. 626-27; Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the
Law v. Canada (Attorney General), 2004 SCC 4, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 76, at
para. 16.  

[33]                         
Since long before the Charter , Canadian
criminal law has adhered to the principle of certainty: prohibited conduct must
be fixed and knowable in advance: M. Manning and P. Sankoff, Manning, Mewett & Sankoff: 
Criminal Law (4th ed. 2009), at p. 76.  As
Glanville Williams explained in Criminal Law: The General Part (2nd ed.
1961), at pp. 575-76 (cited in D. Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law:  A Treatise
(6th ed. 2011), at pp. 20-21):

. . .  Nullum crimen sine
lege, Nulla poena sine lege ― that there must be no crime or
punishment except in accordance with fixed, predetermined law ― this has
been regarded by most thinkers as a self-evident principle of justice ever
since the French Revolution.  The citizen must be able to ascertain beforehand
how he stands with regard to the criminal law; otherwise to punish him for
breach of that law is purposeless cruelty. . . .  

 

. .
. “Law” for this purpose means a body of fixed rules; and it excludes wide
discretion even though that discretion be exercised by independent judges.  The
principle of legality involves rejecting “criminal equity” as a mode of
extending the law.

[34]                         
This does not mean that an individual must know
with certainty whether a particular course of conduct will ultimately result in
a conviction of the crime that prohibits such conduct.  What it does mean is
that the essential elements of the crime must be ascertainable in advance.  If
an accused must wait “until a
court decides what the contours and parameters of the offence are then the
accused is being treated unfairly and contrary to the principles of fundamental
justice”:  Manning, at pp. 75-76.

[35]                         
Individuals are nonetheless expected to refrain
from conduct that tests the boundaries of criminal law lest they bear the
consequences of the risk they have knowingly assumed: see Canadian
Foundation for Children, at para. 42.  Understandably, the appellant
acknowledges that the Constitution contemplates a necessary degree of
imprecision in this regard.  She submits, however, that such imprecision is
unconstitutional if it requires individuals to refrain from constitutionally
protected conduct.  

[36]                         
The appellant argues that s. 243  must explicitly
draw a dividing line between miscarriages and stillbirths lest a woman feel
compelled by her uncertainty to give up more of her Charter -protected
privacy than necessary.  In effect, the appellant urges the Court to modify the
well-established vagueness standard by introducing an additional factor into
the vagueness analysis:  the potential chilling impact of the impugned
provision on Charter -protected interests.  I would decline this
invitation to vary the governing analytical framework established by the
Court.  

[37]                         
The rule against unconstitutional vagueness is
primarily intended to assure the intelligibility of the criminal law to those
who are subject to its sanctions and to those who are charged with its
enforcement.  As this Court stated in Ontario v. Canadian Pacific Ltd.,
[1995] 2 S.C.R. 1031, at para. 82: 

In the
context of vagueness, proportionality plays no role in the analysis.  There is
no need to compare the purpose of the law with its effects (as in overbreadth)
. . . . A court is required to perform its interpretive function, in order to
determine whether an impugned provision provides the basis for legal debate. 

[38]                         
This does not mean that the impact of s. 243  on
a woman’s privacy interests is irrelevant to its constitutionality.  However,
it is important to maintain the analytical distinction between true vagueness
and the additional vagueness concern raised by the appellant.  The latter, in
my view, is more appropriately considered an aspect of overbreadth and dealt
with in that context.  As the respondent rightly points out, failing to do so
would create a “lopsided” analysis that “takes account of individual interests
. . . without equal regard to the law’s objectives”: R.F., at para. 63.   

[39]                         
As this Court held in Nova Scotia
Pharmaceutical, “once the minimal general standard has been met, any
further arguments as to the precision of the enactments should be considered at
the ‘minimal impairment’ stage of s. 1 analysis” (p. 643).  Or, in this
case, where no Charter  violation has yet been established and there is
therefore no need to consider s. 1, additional precision-based arguments
relating to the scope of the provision should be considered in an overbreadth
analysis.  

[40]                         
Where a law meets the minimum standard of
precision required by the Charter , it may nevertheless by
“[g]enerality and imprecision of language . . . fail to confine the invasion of
a Charter  right within reasonable limits.  In this sense vagueness is an
aspect of overbreadth”: Osborne v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1991] 2
S.C.R. 69, at pp. 94-95.  

[41]                         
Given that the appellant’s overbreadth arguments
were rejected by both courts below and not raised on this appeal, there is no
proper basis to revisit the issue here.

[42]                         
I turn then to the question at the heart of this
appeal:  Does s. 243 sufficiently limit enforcement discretion and provide
citizens with fair notice of the type of conduct that risks criminal sanction? 
As mentioned at the outset, I believe that it does.

V

[43]                         
Section 243 states:

243. Every one who in any manner disposes of the dead body of a child,
with intent to conceal the fact that its mother has been delivered of it,
whether the child died before, during or after birth, is guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two
years.

[44]                         
A plain reading of its text makes clear that s.
243 is focused on the event of birth.  The phrase “before, during or after
birth” leaves no room for doubt in this regard.  Indeed the parties agree that
in its application to a child that died before birth, s. 243 applies
only to stillbirths ― not to miscarriages or abortions: see A.F., at
paras. 3-4.

[45]                         
Despite this clear connection to the event of
birth, the appellant argues that the word “before” renders s. 243 vague because
it does not clearly distinguish a birth from a miscarriage.  In other words, a
woman may not know whether she has miscarried and is therefore outside the
scope of s. 243, or has instead experienced a stillbirth and may therefore be
caught by s. 243.  From the appellant’s perspective, the transition point
between miscarriage and stillbirth is critical.  It represents the moment when
a fetus becomes a child and therefore delineates the boundary between
permissible and criminal conduct: only the concealment of the body of a child
is caught by s. 243.

[46]                         
Thus, the central vagueness question is whether
s. 243 sufficiently identifies the moment on the gestational spectrum when a
miscarriage becomes a stillbirth.  The answer to this question does not lie
entirely and exclusively in the text of s. 243.

[47]                         
A court can conclude that a law is
unconstitutionally vague only after exhausting its interpretive function.  The
court “must first develop the full interpretive context surrounding an impugned
provision”: Canadian Pacific, at paras. 47 and 79.  

[48]                         
To develop a provision’s “full interpretive
context”, this Court has considered: (i) prior judicial interpretations; (ii)
the legislative purpose; (iii) the subject matter and nature of the impugned
provision; (iv) societal values; and (v) related legislative provisions: Canadian
Pacific, at paras. 47 and 87.  

[49]                         
Relevant jurisprudence as to the scope of this
offence dates back over 150 years to the English case of Berriman.  Ms.
Berriman was charged with concealing the birth of her child.  The police linked
Ms. Berriman to the “half calcined” bones of a baby with a gestational age of
seven to nine months.  Erle J. instructed the jury not to convict if the fetus
could have had no “chance of life”:

This offence cannot be
committed unless the child had arrived at that stage of maturity at the time of
birth, that it might have been a living child. It is not necessary that it
should have been born alive, but it must have reached a period when, but for
some accidental circumstances, such as disease on the part of itself or of its
mother, it might have been born alive.  There is no law which compels a
woman to proclaim her own want of chastity, and if she had miscarried at a time
when the fœtus was but a few months old, and therefore could have had no chance
of life, you could not convict her upon this charge. No specific limit can be assigned
to the period when the chance of life begins, but it may, perhaps, be safely
assumed that under seven months the great probably [sic] is that the
child would not be born alive. [p. 390] 

[50]                         
According to this test, an accused could only be
convicted of child concealment if he or she, with the intent to conceal its
birth, disposed of the body of a child that had reached a point of development
where, “but for some accidental circumstances . . . it might have been born
alive”.  

[51]                         
Berriman suggests
that an unborn child of at least seven months is more likely than not to be
born alive.  By setting seven months as a guideline ― rather than a
bright line ― the court in that case recognized that a child’s chance of
being born alive will generally increase along the gestational spectrum but is
not necessarily predictable based on the gestational age of the fetus alone.  

[52]                         
I would in any case hesitate to import into s.
243 a fixed threshold based on gestational age that Parliament has so far
chosen to omit.

[53]                         
In my view, s. 243 is informed by Berriman.


[54]                         
However, where Erle J. found it sufficient in Berriman
that the fetus “might have been born alive”, I would adopt a likelihood
requirement instead.  I agree with the Court of Appeal that, for the purposes
of s. 243, a fetus becomes a child when the fetus “has reached a stage in its
development when, but for some external event or other circumstances, it would
likely have been born alive” (para. 115 (emphasis added)).

[55]                         
This “likelihood” standard best comports with
the late term focus of s. 243 and thus affords greater certainty in its
application.

[56]                         
To support a conviction under s. 243, it must be
shown that the “remains” disposed of were the remains of a child.  In cases
involving death before birth, the burden is therefore on the Crown to prove
that the fetus would likely have been born alive.

[57]                         
This brings me to another important aspect of a
full contextual interpretation of s. 243: its legislative purpose and context. 

[58]                         
The parties agree that
s. 243 is largely concerned with facilitating the investigation of homicides. 
In order to do so, s. 243 must cover potential victims of homicide.

[59]                         
Pursuant to s. 222(1) ,
the homicide provisions of the Criminal Code  apply only when the victim
is a human being.  And pursuant to s. 223(1) of the Code, a child
becomes a human being “when it has completely proceeded, in a living state,
from the body of its mother, whether or not (a) it has breathed; (b)
it has an independent circulation; or (c) the navel string is severed”.

[60]                         
In order to facilitate
the investigation of homicides, s. 243 must therefore apply to children that
were either born alive or were likely to be born alive and thus capable of
satisfying the Criminal Code  definition of a human being in s. 223(1) . 
As the trial judge reasoned at para. 156:

. . . allowing persons to conduct
themselves as though pregnancy terminated in still-birth, and to say so if
challenged, all without reliable government certification, amounts to an easy
and unacceptable escape for those inclined to eliminate a new-born infant by
killing it. Unchecked and unreviewable disposal of a still-born child
effectively defeats the state’s ability to verify that death preceded live
birth.  

[61]                         
Accordingly, a likelihood
approach to s. 243 ― that is, requiring evidence that the child would
likely have been born alive ― serves its goal of facilitating the
investigation of potential homicides. 

[62]                         
That said, to fully
achieve its purpose, s. 243 must also facilitate the investigation of ss. 238 
and 242 , which both contemplate the death of a child that has not yet become a
human being within the meaning of s. 223(1)  of the Criminal Code .

[63]                         
Section 238  prohibits
killing an unborn child in the act of birth and s. 242  proscribes the failure
to obtain assistance in childbirth, resulting in permanent injury or death
immediately before, during, or a short time after birth.  

[64]                         
To facilitate the
investigation of these offences, the pre-birth application of s. 243 is appropriately
limited to fetuses that were likely to have been born alive ― that is
children, not fetuses that were miscarried.

[65]                         
This likelihood approach
is also consistent with s. 662(4)  of the Criminal Code , which, on a
charge of murder or infanticide, permits a conviction under s. 243  where
neither murder nor infanticide is made out, but the evidence proves the
requisite elements of s. 243 .  

[66]                         
When considered in light of s. 662(4) , it is
clear that the pre-birth application of s. 243 is not intended to reach back
beyond the delivery of a child that would likely have been born alive.  Rather,
its application to a child that died before birth simply ensures that the law
can respond to criminal conduct against newly born infants in cases where the
evidence does not establish that death occurred post-birth.

[67]                         
By facilitating the investigation of the
offences discussed above, s. 243 ultimately serves to protect children born
alive and a subset of children that died before birth.  The parties agree that
Parliament can properly legislate with respect to both.  As we have seen, the
appellant explicitly concedes that Parliament may “enact legislation which has
application to the concealment of a fetus at some stages of development prior
to live birth”.

[68]                         
With regard to newly born
children, the importance of s. 243 is clear.  As expressed in the Goudge
Report, vol. 1, at p. 4,[2]
society is gravely concerned with investigating offences committed against
society’s youngest:

For the
community itself, the death of a child in criminally suspicious circumstances
is deeply disturbing.  Children are the community’s most precious and most
defenceless asset.  The sense of outrage and the urgent need to understand what
happened are overwhelming.

[69]                         
Bearing its purposes in mind, the pre-birth application
of s. 243 is appropriately limited to fetuses that were likely to have been
born alive.  In the words of the respondent, the crime of concealment is
“limited by the clear late term focus of the offences s. 243 is supporting”:
R.F., at para. 50.   

[70]                         
The appellant argues, however, that even if we
describe a child that died before birth as a fetus that would likely
have been born alive, s. 243 remains vague because an accused is dependent on
expert medical evidence to know whether a fetus was, in fact, likely to have
been born alive.  

[71]                         
Indeed, the doctrine against vagueness cannot be
satisfied by inaccessible laws.  It is not enough for laws to provide guidance
to legal experts; laws, as judicially interpreted, must be sufficiently
intelligible to guide ordinary citizens on how to conduct themselves within
legal boundaries.  As McLachlin C.J. explained in Mabior (in a passage
more fully set out above): “It is a fundamental requirement of the rule of law
that a person should be able to predict whether a particular act constitutes a
crime at the time he commits the act” (para. 14).  

[72]                         
Nonetheless, reliance on expert evidence is not
necessarily fatal to the constitutionality of a provision.  Section 243 is by
no means the only offence that relies on expert evidence to determine whether
an offence was committed.  For example, without the benefit of a breathalyser,
individuals may not know whether they have consumed an amount of alcohol that
would bring them over the legal limit.  Similarly, in some murder cases an
accused may not know, without expert medical evidence, whether his or her conduct
actually caused the victim’s death.  

[73]                         
Expert evidence cannot serve to define the
elements of an offence, but only to help the court determine whether the
elements are made out on the facts of a particular charge.  In the case of s.
243, expert evidence can thus be relied on to establish as a matter of fact
that the disposed-of remains were those of a child that was likely to be born
alive ― an essential element of the offence.

[74]                         
Even if s. 243 provided a detailed description
of the precise moment on the gestational spectrum where a miscarriage becomes a
stillbirth, as the appellant suggests it should, medical evidence would often
be required in any event.  For example, if s. 243 stated that the concealment
offence only applies to a child that died before birth where the gestational
age is over seven months, what additional certainty would that give a woman who
was unsure of the date of conception?  In such a case, expert medical evidence
regarding gestational age would be required to ascertain whether s. 243 would
capture a decision to keep a failed pregnancy private.  

[75]                         
Similarly, if the word “before” were severed
from s. 243, making it only applicable to a child that died during or after
birth, a woman remains dependent on medical evidence to determine whether her
conduct would fall within s. 243.  As the trial judge noted: “A mother may not
be in the best position to know whether her new-born is alive or dead . . . .” (para. 83).  He went on to explain, at
para. 145: 

Where a
woman who has given birth mistakenly believes the child to be dead and disposes
of the body intending to conceal its birth as opposed to notifying the relevant
authorities, there is no opportunity to correct the mother’s “mistake” and save
the child (see R. v. Bryan (1959), 123 C.C.C. 160 (Ont. C.A.) ―
mother erroneously believed child to be still-born, disposed of body down
garbage chute; baby subsequently dying in incinerator).

[76]                         
Accordingly, under the severed version adopted
by the trial judge that would apply only to deaths that occur during or after
birth, medical evidence would still be required; it would simply relate to the
time of death instead of fetal development.  Clearly, it is the subject matter,
rather than the imprecision of the law, that gives rise to the need for expert
medical evidence.

[77]                         
Finally, the state’s interest in late-term
failed pregnancies is both ascertainable and well established.  Stillbirths are
highly regulated by provincial and territorial legislation: see R.F., at Appendix
D.  The regulations in all provinces and territories impose some kind of
positive obligation to disclose failed pregnancies where the gestational age is
20 weeks or more or where the fetus weighs 500 grams or more: see, for example,
Vital Statistics Act, ss. 1 and 9.1; and associated regulations under
R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 1094, s. 20.  

[78]                         
The foregoing contextual and purposive analysis
persuades me that s. 243 meets the minimum standard of precision required
by the Charter .  In its application to a child that died
before birth, s. 243  only captures the delivery of a child that was likely
to be born alive. 

[79]                         
And I recall in this context that a conviction
would only lie where the Crown proves that the child, to the knowledge of the
accused, would likely have been born alive.

VI

[80]                         
For all the foregoing reasons, I have concluded
that s. 243 does not violate s. 7  of the Charter .  Section 243  gives
women ― and men ― fair notice that they risk prosecution and
conviction if they dispose of the remains of a child born at or near full term
with intent to conceal the fact that its mother had been delivered of it.  And
s. 243 limits with sufficient clarity the discretion of those charged with its
enforcement.  There is thus no need to conduct a s. 1 analysis.  

[81]                         
I would therefore dismiss the appeal and affirm
the order for a new trial.

                    A
jury found the accused guilty of sexual assault of his niece which occurred
when she was between the ages of 12 and 14.  At trial, the complainant had
testified about several sexual incidents involving the accused.  The accused
had testified in his own defence and denied any sexual activity with the
complainant.  On appeal, the Court of Appeal was troubled by a number of
inconsistencies in the complainant’s testimony and previous statements.  However,
it noted that nothing appeared from the transcript which should have caused a
juror to question the accused’s truthfulness.  In light of those factors, the
court was of the view that no experienced judge sitting alone would have been
able to provide adequate reasons for the guilty verdict.  The Court of Appeal
concluded that the verdict was unreasonable, set it aside and entered an
acquittal.

                    Held: 
The appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.

                    A
verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence if it is one
that a properly instructed jury acting judicially could not reasonably have
rendered.  Appellate review of a jury’s verdict of guilt must be conducted
within two well‑established boundaries.  On one hand, the reviewing court
must give due weight to the advantages of the jury as the trier of fact who was
present throughout the trial and saw and heard the evidence as it unfolded.  The
reviewing court must not act as a “13th juror” or simply give effect to vague
unease or lurking doubt based on its own review of the written record or find
that a verdict is unreasonable simply because the reviewing court has a
reasonable doubt based on its review of the record.  On the other hand,
however, the review cannot be limited to assessing the sufficiency of the
evidence.  A positive answer to the question of whether there is some evidence
which, if believed, supports the conviction does not exhaust the role of the
reviewing court.  Rather, the court is required to review, analyse and, within
the limits of appellate disadvantage, weigh the evidence and consider through
the lens of judicial experience, whether judicial fact‑finding precludes
the conclusion reached by the jury.  Thus, in deciding whether the verdict is
one which a properly instructed jury acting judicially could reasonably have
rendered, the reviewing court must ask not only whether there is evidence in
the record to support the verdict, but also whether the jury’s conclusion
conflicts with the bulk of judicial experience.

                    The
traditional test for unreasonable verdict applies to cases such as this one in
which the verdict is based on an assessment of witness credibility.  In
applying the test, the court of appeal must show great deference to the trier
of fact’s assessment of witness credibility given the advantage it has in
seeing and hearing the witnesses’ evidence.  This applies with particular force
to verdicts reached by juries. It is for the jury to decide, notwithstanding
difficulties with a witness’s evidence, how much, if any, of the testimony it
accepts.  Credibility assessment does not depend solely on objective
considerations such as inconsistencies or motive for concoction; accordingly, the
jury is entitled to decide how much weight it gives to such factors.  The
reviewing court must be deferential to the collective good judgment and common
sense of the jury.  While appellate review for unreasonableness of guilty
verdicts is a powerful safeguard against wrongful convictions, it is also one
that must be exercised with great deference to the fact‑finding role of
the jury.  Trial by jury must not become trial by appellate court on the
written record.

                    The
Court of Appeal in this case applied the wrong legal test and, in carrying out
its review of the jury’s verdict, failed to give sufficient deference to the
jury’s assessment of witness credibility.  The test to be applied by courts of
appeal in reviewing guilty verdicts for unreasonableness does not involve the
reviewing court attempting to put itself in the place of an imaginary trial
judge and on a review of the written record asking whether that imaginary judge
could have articulated legally adequate reasons for conviction.  The Court of
Appeal’s adoption of this new test resulted in its failure to take a
sufficiently deferential approach to the findings of the jury viewed, as they
must be, in the context of the whole of the evidence.

                    The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

                    Cromwell J. — 

I.       Overview and Issue

[1]                             
A jury found the respondent guilty of sexual
assault, but the Court of Appeal concluded that the jury’s finding was
unreasonable, set it aside and entered an acquittal. The Crown appeals, arguing
that the Court of Appeal wrongly substituted its assessment of witness
credibility for that of the jury. The appeal therefore raises the issue of an
appellate court’s role when it assesses the reasonableness of a jury’s guilty
verdict based on the jury’s assessment of witness credibility.

[2]                             
Of course, a jury’s guilty verdict based on the
jury’s assessment of witness credibility is not immune from appellate review
for reasonableness.  However, the reviewing court must treat the verdict with
great deference. The court must ask itself whether the jury’s verdict is
supportable on any reasonable view of the evidence and whether proper
judicial fact-finding applied to the evidence precludes the conclusion
reached by the jury. Here, the Court of Appeal did not follow this approach. It
asked itself instead whether an experienced trial judge could give adequate
reasons to explain the finding of guilt and, having answered that question in
the negative, found the verdict unreasonable. In my respectful view, the Court
of Appeal applied the wrong legal test and reached the wrong conclusion.

[3]                             
I would allow the appeal and restore the
conviction entered at trial.  

II.     Facts and Proceedings

A.     Overview of the Facts

[4]                             
The respondent was charged with sexual assault
of and sexual interference with his niece when she was between the ages of 12
and 14. The jury found the respondent guilty. The trial judge entered a
conviction for sexual assault but stayed the sexual interference count because
it was based on the same factual and legal foundation:  see Kienapple v. The
Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729; R. v. S.J.M., 2009 ONCA 244, 247 O.A.C.
178. The background as it emerged at trial is this.

[5]                             
The complainant’s parents separated when she was
nine years old. Her mother moved to Ontario while she continued to live with
her father in a small town in Newfoundland and Labrador.  Their home was next
door to the respondent and his wife, who is her father’s sister. When her
father was away for work, the respondent and his wife were responsible for her
care and even when her father was home, they would regularly all have supper
together.

[6]                             
The complainant testified that she was prompted
to disclose the respondent’s conduct towards her by an incident in June 2008. 
She had missed the school bus and asked the respondent to drive her to school. 
During the drive, the respondent began to talk to her about sex and said, “all
you have to do is say the word and I’ll make love to you”: A.R., vol. II, at p.
47.  Later that day or the next day, the complainant called her mother in
Ontario and told her about this incident. She then flew to Ontario to be with
her mother.  Her mother took her to a doctor who made a referral to child
protection authorities which in turn led to police involvement. In late July,
her mother accompanied her to the Port Elgin police station to make an initial
videotaped statement in which she described one incident. 

[7]                             
At trial, the respondent also testified about an
incident in June.  He agreed to drive the complainant to school after she
missed her bus.  He testified that he spoke to her about being careful not to
become pregnant, a conversation he said was prompted by MSN blog messages she
had written using his computer and the respondent’s concern about the sexual
nature of the messages and her use of alcohol.  According to the respondent,
the complainant did not want to talk about it and when she got out of the car,
told him it was none of his business and slammed the car door.  The respondent
did not tell his wife or the complainant’s father about his concerns or about
the door-slamming incident.

[8]                             
RCMP officers in Newfoundland became involved in
the investigation in late July 2008.  RCMP Constable Paul Hierlihy reviewed the
initial videotaped statement from Ontario but was not satisfied with the way
the interview had been conducted. He therefore arranged for RCMP Constable Lisa
Norman, who had received training in interviewing child victims of sexual
abuse, to re-interview the complainant in Ontario.  

[9]                             
Cst. Norman testified that the complainant’s initial
statement to Port Elgin police was conducted in the police station, with four
persons present (the interviewing male police officer, a social worker, the
complainant and her mother). In Cst. Norman’s experience, interviewing an
alleged child victim of sexual assault in the presence of her mother is not
always helpful because it is not a topic that children are comfortable talking
about.  She saw no need for the presence of a social worker and noted that
“sometimes it helps talking to a female” officer: A.R., vol. I, at p. 196. She
agreed with Cst. Hierlihy’s assessment that the original statement was vague
and had a lot of “I don’t remembers” and, in her view, there was not a good
rapport between the interviewing officer and the complainant who appeared not
to have been comfortable at that time. 

[10]                         
In November 2008, Cst. Norman conducted her
interview one-on-one with the complainant in a private hotel conference room,
in order to avoid the police station which is sometimes “intimidating”: A.R.,
vol. I, at p. 197. During this interview, the complainant described more incidents
than she had in her initial statement. When Cst. Norman asked her about this,
the complainant told her that she had not felt comfortable with the male
officer and that she had not wanted to talk about it in front of her mother.

[11]                         
At trial, the complainant testified about
several sexual incidents involving the respondent. Her evidence was that one
incident occurred in the respondent’s car, when he placed his hand between the
complainant’s legs and touched her vagina; another in the computer room in the
respondent’s home when he placed his hand on her left breast over her clothing;
and another in the kitchen of the respondent’s home while the respondent’s wife
was present in the room when the respondent touched the complainant’s breast
over her clothing. The complainant also referred to an occasion on which the
respondent had asked her if she was mad at him, and said, “You know I love you
and I wouldn’t do anything to you like that”: A.R., vol. II, at p. 45. But she
could not remember why he had said that.

[12]                         
The respondent testified in his own defence and
denied any sexual activity with the complainant. The respondent’s wife echoed
the respondent’s testimony. The respondent’s brother and nephew testified that
the complainant was quite affectionate towards the respondent, that she seemed
comfortable when she was around him and, generally, that the respondent and the
complainant seemed to enjoy a good relationship.

B.     The Trial Judge’s Instructions to the Jury

[13]                         
The parties agree that the trial judge’s
instructions to the jury were error-free.  She gave the usual instructions with
respect to credibility and truthfulness generally, including the direction that
the jury could believe or disbelieve all or parts of anything a witness said in
the witness box. She specifically addressed the young age of the victim and
instructed the jury that they could consider this factor along with lapse of
time in dealing with minor discrepancies in the complainant’s testimony. She
however specified that lying under oath was serious and could taint the entire
testimony of a witness. The trial judge stressed the fact that this case was
about credibility and noted that there was no other direct evidence supporting
the complainant’s allegations. She gave a thorough summary of the evidence of
the complainant and the respondent and clearly drew the jury’s attention to the
inconsistencies between the complainant’s testimony and that of other witnesses
and her own previous statements.  

[14]                         
The trial judge directed the jury that it was
“essential that the credibility and reliability of [the complainant’s] evidence
be tested in the light of all the other evidence”: A.R., vol. I, at p. 69.  She
reviewed in detail the position of the defence that the complainant was not
telling the truth, referring to several points at which her recollections were
not consistent. The trial judge also noted that the defence theory was that the
complainant lied because she wanted her mother to return to Newfoundland so
that they could live together. She also reviewed in detail the position of the
Crown, noting that the motive to lie alleged by the defence was never put to
the complainant directly and further that her evidence was that she could have
left Newfoundland to live with her mother at any time.

[15]                         
The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both
counts.

C.     The Judgment of the Court of Appeal, 2011 NLCA 59, 312 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 12 (per Barry J.A., Wells
and White JJ.A. Concurring)

[16]                         
The Court of Appeal concluded that the jury’s
verdict was unreasonable, set it aside and acquitted the respondent.  The court
stated that in conducting a review for unreasonableness, “the appellate court
draws its own inference from the evidence admitted at trial as to the reasoning
process of the jury and determines whether this could have been logical or
rational in light of the verdict being reviewed. . . . If no reasonable process
of analysis by a judge could justify conviction in the circumstances of the
case, an appellate court will be justified in concluding a jury must not have
acted judicially in convicting”:  paras. 47 and 52. 

[17]                         
After reviewing the record, the court concluded
that the verdict was unreasonable because “[a]n experienced judge sitting
alone, with the evidence presented in this case, would not be able to provide
adequate reasons to explain how he or she could be convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt in light of the credibility concerns
arising from the unexplained inconsistencies and improbabilities arising from
the complainant’s testimony and statements”: para. 75.

[18]                         
The Court of Appeal was troubled by a number of
inconsistencies in the complainant’s testimony and statements, even taking into
account “all explanations given by her for those inconsistencies”: para. 64.

[19]                         
First, the Court of Appeal was concerned by
inconsistencies regarding the number and nature of the incidents between the
complainant’s trial evidence and her initial disclosure. The complainant
described only a single and different incident to her mother, father and to the
male police officer when she first came forward. As noted earlier, when the
complainant later spoke to a female police officer, she described more
incidents as she did at trial. The court noted that the complainant said that
she felt more comfortable speaking alone to the female RCMP constable and
wanted to avoid the embarrassment of speaking in the presence of her mother. 
However, the court reasoned that “[d]iscomfort and embarrassment may help
explain omitted incidents [but] they do not adequately explain her express
denial that any other incidents had occurred”: para. 66. The court was also
concerned that the complainant “contradicted herself somewhat in her
explanation in that at the preliminary inquiry she had said her memory had
improved between the first and second police interviews while at trial she said
she had deliberately decided not to discuss all incidents”: para. 66.

[20]                         
A second matter referred to by the Court of
Appeal as creating a “serious concern about [the complainant’s] truthfulness
overall” (para. 67) was this: the complainant told the male police officer at
the initial interview that the only incident happened in the respondent’s home
and nowhere else. But she testified at trial that the most serious incident
happened in the respondent’s vehicle. She explained this inconsistency by
saying that she felt discomfort speaking to a male police officer in her
mother’s presence. With regard to the complainant’s explanation of this
inconsistency, the Court of Appeal indicated that “discomfort would go somewhat
towards explaining omissions but does not adequately explain her express denial
of other locations”: para. 67.

[21]                         
A further point which troubled the Court of
Appeal was the fact that in her initial statement to the male police officer, the
complainant had said that the respondent had been alone in the house when she
had been assaulted, while she later said that the respondent’s wife had been
present on one occasion in the same room and that the respondent’s wife and the
complainant’s father had been present on another occasion in a different room
but within hearing range.  This unexplained discrepancy left the Court of
Appeal with “an additional question regarding her credibility”: para. 68.

[22]                         
The Court of Appeal also found that various
inconsistencies regarding the complainant’s nervousness about being alone
around the respondent raised “significant concerns about her credibility”:
para. 71. These included: the complainant’s father’s denial of the
complainant’s testimony that she had told him she did not want to go to her uncle’s
home; the complainant’s willingness to continue having interactions with the
respondent even after the incidents; and the fact that the complainant declared
at the preliminary inquiry that she was not afraid to be alone with her uncle in
his car yet she had told police in a prior statement that she was “frightened
to death” to drive alone with him: para. 70. 

[23]                         
In the Court of Appeal’s view, the complainant’s
inability to give any detail regarding the nature of the other incident which
she vaguely recalled added “some slight additional doubt regarding her
credibility”: para. 73.

[24]                         
The Court of Appeal concluded that by virtue of
these “unexplained inconsistencies and improbabilities alone, the credibility
of the complainant was damaged to the extent that it is questionable whether a
jury acting judicially could reasonably have convicted”: para. 74. The court
noted that in addition, a jury acting judicially has to consider the
complainant’s testimony in the context of the respondent’s denial of all her allegations.
 In the court’s view, “[n]othing appears from the transcript which should have
caused a juror to question his truthfulness”: para. 74. In light of the
complainant’s testimony and the apparently plausible denial of the accused, the
court was of the view that no experienced judge sitting alone would have been
able to provide adequate reasons for the guilty verdict. The Court of Appeal
concluded that the jury could not have been acting judicially in reaching a
guilty verdict and that the verdict was therefore unreasonable. 

III.    Analysis

A.     The Scope of Review for “Unreasonableness” of a Jury
Verdict: Basic Principles

[25]                         
A person convicted of an indictable offence has
broad avenues of appeal.  There is a right of appeal on any question of law
alone and an appeal by leave of the court on questions of fact or mixed law and
fact or on “any ground of appeal . . . that appears to the court of appeal to
be a sufficient ground of appeal”: Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 ,
s. 675(1) (a). However, as broad as the access to appellate review is, a
court of appeal may only overturn a conviction on three grounds: that the
verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence, that there was
an error of law at trial or that there was a miscarriage of justice: s. 686(1)(a)
of the Code.  This appeal concerns only the first of these grounds (s.
686(1) (a)(i)).

[26]                         
A verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported
by the evidence if it is one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially
could not reasonably have rendered: R. v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168, at
p. 185; R. v. Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, at para. 36. 
While the same test was traditionally applied to verdicts by both juries and
trial judges, the more recent jurisprudence from the Court has expanded
somewhat the scope of review for unreasonableness in the case of verdicts
reached by trial judges: R. v. Beaudry, 2007 SCC 5, [2007] 1
S.C.R. 190;  R. v. Sinclair, 2011 SCC 40, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 3. This
development recognizes a practical distinction between reasonableness review of
a trial judge’s verdict and of a jury verdict: judges, unlike juries, give
reasons for their findings which the appellate court may review and consider as
part of its reasonableness analysis.  However, this expanded reasonableness
review of verdicts entered by trial judges does not apply to
reasonableness review of a jury verdict. 

[27]                         
Appellate review of a jury’s verdict of guilt
must be conducted within two well-established boundaries. On one hand, the
reviewing court must give due weight to the advantages of the jury as the trier
of fact who was present throughout the trial and saw and heard the evidence as
it unfolded. The reviewing court must not act as a “13th juror” or simply give
effect to vague unease or lurking doubt based on its own review of the written
record or find that a verdict is unreasonable simply because the reviewing
court has a reasonable doubt based on its review of the record.

[28]                         
On the other hand, however, the review cannot be
limited to assessing the sufficiency of the evidence. A positive answer to the
question of whether there is some evidence which, if believed, supports the
conviction does not exhaust the role of the reviewing court.  Rather, the court
is required “to review, analyse and, within the limits of appellate
disadvantage, weigh the evidence” (Biniaris, at para. 36) and
consider through the lens of judicial experience, whether “judicial
fact-finding precludes the conclusion reached by the jury”: para.
39 (emphasis added). Thus, in deciding whether the verdict is one which a
properly instructed jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered, the
reviewing court must ask not only whether there is evidence in the record to
support the verdict, but also whether the jury’s conclusion conflicts with the
bulk of judicial experience:  Biniaris, at para. 40.

[29]                         
While it is not possible to catalogue
exhaustively the sorts of cases in which accumulated judicial experience may
suggest that a jury’s verdict is unreasonable, a number of examples may be
offered.  Circumstances in which a special caution to the jury is
necessary about a certain witness or a certain type of evidence are reflective
of accumulated judicial experience and may well factor into an appellate
court’s review for reasonableness.  Some examples include the evidence of
jailhouse informants and accomplices, and eyewitness identification evidence. 
Other circumstances that generally do not require, as a matter of law, any
particular warning to the jury may nonetheless, in light of
accumulated judicial experience, contribute to a conclusion of an unreasonable
verdict, for example the risks of accepting bizarre allegations of a sexual
nature and the risk of prejudice in relation to psychiatric defences:  Biniaris,
at para. 41. What all of these examples have in common is that accumulated
judicial experience has demonstrated that they constitute an explicit and
precise circumstance that creates a risk of an unjust conviction. 

B.     Unreasonable Verdicts and Credibility Assessment

[30]                         
The traditional test for unreasonable verdict
applies to cases such as this one in which the verdict is based on an
assessment of witness credibility.  This was affirmed, in the context of a
judge-alone trial, in R. v. W. (R.), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, at p. 131.
However, in applying the test, the court of appeal must show great deference to
the trier of fact’s assessment of witness credibility given the advantage it
has in seeing and hearing the witnesses’ evidence: W. (R.), at p. 131. 

[31]                         
This point was underlined in R. v. C. (R.),
[1993] 2 S.C.R. 226, also a judge-alone case, in which the Court approved the
dissenting reasons of Rothman J.A. in the Court of Appeal: (1992), 49 Q.A.C.
37.  Rothman J.A. noted, at para. 16:

Credibility
is, of course, a question of fact and it cannot be determined by fixed rules.
Ultimately, it is a matter that must be left to the common sense of the trier
of fact . . . .

[32]                         
This counsel of caution applies with particular
force to verdicts reached by juries. In R. v. François, [1994] 2 S.C.R.
827, McLachlin J. (as she then was) reiterated that the general rule enunciated
in Yebes “also applies to cases where the objection
to the conviction is based on credibility — where it is suggested that
testimony which the jury must have believed to render its verdict is so
incredible that a verdict founded upon it must be unreasonable”: pp. 835-36. 
There are a number of points in François that are particularly relevant
to this case:

1.         It is for the jury to decide, notwithstanding
difficulties with a witness’s evidence, how much, if any, of the testimony it
accepts. As McLachlin J. put it, at p. 836: 

More problematic is a challenge to
credibility based on the witness’s alleged lack of truthfulness and sincerity,
the problem posed in this appeal.  The reasoning here is that the witness may
not have been telling the truth for a variety of reasons, whether because of
inconsistencies in the witness’s stories at different times, because certain
facts may have been suggested to her, or because she may have had reason to
concoct her accusations.  In the end, the jury must decide whether, despite
such factors, it believes the witness’s story, in whole or in part.  

2.         Credibility assessment does not depend solely on
objective considerations such as inconsistencies or motives for concoction.  As
McLachlin J. said in François, at pp. 836-37:

[Credibility] turns not only upon such
factors as the assessment of the significance of any alleged inconsistencies or
motives for concoction, which may be susceptible of reasoned review by a court
of appeal, but on the demeanour of the witness and the common sense of the
jury, which cannot be assessed by the court of appeal.  The latter
domain is the “advantage” possessed by the trier of fact, be it judge or jury,
which the court of appeal does not possess and which the court of appeal must
bear in mind in deciding whether the verdict is unreasonable: R. v. W.
(R.), supra. [Emphasis added.]

3.         The jury is entitled to decide how much weight to give to
factors such as inconsistency and motive to concoct. Particularly where the
complainant offers an explanation for inconsistencies, the jury may reasonably
conclude that those inconsistencies lose “their power to raise a reasonable
doubt with respect to the accused’s guilt”: François, at p. 839. Again
in François, at p. 837, the Court said this: 

In
considering the reasonableness of the jury’s verdict, the court of appeal must
also keep in mind the fact that the jury may reasonably and lawfully deal
with inconsistencies and motive to concoct, in a variety of ways.  The jury
may reject the witness’s evidence in its entirety.  Or the jury may accept the
witness’s explanations for the apparent inconsistencies and the witness’s
denial that her testimony was provoked by improper pressures or from improper
motives.  Finally, the jury may accept some of the witness’s evidence while
rejecting other parts of it; juries are routinely charged that they may accept
all of the evidence, some of the evidence, or none of the evidence of each
witness.  It follows that we cannot infer from the mere presence of
contradictory details or motives to concoct that the jury’s verdict is
unreasonable.  A verdict of guilty based on such evidence may very well be both
reasonable and lawful. [Emphasis added.]

4.         To sum up, the reviewing court must be deferential to the
collective good judgment and common sense of the jury. As stated in François,
“the court of appeal reviewing for unreasonableness must keep in mind . . .
that the jury may bring to the difficult business of determining where the
truth lies special qualities which appellate courts may not share”: p. 837. 

[33]                         
R. v. Burke,
[1996] 1 S.C.R. 474, and R. v. R.P., 2012 SCC 22, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 746,
while judge-alone cases, further underline the great deference which must be
shown by the appellate court to the trial court’s assessment of credibility. In
the latter case, Deschamps J., for the majority, reiterated the applicable
principle as follows:

Whereas the
question whether a verdict is reasonable is one of law, whether a witness is
credible is a question of fact.  A court of appeal that reviews a trial
court’s assessments of credibility in order to determine, for example, whether
the verdict is reasonable cannot interfere with those assessments unless it is
established that they “cannot be supported on any reasonable view of the
evidence” (R. v. Burke, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 474, at para. 7). [Emphasis
added; para. 10.]

[34]                         
Perhaps the most useful articulations of the
test for present purposes are those found in Biniaris and Burke. 
In the former case, Arbour J. put it this way: “. . . the unreasonableness . .
. of the verdict would be apparent to the legally trained reviewer when, in all
the circumstances of a given case, judicial fact-finding precludes the
conclusion reached by the jury”: para. 39 (emphasis added). In the latter,
Sopinka J. concluded that a verdict based on credibility assessment is
unreasonable if “the trial court’s assessments of credibility cannot be
supported on any reasonable view of the evidence”: para. 7
(emphasis added). While appellate review for unreasonableness of guilty
verdicts is a powerful safeguard against wrongful convictions, it is also one
that must be exercised with great deference to the fact-finding role of the
jury.  Trial by jury must not become trial by appellate court on the written
record.

C.     Application to the Facts of This Case 

[35]                         
In my respectful view, the Court of Appeal in
this case applied the wrong legal test and, in carrying out its review of the
jury’s verdict, failed to give sufficient deference to the jury’s assessment of
witness credibility.

[36]                         
To turn first to the legal test, the Court of
Appeal fashioned a new approach to its task by drawing on the law relating to
the sufficiency of a trial judge’s reasons for conviction.  Noting that in a
judge-alone trial the trial judge must provide reasons which are responsive to
the case’s live issues and the parties’ key arguments, the Court of Appeal then
stated: 

A court of
appeal, in reviewing the reasonableness of a jury’s decision, must consider
what would be entailed in the process of analysis by a judge to merit the
conclusion that the judge acted judicially.  If no reasonable process of
analysis by a judge could justify conviction in the circumstances of the case,
an appellate court will be justified in concluding a jury must not have acted
judicially in convicting. [para. 52]

[37]                         
Respectfully, this test is wrong in law and in
principle.

[38]                         
As outlined earlier, the test to be applied by
courts of appeal in reviewing guilty verdicts for unreasonableness is clear and
well settled.  It does not involve the reviewing court attempting to put itself
in the place of an imaginary trial judge and on a review of the written record
asking whether that imaginary judge could have articulated legally adequate
reasons for conviction. Not only is this approach contrary to binding
authority, it is also, as I see it, fundamentally flawed. 

[39]                         
One of the main drivers of the great deference
paid to the jury’s findings of credibility is that the jurors were present at
the trial and saw and heard the evidence as it unfolded. The jury’s reasoning
as to what evidence it accepted and what evidence it did not accept may well be
tied directly to factors flowing from that advantage.  Moreover, the
jurisprudence on the sufficiency of reasons recognizes that it is often
difficult if not impossible to articulate with precision the various factors
that influence an ultimate judgment about a witness’s credibility. As McLachlin
C.J. noted in R. v. R.E.M., 2008 SCC 51, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3, at paras.
48-49, referring with approval to the reasons of Bastarache and Abella JJ. in R.
v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 621:

. . . it may be difficult for
a trial judge “to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of
impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and
attempting to reconcile the various versions of events” . . . .

 

. .
. the fact remains that the exercise may not be purely intellectual and may
involve factors that are difficult to verbalize. . . . In short, assessing
credibility is a difficult and delicate matter that does not always lend itself
to precise and complete verbalization.

[40]                         
The Court of Appeal’s test, respectfully, fails
to give any weight to these considerations. It is premised on trying, on the
basis only of the written record, to fashion an explanation for the jury’s
decision.  But that exercise ignores both the inherent difficulty of the
exercise and the main basis for deference to the jury’s assessment of witness
credibility. The advantage of having heard and seen the evidence, while
afforded to the jury, is not afforded to the appellate court in trying to
reconstruct its reasoning on the basis of the written record. 

[41]                         
As the Court stated in François, where it
is suggested that a witness is not telling the truth because of
inconsistencies, because facts may have been suggested to him or her by others
or because he or she may have reason to concoct the accusations, the jury must
in the end decide whether it believes the witness’s story in whole or in part. 
“Th[e] determination turns not only upon such factors as the assessment of the
significance of any alleged inconsistencies or motives for concoction, which
may be susceptible of reasoned review by a court of appeal, but on the demeanour
of the witness and the common sense of the jury, which cannot be assessed by
the court of appeal”: pp. 836-37.

[42]                         
The Court of Appeal’s adoption of this new test
resulted in its failure to take a sufficiently deferential approach to the
findings of the jury viewed, as they must be, in the context of the whole of
the evidence. 

[43]                         
The Court of Appeal’s treatment of the
complainant’s statement to the Port Elgin police will serve as a first example.
Of great concern to the Court of Appeal was the inconsistency between the
complainant’s initial statement and her subsequent statements and testimonies.
Four of the five inconsistencies which the Court of Appeal found to raise
serious questions about the complainant’s credibility are grounded in whole or
in substantial part in that initial statement: the inconsistencies regarding
the number and nature of incidents, the location, who was present and whether
the complainant was nervous about being alone with the respondent. It seems to
me, however, that there are two problems with the Court of Appeal’s approach.

[44]                         
The first is that the court overlooked
potentially significant parts of the evidence about why that initial statement
was not satisfactory. While the court noted that the RCMP was not satisfied
with how the first interview had been conducted, it did not refer to the trial
evidence about why that was the case. As I outlined earlier, the trial evidence
raised a number of specific concerns about the way the first interview had been
conducted: the potentially intimidating police station setting, the use of a
male interviewing officer, the number of persons present, the presence of the
complainant’s mother, the lack of rapport between the interviewing officer and
the complainant and the complainant’s discomfort during the interview. It would
not have been unreasonable for the jury, on the basis of this evidence, to
decide to attach little value to the initial statement by virtue of the
conditions under which it was taken.  If the jury reached that conclusion it
would of course give little weight to any inconsistencies between that initial
statement and the complainant’s later statements and testimonies.

[45]                         
The second difficulty, in my respectful view, is
that the Court of Appeal, in discounting the complainant’s explanation for
these inconsistencies, engaged in speculative reasoning that has no basis in
judicial experience.  The court referred to the complainant’s explanation that
she had been uncomfortable speaking to the male police officer and embarrassed
to discuss these matters in her mother’s presence. The court reasoned, however,
that while discomfort and embarrassment may help explain omitted incidents,
“they do not adequately explain her express denial that any other incidents had
occurred”: para. 66.  Similarly, with respect to the location of one of the
incidents, the court again concluded that while discomfort in the initial
interview would go somewhat towards explaining omissions, it “does not
adequately explain her express denial of other locations”: para. 67.  

[46]                         
Respectfully, I am not aware of any basis in
fact or judicial experience supporting the view that a witness’s discomfort and
embarrassment during an interview may explain some types of inconsistencies but
not others.  Rather, in my view, it was open to the jury to accept the
complainant’s explanation in whole or in part.

[47]                         
The Court of Appeal also wrongly substituted its
views for those of the jury in other respects.  The court simply re-applied, on
the basis of its review of the written record, the test in R. v. W. (D.),
[1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, for assessing reasonable doubt in light of the
respondent’s testimony. It found the respondent’s denial to be plausible
because there was nothing in the transcript to cause it to be questioned and
because the prosecutor could point to nothing remarkable about the respondent’s
demeanour. Respectfully, this reasoning ignores the disadvantages of an
appellate court in relation to these sorts of findings and undermines the
jury’s unique position and special role in assessing witness credibility.

[48]                         
Respectfully, the Court of Appeal, while rightly
conscious of its responsibility to conduct a thorough review of the record,
erred by applying the wrong legal test in carrying out that review. It further
erred by failing to take a sufficiently deferential stance in relation to the
credibility findings made by the jury.

presided over the appellant’s trial gave, in response to a specific question
from the jury on being an accessory and being a party to an offence, additional
instructions that were incomplete and confusing.  Moreover, although we need
not rule on this issue for the purposes of this appeal, the nature of the
charges against the appellant raises the question whether it would be possible
to base a conviction for first degree murder under s. 231(5)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , on the accused being a party to the offence
within the meaning of s. 21(2) . For these reasons, the appeal is allowed, the verdict
of guilty is set aside, and the Court orders that a new trial be held in
respect of the same charges.

on appeal from the ontario superior court of justice

                    Criminal
law — Interception of communications — General warrant — Telecommunications
company employing unique process for transmitting text messages resulting in
messages stored on their computer database for brief period of time — General
warrant requiring telecommunications company to produce all text messages sent
and received by two subscribers on prospective, daily basis — Whether general
warrant power in s. 487.01 of Criminal Code can authorize prospective
production of future text messages from service provider’s computer — Whether
investigative technique authorized by general warrant in this case is an interception
requiring authorization under Part VI of Criminal Code — Whether general
warrant may properly issue where substance of investigative technique, if not
its precise form, is addressed by existing legislative provision — Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 487.01 .

                    Unlike
most telecommunications service providers, TELUS Communications Company
routinely makes electronic copies of all the text messages sent or received by
its subscribers and stores them on a computer database for a brief period of
time.  The police in this case obtained a general warrant and related
assistance order under ss. 487.01  and 487.02  of the Criminal Code  requiring
Telus to provide the police with copies of any stored text messages sent or
received by two Telus subscribers.  The relevant part of the warrant required
Telus to produce any messages sent or received during a two‑week period
on a daily basis.  Telus applied to quash the general warrant arguing that the
prospective, daily acquisition of text messages from their computer database
constitutes an interception of private communications and therefore requires
authorization under the wiretap authorization provisions in Part VI of the
Code.  The application was dismissed.  The focus of the appeal is on
whether the general warrant power can authorize the prospective production of
future text messages from a service provider’s computer.

                    Held
(McLachlin C.J. and Cromwell J.
dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed and the general warrant and related
assistance order should be quashed.

                    Per
LeBel, Fish and Abella JJ.:  Part VI of the Criminal Code  provides
a comprehensive scheme for “wiretap authorizations” for the interception of
private communications.  The purpose of Part VI is to restrict the ability
of the police to obtain and disclose private communications.

                    Telus
employs a unique process for transmitting text messages that results in the
messages being stored on their computer database for a brief period of time. 
In considering whether the prospective, daily production of future text
messages stored in Telus’ computer falls within Part VI, we must take the
overall objective of Part VI into account.  

                    Text
messaging is, in essence, an electronic conversation.  Technical
differences inherent in new technology should not determine the scope of
protection afforded to private communications.  The only practical difference
between text messaging and traditional voice communications is the transmission
process.  This distinction should not take text messages outside the protection
to which private communications are entitled under Part VI.  

                    Section 487.01
of the Code, the general warrant provision, was enacted in 1993 as part
of a series of amendments to the Code in Bill C‑109, S.C. 1993,
c. 40.  It authorizes a judge to issue a general warrant permitting
a peace officer to “use any device or investigative technique or procedure or
do any thing described in the warrant that would, if not authorized, constitute
an unreasonable search or seizure”.  Notably, s. 487.01(1)(c)
stipulates that the general warrant power is residual and resort to it
is precluded where judicial approval for the proposed technique, procedure or
device or the “doing of the thing” is available under the Code or
another federal statute.  

                    Section
487.01(1)(c) should be broadly construed to ensure that the general
warrant is not used presumptively to prevent the circumvention of the more
specific or rigorous pre‑authorization requirements for warrants, such as
those found in Part VI.  To decide whether s. 487.01(1)(c)
applies, namely, whether another provision would provide for the authorization
sought in this case, requires interpreting the word “intercept” in Part VI.
 “Intercept” is used throughout Part VI with reference to the intercept of
private communications.  This means that in interpreting “intercept a
private communication”, we must consider the broad scope of Part VI and
its application across a number of technological platforms, as well as its
objective of protecting individual privacy interests in communications by
imposing particularly rigorous safeguards.  The interpretation should not be
dictated by the technology used to transmit such communications, like the
computer used in this case, but by what was intended to be protected under
Part VI.  It should also be informed by the rights enshrined in s. 8
of the Charter, which in turn must remain aligned with technological
developments.  

                    A
technical approach to “intercept” would essentially render Part VI
irrelevant to the protection of the right to privacy in new, electronic and
text‑based communications technologies, which generate and store copies
of private communications as part of the transmission process.  A narrow
definition is also inconsistent with the language and purpose of Part VI
in offering broad protection for private communications from unauthorized
interference by the state. 

                    The
interpretation of “intercept a private communication” must, therefore, focus on
the acquisition of informational content and the individual’s expectation of
privacy at the time the communication was made.  To the extent that there may
be any temporal element inherent in the technical meaning of intercept, it
should not trump Parliament’s intention in Part VI to protect an
individual’s right to privacy in his or her communications.  The use of the
word “intercept” implies that the private communication is acquired in the
course of the communication process.  The process encompasses all activities of
the service provider which are required for, or incidental to, the provision of
the communications service.  Acquiring the substance of a private communication
from a computer maintained by a telecommunications service provider would, as a
result, be included in that process.  

                    Text
messages are private communications and, even if they are stored on a service
provider’s computer, their prospective production requires authorization under Part VI
of the Code.  If Telus did not maintain its computer database, there is
no doubt that the police would be required to obtain an authorization under Part VI
to secure the prospective, and in this case continuous, production of text
messages.  Most service providers do not routinely copy text messages to a
computer database as part of their transmission service.  Accordingly, if the
police wanted to target an individual who used a different service provider,
they would have no option but to obtain wiretap authorizations under Part VI
to compel the prospective and continuous production of their text messages. 
This creates a manifest unfairness to individuals who are unlikely to realize
that their choice of telecommunications service provider can dramatically
affect their privacy.  The technical differences inherent in Telus’
transmission of text messages should not deprive Telus subscribers of the
protection of the Code that every other Canadian is entitled to. 

                    The
general warrant in this case was invalid because the police had failed to
satisfy the requirement under s. 487.01(1)(c) of the Code that
a general warrant could not be issued if another provision in the Code is
available to authorize the technique used by police.  Since the warrant
purports to authorize the interception of private communications, and since Part VI
is the scheme that authorizes the interception of private communications, a
general warrant was not available.  

                    Per Moldaver and Karakatsanis JJ.:  There is agreement with Abella J.
that the police are entitled to a general warrant only where they can show that “no other provision” of the Criminal
Code  or any other Act of Parliament would provide for the investigative
technique, including a substantively equivalent technique, for which
authorization is sought.  The investigative technique in this case was
substantively equivalent to an intercept.  The general
warrant is thus invalid.  Resolution of whether what occurred in this
case was or was not, strictly speaking, an “intercept” within the meaning of s. 183 of the Code is unnecessary.  A narrower
decision guards against unforeseen and potentially far‑reaching
consequences in this complex area of the law.

                    The
result is driven by the failure of the authorities to establish the requirement
in s. 487.01(1)(c) that there be “no other provision” that would
provide for the search.  This provision ensures that the general warrant is
used sparingly as a warrant of limited resort.  In creating the general
warrant, Parliament did not erase every other search authorization from the Code
and leave it to judges to devise general warrants on an ad hoc basis as
they deem fit.  Courts must therefore be careful to fill a legislative lacuna
only where Parliament has actually failed to anticipate a particular search
authorization.  The “no other provision” requirement must be interpreted so as
to afford the police the flexibility Parliament contemplated in creating the
general warrant, while safeguarding against its misuse.  There is a need for
heightened judicial scrutiny where Parliament has provided an authorization for
an investigative technique that is substantively equivalent to what the police
seek but requires more onerous preconditions.  Thus, the test under s. 487.01(1)(c)
must consider the investigative technique that the police seek to utilize with
an eye to its actual substance and not merely its formal trappings. 

                    The
approach to the “no other provision” requirement accepts a measure of
uncertainty by tasking judges with the job of inquiring into the substance of
purportedly “new” investigative techniques.  When uncertainty exists, the
police would do well to err on the side of caution.  General warrants may not
be used as a means to circumvent other authorization provisions that are
available but contain more onerous preconditions.  Judges faced with an
application where the investigative technique, though not identical, comes
close in substance to an investigative technique covered by another provision
for which more rigorous standards apply should therefore proceed with extra
caution.  Where careful scrutiny establishes that a proposed investigative
technique, although similar, has substantive differences from an existing
technique, judges may grant the general warrant, mindful of their obligation
under s. 487.01(3) to impose terms and conditions that reflect the nature
of the privacy interest at stake. 

                    A
literal construction of s. 487.01(1)(c) must be rejected.  Such an
approach strips the provision of any meaning and renders it all but valueless. 
Legislative history confirms that general warrants were to play a modest role,
affording the police a constitutionally sound path for investigative techniques
that Parliament has not addressed.  Ensuring that general warrants are confined
to their limited role is the true purpose of s. 487.01(1)(c). 
While the “best interest” requirement in s. 487.01(1)(b) serves to
prevent misuse of the general warrant, this provision should not be interpreted
as swallowing the distinct analytical question that the “no other provision”
test asks.  A purposive approach to s. 487.01(1)(c) has nothing to
do with investigative necessity.  Under the “no other provision” test, the
police are not asked to show why an alternative authorization would not work on
the facts of a particular case, but rather why it is substantively different
from what Parliament has already provided.  

                    In
this case, the general warrant is invalid because the investigative technique
it authorized was substantively equivalent to an intercept.  What the police
did — securing prospective authorization for the delivery of future private
communications on a continual, if not continuous, basis over a sustained period
of time — was substantively equivalent to what they would have done pursuant to
a Part VI authorization.  It was thus, at a minimum, tantamount to an
intercept.  Though there is no evidence to suggest that the police acted
other than in good faith, the police failed to meet their burden to show that
the impugned technique was substantively different from an intercept.  On the facts here, the general warrant served only to provide a
means to avoid the rigours of Part VI.  The police could and should have
sought a Part VI authorization.

                    Per McLachlin C.J. and Cromwell J. (dissenting):  The
question of whether what the police did under this general warrant is an interception
of a private communication is one of statutory interpretation.  When the text
of the statutory provisions is read in its full context, it is clear that the
general warrant does not authorize an interception that requires a Part VI
authorization.  While there is no doubt that the text message is a private
communication and that text messages here were intercepted by Telus by means of
an electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device, the police in this
case, did not intercept those messages when Telus turned over to them copies of
sent and received messages previously intercepted by Telus and stored in its
databases.  Therefore, the investigative technique authorized by the general
warrant in this case was not an interception of private communication.  

                    Fundamental
to both the purpose and to the scheme of the wiretap provisions is the
distinction between the interception of private communications and the
disclosure, use or retention of private communications that have been
intercepted. The purpose, text and scheme of Part VI show that the
disclosure, use or retention of intercepted private communications is distinct
from the act of interception itself.  That is, if disclosure or use of a
private communication were an interception of it, there would be no need to
create the distinct disclosure or use offence.  Similarly, the exemptions from
criminal liability show that Parliament distinguished between interception on
one hand and retention, use and disclosure on the other.

                    In
this case, it is not disputed that Telus was intercepting text messages when it
copied them for its own systems administration purposes.  However, it is also
agreed that Telus lawfully intercepted private communications.  Under the
general warrant, the police sought disclosure from Telus of information that it
had already lawfully intercepted.  The general warrant did not require Telus to
intercept communications, but to provide copies of communications that it had
previously intercepted for its own lawful purposes.  As the scheme of the
legislation makes clear, disclosure or use of a lawfully intercepted
communication is not an interception.  It is inconsistent with the fundamental
distinction made by the legislation to conclude that the police were
intercepting private communications when Telus provided them with copies of
previously intercepted and stored text messages.  The distinction in the
statute between interception and disclosure cannot be dismissed as a mere
“technical difference”.  The distinction is fundamental to the scheme of the
provisions.  When Telus turns over to the police the copies of the
communications that it has previously intercepted, Telus is disclosing the
communications, not intercepting them again.  This disclosure by Telus from its
databases cannot be an interception by the police.

                    Acquiring
the content of a previously intercepted and stored communication cannot be an
interception because that broad reading is inconsistent with the clear
distinction between interception and disclosure in the provisions.  Applied
broadly, this interpretation of “acquire” would extend the scope of
investigative techniques which require wiretap authorizations far beyond
anything ever previously contemplated.  Further, introducing a temporal aspect
of interception would confuse the act of interception with the nature of its
authorization.  Interception is a technique, a way of acquiring the substance
of a private communication.  It could not be that exactly the same technique,
which acquires information in exactly the same form, may be either a seizure of
stored material or an interception, depending on the point in time at which the
technique is authorized.

                    The
general warrant is not one of limited resort that should be used sparingly.  On
the contrary, as numerous authorities have acknowledged, the provision is cast
in wide terms.  Therefore, it is not accepted as an imperative that s. 487.01 
must be interpreted with a view to heavily restricting its use.  The focus of
the inquiry is on two matters (in addition of course to reasonable grounds to
believe that an offence has been committed and that information concerning the
offence will be obtained): Is authorization for the “technique, procedure or
device to be used or the thing to be done” provided for in any other federal
statute, and is it in the best interests of the administration of justice to
authorize it to be done?  Section 487.01(1)(c) provides that a
general warrant may issue if “there is no other provision . . . that
would provide for a warrant, authorization or order permitting the technique,
procedure or device to be used or the thing to be done”.  The words
“technique”, “procedure”, “device to be used” and “thing to be done” all are
concerned with what the police want to do, not why they want to
do it.  This paragraph does not require issuing judges to consider whether
other techniques are similar or allow access to the same evidence; it simply
asks if the same technique can be authorized by another provision.  This
is not simply a narrow, literal interpretation of s. 487.01 .  Rather, it
is an interpretation that reflects its purpose of conferring a broad judicial
discretion to authorize the police to “use any device or investigative
technique or procedure or do any thing”, provided of course that the
judge is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the administration of
justice to do so, having due regard to the importance of the constitutional
right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures.  However, courts should
not authorize anything the police seek to do simply because it is not
authorized elsewhere.  The judicial discretion to issue the warrant must give
full effect to the protection of reasonable expectations of privacy as set out
under s. 8 of the Charter.  

                    There
is no support in the text or the purpose of s. 487.01(1)(c), or in
the jurisprudence, for building into it a “substantive equivalency” test.  The
paragraph asks a simple question:  Does federal legislation provide for “a
warrant, authorization or order permitting the technique, procedure or device
to be used or the thing to be done”?  Where this threshold is met, the judge is
entitled to consider granting the requested authorization.  The further
question of whether the authorization ought to be granted is not the
focus of this paragraph of the section. Rather, whether a general warrant ought
to issue is properly considered under s. 487.01(1)(b), which asks
whether authorizing the warrant would be in the best interests of the administration
of justice.  This approach is not only supported by the text, purpose and
jurisprudence, but by the application of a “substantive equivalency” test
creates unnecessary uncertainty and distracts the issuing judge from the
question of whether the technique sought to be authorized is inconsistent with
the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.  Predictability
and clarity in the law are particularly important in the area of judicial
pre-authorization of searches.  The primary objective of pre-authorization is
not to identify unreasonable searches after the fact, but to ensure that
unreasonable searches are not conducted.  The requirements for
pre-authorization should be as clear as possible to ensure that Charter
rights are fully protected. 

                    The
technique sought to be authorized here is not the substantive equivalent of a
wiretap authorization.  On the facts of this case, a wiretap authorization
alone would not allow the police to obtain the information that Telus was
required to provide under the general warrant.  Three separate authorizations
would be required in order to provide the police with the means to access the
information provided to them under the general warrant.  Therefore, even if one
were to accept reading into s. 487.01(1)(c) a “substantive
equivalency” test, neither the facts nor the law would support its application
in this case.

                    The
police did not seek a general warrant in this case as a way to avoid the
rigours of Part VI.  The general warrant achieved the legitimate aims of
the police investigation in a much more convenient and cost-effective manner
than any other provision would have allowed.  There is no evidence of “misuse”
of s. 487.01 .  The effective and practical police investigation by a
relatively small municipal police force was fully respectful of the privacy
interests of the targets of the investigation and other Telus subscribers.

                    The
judgment of LeBel, Fish and Abella JJ. was delivered by

[1]                             
Abella J. — For many Canadians, text messaging has
become an increasingly popular form of communication.  Despite technological
differences, text messaging bears several hallmarks of traditional voice
communication: it is intended to be conversational, transmission is generally
instantaneous, and there is an expectation of privacy in the communication. 
The issue in this appeal is the proper procedure under the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , for authorizing the prospective daily production of these
messages from a computer database maintained by a telecommunications service
provider.

[2]                             
The service provider in this case is TELUS
Communications Company.  It urges this Court to find that the prospective,
daily acquisition of text messages from their computer database constitutes an
interception of private communications and therefore requires authorization
under Part VI of the Code, a comprehensive scheme for “wiretap
authorizations” for the interception of private communications.  The
Crown, on the other hand, contends that the retrieval of messages from a
computer maintained by a service provider does not fall within the scope of
Part VI because the production of messages in computer storage does not amount
to an “interception”, and that the police are therefore permitted to use the
general warrant power in s. 487.01 of the Code to get copies of the text
messages.  

[3]                             
Part VI of the Code provides a scheme to
protect private communications.  Telus employs a unique process for
transmitting text messages that results in the messages being stored on their
computer database for a brief period of time.  The question in this appeal is
whether the technical differences inherent in Telus’ transmission of text
messages should deprive Telus subscribers of the protection of the Code that
every other Canadian is entitled to. 

[4]                             
The focus of this appeal therefore turns on the
interpretation of “intercept” within Part VI.  “Intercept” is used throughout
Part VI with reference to the intercept of private communications.  This
means that in interpreting “intercept a private communication”, we must
consider the broad scope of Part VI and its application across a number of
technological platforms, as well as its objective of protecting individual
privacy interests in communications by imposing particularly rigorous
safeguards.  The interpretation should not be dictated by the technology used
to transmit such communications, like the computer used in this case, but by
what was intended to be protected under Part VI.  

[5]                             
Text messaging is, in essence, an electronic
conversation.  The only practical difference between
text messaging and the traditional voice communications is the transmission
process.  This distinction should not take text messages outside the protection
of private communications to which they are entitled in Part VI.  Technical
differences inherent in new technology should not determine the scope of
protection afforded to private communications.

Background 

[6]                             
When Telus subscribers send a text message, the
transmission of that message takes place in the following sequence.  It is
first transmitted to the nearest cell tower, then to Telus’ transmission
infrastructure, then to the cell tower nearest to the recipient, and finally to
the recipient’s phone.  If the recipient’s phone is turned off or is out of
range of a cell tower, the text message will temporarily pause in Telus’
transmission infrastructure for up to five days.  After five days, Telus stops
trying to deliver the message and deletes it without notifying the sender.  

[7]                             
Unlike most telecommunications service
providers, Telus routinely makes electronic copies of all the text messages
sent or received by its subscribers and stores them on a computer database for
a period of 30 days.  Text messages that are sent by a Telus subscriber are
copied to the computer database during the transmission process at the point in
time when the text message enters Telus’ transmission infrastructure.  Text
messages received by a Telus subscriber are copied to the computer database
when the Telus subscriber’s phone receives the message.  In many instances,
this system results in text messages being copied to the computer database
before the recipient’s phone has received the text message and/or before the
intended recipient has read the text message.  

[8]                             
On March 27, 2010, the Owen Sound Police Service
obtained a general warrant under s. 487.01  and related assistance order under
s. 487.02 of the Code.  The warrant named two Telus wireless subscribers
and required Telus to provide the police with copies of any text messages sent
or received by these subscribers which were stored on Telus’ computer
database.  In addition, the warrant required the production of subscriber
information identifying any individuals who sent text messages to, or received
text messages from the two individuals who were the target of the warrant.  

[9]                             
The warrant covered a subsequent two-week period
between March 30, 2010 and April 16, 2010.  During this time, the warrant
required Telus to abide by a specific production schedule.  On March 30, 2010,
Telus was required to produce the information for March 18, 2010 to March 30,
2010.  On each of the following 13 days, Telus was required to produce, on a
daily basis, the text messages sent or received within the last 24 hours, as
well as any related subscriber information. 

[10]                         
Telus argued that the warrant was invalid
because the police had failed to satisfy the requirement under s. 487.01(1)(c)
of the Code that a general warrant could not be issued if another
provision in the Code is available to authorize the technique used by
police.  Since the warrant purports to authorize the interception of private
communications, and since Part VI is the scheme that authorizes the
interception of private communications, a general warrant was not available.  The
Crown’s position, on the other hand, was that the retrieval of messages from
Telus’ computer database does not fall within the scope of Part VI since the
copies on Telus’ computer database are not real-time communications and the
police are therefore permitted to use the general warrant power to authorize
the prospective production of text messages stored on a service provider’s
computer.  

[11]                         
The application judge dismissed Telus’
application (2011 ONSC 1143, 105 O.R. (3d) 411).  The part of the warrant that
required production of historical messages predating the issuance of the
warrant was rescinded since both the Crown and Telus conceded that a production
order was available to obtain those messages.

[12]                         
 In my view, text messages are private
communications and, even if they are stored on a service provider’s computer,
their prospective production requires authorization under Part VI of the Code. 


[13]                         
If Telus did not maintain its computer database,
there is no doubt that the police would be required to obtain an authorization
under Part VI to secure the prospective, and in this case continuous,
production of text messages.  In fact, most service providers do not routinely
copy text messages to a computer database as part of their transmission
service.  Accordingly, if the police wanted to target an individual who used a
different service provider, they would have no option but to obtain wiretap
authorizations under Part VI to compel the prospective and continuous
production of their text messages.  This creates a manifest unfairness to
individuals who are unlikely to realize that their choice of telecommunications
service provider can dramatically affect their privacy.

[14]                         
I would therefore allow the appeal and quash the
general warrant and related assistance order. 

Analysis

[15]                         
We have not been asked to determine whether a
general warrant is available to authorize the production of historical text
messages, or to consider the operation and validity of the production order
provision with respect to private communications.  Rather, the focus of this
appeal is on whether the general warrant power in s. 487.01 of the Code can
authorize the prospective production of future text messages from
a service provider’s computer.  That means that we need not address whether the
seizure of the text messages would constitute an interception if it were
authorized after the messages were stored.  

[16]                         
 Section 487.01  was enacted in 1993 as part of a
series of amendments to the Code in Bill C-109, S.C. 1993, c. 40.  The
Bill introduced a number of new judicial authorization provisions.  Section
487.01  was meant to make search warrants available for techniques or procedures
not specified in the Code.  It authorizes a judge to issue a
general warrant permitting a peace officer to “use any device or investigative
technique or procedure or do any thing described in the warrant that would, if
not authorized, constitute an unreasonable search or seizure”: 

           487.01 (1) A
provincial court judge, a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or
a judge as defined in section 552 may issue a warrant in writing authorizing a
peace officer to, subject to this section, use any device or investigative
technique or procedure or do any thing described in the warrant that would, if
not authorized, constitute an unreasonable search or seizure in respect of a
person or a person’s property if

 

(a)
the judge is satisfied by information on oath in writing that there are reasonable
grounds to believe that an offence against this or any other Act of Parliament
has been or will be committed and that information concerning the offence will
be obtained through the use of the technique, procedure or device or the doing
of the thing;

 

(b)
the judge is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the administration
of justice to issue the warrant; and

 

(c)
there is no other provision in this or any other Act of Parliament that
would provide for a warrant, authorization or order permitting the technique,
procedure or device to be used or the thing to be done.

 

[17]                         
The key to this case lies in whether s.
487.01(1)(c) applies, namely, whether another provision would provide
for the authorization sought in this case.  In R. v. Ha, 2009 ONCA 340,
96 O.R. (3d) 751, MacPherson J.A. observed that the focus of the s. 487.01(1)(c)
analysis is “on the particular investigative technique or procedure that the
police seek to utilize and whether it can properly be authorized by another
provision in the Code or any other federal statute” (at para. 43; see also R.
v. Brand, 2008 BCCA 94, 229 C.C.C. (3d) 443 (sub nom. R. v. Ford),
at para. 50).

[18]                         
Viewed contextually, therefore, s. 487.01(1)(c)
stipulates that the general warrant power is residual and resort to it
is precluded where judicial approval for the proposed technique,
procedure or device or the “doing of the thing” is available under the Code or
another federal statute. 

[19]                         
In other words, s. 487.01(1)(c)  should
be broadly construed to ensure that the general warrant is not used
presumptively. This is to prevent the circumvention of more specific or
rigorous pre-authorization requirements for warrants (S. C. Hutchison et al., Search
and Seizure Law in Canada (loose-leaf), at p. 16-40.3). 

[20]                         
 This means that the Crown is only entitled to a
general warrant where it can show that no other provision would provide for a
warrant, authorization or order permitting the technique, including, as
Moldaver J. observes, provisions that authorize techniques which are
substantively equivalent to the technique proposed by the police in a given
case.  The investigative technique authorized by the general warrant in this
case allowed the police to obtain prospective production of future text
messages on a daily basis for a two-week period directly from a service
provider.  The essence of the Crown’s argument was that no other provision was
available because the retrieval of stored messages was not an interception.  If
the Crown is right, they are entitled to a general warrant.  If they are wrong,
the general warrant must be quashed.  Either way, it is impossible to avoid an
examination of whether the technique the police sought to employ was something
that required a Part VI authorization.  

[21]                         
The Crown never conceded that these were
circumstances in which a choice was available under either a general warrant or
a Part VI authorization.  Instead, it argued that the requirement in s.
487.01(1)(c) was satisfied because no other provision was available to
authorize the prospective production of future text messages stored on a
service provider’s computer, maintaining that Part VI did not apply because the
retrieval of messages from computer storage is not an “intercept”.  That is the
central issue that is engaged in this case.  

[22]                         
This requires us to determine whether Part VI
applies to the prospective, and in this case continuous, production of text
messages sought by the police, or whether the fact that the messages are stored
in Telus’ computer means that their retrieval by the police is not an
“intercept”.  If Part VI does apply, then in accordance with s. 487.01(1)(c),
a general warrant is not available. 

[23]                         
Section 184(1) makes it an indictable offence to
“wilfully intercep[t] a private communication” by use of a device.  Part VI provides
a comprehensive scheme for the authorization of these interceptions.  It was
enacted in 1974 through the Protection of Privacy Act, S.C. 1973-74, c.
50, which amended the Code to add Part IV.1 (now Part VI) entitled
“Invasion of Privacy”.  The goal of the legislation was explained by Zuber J.A.
in R. v. Welsh an Iannuzzi (No. 6) (1977), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 363 (Ont.
C.A.) as follows: 

It is apparent that in enacting the Protection
of Privacy Act, 1973-74 (Can.), c. 50, . . . Parliament had two
objectives.  The first was to protect private communications by prohibiting
interception and to render inadmissible evidence obtained in violation of the
statute.  The second objective, which balances the first, was to recognize the
need to allow the appropriate authorities, subject to specific controls, to
intercept private communications in the investigation of serious crime, and to
adduce the evidence thus obtained. [p. 369]

[24]                         
Because the purpose of Part VI is to restrict
the ability of the police to obtain and disclose private communications, it is
drafted broadly to ensure the necessary protection.  In Lyons v. The Queen,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 633, this Court explained this breadth as follows: 

This is broad legislation embracing in
these extensive provisions the use of a wide range of
radio, telephone, optical and acoustical devices for listening to and recording
private communications as broadly defined. It is not “wiretapping” legislation,
nor eavesdropping legislation, nor radio regulation.  It is the regulation of
all these things and “any other device” that may be used to intercept
intelligence reasonably expected by the originator not to be intercepted by
anyone other than the intended recipient. [p. 664]

[25]                         
The definition of “intercept” in s. 183 includes
“listen to, record or acquire a communication or acquire the substance, meaning
or purport thereof”.  Consistent with the broad scope of Part VI, this
definition is not exhaustive and focuses on the state acquisition of
informational content — the substance, meaning, or purport — of the private
communication.  It is not just the communication itself that is protected, but
any derivative of that communication that would convey its substance or
meaning. “[P]rivate communication” is defined in s. 183 as follows: 

. . . any oral
communication, or any telecommunication, that is made by an originator who is
in Canada or is intended by the originator to be received by a person who is in
Canada and that is made under circumstances in which it is reasonable for the
originator to expect that it will not be intercepted by any person other than
the person intended by the originator to receive it,
and includes any radio-based telephone communication that is treated
electronically or otherwise for the purpose of preventing intelligible
reception by any person other than the person intended by the originator to
receive it; 

 

[26]                         
This definition focuses on the individual’s
reasonable expectation of privacy in the communication. The word
“telecommunication” used in this definition is in turn defined in the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21 , s. 35 , amended in 1993 (S.C. 1993, c. 38 , s. 87 )
as “the emission, transmission or reception of signs, signals, writing, images,
sounds or intelligence of any nature by any wire, cable, radio, optical or
other electromagnetic system, or by any similar technical system”. 

[27]                         
Sections 185 and 186 of the Code set out
the general requirements governing the application for an authorization under
Part VI.  Compared with other search and seizure and warrant provisions in the Code,
the provisions in Part VI contain more stringent requirements to safeguard
privacy interests.  Before granting an authorization under Part VI, a judge
must be satisfied that the authorization is in the best interests of the
administration of justice.  

[28]                         
A judge must also be satisfied, in accordance
with s. 186(1)(b), “that other investigative procedures have been tried
and have failed, other investigative procedures are unlikely to succeed or the
urgency of the matter is such that it would be impractical to carry out the
investigation of the offence using only other investigative procedures”.  In R.
v. Araujo, 2000 SCC 65, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 992, this Court clarified
that this criterion required the police to show that there was “no other
reasonable alternative method of investigation in the circumstances of the
particular criminal inquiry” (para. 29).  

[29]                         
 Part VI authorizations must also state the
identity of persons whose private communications will be intercepted, the place
at which they are intercepted, and the manner of the interception.  They are
required to contain such conditions as the judge considers advisable and will
only be valid for a limited period of time not to exceed 60 days.  Finally, a
written application by the Attorney General, Minister of Public Safety or a
designated agent is required.  

[30]                         
In addition to these prerequisites for
authorization, Part VI contains a number of notice requirements.  Section 196
requires that notice be given to targets of interceptions authorized under s.
186 within a certain timeframe.  Under s. 189, an accused must be given notice
of any interception intended to be produced in evidence.  In addition, s. 195
requires the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness or the
Attorney General for each province to produce an annual report with respect to
the use of Part VI authorizations.  In R. v. Tse, 2012 SCC
16, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 531, this Court found that a notice requirement provides
transparency and serves as a further check on the power of police to perform
highly intrusive interceptions of private communications.  The Court therefore
concluded that a notice provision was necessary to meet the minimal
constitutional standards of s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms .  

[31]                         
These safeguards illuminate Parliament’s
intention that a higher degree of protection be available for private
communications.  Part VI has broad application to a number of technologies and
includes more rigorous safeguards than other warrant provisions in the Code. 
In considering whether the prospective, daily production of future text
messages stored in Telus’ computer falls within Part VI, therefore, we must
take this overall objective into account.  

[32]                         
As all parties acknowledged, it is clear that
text messages qualify as telecommunications under the definition in the Interpretation
Act .  They also acknowledged that these messages, like voice
communications, are made under circumstances that attract a reasonable
expectation of privacy and therefore constitute “private communication” within
the meaning of s. 183 .  Similarly, there is no question that the computer used
by Telus would qualify as “any device” under the definitions in s. 183 .  

[33]                         
The issue then is how to define “intercept” in
Part VI.  The interpretation should be informed not only by the purposes of
Part VI, but also by the rights enshrined in s. 8  of the Charter , which
in turn must remain aligned with technological developments.  In R. v. Wong,
[1990] 3 S.C.R. 36, this Court found that “the broad and general right to
be secure from unreasonable search and seizure guaranteed by s. 8  [of the Charter ]
is meant to keep pace with technological development, and, accordingly, to
ensure that we are ever protected against unauthorized intrusions upon our
privacy by the agents of the state, whatever technical form the means of
invasion may take” (p. 44).  A technical approach to “intercept” would
essentially render Part VI irrelevant to the protection of the right to privacy
in new, electronic and text-based communications technologies, which generate
and store copies of private communications as part of the transmission process.


[34]                         
 It is true that unlike traditional voice
communication, a text message may or may not be delivered to its intended
recipient at the time it is created.  Receipt of the text message depends on
whether the phone is turned on, whether it is in range of a cell tower, and
whether the user has accessed the message.  If Telus is unable to deliver the
message, it remains in the transmission infrastructure for five days, at which
point Telus stops trying to complete delivery.  Furthermore, unlike voice
communications, text communications, by their nature, generate a record of the
communication which may easily be copied and stored.  A narrow or technical
definition of “intercept” that requires the act of interception to occur
simultaneously with the making of the communication itself is therefore
unhelpful in addressing new, text-based electronic communications.  

[35]                         
A narrow definition is also inconsistent with
the broad language and purpose of Part VI.  The statutory definition of
“intercept” in s. 183 includes three distinct parts — “listen to”, “record” or
“acquire”.  In French, the definition includes “de prendre . . .
connaissance”.  Rather than limit the definition of “intercept” to its
narrow, technical definition, the statutory definition broadens the concept of
interception.  There is no requirement in the Code definition of
“intercept” that the interception of a private communication be simultaneous or
contemporaneous with the making of the communication itself.  If Parliament
intended to include such a requirement, it would have included it in the
definition of “intercept”.  Instead, it chose to adopt a wider definition,
consistent with Part VI’s purpose to offer broad protection for private
communications from unauthorized interference by the state. 

[36]                         
The interpretation of “intercept a private
communication” must, therefore, focus on the acquisition of informational
content and the individual’s expectation of privacy at the time the
communication was made. In my view, to the extent that there may be any
temporal element inherent in the technical meaning of intercept, it should not
trump Parliament’s intention in Part VI to protect an individual’s right to
privacy in his or her communications. 

[37]                         
The use of the word “intercept” implies that the
private communication is acquired in the course of the communication process. 
In my view, the process encompasses all activities of the service provider
which are required for, or incidental to, the provision of the communications
service.  Acquiring the substance of a private communication from a computer
maintained by a telecommunications service provider would, as a result, be
included in that process.  

[38]                         
Focusing on the fact that the Code draws
a distinction between the interception of private communications and the
disclosure of those communications, fails to provide the intended protection
under Part VI.   On the contrary, it allows technological differences in Telus’
transmission process to defeat Parliament’s intended protection of private
communications from state interference. 

[39]                         
The reality of modern communication technologies
is that electronic private communications, such as text messages, are often
simultaneously in transit and in some form of computer storage by the
service provider.  As a result, the same private communication exists in more
than one place and may therefore be acquired by the state from the transmission
stream and from computer storage.  In other words, the same private
communication may be “intercepted” by police more than once from different
sources.  

[40]                         
When Telus copies messages to its computer
database, several steps in the transmission process have yet to occur.  The
production schedule required by the general warrant in this case means that the
police likely obtained stored copies of some text messages before they were
even received by the intended recipient.  Had the police acquired the same
private communications directly from the transmission stream, instead of from
the stored copies, the Crown concedes that a Part VI authorization would be
required.  The level of protection should not depend on whether the state
acquires a copy of the private communication that is being transmitted or a
copy that is in storage by a service provider as part of the communications
process.  Parliament drafted Part VI broadly to ensure that private
communications were protected across a number of technological platforms (see Lyons).


[41]                         
The communication process used by a third-party
service provider should not defeat Parliament’s intended protection for private
communications.  As the interveners Canadian Civil Liberties Association and
Samuelson-Glushko Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic point out
in their factums, this Court has recognized in other contexts that
telecommunications service providers act merely as a third-party “conduit” for
the transmission of private communications and ought to be able to provide
services without having a legal effect on the nature (or, in this case, the
protection) of these communications (Society of Composers, Authors and Music
Publishers of Canada v. Canadian Assn. of Internet Providers, 2004
SCC 45, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 427, at paras. 100-101).  

[42]                         
Part VI recognizes the dangers inherent in
permitting access to the future private communications of a potentially unlimited
number of people over a lengthy period of time.  Those are the very risks
inherent in the investigative technique in this case.  An authorization that
permits police to obtain the prospective production of future
text messages over a two-week period directly from the communications process
used by the service provider is precisely what Part VI was intended to
protect.  In my view, the investigative technique in this case therefore
qualifies as “intercepting private communications” under Part VI.  

[43]                         
An interpretation of “intercept a private
communication” that includes the investigative technique used by police in this
case finds support in the statutory definition of “intercept” in s. 183.  The
definition includes the simple acquisition of a communication.  It does not
require the acquisition of the communication itself; rather, the acquisition of
the “substance, meaning or purport” of the communication is sufficient. 
Moreover, this interpretation is harmonious with the scheme and objectives of
Part VI, which is drafted broadly in order to regulate and control a wide
variety of technological invasions of privacy.  Finally, it strikes the
appropriate balance between the serious invasion of privacy that results from
the surreptitious acquisition of private communications and the evolving needs
of effective law enforcement.  

[44]                         
The police gained a substantial advantage by
proceeding with a general warrant.  They did not need the Attorney General’s
request for an authorization; they did not need to show that other
investigative procedures had been tried and failed; they did not need to
provide any notice to the target individuals; and they did not need to identify
which other individuals’ private communications may be acquired in the course
of the search.  

[45]                         
The general warrant in this case purported to
authorize an investigative technique contemplated by a wiretap authorization
under Part VI, namely, it allowed the police to obtain prospective production
of future private communications from a computer maintained by a service
provider as part of its communications process.  Because Part VI applied, a
general warrant under s. 487.01  was unavailable.  

[46]                         
Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and quash
the general warrant and related assistance order.  

                    The
reasons of Moldaver and Karakatsanis were delivered by

                    Moldaver J. — 

I.       Introduction

[47]                         
Where a police investigative technique intrudes
on an individual’s reasonable expectation of privacy, it falls to Parliament to
provide for specific legislative authorization of the technique.  That is the
general rule.  The so-called “general warrant” provision of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , operates as an exception to the rule,
allowing the police to seek judicial authorization of a proposed investigative
technique that is not specifically authorized by statute.  Although several
issues have been raised in this appeal, the dispositive one, in my view, is
whether a general warrant may properly issue where the substance of an
investigative technique, if not its precise form, is addressed by an existing
legislative provision.

[48]                         
I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of
my colleague Abella J. and, although we approach the matter differently, I
share her conclusion that the general warrant in this case is invalid.  My
colleague’s reasons focus on the definition of “intercept” in s. 183 of the Code
and whether the search in this case fell within that definition for purposes of
Part VI.  I do not think it necessary to answer those questions because in my
view the result in this case is driven by the failure of the authorities to
establish one of the prerequisites needed to obtain a general warrant.

[49]                         
On the facts of this case, when one cuts through
form and looks at the substance of the search that the police sought to conduct,
what we are left with is the equivalent of a Part VI intercept.  As such, the
police could and, for reasons I will explain, should have sought an
authorization under Part VI, which thereby precludes the issuance of a general
warrant.  I would accordingly join my colleague Abella J. in allowing the
appeal and quashing the general warrant, as well as the related assistance
order.

II.     Overview of Issues on Appeal

[50]                         
The parties in this appeal framed their
principal arguments around the question of whether the investigative technique
authorized by the general warrant falls within the definition of “intercept” in
s. 183 of the Code.  The parties agree that if what occurred here was an
intercept, the general warrant could not issue, as it would fail the “no other
provision” requirement in s. 487.01(1)(c) of the Code.  They, of
course, disagree as to whether this technique was an intercept.

[51]                         
My colleague Abella J. and I agree that the
Crown is entitled to a general warrant only where it can show that “no other provision” would provide for
the technique, including a substantively equivalent technique, proposed by the
police in a given case.  We also agree on the result in this case.  We
part company, however, on the path to that result.

[52]                         
My colleague takes the position that the investigative technique
here was an intercept within the meaning of s. 183, and would thereby
hold the general warrant invalid.  I prefer, instead, to resolve this case on
the basis that the investigative technique here was substantively equivalent
to an intercept and, in light of that conclusion, would hold the general
warrant invalid.

[53]                         
I choose a different path because I am reluctant to use this case
as a vehicle to undertake an analysis of what constitutes an intercept for
purposes of Part VI.  In approaching the matter as I have, I am not unmindful
of the need to address the risks to privacy posed by the digital age.  The task
of adapting laws that were a product of the 1970s to a world of smartphones and
social networks is a challenging and profoundly important one.  But the
resolution of whether what occurred here was or was not, strictly speaking, an
intercept is unnecessary, in my view, because there is a narrower basis for
decision that guards against unforeseen and potentially far-reaching
consequences in this complex area of the law. 

III.    Analysis

A.     The General Warrant Provision

[54]                         
Parliament enacted the general warrant provision
in 1993 together with several new search powers as part of its response to a
series of decisions of this Court concerning electronic surveillance.  Section
487.01  was a specific response to R. v. Wong,
[1990] 3 S.C.R. 36.  That decision held that police video monitoring of
activities in a hotel room intruded on an individual’s reasonable expectation
of privacy and thus required prior judicial authorization pursuant to a valid
legislative provision.  Parliament’s response, in the form of s. 487.01 , went
beyond the authorization of video monitoring.  The provision states in relevant
part:

           487.01
(1) [Information for general warrant] A provincial
court judge, a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a judge as
defined in section 552 may issue a warrant in writing authorizing a peace
officer to, subject to this section, use any device or investigative technique or
procedure or do any thing described in the warrant that would, if not
authorized, constitute an unreasonable search or seizure in respect of a person
or a person’s property if

 

(a)
the judge is satisfied by information on oath in writing that there are
reasonable grounds to believe that an offence against this or any other Act of
Parliament has been or will be committed and that information concerning the
offence will be obtained through the use of the technique, procedure or device
or the doing of the thing;

 

(b)
the judge is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the administration
of justice to issue the warrant; and

 

(c)
there is no other provision in this or any other Act of Parliament that would
provide for a warrant, authorization or order permitting the technique,
procedure or device to be used or the thing to be done.

 

           (2)
[Limitation] Nothing in subsection (1) shall be construed as to permit
interference with the bodily integrity of any person.

 

           (3)
[Search or seizure to be reasonable] A warrant issued under subsection
(1) shall contain such terms and conditions as the judge considers advisable to
ensure that any search or seizure authorized by the warrant is reasonable in
the circumstances.

[55]                         
The breadth of the general warrant — judicial
sanction to “use any device or investigative technique or procedure or do any
thing” that if not authorized would constitute an unreasonable search or
seizure — is kept in check by several prerequisites to its availability and
conditions on its operation.  Chief among them and what, in my view, lies at
the heart of this appeal is the requirement in s. 487.01(1)(c) that
“there is no other provision in this or any other Act of Parliament that
would provide for a warrant, authorization or order permitting the technique,
procedure or device to be used or the thing to be done”.

[56]                         
The requirement that there be “no other
provision” that would provide for the search ensures that the general warrant
is used sparingly as a warrant of limited resort.  It guards against the
general warrant becoming “an easy back door for other techniques that have more
demanding pre-authorization requirements”: S. C. Hutchison et al., Search
and Seizure Law in Canada (loose-leaf), at p. 16-40.3.  Without ascribing
any improper motive to the police, that, I believe, is what occurred in this
case.

B.     The General Warrant in This Case

[57]                         
In a typical scenario where TELUS Communications
Company (“Telus”), the telecommunications service provider here, is served with
an authorization under Part VI, the company installs a device that
automatically copies all activity for the identified phone number, including
all text messages, and automatically delivers such data to a police “wire
room”.  The Crown does not dispute that the acquisition of an individual’s text
messages in this manner constitutes a Part VI intercept, nor is there any
dispute that a text message can constitute a “private communication” within the
meaning of Part VI. 

[58]                         
As a matter of corporate practice, however,
Telus routinely stores a copy of a subscriber’s incoming and outgoing text
messages on its databases for at least 30 days.  Though Telus is unique among
major telecommunications service providers in making such copies, it is legally
entitled to do so pursuant to an exception in s. 184(2) of the Code.  The
company says it intercepts its subscribers’ messages in this manner to aid in
troubleshooting customer problems.

[59]                         
The fact that Telus stores its subscribers’ text
messages in this manner is significant — indeed, it is the reason this appeal
exists — because it creates an investigative resource for the authorities.  As
Det. Sgt. Prosser of the Ontario Provincial Police said in his affidavit filed
with this Court, Telus’s practice “provides investigators with another option
by which to access the content of these messages” (A.R., at p. 115).  Relying
on conventional search warrants (s. 487) or production orders (s. 487.012), the
police have obtained copies of the messages stored in Telus’s databases.  

[60]                         
In sum, prior to this case, with only a handful
of exceptions, all police searches that sought copies of Telus subscribers’
text messages were authorized either under Part VI or by a conventional search
warrant or production order.  The Crown in its factum puts the matter
succinctly: police practice with respect to Telus subscribers has been to seek
either “search warrants or production orders (for historic messages) or
wiretap authorizations (for future messages)” (R.F., at para. 10
(emphasis added)). 

[61]                         
The general warrant in this case thus represents
a third option.  In form, it resembles a production order because it authorizes
police access to text messages already stored in Telus’s database.  And
yet, in substance, it resembles a Part VI authorization, because it prospectively
authorizes police access to future private communications on a continual
basis over a sustained period of time.  

[62]                         
The inherent hybridity of the general warrant in
this case underscores the need for an inquiry into whether the “no other
provision” test is satisfied to assess the substance of the police
investigative technique, not merely its formal trappings.  But that is not what
happened here.

C.     Was the General Warrant Validly Issued?

[63]                         
The reviewing judge looked to binding authority
from the Ontario Court of Appeal for guidance.  In R. v. Ha, 2009 ONCA
340, 96 O.R. (3d) 751, MacPherson J.A. observed:

The focus in the s. 487.01(1)(c)
analysis is not on whether there are other investigative techniques that might
accomplish the purported investigative purposes or goals of the police; rather,
the focus is on the particular investigative technique or procedure that the
police seek to utilize and whether it can properly be authorized by another
provision in the Code or any other federal statute.  [Emphasis added; para.
43.]

[64]                         
On the strength of Ha, the reviewing
judge concluded that there was no other provision in the Code or any
other statute that would authorize the investigative technique in this case —
namely the “prospective and daily production of text messages” (2011 ONSC 1143,
105 O.R. (3d) 411, at para. 75).  Though the police “could have gone to a
justice of the peace every day for the 14 days covered by the General Warrant
and obtained the same records using conventional warrants”, the general warrant
could issue precisely because it provided a single, comprehensive authorization
for the search that was otherwise unanticipated by Parliament (para. 70).[1] 

[65]                         
The analysis is, in my respectful view,
incomplete.  It is self-evident that the police could have sought a Part
VI authorization and achieved their investigative objective.  Crown counsel
recognized this during the hearing of this appeal:

I’m not sure that they really thought this through at
the end of the day because if what the police are doing here is Part VI, well,
you know, presumably, the police could go back to the issuing justice who was a
Superior Court judge and say:  Okay.  Just issue this as a Part VI
authorization.  [Emphasis added; transcript, at p. 81.]

On the record before us,
the police have offered no explanation as to why they could not have sought a
Part VI authorization.  We do know that but for Telus’s practice of routinely
storing subscribers’ messages, the police would have had no option other than
to obtain such an authorization since what they were seeking was prospective
authorization for the daily production of future text messages.  Indeed, that is
what they do — ostensibly without any trouble — with the other major
telecommunications service providers, such as Rogers and Bell, who do not store
text messages as Telus does.  

[66]                         
Nonetheless, the question remains whether the
law requires that the police should have sought such an authorization. 
At the hearing of this appeal, Crown counsel argued that Ha conclusively
resolves the issue in the negative:

           . . . as
the Ontario Court of Appeal pointed out in Ha, the test for determining
whether a general warrant can be issued focuses on the nature of the
investigative technique in question, not the nature of the investigative
objective.  

 

           The
search of the Telus database for future records is a technique that’s quite
distinct from the seizure of a telecommunication.   I mean, mechanically . . .
the police were doing different things. . . . [I]t was a completely different
process.  [Emphasis added; transcript, at pp. 94-95.]

[67]                         
With respect, I cannot agree.  To adopt Ha in
this way is to turn a blind eye to the substance of the search — and to common
sense.  What the police did in this case — securing prospective authorization
for the delivery of future private communications on a continual,
if not continuous, basis over a sustained period of time — was substantively
equivalent to what they would have done pursuant to a Part VI authorization. 
It was thus, at a minimum, tantamount to an intercept.  

[68]                         
I accept the Crown’s contention that, as a
technical matter, what occurred here was different from what would occur
pursuant to a Part VI authorization.  I do not accept, however, that that fact
is determinative in light of the identical privacy interests at stake.  But for
the 24-hour time delay, the investigative techniques were the same.  Indeed, if
the Crown’s logic is to be accepted, a general warrant could still issue had
the delay been 24 minutes or, for that matter, 24 seconds.[2]  To draw a line between
what was authorized here and a Part VI intercept on the basis of such a theory
is to draw “an artificial and unrealistic distinction”: Lyons v. The Queen,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 633, at p. 643.

[69]                         
As a result, the facts of the case at hand are
distinguishable from Ha.  Both Ha and R. v. Brand,
2008 BCCA 94, 229 C.C.C. (3d) 443 (sub nom. R. v. Ford), the other
appellate authority interpreting s. 487.01 , concerned unsuccessful attempts by
the target of a search to invalidate a general warrant on the basis that the
police could have sought multiple conventional warrants.  In Ha, the
police were investigating a suspected drug lab.  They sought the flexibility to
enter the property covertly at any time within a two-month period and to engage
in a broad range of evidence gathering activities therein, including
photographing, taking chemical samples, and fingerprinting items.  Likewise, in
Brand, the police were investigating a large marihuana grow operation
and needed covert access to multiple properties in order to verify the presence
of drugs without compromising other aspects of their investigation.  Fundamentally,
in each instance, the request for covert access and temporal flexibility made
clear that the substance of the investigative techniques for which
authorization was sought differed from what could be authorized under a
conventional warrant.  

[70]                         
Explaining why the search sanctioned by the
general warrant in Ha was thus substantively different from one
involving multiple conventional warrants, MacPherson J.A. said:

In this case, the police sought to
obtain authorization to conduct an unlimited number of covert entries and
searches on private property over a two-month period.  Except
for s. 487.01 of the Code, there is “no other provision in . . . any other Act
of Parliament” that could potentially accomplish this goal.  [para. 43]

Those are not our facts. 
Here, the police sought, in the reviewing judge’s words, authorization for “the
investigative technique or procedure of prospective and daily production of
text messages” (para. 75). The simple fact is that there is a provision
that substantively provides for this technique.  It is known as Part VI. 

[71]                         
In emphasizing the importance of looking beyond
the form of a search technique to uncover its true substance, a further point
bears noting.  In both Ha and Brand, if the police wanted the
evidence, they had a choice between a series of conventional warrants or a
general warrant.  If the police sought a general warrant, they would have to
meet the requirements of s. 487.01  which are deliberately stricter than those
for a conventional warrant.  For example, the requirements that a general
warrant can only be issued by a judge, not a justice of the peace, and that
issuance must be in the best interests of justice themselves serve to ensure
that the general warrant remains a rearguard warrant of limited resort.

[72]                         
In other words, by dint of its more stringent
requirements, the general warrant contains a disincentive to its everyday use. 
In Ha and Brand, where the only alternative was a series of
conventional warrants, reliance on a general warrant did not provide the police
with an easy way out from the rigours of a more demanding legislative
authorization — the general warrant was the more demanding legislative
authorization.  Thus, in these cases, it is harder to see how the general
warrant provision might be misused.

[73]                         
In this case, by contrast, the police actually
had a choice between a Part VI authorization and a general warrant.[3]  The incentives before
the police were thus markedly different than they were in Ha.  Though
both the general warrant and the Part VI provisions require that the issuing
judge be satisfied that the order is in the best interests of justice, Part VI
alone imposes several further requirements in the interest of protecting the
right to privacy:

1.                 
An authorization under Part VI is available only
for certain offences (s. 183).

2.                 
Only individuals designated by the Minister of
Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness or Attorney General may seek a Part VI
authorization (ss. 185(1) and 186(6)).

3.                 
A Part VI authorization is available only where
“other investigative procedures have been tried and have failed, other
investigative procedures are unlikely to succeed or the urgency of the matter
is such that it would be impractical to carry out the investigation of the
offence using only other investigative procedures” (s. 186(1)(b)).

4.                 
A Part VI authorization must state the identity
of persons whose private communications will be intercepted, the place at which
they are intercepted, and the manner of the interception (s. 186(4)(c)).


5.                 
The Attorney General or Minister is required to
provide notice to the target of the authorization within a certain timeframe
(s. 196).

6.                 
The Minister is required to make an annual
report to Parliament concerning the number of applications made for
authorizations under Part VI and the details thereof (s. 195).

[74]                         
Consequently, in this case, a narrow focus on
the mechanics of the search is to miss the forest for the trees.  The general
warrant must be analogized to a Part VI authorization if one is to appreciate
the actual incentives before the police.  A mechanistic interpretation of the
“no other provision” requirement cannot hold because, put bluntly, a general
warrant can prove easier to obtain than a Part VI authorization.  For that
reason, one can hardly fault the police for seeking a general warrant instead
of a Part VI authorization.  There was little to be lost (a delay in the
receipt of the data sought, which may well have had little consequence) and
much to be gained (no requirement to meet the onerous burdens Parliament has
chosen to impose under Part VI).

[75]                         
 The facts suggest that this is precisely what
has happened as a consequence of Telus’s unsuccessful challenge of the warrant
in this case.  The affidavit of Det. Sgt. Prosser states that the police seek
general warrants only in those “rare circumstances” requiring access to text
messages “under a more immediate timeline” (A.R., at p. 116).  And yet, though
Telus received only six general warrants prior to 2010, counsel for the company
informed us at the hearing of this appeal that the number has since grown to
“several hundred” in light of the decision below (transcript, at p. 42).  

[76]                         
The logic that led to this predictable result
effectively nullifies the “no other provision” safeguard by inviting the police
to distinguish an investigative technique in some manner — any manner, even if
substantively immaterial — so as to avoid the rigours of a more demanding
legislative authorization such as Part VI.  Faced with the choice of having to
seek an authorization under Part VI and being able to proceed down a less
demanding path, it should be expected that the police will elect the latter —
and understandably so.  It follows, in my view, that the “no other provision”
test must be given interpretive teeth if it is to serve its purpose of ensuring
that general warrants do not become a means to avoid more onerous search
authorizations. 

D.     The Summary of the Approach to the “No Other Provision”
Requirement

[77]                         
The test under s. 487.01(1)(c) must
consider the investigative technique that the police seek to utilize with an
eye to its actual substance and not merely its formal trappings.  The provision
must be interpreted so as to afford the police the flexibility Parliament
contemplated in creating the general warrant, while safeguarding against its misuse. 
As the facts of this case illustrate, there is a need for heightened judicial
scrutiny where Parliament has provided an authorization for an investigative
technique that is substantively equivalent to what the police seek but requires
more onerous pre-conditions.  

[78]                         
In so concluding, I note that in creating the
general warrant, Parliament did not erase every other search authorization from
the Code and leave it to judges to devise general warrants on an ad
hoc basis as they deem fit.  Courts must therefore be careful to fill a
legislative lacuna only where Parliament has actually failed to anticipate a
particular search authorization.  To do otherwise would chip away at the
foundation that shapes the respective roles of the courts and Parliament in our
system of criminal justice when individual rights and freedoms are at stake.

[79]                         
That said, I recognize, as I must, that this
approach accepts a measure of uncertainty by tasking judges with the job of
inquiring into the substance of purportedly “new” investigative techniques.  In
my view, an interpretation that is faithful to the purpose of the “no other
provision” requirement in s. 487.01(1)(c) necessarily demands as much. 
Two practical guidelines, however, should serve to mitigate concerns that may
arise. 

[80]                         
First, it is important for the police to
appreciate that general warrants are not warrants of general application.  On
the contrary, they are to be used sparingly, when the investigative technique
they wish to employ is truly different in substance from an investigative
technique accounted for by another legislative provision.  Where uncertainty
exists, the police would do well to err on the side of caution.  They must know
— with certainty — that general warrants may not be used as a means to circumvent
other authorization provisions that are available but contain more onerous preconditions.

[81]                         
Second, when judges are faced with an
application for a general warrant where the investigative technique, though not
identical, comes close in substance to an investigative technique covered by
another provision for which more rigorous standards apply, they should proceed
with extra caution.  At a minimum, judges should look closely at the material
filed and satisfy themselves that the request for a general warrant is genuine
and not merely a device to escape the rigours of another authorization
provision.  Where careful scrutiny establishes that a proposed investigative
technique, although similar, has substantive differences from an
existing technique — not simply that it is similar in substance but different
in form — judges may grant the general warrant, but they should be mindful of
their obligation under s. 487.01(3) to impose terms and conditions that reflect
the nature of the privacy interest at stake.  In doing so, they may borrow as
appropriate from the conditions that Parliament has chosen to impose on the
substantively similar existing authorization. 

[82]                         
With these twin considerations in mind, and
despite Justice Cromwell’s concerns about certainty, to which I shall turn
momentarily, if the police proceed in good faith and the authorizing judge
proceeds with caution, it is unlikely that a general warrant issued in such
circumstances will be found to be defective at trial — and even less so that
evidence obtained pursuant to it will be excluded under s. 24(2)  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

E.      The Competing Approach to the “No Other Provision”
Requirement

[83]                         
I have had the opportunity to read the reasons
of Cromwell J., who is of the view that the “no other provision” test was
satisfied in this case because the investigative technique does not meet the
definition of “intercept” for purposes of Part VI.  He would accordingly
dismiss the appeal.  Insofar as the definition of an intercept is concerned, my
colleague’s analysis hinges on distinguishing between the interception of a
private communication (s. 184) and the subsequent disclosure of such
intercepted communications (s. 193).  As I have explained, I do not find it
necessary to reach that question in this appeal and, for that reason, do not
comment on this aspect of his reasons.

[84]                         
My colleague does, however, take issue with my
interpretation of s. 487.01(1)(c) and its application to the case at
hand.  It is clear that my colleague and I have fundamentally different
understandings not only of the “no other provision” requirement, but of the
proper role of general warrants more broadly.  He has offered a careful
analysis that warrants a response.

[85]                         
Justice Cromwell maintains that s. 487.01(1)(c)
should be construed literally and he rejects the purposive approach I have
taken, asserting that it “creates unnecessary uncertainty and distracts the
issuing judge from the question of whether the technique sought to be
authorized is inconsistent with the right to be free from unreasonable searches
and seizures” (para. 171).  According to my colleague, “predictability and
clarity in the law are particularly important in the area of judicial
pre-authorization of searches” (para. 172). 

[86]                         
Justice Cromwell further challenges my
construction of s. 487.01(1)(c) on the basis that it impermissibly adds
“investigative necessity” as a further precondition to the issuance of a
general warrant — that is, to obtain a general warrant, the police must be able
to show that there are no other ways by which they can achieve their
investigative objective.  My colleague maintains that Parliament did not see
fit to add such a requirement and it is impermissible for the Court to do so. 

[87]                         
I propose to address each of Justice Cromwell’s
concerns.

[88]                         
First, for reasons that should be clear from the
above, I cannot accept my colleague’s literal construction of s. 487.01(1)(c). 
With respect, such an interpretation strips the provision of any meaning and
renders it all but valueless.  Writing in 1996, soon after the general warrant
was introduced, the authors of a leading treatise on this subject predicted:

Of the four preconditions [to a general
warrant] the most difficult for investigators will be [the “no other
provision” requirement], a novel provision intended to prevent this
residual warrant power from becoming an easy back door for other techniques
that have more demanding pre-authorization requirements. [Emphasis added;
Hutchison et al., at p. 16-40.3.]

My colleague’s approach,
however, would reduce that provision to a paper tiger.

[89]                         
On my colleague’s literal interpretation of s.
487.01(1)(c), any deviation — no matter how slight or insignificant —
that takes an investigative technique outside the four corners of another
authorization provision in the Code or an Act of Parliament is
sufficient to satisfy the “no other provision” requirement.  Thus, in this
case, had the police sought a general warrant requiring Telus to provide copies
of all stored text messages using a 24-second delay (as opposed to a 24-hour
delay), I gather that my colleague would hold that the “no other provision”
requirement had been met.  Likewise, on my colleague’s construction, had the
police sought a general warrant requiring both the contemporaneous
interception of text messages and a dial number recorder warrant, it
would appear that this too would suffice to satisfy the “no other provision”
requirement.

[90]                         
If, as my colleague reasons, Parliament truly
intended that the police could satisfy the “no other provision” requirement by
coming up with a hook — any hook — that would take the investigative technique
outside the four corners of an existing authorization, then we are left to
conclude that Parliament chose to enact an absurdity.  I cannot accept any such
conclusion.

[91]                         
Moreover, my colleague’s focus on the breadth of
the general warrant provision — breadth that I readily accept — conflates the
distinct questions of what the power can do, assuming it is available,
with when it arises.  As I have already observed, the general warrant
provision was not meant to erase every other authorization provision from the Code
and leave it to individual judges to fashion general warrants on an ad hoc
basis.  On the contrary, general warrants were created “to fill any
potential ‘gap’” (Schreiber v. Canada (Attorney General), [1997] 2
F.C. 176 (C.A.), at para. 86 (emphasis added), rev’d on other grounds, [1998] 1
S.C.R. 841), to provide a “legislative ‘failsafe’” that “supplement[s]
rather than supplant[s]” (S. C. Hutchison, Hutchison’s Canadian Search
Warrant Manual 2005 (2nd ed. 2004), at pp. 143 and 163 (emphasis added)),
to “fill an investigatory hiatus” (J. A. Fontana and D. Keeshan, The
Law of Search and Seizure in Canada (8th ed. 2010), at p. 459 (emphasis
added)), and to serve as a “residual power” (Hutchison et al., at p.
16-36 (emphasis added)).

[92]                         
Though little was said of general warrants in
debates or committee hearings in 1993, we do know that Parliament did not get
out of the warrant business after enacting s. 487.01 .  Multiple new authorizations
have been created since then, including production orders in 2004. 
Existing authorizations have been amended to reflect evolving investigatory
needs and privacy concerns, including the provisions of Part VI.  And even
today Parliament continues to consider warrant proposals introduced — and
sometimes withdrawn — by the government.  See, e.g., Bill C-30, Protecting
Children from Internet Predators Act, 1st Sess., 41st Parl. (First Reading,
February 14, 2012); Bill C-55, Response to the Supreme Court of Canada
Decision in R. v. Tse Act, 1st Sess., 41st Parl. (First Reading, February
11, 2013).

[93]                         
This history confirms that general warrants were
to play a modest role, affording the police a constitutionally sound path for
investigative techniques that Parliament had not addressed.  They were thus
rearguard warrants of limited resort, not frontline warrants of general
application.  They were meant to fill gaps, not create them.  

[94]                         
In sum, ensuring that general warrants are
confined to their limited role, in my view, is the true purpose of s.
487.01(1)(c).  Justice Cromwell’s literal construction of the provision
turns that purpose on its head by inviting the police to seek judicial sanction
of purportedly “new” investigative techniques on the basis of substantively
meaningless distinctions.  Manifestly, this approach puts a premium on form
over substance.

[95]                         
My colleague takes comfort in the “best
interests” clause in s. 487.01(1)(b) as an adequate safeguard against
misuse of the general warrant.  Parliament, he contends, enacted para. (1)(b)
to deal alone with “potential abuses of the general warrant” (para. 190).  But
if that is so, one might ask why Parliament enacted s. 487.01(1)(c) in
the first place.

[96]                         
No doubt, the “best interests” requirement
serves to prevent misuse of the general warrant.  But this provision should not
be interpreted as swallowing the distinct analytical question that the “no
other provision” test asks.  The role of each provision must be respected. 
First, under s. 487.01(1)(c), the question is whether there is any other
provision in the Code or other Act of Parliament that actually or
substantively provides for the investigative technique for which the police
seek authorization.  Second, under s. 487.01(1)(b), only if the first
question is answered in the negative does the inquiry shift to whether issuance
of the warrant is in the best interests of the administration of justice.

[97]                         
The two hypotheticals I mentioned earlier
illustrate the point.  I would hope that a 24-second delay and a dial number
recorder warrant piggy-backed on an authorization for the contemporaneous
interception of text messages would meet my colleague’s definition of abuse. 
Why?  Because both investigative techniques would presumably be seen for what
they are — the substantive equivalent of a Part VI authorization. In the end,
all roads lead to Rome.  But the interpretation of s. 487.01(1)(c) that
I endorse gives some meaning and purpose to the provision; my colleague’s
interpretation strips it of both.

[98]                         
Insofar as s. 487.01(1)(b) is concerned,
take, as just one example, the fact that the availability of a Part VI
authorization is limited to certain offences included under the definition of
“offence” in s. 183.  Should the police seek authorization for a search concerning
an offence not included within that definition, though the “no other provision”
test would be satisfied, it would fall to an analysis under para. (1)(b)
to guard against the issuance of a warrant that Parliament obviously
anticipated and deliberately excluded: S. Coughlan, “R. v. Ha:
Upholding General Warrants without Asking the Right Questions” (2009), 65 C.R.
(6th) 41, at pp. 41-43.

[99]                         
Leaving that aside, my colleague provides no
guidance as to the type of conduct that he would classify as abusive, even as
he stresses that “judges asked to issue general warrants must be vigilant to
ensure that the right to be free against unreasonable searches and seizures is
fully given effect” (para. 189).  Presumably, he would leave it to individual
judges to decide the matter on a case-by-case basis under s. 487.01(1)(b),
thereby accepting his own form of uncertainty in the process.  As I have
acknowledged, the substantive approach to which I ascribe is not airtight — but
it is no more porous than the total reliance on the “best interests” test that
my colleague endorses.

[100]                     
I turn then to my colleague’s second concern —
that I have impermissibly read investigative necessity, a concept peculiar to
Part VI, into s. 487.01 .  With respect, my approach to s. 487.01(1)(c)
has nothing to do with investigative necessity.

[101]                     
The requirement under s. 186(1)(b) that a
Part VI authorization be necessary is concerned with a factual question. 
In requiring that other procedures “have been tried and have failed”, or that
they were “unlikely to succeed”, or that the “urgency of the matter is such
that it would be impractical” to use them, it is apparent that s. 186(1)(b)
is concerned with whether the factual circumstances of a particular case
necessitate the use of the powers granted under Part VI.  LeBel J. explained as
much for the Court in R. v. Araujo, 2000 SCC 65, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 992:

Parliament and the courts have indeed
recognized that the interception of private communications is a serious matter,
to be considered only for the investigation of serious offences, in the
presence of probable grounds, and with a serious testing of the need for
electronic interception in the context of the particular investigation and its
objects . . . . There must be, practically speaking, no other reasonable
alternative method of investigation, in the circumstances of the particular
criminal inquiry. [Emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted; para. 29.]

[102]                     
By contrast, the “no other provision” test asks
a legal question.  The inquiry is not whether alternative search
techniques have been exhausted, or whether they are unlikely to work, or
whether there is urgency in the circumstances.  Rather, the question is whether
the purportedly “new” investigative technique is actually or
substantively equivalent to a technique that is already authorized by law.  In
other words, under the “no other provision” test, the police are not asked to
show why an alternative authorization would not work on the facts of a
particular case, but rather why it is substantively different from what
Parliament has already provided.  Though the fact that an alternative
authorization will satisfy the investigative objective of the police may be
helpful as a factor in demonstrating its substantive equivalence, the inquiry
under the “no other provision” test remains focused on the latter point, not
the former.  If the police successfully make this showing, the inquiry under s.
487.01(1)(c) ends.  

[103]                     
Two final matters raised by Justice Cromwell’s
reasons warrant clarification. 

[104]                     
First, I do not conclude — nor should I be taken as suggesting —
that the police acted duplicitously or in bad faith in seeking the general
warrant in the case at hand.  There is no evidence to that effect and I have no
reason to believe that the police acted other than in good faith.  Put simply,
we do not know what motivated the police, nor is that the real issue. 
Ultimately, whether the police could or could not obtain a Part VI
authorization in this case is irrelevant insofar as the “no other provision”
requirement is concerned.  What does matter is that we have been provided with
nothing that would assist the police in meeting their burden to show that the
impugned technique was substantively different from an intercept. 

[105]                     
Second, the approach I endorse does not take investigative
flexibility off the table.  As Ha and Brand make clear, it is a
factor that a judge may consider in deciding whether an investigative technique
is substantively different such that a general warrant should issue.  But it is
not the only factor, and it must be approached with caution, particularly in
cases like the present one, where the issuance of a general warrant may be a
convenient way for the police to avoid the rigours of another search provision
that is substantively equivalent.

IV.    Conclusion

[106]                     
For these reasons, I am of the view that the
approach taken by the police in this case cannot be sanctioned.  The general
warrant is invalid because the investigative technique it authorized was
substantively equivalent to an intercept.  On the facts here, the general
warrant served only to provide a means to avoid the rigours of Part VI.  As the
Crown recognized, the police could have sought a Part VI authorization.  It is
enough to decide this appeal to conclude that they should have. 

[107]                     
That said, though we are not presented with such
a scenario, I would not go so far as to conclude that a general warrant can never
prospectively authorize the delivery of future private communications to the
police on a continual basis over a sustained period of time.  If an issuing
judge is satisfied that a particular investigative technique is substantively
different such that the provisions of Part VI, or of any other statute, do not
provide for the search, it would be open to the judge to issue the warrant,
assuming other requirements are satisfied.  The judge must, of course, conclude
that the warrant is in the “best interests of the administration of justice”
(s. 487.01(1)(b)) and the judge “shall” impose such terms and conditions
as necessary to ensure that the search is reasonable in the circumstances (s.
487.01(3)).  

[108]                     
I would allow the appeal and quash the general
warrant and related assistance order.

I.       Overview

[109]                     
TELUS Communications Company (“Telus”) stores in
its databases a copy of all text messages sent by or to its subscribers. The
main question on this appeal is whether, when the police wished to obtain
copies of these stored messages, they required a wiretap authorization.  My
colleagues Abella J. and Moldaver J. would hold that they did, although for
markedly different reasons. I respectfully disagree. Like the Ontario Superior
Court judge whose decision is under appeal, my view is that a wiretap
authorization was not required. I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

II.     Facts, Proceedings and Issues

[110]                     
We are concerned in this case with particular investigative techniques
that may be authorized under the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , in
the context of the police wishing to have lawful access to the content of text
messages. Before turning to an analysis of the specific legal issues we
confront, I will set out some technical background about text messaging and the
range of investigative techniques that may be open to the police to gain access
to them.  I will then set out a brief account of the proceedings which bring
the case to us and the specific issues that we must resolve.  

A.     Telus’s
Text Messaging Service

[111]                     
Text messaging, technically known as Short Message Service (“SMS”), is a
communication service using standardized communications protocols and mobile
telephone service networks to allow for the exchange of short text messages
from one mobile phone to another. 

[112]                     
Telus’s system of text message delivery is the same as that of other
telecommunications service providers. When a message is sent by a Telus
subscriber, it is transmitted to a Telus cell tower and then routed to a Mobile
Switching Centre (“MSC”) which is the computerized mainframe to the Telus
network. Within the MSC is Telus’s Short Message Service Centre (“SMSC”), which
uses routing engines to attempt to deliver the message to its destination. If
the recipient is also a Telus subscriber, the message will then be sent from
Telus’s SMSC to a cell tower which will forward the message to the recipient’s
phone. If the recipient is not a Telus subscriber, the message will pass from
Telus’s SMSC to the SMSC of the recipient’s provider and then through a cell
tower to the recipient’s phone. Where the destination phone is not available
(for example, because it is turned off or does not have service reception), the
text message remains in the Telus SMSC for up to five days. If the recipient
phone does not become available within that timeframe, the message is deleted.
The sender is not informed if a message is not delivered.

[113]                     
Telus differs from most other providers in that it makes electronic
copies of the text messages that pass through its system and stores those
copies in one of four computer databases for at least 30 days. There are three
PSMS databases (namely, PSMS 1 (primary database), PSMS 2 (secondary database),
and PSMS 3 (tertiary database)) which receive messages within up to
approximately 15 minutes of the time they are sent. Which PSMS a message goes
to depends on the capacity of each database. All text messages received by a
Telus customer are copied, and the copy is forwarded to the databases when the
Telus subscriber’s phone receives the message from the Telus SMSC. When a Telus
subscriber sends a text message, it is copied when it arrives at the Telus SMSC
and the copy is stored in a database. Telus also maintains a fourth database,
named PECSMS, which receives messages between two to eight hours after they are
sent. At the time this case was heard at first instance, Telus expected that by
April 2011, PECSMS would be the sole repository for all text message content;
it would cease to use the PSMS databases. 

[114]                     
Telus copies text messages in order to facilitate troubleshooting and
dealing with customer complaints. As I will explain, Telus in doing this is
intercepting the messages and it has legal authority under the Code to
do so without a wiretap authorization. In my view, Telus’s stated purpose,
coupled with the fact that most other service providers in Ontario transmit
text messages without storing copies of them in this manner, makes it clear
that this additional step is not part of the communications process.   Unlike
e-mail messages, which must go through transient storage as they are
transmitted, storage of the type in issue here is not inherent to the
communication of text messages.

B.     Text
Messages and Investigative Techniques

[115]                     
The Code provides at least three potential ways for the police to
obtain authorization to acquire the content of stored text messages from Telus:
a production order, a general warrant and a so-called “wiretap” interception
authorization. The police in this case sought and obtained a general warrant as
a sort of enhanced production order, but Telus’s contention is that they were
required to seek a wiretap authorization. It will be helpful to describe these
three investigative techniques briefly, because the requirements of each are
somewhat interrelated.  

                    1.     Production Order

[116]                     
The police may obtain the contents of stored text messages by means of a
production order under s. 487.012.  This provision allows a judge or justice to
order a person “to produce documents, or copies of them . . . or to prepare a document
based on documents or data already in existence and produce it” (s. 487.012(1)(a)
and (b)). The conditions for issuing a production order are similar to
those for a search warrant.  The issuing justice or judge must be satisfied by
information on oath that an offence has been or is suspected to have been
committed, that the documents or data will afford evidence respecting the
commission of the offence and that the person to whom the order is directed has
possession or control of the documents or data (s. 487.012(3)). In addition,
the person to whom the order is directed cannot be a person under investigation
(s. 487.012(1)).

[117]                     
When presented with a production order, Telus is required to produce to
police, documents or data, or copies thereof, which it already has. In this
way, police obtain copies of text messages that have already been sent or
received by the subscribers and stored in Telus’s databases.   It has been
assumed and I will accept for the purposes of this case that a production order
cannot issue for documents or data not yet in existence (see ss. 487.012(1)(b)
and 487.012(3)(c)). 

[118]                     
I would add that s. 487.012, on its face, allows a judge or justice to
order production of text messages from a provider’s databases through a series
of daily authorizations. Section 487.012 sets relatively few limits on the
issuance of production orders. Unlike the other authorizations that concern us
here, it does not require a finding by the judge that the order is necessary to
the police investigation, nor does it require that a production order be in the
best interests of the administration of justice. Like the reviewing judge, I
accept that the police could have accessed the text messages stored in Telus’s
databases pursuant to such a series of orders. 

                    2.     General Warrant

[119]                     
A judge may issue a general warrant, provided for in s. 487.01 , to
authorize a peace officer to “use any device or investigative technique or
procedure or do any thing described in the warrant that would, if not
authorized, constitute an unreasonable search or seizure”. The issuing judge
must be satisfied on the basis of information on oath that there are reasonable
grounds to believe that an offence has been or will be committed and that
information concerning the offence will be obtained through the use of the
technique for which the police seek authorization.  

[120]                     
Given the wide array of techniques that may be authorized under a
general warrant, Parliament has imposed additional, stringent conditions. 
First, unlike search warrants and production orders that may be issued by
judges or justices of the peace, general warrants may only be issued by judges
(s. 487.01(1)). Second, “the judge [must be] satisfied that it is in the best
interests of the administration of justice to issue the warrant” (s. 487.01(1)(b)).
Third, a general warrant must “contain such terms and conditions as the judge
considers advisable to ensure that the search or seizure authorized by the
warrant is reasonable in the circumstances” (s. 487.01(3)). Fourth, a general
warrant may be issued only if “there is no other provision . . . that would
provide for a warrant, authorization or order permitting the technique,
procedure or device to be used or the thing to be done” (s. 487.01(1)(c)).
In other words, a general warrant may not be used to authorize a “technique,
procedure or device to be used or . . . thing to be done” if there are other
provisions in the Code (or elsewhere) that could authorize it. (I will
refer to this as the “no other provision” requirement.)  Telus’s position is
that this requirement was not met because the wiretap provisions of the Code
provide for authorization of the technique which the police wished to use. 

                    3.     Wiretap Authorization


[121]                     
An authorization to intercept private communications under Part VI of
the Code allows police to receive messages as they are being sent or
received by subscribers. These sorts of authorizations are subject to even more
strict conditions than those which apply to general warrants.  They may only be
issued by a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a judge as
defined in s. 552 of the Code.  The Attorney General, the Minister of
Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness or a specially designated agent must
bring the application (s. 185(1)). There are specific and detailed provisions
relating to what must be placed before the judge.  The issuing judge must be
satisfied not only that it would be in the best interests of the administration
of justice to issue the authorization but also that the so-called
“investigative necessity” test has been met (s. 186(1)).  This means that the
judge must be satisfied that “other investigative procedures have been tried
and have failed, other investigative procedures are unlikely to succeed or the
urgency of the matter is such that it would be impractical to carry out the
investigation of the offence using only other investigative procedures” (s.
186(1)). The authorization may generally not be valid for more than 60 days (s.
186(4)(e)) and there are notice and reporting requirements (s. 196).  

[122]                     
Where a wiretap authorization has issued in relation to text messages,
Telus installs a device which automatically re-routes a copy of each text
message to a police wire room or listening post. When a text message is sent by
a Telus subscriber, the device re-routes a copy of the message when it arrives
at the Telus SMSC. When a text message is received by a Telus subscriber, the
wiretap device re-routes the copy when the subscriber’s phone receives the
message. With an intercept authorization, then, police have access to messages
“in real time” as they are being sent and received. 

C.     Proceedings


[123]                     
The police sought and obtained a general warrant in this case. It
directed Telus to provide them with copies of the stored text messages to and
from two of its subscribers. The warrant required production of messages sent
and received before it was issued and, as well, of messages sent and received
roughly two weeks into the future.  Only the authorization in relation to the
future production is in issue here. For those future messages, Telus was
required by 2:00 p.m. each day Tuesday to Friday, to provide copies of all
messages that had been sent or received between 11:00 a.m. on the previous day
and 11:00 a.m. that same morning. On Mondays, Telus had to provide by 2:00 p.m.
copies of all messages that had been sent or received between 11:00 a.m. Friday
and 11:00 a.m. Monday. In addition, the general warrant required Telus to
provide the police with subscriber information for all of the telephone numbers
which exchanged texts with the two subscribers in question. Thus, this general
warrant was similar to a production order in that it required the production of
copies of stored messages and related subscriber information.  But it was
different from a production order in that it prospectively authorized the
production of these copies.

[124]                     
Telus applied to quash the general warrant and its application was
mainly dismissed by Sproat J. (2011 ONSC 1143, 105 O.R. (3d) 411). Telus’s
principal ground for its challenge to the general warrant was that it
authorized an interception, a technique that could be authorized under Part VI
of the Code. It followed that a general warrant could not issue because
the “no other provision” requirement for a general warrant was not met. 

[125]                     
The reviewing judge rejected this contention.  He did not think that
what the police were authorized to do under the general warrant was an
interception. The police were asking for copies of the messages already stored
in Telus’s databases; they were not asking permission to “intercept private
communications”. In his view, the word “intercept” requires a real time capture
of otherwise transient communications, and this does not cover obtaining copies
of messages stored in a database. The wiretap provisions could only be used to
authorize interceptions and therefore would not apply to the investigative
technique used by the police in this case.  It followed, in the reviewing
judge’s opinion, that a general warrant could issue.

[126]                     
Telus also advanced a number of other arguments which were rejected by
the reviewing judge. Telus submitted that police should have waited until the
end of the 14-day period covered by the general warrant and applied for a
single production order. The judge rejected Telus’s submission that police had
to wait so long to obtain the messages. He also found that while police could
have gone to the Justice of the Peace to obtain 14 separate production orders,
that would have been an impractical solution in the circumstances (para. 76).
He identified various drawbacks of requiring police to seek 14 authorizations
including the need to make repeated, daily applications potentially involving
different judicial officers and the inconvenience to Telus resulting from
having to deal with daily warrants requiring prompt response (para. 70). Sproat
J. concluded that a single general warrant that authorized police to receive
deliveries of messages by e-mail over roughly two weeks was appropriate because
“it would have been impractical for the police to obtain a daily warrant to
achieve the investigative objective of obtaining stored text messages for daily
review” (para. 76). 

[127]                     
The reviewing judge also dismissed Telus’s submission that issuing a
general warrant was not in the best interests of the administration of justice
(s. 487.01(1)(b)).  He held that the technique sought to be authorized
was not an interception. The judge concluded that “it is not open to the court
to decide on public policy grounds that the legislative scheme is inappropriate
and, under the guise of what is in the best interests of the administration of
justice, effectively expand the ambit of Part VI of the Criminal Code ”
(para. 80). The reviewing judge similarly rejected Telus’s submissions that the
general warrant was unwieldy and unworkable and imposed an undue burden. The
judge noted that similar concerns had been dismissed by this Court in Tele-Mobile
Co. v. Ontario, 2008 SCC 12, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 305, at para. 60.

D.     Issues

[128]                     
The principal point advanced by Telus on appeal is that the
investigative technique authorized by the general warrant was, in fact, an
interception of a private communication and therefore, by virtue of the “no
other provision” requirement in s. 487.01(1)(c), could only be
authorized under Part VI of the Code. My colleague Abella J. agrees with
this position while I, respectfully, do not.  My colleague Moldaver J., on the
other hand, does not find it necessary to address Telus’s principal submission. 
Instead, he would hold that even if the general warrant is not, strictly
speaking, an interception, it authorizes a technique that is substantively the
same as an interception and therefore should be excluded from authorization by
a general warrant by virtue of the “no other provision” requirement in s.
487.01(1)(c). Thus there are two issues:

1.      Is the
investigative technique authorized by the general warrant in this case an
interception which requires an authorization under Part VI of the Code? 

2.      If the
seizure of the stored text messages is not an interception, is the issuance of
a general warrant nevertheless barred by the “no other provision” requirement
in s. 487.01(1)(c) because the technique sought to be authorized was
substantively the equivalent of a wiretap?

III. 
  Analysis

A.     First Issue: Is the Investigative Technique
Authorized by the General Warrant in This Case an Interception Which Requires an
Authorization Under Part VI of the Code?

[129]                     
Telus submits that a general warrant could not issue in this case
because the technique for which police were seeking authorization was the
interception of private communications. The investigative technique of
interception of private communications can be authorized by a judge under s.
186 in Part VI of the Code.  Therefore, goes the argument, a general
warrant should not have been issued because the police did not meet the “no
other provision” requirement for a general warrant (s. 487.01(1)(c)). 

[130]                     
My colleague Abella J. substantially accepts this position. She would
hold that the general warrant purported to authorize an interception because it
allowed for “the prospective production of future text messages from a
service provider’s computer” (para. 15 (emphasis in original)). I understand
“the prospective production of future text messages” to mean that at the
time the warrant issues, at least some of the messages that are required to be
disclosed have not yet come into existence. In my respectful view, this general
warrant did not authorize an interception.

[131]                     
 The investigative technique authorized by the general warrant in this
case was not an interception of private communications that could be authorized
by s. 186. The general warrant provides the police with copies from Telus of
stored messages which it had previously intercepted; police only obtain
disclosure of the messages when Telus compiles them from its databases and
sends them by e-mail.  Far from being a “technical” difference, the distinction
between disclosure of an intercepted communication and interception of a
communication is fundamental to both the purpose and the scheme of the wiretap
provisions.

                    1.     The
Text, Context and Scheme of Part VI

[132]                     
The question of whether what the police did under this general warrant
is an interception of a private communication is one of statutory
interpretation.  In my view, when we read the text of the statutory provisions
in its full context, it is clear that the general warrant does not authorize an
interception that requires a Part VI authorization. 

[133]                     
As a general rule, the police require an authorization to intercept
private communications by means of any electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical
or other device. The key words are thus “intercept” and “private communication”. 


[134]                     
The word “intercept” is given a non-exhaustive definition: it includes
“listen to, record or acquire a communication or acquire the substance, meaning
or purport thereof” (s. 183).  The definition of the term “private
communication” is linked to the concept of interception. Stripping the
definition of “private communication” down to its essentials, a private
communication is a communication made “under circumstances in which it is
reasonable for the originator to expect that it will not be intercepted by any
person other than the person intended by the originator to receive it” (s.
183).  

[135]                     
There is no doubt that the text message is a private communication. As
we shall see, there is also no doubt that text messages were intercepted by
Telus by means of an electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device.
The question is whether the police also intercepted those messages when Telus
turned over to them copies of sent and received messages previously intercepted
by Telus and stored in its databases. 

[136]                     
This brings me to a fuller examination of the purpose, text and scheme
of the wiretap provisions.  In my view, this analysis sheds the most light on
Parliament’s intent as to whether the technique adopted by the police in this
case constitutes an interception. The relevant provisions are set out in the
Appendix.

[137]                     
Fundamental to both the purpose and to the scheme of the provisions is
the distinction between the interception of private communications and the
disclosure, use or retention of private communications that have been
intercepted. The purpose, text and scheme of Part VI show that the disclosure,
use or retention of intercepted private communications is distinct from the act
of interception itself. 

[138]                     
When the original wiretap provisions were introduced in 1973, the
explanatory note to the Bill outlined that one of its purposes was to create
three distinct types of offences. Two are relevant to this case. The first
offence relates to the interception of private communications by the use
of any electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device. The second
relates to the disclosure of private communications intercepted by the
use of any such device (Explanatory Note, Bill C-176, Protection of Privacy
Act, 1st Sess., 29th Parl. (S.C. 1973-74, c. 50)). While explanatory notes
are less authoritative than legislated statements of purpose, they nonetheless
provide some insight to legislative purpose: R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the
Construction of Statutes (5th ed. 2008), at p. 272. The explanatory note thus
shows that from its inception, one of the purposes of the legislation was to
distinguish between interceptions of private communications and the subsequent
and separate acts of disclosure or use of intercepted private communications.
This shows that Parliament understood interception and disclosure of
intercepted communications to be different things and therefore did not intend
to include disclosure or use of intercepted communications as part of the
concept of interception.

[139]                     
An early commentator on the legislation noticed that this distinction
was fundamental to the statutory scheme.  David Watt (now Watt J.A. at the
Ontario Court of Appeal) considered whether or not replaying, rehearing, or
re-recording a previously recorded conversation constituted an “interception”
and concluded: 

Each replaying or rehearing of the original
interception may well constitute [a] use or disclosure of the intercepted
communication within the relevant prohibition but, use or disclosure is not,
perforce, interception, and to equate the two is to ignore the fundamental
statutory distinction between them. [Emphasis added.]

 

(Law of Electronic
Surveillance in Canada (1979), at p. 44) 

[140]                     
This distinction between interception and disclosure is reflected in the
structure of the offence-creating provisions in Part VI. In other words, the
text of the legislation precisely reflects the purpose set out in the
Explanatory Note. Part VI creates distinct offences reflecting the purpose set
out in the Explanatory Note. 

[141]                     
One offence, as noted, prohibits the interception of a private
communication. Section 184 of the Code provides that “[e]very one
who, by means of any electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device,
willfully intercepts a private communication is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years”.  There
are a number of exceptions which I will review shortly. The other offence is
concerned with disclosure or use of intercepted information. Section 193
of the Code provides that it is an indictable offence to use or disclose
the content or existence of an intercepted communication without the consent of
the originator or the person intended to receive it.  Once again, there are
several exceptions which I will return to in a moment. The enactment of these
two distinct offences underlines that the act of interception and the act of
disclosure or use of intercepted communications are distinct acts which receive
distinct treatment under the statutory scheme.  

[142]                     
Turning to the first offence which deals with interceptions, there are
several “saving provisions” that exclude certain acts that would otherwise
constitute illegal interceptions.  These exclusions from liability are relevant
to understanding the statutory scheme because they distinguish interception
of communications from use or retention of intercepted communications.
It is not necessary to go into all of the details, but the exemptions from
criminal liability fall into three categories. It is not an offence to
intercept a private communication by means of an electro-magnetic, acoustic,
mechanical or other device if (i) the interception occurs with consent (s.
184(2)(a)); (ii) the interception is authorized in accordance with the
authorization provisions (s. 184(2)(b)); or (iii) the interception is
done for the purposes of providing a communications service or by a servant of
Her Majesty engaged in radio frequency spectrum management, or for the purposes
of managing or protecting a computer system (s. 184(2)(c), (d) and
(e)). 

[143]                     
The important point is that the third of these saving provisions — the
one in relation to computer system interceptions — makes a distinction between interception
on the one hand and use or retention of the intercepted
communications on the other.  Section 184(2)(e) excludes from the
offence the interception of a private communication passing through a computer
system by a person in control of it, provided that the interception is
reasonably necessary for managing the quality of service or protecting the
computer system.  This exception is qualified by s. 184(3), which relies on the
distinction between interception and use or retention. Under s.
184(3), a private communication intercepted by a person in control of a
computer system may only be used or retained if it is essential to
prevent harm to the system or if it is disclosed as provided for elsewhere in
the legislation. 

[144]                     
Thus, within the interception offence provisions, there is a distinction
made between interceptions and the use or retention of intercepted
communications. This suggests that Parliament viewed those acts as different
and distinct.

[145]                     
That brings us to the second offence in the scheme, the offence
prohibiting the use or disclosure of previously intercepted private
communications. Under s. 193(1), it is an offence to use or disclose
the content or existence of a private communication that has been intercepted
without consent. Note that the use and disclosure offence relates to a “private
communication or any part thereof or the substance, meaning or purport
thereof”.  The existence of this offence as something distinct from the
interception offence shows that Parliament treated interception and disclosure
or use as distinct concepts.

[146]                     
A comparison of the exemptions in ss. 184 and 193 reinforces my
position. The exemptions in s. 193 are far more permissive than those in s.
184, especially with respect to criminal investigations. Under s. 184, police
can only intercept communications if they are authorized to do so (s. 184(2)(b))
or in certain exceptional circumstances (s. 184.4). By contrast, s. 193
includes broad exemptions that permit disclosure of intercepted communications
in a range of circumstances including in the course of civil or criminal
proceedings (s. 193(2)(a)), and “in the course of or for the purpose of
any criminal investigation” (s. 193(2)(b)). Had Parliament understood
disclosure of intercepted private communications to be a form of interception,
one would expect substantial correspondence between the exemptions relating to
interception and those relating to disclosure. This is plainly not the case.

[147]                     
This point is even further supported by a comparison of the particular
exemptions that apply to communication service providers, set out in ss. 193(2)
and 184(2).  Recall that providers of communication services are exempt from
the interception offence when they intercept communications for the purposes of
service delivery (s. 184(2)(c)). There is a comparable exemption for
service providers in relation to the disclosure offence. Section 193(2)(d)
exempts from criminal liability disclosures in the course of the operation of a
communications or computer system, provided that the disclosure is necessarily
incidental to the purposes which provide such operators with an exemption from
the interception offence. Thus, operators of communications systems such as
Telus are exempted in certain circumstances from both the interception offence
and the disclosure offence. This further underlines that Parliament viewed
these activities as distinct. 

[148]                     
To sum up, the legislative scheme creates two distinct offences, one
which deals with interception and the other with use or disclosure of a
communication. Fundamental to the scheme is the distinction between these
activities:  if disclosure or use of a private communication were an
interception of it, there would be no need to create the distinct disclosure or
use offence.  Similarly, the exemptions from criminal liability show that
Parliament distinguished between interception on one hand and retention, use
and disclosure on the other. 

                    2.     Did the General Warrant
Authorize an Interception of a Private Communication? 

[149]                     
How does this relate to what Telus and the police were doing under the
general warrant in this case?  To begin with Telus, no one disputes that it was
intercepting text messages when it copied them for its own systems
administration purposes. Similarly, it is agreed (and I will accept for the
purposes of this appeal) that Telus did not commit the offence of unlawful
interception. It performed interceptions for a permitted purpose which was
exempted from criminal liability. Section 184(2)(c) makes it clear that
it is not an offence for communication service providers such as Telus to
intercept private communications where that is necessary for, among other
things, quality control purposes.  Under s. 193(2)(d), they also, for
the same purposes, can disclose the intercepted communications without
incurring criminal liability. There is, therefore, no question for the purposes
of this appeal that Telus lawfully intercepted private communications.

[150]                     
What about the actions of the police under the general warrant?  They
sought disclosure from Telus of information that it had already lawfully
intercepted. The general warrant did not require Telus to intercept
communications, but to provide copies of communications that it had previously
intercepted for its own lawful purposes. There is no suggestion that Telus was
carrying out these interceptions at the bidding of the police; interceptions
carried out for police purposes would clearly require authorizations as they
would not fall within the exempt purposes under s. 184(2)(c). However,
as the scheme of the legislation makes clear, disclosure or use of a lawfully
intercepted communication is not an interception.  As discussed in detail
earlier, Part VI of the Code makes a fundamental distinction between, on
one hand, intercepting — i.e. listening to, recording or acquiring a
communication or the substance, meaning or purport thereof — and, on the other,
using or disclosing a private communication or the substance, meaning or
purport thereof or disclosing the existence of the communication. This
distinction is recognized by the purposes of the provisions, by the creation of
distinct offences for unlawful interception and unlawful use or disclosure and
by the saving provisions which apply to the interception and disclosure
offences. 

[151]                     
In my view, it is inconsistent with the fundamental distinction made by
the legislation to conclude that the police were intercepting private
communications when Telus provided them with copies of previously intercepted
and stored text messages.

                    3.      Abella J.’s Reasons

[152]                     
That brings me to Abella J.’s reasons. She would hold that the general
warrant purported to authorize an interception because it allowed for  “the prospective
production of future text messages from a service provider’s computer” (para.
15 (emphasis in original)); the fact that the messages were stored in a
database is simply a “technical” difference in Telus’s service delivery system
that should not “deprive Telus subscribers of the protection of the Code”
(para. 3). Therefore, a wiretap authorization, not a general warrant, was
required. This interpretation relies on the fact that the word “intercept” is
defined to include “acquire a communication or . . . the substance, meaning or
purport thereof” (s. 183) and the fact that wiretap authorizations are
prospective in nature.  I do not find this approach convincing for three
reasons.

[153]                     
My first difficulty is that Abella J.’s approach does not give effect to
the clear distinction in the statute between interception and disclosure.  For
reasons I set out earlier, this distinction cannot in my view be dismissed as a
mere “technical difference”. The distinction is fundamental to the scheme of
the provisions. Parliament treated “interception” and “disclosure” as separate
acts, giving rise to different offences and different exemptions, even though
they may relate to the same private communications. When Telus turns over to the
police the copies of the communications that it has previously intercepted,
Telus is disclosing the communications, not intercepting them again.  I do not
understand how this disclosure by Telus from its databases can be an
interception by the police.  

[154]                     
 The second difficulty with my colleague’s position relates to her
reliance on the definition of “intercept” in s. 183 and particularly on the
fact that “intercept” includes “acquire the substance, meaning or purport” of a
private communication. Read broadly, this definition of “intercept” means that
any time the police acquire the content of a private communication by means of
any electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device, they have engaged
in an interception.   In my view, the context and purpose of Part VI require
the phrase “acquire the substance, meaning or purport” of a private
communication to be read more narrowly.  

[155]                     
To begin, “acquire” must be understood in the context of the text
surrounding it; it is found in a list that includes “listen to” and “record”,
both activities that occur simultaneously with the communication being
intercepted.  It is also used to explain the word “intercept” and I think it is
clear that there are many ways to acquire the content of a communication that
could not be thought of as an interception. Moreover, if, as my colleague
Abella J. maintains (at para. 37), “[a]cquiring the substance of a private
communication from a computer maintained by a telecommunications service
provider” constitutes an interception, then wiretap authorizations may well be
required for a host of searches that are clearly not contemplated by Part VI of
the Code.  Police may well have to obtain a Part VI authorization any
time they want access to the content of private communications, no matter when
the message has been sent or whether it has been received or stored on the
recipient’s device.  For example, on a broad reading of “acquire” police
seizing e-mails on a BlackBerry device would be engaged in an interception
because they are acquiring the content of private communications. Similarly, a
person authorized to search a computer system as contemplated under s. 487(2.1)
would need a wiretap authorization to seize copies of personal communications
stored on those computers (including, for example, e-mail messages and stored
copies of Internet chats). This approach would run counter to a line of cases
in which Canadian courts have found that search warrants are sufficient to
allow police to access documents and data stored on a computer: see, e.g., R.
v. Cole, 2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34, at para. 73; R. v. Jones,
2011 ONCA 632, 107 O.R. (3d) 241, at para. 33; R. v. Bahr, 2006 ABPC
360, 434 A.R. 1; R. v. Cross, 2007 Can LII 64141 (Ont. S.C.J.), at
paras. 25-27; R. v. Little, 2009 CanLII 41212 (Ont. S.C.J.), at
para. 154; R. v. Tse, 2008 BCSC 906 (CanLII), at para. 198; R. v.
Weir, 2001 ABCA 181, 281 A.R. 333, at para. 19. If the phrase
“acquire a communication or . . . the substance, meaning or purport thereof” is
given a broad meaning, stored private communications that have long been
accessible to police under ordinary search warrants or production orders would
fall under Part VI. 

[156]                     
As I see it, such a broad reading of “acquire” is inappropriate, given
the scheme and purpose of the wiretap provisions. I will not repeat the
analysis set out above.  It flows from that analysis, however, that acquiring
the content of a previously intercepted and stored communication cannot be an
interception because that broad reading is inconsistent with the clear
distinction between interception and disclosure in the provisions. Applied
broadly, this interpretation of “acquire” would extend the scope of
investigative techniques which require wiretap authorizations far beyond
anything ever previously contemplated.

[157]                     
That brings me to the temporal aspect of interception that Abella J.
introduces, which is the third difficulty I see with her approach.  As I
understand it, the acquisition of the content of a private communication is an
interception if the acquisition is authorized prospectively.  It follows that
whether or not an act constitutes an interception depends not on the nature or
timing of the act itself, but on when the act is authorized.  It necessarily
follows that the seizure of previously intercepted and stored text messages
would not be an interception as long as it was authorized after the
messages were stored.  The police could obtain a production order at the end of
every day during the period covered by the general warrant and there would be
no interception. However, under this prospective authorization test, if the
police were to seize the exact same information, in the same form and by the
same means pursuant to an authorization issued before the messages were
stored, they would be engaging in an interception. This approach seems to me to
confuse the act of interception with the nature of its authorization.

[158]                     
Interception is a technique, a way of acquiring the substance of a
private communication.  I do not understand how it could be that exactly the
same technique, which acquires information in exactly the same form, may be
either a seizure of stored material or an interception, depending on the point
in time at which the technique is authorized. But that is the result of my
colleague Abella J.’s analysis. I cannot accept this conclusion.

                    4.      The Conclusion on the
First Issue

[159]                     
In my view, the investigative technique which the police were authorized
to use by the general warrant was not an interception within the meaning of the
wiretap provisions of the Code. 

B.     Second
Issue:  If the Seizure of the Stored Text Messages Is Not an Interception, Is
the Issuance of a General Warrant Nevertheless Barred by the “No Other Provision”
Requirement in Section 487.01(1)(c) Because the Technique Sought to Be
Authorized Was Substantively the Equivalent of a Wiretap?

[160]                     
My colleague Moldaver J., like Abella J., would set aside the general
warrant because the police did not meet the “no other provision” requirement in
s. 487.01(1)(c).  However, Moldaver J. reaches this conclusion by a
different route which, as I understand it, relies on three main points. First,
the general warrant is one of limited resort that should be used sparingly
(para. 56).  I respectfully do not accept this general proposition or the
result to which its adoption leads in this case. Second, the technique proposed
by police in this case is “substantively” the same as an interception and
therefore cannot be authorized under s. 487.01(1) because of the “no other
provision” requirement in para. (c). Respectfully, as I see it, the
“substantive equivalency” test is not part of the analysis under s. 487.01(1)(c)
and would not apply to the facts of this case even if it were. Third, given
this “substantive” similarity, police resort to the general warrant amounts to
a “misuse” of s. 487.01 , a “convenient way” for police to avoid the rigours of
wiretap authorizations. While I share my colleague’s view that the courts
should be vigilant for undue extension and abuse of the general warrant
provisions, my respectful view is that this is an inappropriate case in which
to give effect to those concerns. 

                    1.      The Purpose of the
General Warrant Provision

[161]                     
Moldaver J. counsels against literal interpretation of the provisions
and espouses a purposive one.  Of course, I agree that all legislation must be
interpreted purposively.  I respectfully part company about what results from a
purposive interpretation of this provision. 

[162]                     
I begin with the purposes of the general warrant provision. I do not
accept that the purpose of s. 487.01(1) is to provide authorizations only in
very limited circumstances and that it therefore must only be used “sparingly”.
On the contrary, as numerous authorities have acknowledged, the provision is
cast in wide terms.  As one leading commentator put it: 

                             Through
s. 487.01 (and s. 487.02 ), Parliament has provided a broad, plenary
warrant-granting power intended to ensure that judicial authorization is
legally available for virtually any investigative technique that can be brought
within the Hunter conditions for judicial pre-authorization. 

 

(S. C. Hutchison,
Hutchison’s Canadian Search Warrant Manual 2005 (2nd ed. 2004), at p. 143) 

When the Ontario Court of Appeal
considered this issue in R. v. Ha, 2009 ONCA 340, 96 O.R. (3d) 751, at
para. 35, leave to appeal refused, [2009] 3 S.C.R. vii, it rejected a
restrictive interpretation of s. 487.01. Rather, the court affirmed the remedial
character of s. 487.01 and cited its previous holding in R. v. Lauda
(1998), 37 O.R. (3d) 513, at pp. 522-23, aff’d [1998] 2 S.C.R. 683, to the
effect that the general warrant provides for a flexible range of investigative
procedures; see also R. v. Noseworthy (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 641,
at p. 644. 

[163]                     
Taking into account this understanding of the purpose of s. 487.01, I
approach the interpretation of the provision differently than my colleague. In
particular, I do not accept as an imperative that s. 487.01 must be interpreted
with a view to heavily restricting its use. The focus of the inquiry is on two
matters (in addition of course to reasonable grounds to believe that an offence
has been committed and that information concerning the offence will be obtained): 
Is authorization for the “technique, procedure or device to be used or the
thing to be done” provided for in any other federal statute and is it in the
best interests of the administration of justice to authorize it to be done?  

[164]                     
Turning from the purpose of s. 487.01 to the text and purpose of s.
487.01(1)(c) specifically, its focus is on the means by which an
investigation is carried out, not its objective.  Section 487.01(1)(c)
provides that a general warrant may issue if “there is no other provision . . .
that would provide for a warrant, authorization or order permitting the
technique, procedure or device to be used or the thing to be done”. The
words “technique”, “procedure”, “device to be used” and “thing to be done” all
are concerned with what the police want to do, not why they want
to do it. This paragraph does not require issuing judges to consider whether
other techniques are similar or allow access to the same evidence; it simply
asks if the same technique can be authorized by another provision. 

[165]                     
The jurisprudence under this provision has consistently taken this
approach.  MacPherson J.A. made this point in Ha when he observed, at
para. 43, that 

[t]he focus in the s. 487.01(1)(c) analysis is
not on whether there are other investigative techniques that might accomplish
the purported investigative purposes or goals of the police; rather the
focus is on the particular investigative technique or procedure that the police
seek to utilize and whether it can properly be authorized by another provision.
[Emphasis added.] 

This is not simply a narrow, literal interpretation
of s. 487.01. Rather, it is an interpretation that reflects its purpose of
conferring a broad judicial discretion to authorize the police to “use any
device or investigative technique or procedure or do any thing”,
provided of course that the judge is satisfied that it is in the best interests
of the administration of justice to do so, having due regard to the importance
of the constitutional right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. 
I completely agree with MacPherson J.A., writing for the Ontario Court of
Appeal in Ha, when he said that he saw “no policy reason for struggling
to constrain the scope of s. 487.01 by adding words that were not expressly
included by Parliament in the provision” (para. 37).

[166]                     
I note that Moldaver J. relies on this same paragraph in Ha to
support the view that investigative goals are to be taken into account in the
s. 487.01(1)(c) analysis, suggesting that in this passage MacPherson
J.A. adopted an approach which considered “substantive” differences between
various techniques (para. 70). Read in full, however, MacPherson J.A.’s reasons
do not support that proposition. As I see it, MacPherson J.A. was not
“[e]xplaining why the search sanctioned . . . in Ha was . . .
substantively different from one involving multiple conventional warrants”
(Moldaver J., at para. 70). This is clear not only in the portions of the
paragraph which I cite above, but also from the way MacPherson J.A. summarizes
his conclusion, at para. 41: “The simple fact is that there is no provision . .
. that would authorize an unlimited number of covert entries and searches on
private property over a two-month period.”  In performing the s. 487.01(1)(c)
analysis, MacPherson J.A. simply compared the search for which the police
sought authorization under a general warrant with other search provisions and
concluded that none of them would permit authorization of what the police
sought to do.

[167]                     
Similarly, in R. v. Brand, 2008 BCCA 94, 229 C.C.C. (3d) 443 (sub
nom. R. v. Ford), at para. 50, Frankel J.A. for the court stated that
“[r]esort to a general warrant is only precluded when judicial approval for the
proposed ‘technique, procedure or device or the doing of the thing’ is
available under some other federal statutory provision.” There is no hint in
his reasons that there is any substantive equivalency or investigative
necessity analysis required.

[168]                     
I am reinforced in my reading of s. 487.01(1)(c) by a comparison
of that paragraph with s. 186(1)(b) which sets out the investigative
necessity requirement that must be met before a wiretap can be issued. According
to s. 186(1)(b) an authorization under that section cannot be given
unless the judge is satisfied 

that other investigative procedures have been tried and
have failed, other investigative procedures are unlikely to succeed or the
urgency of the matter is such that it would be impractical to carry out the
investigation of the offence using only other investigative procedures. 

In R. v. Araujo, 2000 SCC 65, [2000] 2 S.C.R.
992, the Court established that, under s. 186(1)(b), a judge cannot
issue an intercept authorization unless she is satisfied that “practically
speaking” there is “no other reasonable alternative method of investigation, in
the circumstances of the particular criminal inquiry” (para. 29 (emphasis
deleted)). The standard set by Parliament here is high; it is not enough that
an interception would be “more efficacious” than some other available
technique, it must be necessary to the investigation (Araujo, at
para. 39).  

[169]                     
By contrast, under s. 487.01(1)(c), a judge only needs to be
satisfied that the proposed technique cannot be authorized by provisions in the
Code or some other Act of Parliament. The judge does not, in addition,
need to be satisfied that the novel technique is necessary to the investigation
or that it is not the substantive equivalent of something that can be
authorized elsewhere. Parliament knew how to direct an issuing judge or justice
to consider whether other investigative techniques would achieve the
investigative objective.  It did so in s. 186(1)(b).  It did not do so
in s. 487.01(1)(c). 

[170]                     
Of course, this does not mean that the court should authorize anything
the police seek to do simply because it is not authorized elsewhere.  The
judicial discretion to issue the warrant must give full effect to the
protection of reasonable expectations of privacy as set out in the abundant
jurisprudence under s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms . Judges should not exercise their discretion so as to permit the
police to use the general warrant to evade the pre-authorization requirements
that Parliament has imposed on certain investigative techniques. However, as I
will explain, my view is that those concerns should be addressed directly and
specifically under s. 487.01(1) (b) when they arise, not by reading in a
limitation in s. 487.01(1) (c) that is not there. 

[171]                     
To sum up on this point, there is no support in the text or the
purpose   of s. 487.01(1)(c), or in the jurisprudence, for building into
it a “substantive equivalency” test.  The paragraph asks a simple question:
Does federal legislation provide for “a warrant, authorization or order
permitting the technique, procedure or device to be used or the thing to be
done”?  Where this threshold is met, the judge is entitled to consider granting
the requested authorization.  The further question of whether the authorization
ought to be granted is not the focus of this paragraph of the section.
Rather, as I will explain, whether a general warrant ought to issue
is properly considered under s. 487.01(1)(b), which asks whether
authorizing the warrant would be in the best interests of the administration of
justice. Not only, in my view, is this approach supported by the text, purpose
and jurisprudence.  The alternative proposed by Moldaver J. also creates
unnecessary uncertainty and distracts the issuing judge from the question of
whether the technique sought to be authorized is inconsistent with the right to
be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.  

[172]                     
I turn first to my concern about uncertainty. In my view, predictability
and clarity in the law are particularly important in the area of judicial
pre-authorization of searches. Judicial pre-authorization is a cornerstone of
the Charter ’s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. 
The primary objective of pre-authorization is not to identify unreasonable
searches after the fact, but to ensure that unreasonable searches are not
conducted. The requirements for pre-authorization should be as clear as
possible to ensure that Charter  rights are fully protected. 

[173]                     
Clarity also serves an important practical objective. Generally, and
unlike in this case, challenges to judicial pre-authorization of searches are
made after the fact at trial. If successful, the admissibility of the evidence
obtained under the authorized search is put at risk. The police cannot undo,
after the fact, that during their investigation, they relied on what is
ultimately found to be a defective authorization. This makes it of great
practical importance for the law to be clear to judges and justices who are
asked to authorize searches and to police officers who seek authorization. 

[174]                     
The approach adopted by my colleague Moldaver J. in my view is seriously
deficient in this regard. No guidance is provided as to when one investigative
technique should be found to be substantively the same as another and when the
differences are merely technical.  As I will discuss in the next section of my
reasons, this uncertainty is apparent from my colleague’s application of the
“substantive equivalency” test in this case.

[175]                     
Moreover, my view is that adopting this approach to s. 487.01(1)(c)
will not assist issuing judges in giving effect to the constitutional guarantee
of freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures.  That issue should be
addressed directly under s. 487.01(1)(b), not through a vague,
unnecessary and largely semantic exercise of comparing how much one technique
may be like another.  As I shall discuss, even when that question is addressed
directly in this case, the arguments against issuing the general warrant are,
in my respectful view, unconvincing.

                    2.      The “Substantive
Equivalency” of the Proposed Technique and an Interception

[176]                     
Even if I were to accept (which I do not) that s. 487.01(1)(c) is
concerned with the substantive equivalency of various investigative techniques,
I would not find the technique sought to be authorized here to be the
substantive equivalent of a wiretap authorization. According to my colleague
Moldaver J., the general warrant in this case authorized a technique that was
in substance an interception “because it prospectively authorizes police
access to future private communications on a continual basis over
a sustained period of time. . . .  But for the 24-hour time delay, the
investigative techniques were the same” (paras. 61 and 68 (emphasis in
original)).

[177]                     
Respectfully, this assertion is not borne out by the facts nor
consistent with the law. 

[178]                     
Turning first to the facts, a wiretap authorization alone would not
allow the police to obtain the information that Telus was required to provide
under the general warrant. In fact, as the evidence from Telus shows, three
separate authorizations would be required in order to provide the police with
the means to access the information provided to them under the general warrant.
As I explained above, when Telus responds to a wiretap authorization, it
installs a device which re-routes in real time a copy of each text message sent
to and from a particular number to the police. The general warrant in this case
requires Telus to do more: it has to sort through its databases to deliver
stored text messages and it also has to provide the relevant subscriber
information relating to them. 

[179]                     
In her affidavit filed before the reviewing judge, Corinne McNish, a
Telus Security Analyst, indicated that three different authorizations would be
necessary to obtain the information required under the general warrant: an
authorization under s. 492.2(1) for a dial number recorder; an authorization
under s. 492.2(2) to obtain telephone records; and a Part VI authorization. I
would add that, in order to make use of a Part VI authorization, police would
have to secure a wire room or listening post to receive the messages as well as
officers to process the incoming information, to deal with the information
obtained from the dial number recorder and to sort through the telephone
records. 

[180]                     
In light of Telus’s own evidence, then, it seems to me to be quite a
stretch to assert that the investigative techniques were substantively the
same. 

[181]                     
Notwithstanding these clear and significant differences between the two
techniques, my colleague relies heavily on two facts in concluding that the
techniques were substantively the same:  the fact that there was only a 24-hour
time delay in the police gaining access to the information under the general
warrant and that the general warrant authorized the turning over of the stored
messages “prospectively”. As I see it, the first fact is not correct and the
second does not support the conclusion drawn from it.

[182]                     
 Turning first to the time delay, my colleague finds that the time delay
between when the messages were sent and when they were to be received by police
was short enough that their production would constitute the substantive
equivalent of an interception. While Moldaver J. declines to identify the point
at which the period of delay would render the proposed technique substantively
different from an interception, he concludes that “the 24-hour gap here fell
short of the mark” (footnote 2).  Respectfully, I cannot agree for two reasons.


[183]                     
First, as the general warrant itself makes clear, some of the messages
that police were to receive would be delayed by 72 hours, not 24. The productions
ordered under the general warrant were to begin on March 30, 2010, and end on
April 16, 2010. On Tuesday March 30, Telus was to produce information from
March 18 to March 30, and the Crown concedes that this could have been obtained
by a production order and therefore could not be the subject of a general
warrant. Applied over the next two and a half weeks, the general warrant
created two different time gaps, as I described earlier. On Tuesday through
Friday, Telus was required to provide by 2:00 p.m. each day the messages sent
and received between 11:00 a.m. the previous day and 11:00 a.m. that day.  
However, on weekends, there was a longer “gap”.  By 2:00 p.m. on Mondays, Telus
was required to provide the messages stored between 11:00 a.m. the previous
Friday and 11:00 a.m. on Monday.  Thus, for twelve days, production was daily.
However, on weekends, or for six days covered by the general warrant, there was
a longer “gap” of   72 hours. The question therefore arises whether that
72-hour delay also “fell short of the mark” and if not, whether police would
need different authorizations for the messages they received on Mondays than
they would for the messages they received on the other days of the week. 

[184]                     
Second, because I agree with the reviewing judge that police could
have obtained a series of daily production orders, I have difficulty
accepting that the 24-hour “gap” on which Moldaver J. relies makes the general
warrant substantively equivalent to an interception. A series of daily
production orders would have provided police with copies of the text messages
within 24 hours of the time that they were sent. On my colleague’s
understanding of what is substantively an interception, then, some production orders
could also be the equivalent of interceptions.  This, as I see it, underlines
the confusion and uncertainty inherent in the substantive equivalency approach
to s. 487.01(1)(c).

[185]                     
The second fact advanced in support of the finding of substantive equivalency
is that the authorization is “prospective”.  As I pointed out earlier, however,
it is hard to understand how exactly the same technique either is or is not
equivalent to an interception, depending on the point in time that it is
authorized. If we accept for the purposes of this appeal, which I do, that the
police could lawfully obtain daily production orders, I simply cannot
understand how authorizing that technique two weeks earlier converts the
production order into a wiretap authorization.

[186]                     
Finally, the conclusion of substantive equivalency is inconsistent with
the text and scheme of the wiretap provisions themselves. As I have explained
at length earlier, the act of disclosure of previously intercepted private
communication has been identified and treated in the Code as a separate
and distinct act from that of interception itself. With respect, I cannot
accept that what Parliament has made a legally significant distinction is
merely a technical difference. 

[187]                     
To sum up, even if one were to accept reading into s. 487.01(1)(c)
a “substantive equivalency” test, neither the facts nor the law would support
its application in this case, in my respectful view. 

[188]                     
This also underlines, as I see it, the confusion and uncertainty that
would flow from adopting such a test.  My colleague provides no meaningful
guidance on this point aside from a 24-hour “gap” guideline.  The latter is
problematic, however, because it conflicts with the availability of daily
production orders under s. 487.012.  In my view, issuing judges and police
investigators should not be left to draw the line on their own and then to
hope, with little reason for optimism, that they will be found to have been
right after a voir dire at a future trial.

                    3.      Dealing
With Abuses of General Warrants

[189]                     
This brings us to the real heart of the matter: whether the general
warrant should not have been issued because it represents, as my colleague
would have it, a “misuse” of s. 487.01, an “easy way out”, or a “convenient
way”, “device” or “hook”, that allows the police to  “escape the rigours” of
Part VI (paras. 72, 81, 90 and 105). As I read Moldaver J.’s reasons, the
proposed interpretation of s. 487.01(1)(c) is driven by a need to
preclude abuses of the general warrant power. I accept that judges asked to
issue general warrants must be vigilant to ensure that the right to be free
against unreasonable searches and seizures is fully given effect by any
investigative technique that is authorized. However, my view is that this
analysis should be undertaken directly under s. 487.01(1)(b), not
through the lens of asking the question of whether two techniques are
substantively equivalent.

[190]                     
As MacPherson J.A. wisely pointed out in Ha, the “no other
provision” requirement in s. 487.01(1)(c)  is not the only requirement
that must be met before a general warrant may be issued (para. 44).  The
section should not be approached on the assumption that Parliament intended
that every investigative technique not authorized elsewhere could be authorized
under s. 487.01(1): see, e.g., S. Coughlan, “R. v. Ha: Upholding General
Warrants without Asking the Right Questions” (2009), 65 C.R. (6th) 41. Rather,
the judge asked to issue the warrant must also be satisfied that it is in the
best interests of the administration of justice to authorize the particular
technique (s. 487.01(1)(b)).  This is the provision under which
potential abuses of the general warrant should be addressed, in my view. Of
course, even where the requirements in s. 487.01(1)(b) and (c)
are met, s. 487.01(3) requires that a general warrant contain “such terms and
conditions as the judge considers advisable to ensure that any search or
seizure authorized by the warrant is reasonable in the circumstances”. 

[191]                     
Section 487.01(1)(b) was not raised in this appeal and I do not
want to say much about it beyond my view that it is the place in s. 487.01 that
addresses concerns about whether a new investigative technique is one that
should be authorized. That said, I do not find Moldaver J.’s concerns raised
under the rubric of the proposed “substantive equivalency” test at all
compelling.

[192]                     
First, I would not conclude that police sought a general warrant in this
case as a “convenient way” to avoid the rigours of Part VI.  Of course, there
is no evidence of that.  Second, I do not agree with the claim that the privacy
interests at stake in this case are exactly the same as those in issue where a
wiretap authorization is sought.  The reviewing judge accepted, and I agree,
that warrants could issue daily to provide the police with copies of the stored
messages.  I fail to see how the affected privacy interests are different if
permission to do that is granted two weeks in advance.  Third, for all of the
reasons identified by the reviewing judge, the general warrant was a more
practical approach than a series of production orders. Fourth, the general
warrant authorized a technique that was not only different from an interception
but was also more responsive to the needs of police. In particular, it
significantly reduced the burden on the police in terms of resources to staff a
wire room, and to extract information from subscriber records and dial number
recorders.  As I see it, the general warrant achieved the legitimate aims of
the police investigation in a much more convenient and cost-effective manner
than any other provision would have allowed.

[193]                     
Of course, the general warrant had the effect of shifting costs to
Telus. But that has nothing to do with the privacy interests of the
subscribers. Moreover, Telus advanced evidence and argument in relation to the
burden the general warrant placed on it, but those submissions were flatly
rejected by the reviewing judge and not renewed in this Court. 

[194]                     
On the record before us, I do not see evidence of “misuse” of s. 487.01
or an attempt by police to “escape the rigours” of Part VI.  What I see is effective
and practical police investigation by a relatively small municipal police force
which is fully respectful of the privacy interests of the targets of the
investigation and other Telus subscribers.

C.     Conclusion

[195]                     
For these reasons, I find that the general warrant did not authorize an
interception requiring a Part VI wiretap authorization and that the “no other
provision” requirement of s. 487.01(1)(c) was met.

IV.    Disposition

[196]                     
I would dismiss the appeal.

PART
VI

        183. In this Part,

. . .

“intercept” includes listen to, record or acquire a communication or
acquire the substance, meaning or purport thereof;

. . .


“private communication” means any oral communication, or any
telecommunication, that is made by an originator who is in Canada or is

is made under circumstances in which it is reasonable for the originator to
expect that it will not be intercepted by any person other than the person
intended by the originator to receive it, and includes any radio-based
telephone communication that is treated electronically or otherwise for the purpose
of preventing intelligible reception by any person other than the person
intended by the originator to receive it;

. . .

        184. (1) Every one who, by means of any electro-magnetic, acoustic,
mechanical or other device, wilfully intercepts a private communication is
guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not
exceeding five years.

        (2)
Subsection (1) does not apply to 

(a) a
person who has the consent to intercept, express or implied, of the originator
of the private communication or of the person intended by the originator
thereof to receive it;

(b) a
person who intercepts a private communication in accordance with an
authorization or pursuant to section 184.4 or any person who in good faith aids
in any way another person who the aiding person believes on reasonable grounds
is acting with an authorization or pursuant to section 184.4;

(c) a
person engaged in providing a telephone, telegraph or other communication
service to the public who intercepts a private communication,

(i) if the
interception is necessary for the purpose of providing the service,

a transmission; or

(e) a
person, or any person acting on their behalf, in possession or control of a
computer system, as defined in subsection 342.1(2), who intercepts a private
communication originating from, directed to or transmitting through that
computer system, if the interception is reasonably necessary for

(i) managing
the quality of service of the computer system as it relates to performance
factors such as the responsiveness and capacity of the system as well as the
integrity and availability of the system and data, or

(ii) protecting
the computer system against any act that would be an offence under subsection 342.1(1)
or 430(1.1).

private communication intercepted by a person referred to in paragraph (2)(e)
can be used or retained only if

(a) it

[1]
The validity of a series of daily (or more frequent) production orders
was not argued by the parties, nor is addressing that issue necessary to
resolve this appeal.  Accordingly, I would not decide whether there exists any
statutory or constitutional bar to the police seeking such orders.





[2] It is neither prudent nor necessary to draw a bright line in this
case as to when the period of delay would render the search technique substantively
different such that a general warrant would be acceptable.  Whatever that
timeframe may be, the 24-hour gap here fell short of the mark.  To the extent that
uncertainty arises in a future case, it must be resolved in keeping with the
approach to s. 487.01(1)(c) articulated here.  I also note that my
colleague Cromwell J. makes much of the fact that “some of the messages that
police were to receive would be delayed by 72 hours, not 24” (para. 183).  With
respect, I find his emphasis on this fact puzzling.  Even if one assumes that a
72-hour delay is substantively different from an intercept, it hardly follows
that because one part of an otherwise offensive authorization is valid,
the entire authorization should be spared.





[3]
The record in this case suggests that the entirety of the information
sought by the police could have been obtained pursuant to a Part VI
authorization, a number recorder under s. 492.2(1), and an order to obtain
telephone records under s. 492.2(2).  Before this Court, none of the parties
concentrated on the latter two authorizations; rather, they focused on whether
the warrant’s core — the delivery of text messages — amounted to an intercept.",2013-03-27 00:00:00,CA Supreme Court

alberta

                    Criminal
law — Sentencing —
Considerations — Collateral consequences of sentence — Accused sentenced to two
years’ imprisonment — Sentencing judge not made aware that sentence would
result in loss of right to appeal removal order under Immigration and Refugee
Protection Act — Court of Appeal refusing to vary sentence to two years less a
day — What weight should be attributed to collateral consequences in sentencing?
— Whether sentence can be varied by appellate court on basis that accused would
face collateral consequences — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 , ss. 718.1 ,
718.2 .

                    The
accused, a non‑citizen, was convicted of two drug‑related
offences.  In light of a joint submission by the Crown and defense counsel, the
sentencing judge imposed a sentence of two years’ imprisonment.  Under the Immigration
and Refugee Protection Act , a non‑citizen sentenced to a term of
imprisonment of at least two years loses the right to appeal a removal order
against him or her.  In the present case, neither party had raised the issue of
the collateral consequences of a two-year sentence on the accused’s immigration
status before the sentencing judge.  The majority of the Court of Appeal
dismissed the appeal and refused to vary the sentence. 

                    Held:
 The appeal should be allowed and the sentence of imprisonment reduced to two
years less a day.

                    A
sentencing judge may exercise his or her discretion to take collateral
immigration consequences into account, provided that the sentence ultimately
imposed is proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of
responsibility of the offender.  The significance of collateral immigration
consequences will depend on the facts of the case.  However, it remains that
they are but one of the relevant factors that a sentencing judge may take into
account in determining an appropriate sentence.  Those consequences must not be
allowed to skew the process either in favour of or against deportation. 
Further, it remains open to the sentencing judge to conclude that even a
minimal reduction of a sentence would render it inappropriate in light of the
gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.

                    An
appellate court has the authority to vary a sentence if the sentencing judge
was not aware of the collateral immigration consequences, or if counsel had
failed to advise the judge on this issue.  Where the matter was not raised
before the sentencing judge and where the Crown does not give its consent to
the appeal, some evidence should be adduced for consideration by the Court of
Appeal.  In the case at bar, the sentencing judge was unaware of the sentence’s
collateral immigration consequences and the Crown had conceded that sentence
should be reduced by one day.  It was wrong for the Court of Appeal to refuse
the sentence reduction based solely on the fact that the accused had a prior
criminal record or on its belief that the accused had abused the hospitality
that had been afforded to him by Canada.  It is therefore appropriate to grant
the variation of the sentence from two years to two years less a day.

                    The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

                    Wagner J. — 

I.  Introduction

[1]                             
The central issue in this appeal is whether a
sentence otherwise falling within the range of fit sentences can be varied by
an appellate court on the basis that the offender would face collateral
consequences under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.
2001, c. 27  (“IRPA ”), s. 64 , that were not taken into account by the
sentencing judge.  

[2]                             
Since the Crown conceded that, had it been aware
of the collateral consequences at the time of the sentencing hearing, it would
have agreed to a sentence of two years less a day, this Court decided at the
conclusion of oral argument to allow the appeal and reduce the sentence from
two years to two years less a day. The following are the reasons for that
decision.

II.  Background

[3]                             
Hoang Anh Pham was convicted on charges of
producing marihuana and possessing it for the purpose of trafficking contrary
to ss. 7(1)  and 5(2)  of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C.
1996, c. 19 . In light of a joint submission by the Crown and counsel for the
appellant, the Provincial Court of Alberta imposed a sentence of two years’
imprisonment. 

[4]                             
Mr. Pham appealed the sentence, seeking to have
it reduced by one day. He argued that the sentencing judge was not aware of
and, for this reason, did not consider the collateral consequences of a
sentence of two years’ imprisonment on his immigration status. Under the IRPA ,
a non-citizen sentenced in Canada to a term of imprisonment of at least two
years loses the right to appeal a removal order against him or her. Considering
that a sentence of two years less a day, like the imposed sentence of two
years, remained within the range of appropriate sentences, the Crown conceded
that the sentence should be reduced by one day. It must be noted that neither
the appellant’s counsel nor the Crown had raised these issues before the
sentencing judge, who apparently was not aware of the collateral consequences. 


[5]                             
Despite the Crown’s concession, the majority of
the Court of Appeal of Alberta refused to vary the appellant’s sentence by one
day, holding that, in the circumstances, allowing the appeal from a sentence
situated within the range of otherwise fit sentences would inappropriately
undermine the provisions of the IRPA  (2012 ABCA 203, 533 A.R. 192, at
paras. 24-25). The dissenting judge would have allowed the variation, noting
that, had the appellant’s counsel been aware of the collateral consequences of
a two-year sentence in this case, a joint submission for a sentence of two
years less a day would have been agreed upon (para. 33). 

III. Analysis

[6]                             
Proportionality is a fundamental principle of
sentencing. Section 718.1  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 ,
provides that a sentence must
be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility
of the offender. 

[7]                             
LeBel J. explained proportionality as follows in
R. v. Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 37: 

Proportionality is the sine qua non
of a just sanction. First, the principle ensures that a sentence reflects the
gravity of the offence. This is closely tied to the objective of denunciation.
It promotes justice for victims and ensures public confidence in the justice
system. . . . Second, the principle of proportionality ensures that a sentence
does not exceed what is appropriate, given the moral blameworthiness of the
offender. In this sense, the principle serves a limiting or restraining
function and ensures justice for the offender. In the Canadian criminal justice
system, a just sanction is one that reflects both perspectives on
proportionality and does not elevate one at the expense of the other. 

[8]                             
In addition to proportionality, the principle of
parity and the correctional imperative of sentence individualization also
inform the sentencing process. This Court has repeatedly emphasized the value
of individualization in sentencing: Ipeelee, at para. 39; R. v. Wust, 2000 SCC 18, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 455, at para. 21; R. v. M. (C.A.),
[1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 92. Consequently, in determining what a fit
sentence is, the sentencing judge should take into account any relevant
aggravating or mitigating circumstances (s. 718.2 (a) of the Criminal
Code ), as well as objective and subjective factors related to the
offender’s personal circumstances.  

[9]                             
As a corollary to sentence individualization,
the parity principle requires that a sentence be similar to those imposed on
similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances (s.
718.2 (b) of the Criminal Code ). In other words, “if the personal
circumstances of the offender are different, different sentences will be
justified” (C. C. Ruby, G. J. Chan and N. R. Hasan, Sentencing (8th ed.
2012), at §2.41). 

[10]                         
Ultimately, the sentence that is imposed must be
consistent with the fundamental purpose of sentencing, which is to contribute
to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe
society. The sentence must have one or more of the objectives of denunciation,
general and specific deterrence, separation of offenders from society if need
be, rehabilitation, reparations to victims for harm done to them, promotion of
a sense of responsibility in offenders and acknowledgment of the harm done to
victims and to the community (s. 718  of the Criminal Code ).

[11]                         
In light of these principles, the collateral
consequences of a sentence are any consequences for the impact of the sentence
on the particular offender. They may be taken into account in sentencing as
personal circumstances of the offender. However, they are not, strictly
speaking, aggravating or mitigating factors, since such factors are by
definition related only to the gravity of the offence or to the degree of
responsibility of the offender (s. 718.2 (a) of the Criminal Code ).
Their relevance flows from the application of the principles of
individualization and parity. The relevance of collateral consequences may also
flow from the sentencing objective of assisting in rehabilitating offenders (s.
718 (d) of the Criminal Code ). Thus, when two possible sentences
are both appropriate as regards the gravity of the offence and the
responsibility of the offenders, the most suitable one may be the one that
better contributes to the offender’s rehabilitation. 

[12]                         
However, the weight to be given to collateral
consequences varies from case to case and should be determined having regard to
the type and seriousness of the offence. Professor Manson explains this as
follows: 

                          As
a result of the commission of an offence, the offender may suffer physical,
emotional, social, or financial consequences. While not punishment in the true
sense of pains or burdens imposed by the state after a finding of guilt, they
are often considered in mitigation. . . .

 

. . .

 

                          The
mitigating effect of indirect consequences must be considered in relation both
to future re-integration and to the nature of the offence. Burdens and
hardships flowing from a conviction are relevant if they make the rehabilitative
path harder to travel. Here, one can include loss of financial or social
support. People lose jobs; families are disrupted; sources of assistance
disappear. Notwithstanding a need for denunciation, indirect consequences which
arise from stigmatization cannot be isolated from the sentencing matrix if they
will have bearing on the offender’s ability to live productively in the
community. The mitigation will depend on weighing these obstacles against
the degree of denunciation appropriate to the offence. [Emphasis added.] 

 

(The
Law of Sentencing (2001), at pp. 136-37)

[13]                         
Therefore, collateral consequences related to
immigration may be relevant in tailoring the sentence, but their significance
depends on and has to be determined in accordance with the facts of the
particular case. 

[14]                         
The general rule continues to be that a sentence
must be fit having regard to the particular crime and the particular offender.
In other words, a sentencing judge may exercise his or her discretion to take
collateral immigration consequences into account, provided that the sentence
that is ultimately imposed is proportionate to the gravity of the offence and
the degree of responsibility of the offender. 

[15]                         
The flexibility of our sentencing process should
not be misused by imposing inappropriate and artificial sentences in order to
avoid collateral consequences which may flow from a statutory scheme or from
other legislation, thus circumventing Parliament’s will. 

[16]                         
These consequences must not be allowed to
dominate the exercise or skew the process either in favour of or against
deportation. Moreover, it must not lead to a separate sentencing scheme with a de
facto if not a de jure special range of sentencing options where
deportation is a risk. 

[17]                         
In R. v. Badhwar, 2011 ONCA 266, 9 M.V.R.
(6th) 163, the offender was convicted of criminal negligence causing death
while street racing and failure to stop at the scene of an accident. He was
sentenced to 30 months (less 5 months for pre-trial custody) on the first count
and 12 months consecutive on the second. On appeal, he did not seek a reduction
of his global sentence of 37 months; rather, he asked the court to adjust his
sentence to 23 months and 19 months consecutive in order to avoid the
collateral consequences of a sentence of 24 months or more, namely the loss of
his immigration appeal rights. I agree with Moldaver J.A. (as he then was),
who, in refusing to grant the adjustment, wrote the following, at paras. 42-45:

In seeking to have his
sentence adjusted, the appellant does not suggest that the trial judge erred in
imposing a penitentiary sentence on the charge of criminal negligence causing
death — nor could he. This court . . . upheld a 30 month sentence for
[the offence of criminal negligence causing death while street racing] in
respect of Mr. Multani (2010), 261 O.A.C. 107 (Ont. C.A.).

 

Significantly,
in Multani’s case, the court refused to give effect to Mr. Multani’s submission
that the sentence of 30 months should be reduced to 23 months for reasons
relating to his immigration status. At para. 3 of the decision, the court noted
that “while the deportation consequences of the sentence may be a proper factor
to consider in determining the appropriate sentence in certain cases,
immigration consequences cannot take a sentence out of the appropriate range.”

 

That
principle applies equally to the appellant. In his case, somewhat ironically,
he seeks to benefit from the fact that he was convicted of two offences and therefore
can seek the adjustments he is requesting without interfering with the overall
length of his sentence — something Mr. Multani could not do given that he was
only convicted of the single offence of criminal negligence causing death.

 

No
matter how one chooses to come at the issue, the bottom line remains the same.
Courts ought not to be imposing inadequate or artificial sentences at all, let
alone for the purpose of circumventing Parliament’s will on matters of
immigration.

[18]                         
 It follows that where a sentence is varied to
avoid collateral consequences, the further the varied sentence is from the
range of otherwise appropriate sentences, the less likely it is that it will
remain proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the responsibility of
the offender. Conversely, the closer the varied sentence is to the range of
otherwise appropriate sentences, the more probable it is that the reduced
sentence will remain proportionate, and thus reasonable and appropriate. 

[19]                         
I adopt the position asserted by Doherty J.A. in
R. v. Hamilton (2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at paras. 156 and 158:

. . . the risk of deportation
cannot justify a sentence which is inconsistent with the fundamental purpose
and the principles of sentencing identified in the Criminal Code . The
sentencing process cannot be used to circumvent the provisions and policies of
the Immigration and Refugee Act. As indicated above, however, there is
seldom only one correct sentencing response. The risk of deportation can be a
factor to be taken into consideration in choosing among the appropriate
sentencing responses and tailoring the sentence to best fit the crime and the
offender . . . . 

 

. . .

 

. .
. If a trial judge were to decide that a sentence at or near two years was the
appropriate sentence in all of the circumstances for [the offender], the trial
judge could look at the deportation consequences for [the offender] of imposing
a sentence of two years less a day as opposed to a sentence of two years. I see
this as an example of the human face of the sentencing process. If the future
prospects of an offender . . . can be assisted or improved by imposing a
sentence of two years less a day rather than two years, it is entirely in
keeping with the principles and objectives of sentencing to impose the shorter
sentence. While the assistance afforded to [the offender] by the imposition of
a sentence of two years less a day rather than two years may be relatively
small, there is no countervailing negative impact on broader societal interests
occasioned by the imposition of that sentence . . . . [Citations omitted.] 

[20]                         
Accordingly, the sentencing judge is not
compelled in all circumstances to adjust a sentence in order to avoid the
impact of collateral immigration consequences on the offender. It remains open to
the judge to conclude that even a minimal reduction, i.e. from two years’
imprisonment to two years less a day, would render the sentence inappropriate
for the particular offence and the particular offender. Collateral immigration
consequences are but one relevant factor amongst many others related to the
nature and the gravity of the offence, the degree of responsibility of the
offender and the offender’s personal circumstances.   

[21]                         
The reasons of Doyon J.A. in R. v. Guzman,
2011 QCCA 136 (CanLII), provide an illustration of this approach to the
treatment of collateral immigration consequences in sentencing. In that case,
the Quebec Court of Appeal was asked to grant a minimal variation of a sentence
to ensure that the sentence would not have adverse consequences for the
offender’s immigration status. Doyon J.A. declined to acquiesce in this
request, stating that, in light of the facts of the case, a reduction of the
sentence, even a modest reduction of one day, would be both unfit and
inconsistent with the principles of sentencing. He held as follows, at paras.
102-3: 

[translation] In summary, the status of
the appellants and the impact of the prison sentences on their right to appeal
to the Immigration Appeal Division are relevant circumstances and must be taken
into consideration. However, given the circumstances in which the offences were
committed, their seriousness, the profile of the appellants, and the objectives
and principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code , I am of the
view that the sentences inflicted on the appellants are fit even if they are
not reduced by one day, as the appellants seek.

 

. .
. the near total lack of factors suggesting a real
possibility of rehabilitation and change of behaviour on the part of the
appellants convinces me that, even if the judges had been aware of all of
the relevant facts, they would not have imposed sentences of less than two
years’ imprisonment solely to allow the appellants to preserve their right
of appeal. [Emphasis added.]

[22]                         
In sum, collateral immigration consequences may
be just as relevant in sentencing as the collateral consequences of other
legislation or of circumstances specific to the offender. 

[23]                         
Where the issue of immigration consequences is
brought to the trial judge’s attention and the trial judge applies the proper
sentencing principles but nonetheless decides on a two-year sentence, then,
absent fresh evidence, deference is owed to that decision. Where this issue has
not been raised before the trial judge and the Crown does not give its consent,
an affidavit or some other type of evidence should then be adduced for
consideration by the Court of Appeal.

[24]                         
An appellate court has the authority to
intervene if the sentencing judge was not aware of the collateral immigration
consequences of the sentence for the offender, or if counsel had failed to
advise the judge on this issue. In such circumstances, the court’s intervention
is justified because the sentencing judge decided on the fitness of the
sentence without considering a relevant factor: M. (C.A.), at para. 90.
As I explained above, however, the aim of such an intervention is to determine
the appropriate sentence in light of the facts of the particular case while
taking all the relevant factors into account. Although there will be cases in which
it is appropriate to reduce the sentence to ensure that it does not have
adverse consequences for the offender’s immigration status, there will be other
cases in which it is not appropriate to do so. 

[25]                         
In the case at bar, the sentencing judge was not
aware of the sentence’s collateral immigration consequences, and the appellate
court accordingly had the authority to intervene. The Crown conceded both in
the Court of Appeal and at the hearing in this Court that a reduced sentence of
two years less a day remains within the range of otherwise fit sentences and
that the imposed sentence of two years’ imprisonment should be reduced by one
day. The Crown also agreed that the reduced sentence is the one that the
sentencing judge would have imposed in the case at bar had he been aware of the
collateral immigration consequences (R.F., at para. 69). It was wrong for the
Court of Appeal to refuse the one-day reduction solely on the basis that the
appellant had a prior criminal record or that it felt that he had “abused the
hospitality that [had] been afforded to him by Canada” (para. 24). It is
therefore appropriate to grant the variation of the sentence sought by the
appellant. 

IV.  Conclusion

Parties to offences — Whether a person can be a party to the offence of

                    J,
a youth, learned that his friend T and her sister R were planning to murder
their mother by plying her with alcohol and drowning her, a plan which the
sisters ultimately executed and were convicted for.  The police found an MSN
chat log between J and T in which J provided information to T about death by
drowning; suggested that the sisters should give their mother codeine pills in
addition to alcohol; and suggested ways to mislead the police.  The Crown also
led evidence that J supplied the girls with pills and met T and R after the
murder to provide an alibi.  The trial judge instructed the jury that J could
be convicted of conspiracy to commit murder under s. 465(1)  of the Criminal
Code  either as a principal, or as a party under s. 21(1) (b) or
(c) of the Criminal Code .  J was convicted of conspiracy to
commit murder.  The Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from the conviction but
reduced J’s sentence.

                    Held:  The appeal
should be dismissed.

                    Per McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Fish,
Rothstein, Cromwell, Moldaver and Karakatsanis JJ.:  Party liability to
conspiracy is an offence known to Canadian law.  Unlike
attempted conspiracy, it does not involve stacking one form of inchoate
liability upon another, and does not suffer from remoteness.

                    There
are two schools of thought in Canada as to how, and under what circumstances, a
person can be found liable as a party to the offence of conspiracy.  The
narrower approach (the Trieu model) limits such liability to aiding or
abetting the formation of the agreement.  The broader approach (the McNamara
model) extends such liability to also include aiding or abetting the
furtherance of the conspiracy’s unlawful object.  The approach to be followed
is Trieu and not McNamara.  Party liability is limited to cases
where the accused aids or abets the initial formation of the agreement, or aids
or abets a new member to join a pre‑existing agreement.

                    The
Trieu model is a legitimate basis for party liability to a conspiracy. 
A person becomes party to an offence if he aids or abets a principal in the commission
of the offence.  It follows that party liability to a conspiracy is made out
where the accused aids or abets the actus reus of conspiracy, namely the
conspirators’ act of agreeing.  

                    The
McNamara model is not a basis for party liability to conspiracy.  Acts
that further the unlawful object of a conspiracy are not an element of the
offence of conspiracy.  Aiding or abetting the furtherance of the unlawful
object does not establish aiding or abetting the principal with any element of
the offence of conspiracy, and thus cannot ground party liability for
conspiracy.  However, where a person, with knowledge of a conspiracy, does or
omits to do something for the purpose of furthering the unlawful object, with
the knowledge and consent of one or more of the existing conspirators, this
provides powerful circumstantial evidence from which membership in the conspiracy
can be inferred.

                    While
party liability to conspiracy includes aiding or abetting the formation of a
new agreement (the Trieu model), it also includes aiding or abetting a
new member to join a pre‑existing agreement.  Such assistance or
encouragement facilitates the new member’s commission of the offence of
conspiracy — that is, the act of agreeing.

                    In
light of the conclusion that party liability does not extend to acts done in
furtherance of the unlawful object of the conspiracy, party liability should
not, in the present case, have been put to the jury.  There is no evidence that
J aided or abetted the initial formation of the agreement between R and T to
murder their mother or aided or encouraged a new member to join the existing
conspiracy.  The trial judge’s error, however, could not possibly have affected
the verdict.  The curative proviso under s. 686(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code  applies.  The evidence implicating J as a member of the conspiracy was
overwhelming and, once the jury rejected J’s defence, a finding of guilt under s. 465(1) 
of the Criminal Code  was inevitable.  

                    Finally,
the two grounds of appeal relating to evidence admitted under the co‑conspirators’
exception to the hearsay rule are dismissed.

                    The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

[1]                             
Moldaver J. — In this appeal, the Court is required to
decide whether the aiding and abetting provisions in the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , are applicable to the offence of conspiracy and, if so,
how and under what circumstances.  Appellate courts are divided on these
questions, and the case at hand provides an opportunity to resolve the
conflicting approaches.

I.       Background

[2]                             
The appellant was convicted of conspiracy to
commit murder following a trial before Van Melle J. of the Ontario Superior
Court of Justice and a jury.  He was tried as a youth and received a sentence
of 12 months’ imprisonment and 6 months’ conditional supervision in the
community.

[3]                             
The appellant appealed to the Ontario Court of
Appeal against both conviction and sentence.  His appeal from conviction was
dismissed; his appeal from sentence was allowed and the sentence was reduced to
8 months in custody and 4 months’ conditional supervision.

[4]                             
The appellant appeals his conviction to this
Court with leave.  As I have said, the primary issue is whether a person can be
found liable as a party to the offence of conspiracy and, if so, under what
circumstances.  

[5]                             
The charge of conspiracy to commit murder, for
which the appellant stands convicted, revolves around the killing of A.K. by
her two daughters R and T.  The evidence at the appellant’s trial established
that R and T conspired to kill their mother and eventually carried out their
plan.  R and T were tried as youths and both were convicted of first degree
murder.

A.     The Case Against the Appellant

[6]                             
The theory of the Crown against the appellant
was that he and T were friends and that he learned from T that she and R were
planning to kill their mother.  It was their intention to ply her with alcohol,
drown her in the family bathtub, and make it look like an accident.

[7]                             
According to the Crown, the appellant took
various steps to help R and T achieve their plan.  An MSN chat log, discovered
by the police on a computer belonging to R and T, contained a revealing
conversation between the appellant and T a few days before the killing.  In
that conversation, the appellant provided information to T about death by
drowning and explained what R and T should do if their mother woke up during
the drowning process.  He further suggested that in addition to plying their
mother with alcohol, R and T should give her about five Tylenol 3 pills as this
would “knock [her] right out” (A.R., at p. 198).  Autopsy results revealed
codeine in A.K.’s blood at 3.5 times the upper therapeutic level — a level
consistent with the consumption of four to six Tylenol 3 tablets.  The Crown
advanced evidence that it was the appellant who supplied R and T with Tylenol 3
tablets shortly before the killing.

[8]                             
In the same conversation, the appellant promised
to provide R and T with an alibi for the time of the murder and he proposed a
plan that he described as “irrefutable”.  R and T did not take up the
appellant’s suggestion, choosing instead to follow a plan of their own which
involved meeting the appellant and another friend at a specified restaurant a
short time after the killing.  Evidence presented by the Crown showed that the
appellant agreed to that suggestion and attended the restaurant as planned.

[9]                             
Finally, in the same chat with T, the appellant
offered to be present with R and T when the police arrived and he suggested
ways in which R and T should behave to mislead the police.  At one point in his
conversation with T, the appellant made the following telling admission:  “I’m
involved this much, I’m willing to help you out with any of it [T]” (A.R., at
p. 197).

[10]                         
In a statement made to the police following his
arrest, the appellant did not deny that he was the one communicating with T in
the MSN chats; rather, he maintained that he was not being serious and did not
expect that his comments would be taken seriously (R.F., at para. 20).

B.     The Crown’s Closing Address and the Trial Judge’s Instructions
to the Jury

[11]                         
Crown counsel in her closing address invited the
jury to find the appellant guilty on one of two bases: either as a principal
in the conspiracy, or as a party to the conspiracy under s. 21(1) (b)
or (c).  In other words, the Crown argued that either the appellant had
become a member of the conspiracy between R and T or, in the alternative, he
had become an aider or abettor of the conspiracy.

[12]                         
The trial judge acceded to the Crown’s request
that the jury be instructed on both bases of liability.  The relevant portions
of the charge on party liability are reproduced in full below:

A
person also commits an offence if he does anything for the purpose of helping
another person to commit the offence.

 

Anyone
who actively assists or encourages somebody else to commit an offence is as
guilty of the offence as the person who actually commits it.  I remind you
though that mere knowledge of, discussion, or passive acquiescence in a plan of
criminal conduct is not of itself sufficient.

 

. . .

 

It
is the position of the Crown that [the appellant] can be convicted of
conspiracy as either a full partner like [T] and [R] or if he was a party to
the conspiracy.  He is a party to the conspiracy by aiding, which means
assisting, or abetting, which means encouraging [T] and [R] in their plan to
murder — in the plan to murder [the deceased].

 

Some
of you might think that [the appellant] was a main partner of the plan that he
agreed to murder [the deceased].  Others might agree at the end of the day that
he was only a party to the conspiracy in that he assisted or encouraged the
girls in their murder plot.  The Crown’s position is that [the appellant] was
involved in this conspiracy because he provided at least one of the following:

 

•   Advice about the drowning process and how to act when
interacting with the police.

 

•   Help with details of the plan including combining alcohol and
Tylenol 3’s and what to do if she woke up part way through.

 

•   An agreement to assist with the alibi and attended at Jack
Astor’s the night of the murder.

 

•   Or Tylenol 3’s to facilitate her death.  [A.R., at pp. 61 and 69-70]

C.     Appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal, 2011 ONCA 220, 15
O.R. (3d) 161

[13]                         
On his appeal from conviction to the Ontario
Court of Appeal, the appellant raised several grounds, one being that the jury
should not have been instructed on party liability.  Rosenberg J.A., on behalf
of a unanimous court, disagreed.  In his view, on the facts of the case, the
appellant could be convicted as a party to the offence of conspiracy to commit
murder “if he aided or abetted the sisters within the meaning of s. 21(1)  [of
the Criminal Code ] to pursue their unlawful object” (para. 27
(emphasis added)).

[14]                         
Having concluded that party liability was
available, Rosenberg J.A. reviewed the instructions on party liability and
found them to be deficient.  In his view, they “were generic, divorced from the
facts of the case and failed to make clear that the jury had to find that the
appellant knew the object of the conspiracy and that his assistance was
intended to assist [R and T] in pursuing the unlawful object of murdering their
mother” (para. 29).

[15]                         
Despite this deficiency, Rosenberg J.A. was
satisfied that the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code could
safely be applied to uphold the conviction.  In this regard, he observed that
the defence put forward by the appellant — his comments in the MSN chats
to T were not to be taken seriously — “did not depend on whether the
appellant was a principal in, or a party to, the conspiracy”.  If the jury
accepted his position or it raised a reasonable doubt, he would be acquitted. 
On the other hand, if the jury rejected his position, “a finding of guilt was inevitable”. 
Rosenberg J.A. further noted that the appellant’s MSN chats with T constituted
“direct evidence, in his own words, of the appellant’s role in the
conspiracy”.  It followed, in his view, that the “[appellant’s] liability as a
party or a member of the conspiracy was overwhelming” (para. 74).

II.     Overview of Issues on Appeal

[16]                         
Against that backdrop, I turn to what I believe
are the two main issues in this appeal, namely:  Can a person be a party to the
offence of conspiracy as a matter of law and, if so, how and
under what circumstances?  For the reasons that follow, I am satisfied that a
person can be a party to the offence of conspiracy as a matter of law under s.
21 of the Code.  

[17]                         
The more perplexing issue — and the one that in
my view forms the centerpiece of this appeal — is how and under what
circumstances.  The answer to that question hinges on how one conceptualizes
the offence of conspiracy for purposes of party liability.  Accepting that the
prohibited act in a conspiracy (the actus reus) consists of an agreement
by two or more persons to pursue an unlawful object, specifically a criminal
offence (R. v. O’Brien, [1954] S.C.R. 666), the question that arises is
this:  Should party liability be restricted to those who aid or abet the
agreement that forms the basis of the conspiracy, or does party liability
extend as well to those who aid or abet the furthering of the unlawful object
of the conspiracy?

[18]                         
Canadian jurisprudence on the subject is
divided.  Alberta and Quebec have adopted the narrower approach, restricting
party liability to those who aid or abet the agreement itself, with a
particular focus on its formation.  See R. v. Trieu, 2008 ABCA 143, 429
A.R. 200, and R. v. Bérubé (1999), 139 C.C.C. (3d) 304
(Que. C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [2000] 1 S.C.R. vii.  Ontario and British
Columbia have adopted the broader approach, expanding party liability to also
include those who aid or abet the furthering of the unlawful object.  See R.
v. McNamara (No. 1) (1981), 56 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (Ont. C.A.); R. v.
Vucetic (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 178 (Ont. C.A.); and United States of
America v. Lorenz (2007), 222 C.C.C. (3d) 16 (B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal
refused, [2008] 1 S.C.R. vi (sub nom. Cheema v. Attorney
General of Canada on behalf of the United States of America).

[19]                         
The case at hand provides this Court with an opportunity to
resolve the conflicting viewpoints.  The first order of business, however, is
to address the seminal question raised by the appellant, namely:  Can a person
be a party to the offence of conspiracy as a matter of law?  

III.    Analysis

A.     Can a Person Be a Party to the Offence of Conspiracy as a
Matter of Law?

[20]                         
Section 465  of the Criminal Code 
criminalizes the offence of conspiracy.  Conspiracy to commit murder, the crime
at issue here, is a free-standing offence under s. 465(1)(a) of the Code,
which reads as follows:

465. (1) Except
where otherwise expressly provided by law, the following provisions apply in
respect of conspiracy:

 

(a) every
one who conspires with any one to commit murder or to cause another person to
be murdered, whether in Canada or not, is guilty of an indictable offence and
liable to a maximum term of imprisonment for life;

[21]                         
Like all conspiracies, conspiracy to commit
murder is a form of inchoate liability.  The crime is complete when two or more
persons agree to kill a third party.  No one need be killed; nor is it
necessary that any steps be taken to bring about the murder.

[22]                         
Section 21(1) of the Code sets out three
ways in which someone can be found liable as “a party to an offence”.

                           21. (1) Every one is a party to an offence who

 

                           (a) actually commits it;

 

                           (b) does or omits to do
anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it; or

 

                           (c) abets any person in
committing it.

[23]                         
Nothing in the language of s. 21 suggests that
party liability does not apply to offences that punish inchoate behaviour. The
appellant’s real complaint, as I understand it, is that party liability ought
not to apply to the offence of conspiracy because being a party to a conspiracy
“is an offence unknown to the law” (A.F., at para. 41).  It suffers from the
same problem of remoteness that led this Court in R. v. Déry, 2006 SCC
53, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 669, to conclude that “attempted conspiracy” is not an
offence known to law.  As Fish J. explained, the separate rationales
underlining the offences of “conspiracy” and “attempt” lose their justification
when these two forms of inchoate liability are stacked upon one another:  

                    When
applied to conspiracy, the justification for criminalizing attempt is lost,
since an attempt to conspire amounts, at best, to a risk that a risk will
materialize.  [para. 50]

[24]                         
Much as the appellant seeks to apply the logic
of Déry to party liability where the
offence in issue is conspiracy, I am respectfully of the view that the
comparison is inapt — no less so than comparing apples with oranges.  Quite
simply, unlike the crime of attempt, party liability is not inchoate.  In order
for the Crown to rely on party liability, the underlying offence must have been
committed by the principal.  Consequently, being a party to a conspiracy does
not involve stacking one form of inchoate liability upon another.

[25]                         
The appellant raised this argument before the
Court of Appeal.  Rosenberg J.A. rejected it for the following reasons, with
which I agree:

                           In
my view, the holding in Déry does not warrant reconsideration of this
court’s decisions in McNamara and Vucetic.  Party liability for
conspiracy does not suffer from the problem of remoteness identified in Déry
with respect to attempt to conspire.  A person can be liable as a s. 21(1) 
party to conspiracy only if the Crown proves an agreement by at least two
other people to commit a substantive offence.  If no agreement materialized,
the alleged party’s conduct would be at most an attempt to conspire and would
fail on the holding in Déry.  If, however, the accused is a party to
the conspiracy, . . . the risk of commission of the criminal offence has
sufficiently materialized to warrant criminal sanction.  [Emphasis added; para.
20.]

[26]                         
I would accordingly not give effect to this
aspect of the appellant’s argument.  In short, I am satisfied that being a
party to a conspiracy is an offence known to law.  The more difficult question,
to which I now turn, is how and under what circumstances a person can be found
liable as a party to a conspiracy.

B.     How and Under What Circumstances Can a Person Be Found
Liable as a Party to the Offence of Conspiracy?

                    (1)      The Two Approaches in Canadian
Jurisprudence

[27]                         
As mentioned, there are two schools of thought
in Canada as to how, and under what circumstances, a person can be found liable
as a party to the offence of conspiracy — the narrower view and the broader
view.  

[28]                         
The leading authority in support of the narrower
view is Trieu.  The facts are straightforward.  Trieu operated a
small business selling cellular phones.  He sold phones to five people who were
involved in a conspiracy to traffic in cocaine.  Trieu knew that the
conspirators were engaged in drug trafficking, that they worked as a group, and
that they would use the phones in their trafficking operation.  He claimed,
however, that he was not a member of the conspiracy and denied agreeing with
any of the conspirators to traffic in cocaine. 

[29]                         
The trial judge acquitted Trieu (R. v. Lam,
2005 ABQB 849 (CanLII)).  In his view, the evidence fell short of establishing
that Trieu was a member of the conspiracy.  He also rejected the Crown’s
alternate theory that in selling cellular phones to the conspirators, Trieu
intentionally assisted the conspirators in attaining their object — trafficking
in cocaine — and as such, he should be found liable as a party to the offence
of conspiracy. 

[30]                         
Recognizing that there were two lines of
authority on the subject, the trial judge adopted the narrower approach.  In
his view, party liability for the offence of conspiracy did not extend to those
who took steps to further the unlawful object of the conspiracy; rather, it was
restricted to those who aided in the formation of the agreement that had a
particular unlawful object as its goal.  And since there was no evidence that
Trieu aided in the formation of the agreement hatched by the conspirators, he
could not be found liable as a party to the offence of conspiracy.

[31]                         
The Crown appealed Trieu’s acquittal to the
Alberta Court of Appeal, claiming that the trial judge erred in taking the
narrower approach to party liability.  The Court of Appeal disagreed.

[32]                         
On behalf of the court, Costigan J.A. commenced
his analysis by reviewing some of the basic principles applicable to the law of
conspiracy and party liability.  Citing this Court’s decisions in Papalia v.
The Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 256, and Sheppe v. The Queen, [1980] 2
S.C.R. 22, he noted that the essence of the offence of conspiracy is the
agreement, and acts done in furtherance of the unlawful object are not an
element of the offence.  He cited R. v. Hibbert, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 973,
for the proposition that “[t]o be a party to an offence, a person must aid the
principal in the commission of that offence” (para. 32).

[33]                         
Having identified the basic principles that
apply to the law of conspiracy and parties, Costigan J.A. turned to the facts
of Trieu and commented as follows:

It follows from these principles that for Trieu to be a party to the
offence of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine, the Crown had to prove that Trieu
performed acts for the purpose of aiding the formation of an agreement
to traffic in cocaine.  Acts performed after the agreement was formed did not
aid in the commission of the offence of conspiracy on the facts of this case. 
Therefore, Trieu could not be a party to the offence of conspiracy for
facilitating the conspirators in attaining their object of trafficking in
cocaine.  Although acts performed after the agreement was reached could have
aided in the commission of the offence of trafficking, Trieu was not charged
with the offence of trafficking.  [Emphasis added; para. 33.]

 

[34]                         
Trieu was brought
to the attention of the Court of Appeal in the present case.  Rosenberg J.A.
considered the reasoning underlying the narrower approach endorsed by Trieu
but refused to follow it, choosing instead the more expansive approach adopted
by the Ontario Court of Appeal in McNamara and Vucetic.

[35]                         
At issue in McNamara was whether two
individuals and a company were liable as co-conspirators for joining an ongoing
bid-rigging scheme operated by a number of pre-existing conspirators.  One of
the issues before the Court of Appeal was whether the two individuals and the
company could be found liable as parties to the offence of conspiracy.  The
court answered that question in the affirmative:

On the other
hand, if, at any time before the object of the conspiracy had been attained,
that is, the receipt of the contract money from the Crown, [the individuals and
the company] abetted or encouraged any of the conspirators to pursue its
object, they would become parties to the criminal offence of conspiracy by
virtue of s. 21 of the Code.  [Emphasis added; p. 454.]

[36]                         
In Vucetic, the Ontario Court of Appeal
re-affirmed the expansive approach to party liability endorsed in McNamara:

However, in
order to find him guilty as an aider and abettor, the jury would have to be
instructed that the appellant knew the object of the conspiracy and that his
assistance was intended to assist the conspirators in attaining their
unlawful criminal object.  [Emphasis added; para. 7.]

[37]                         
In choosing to follow McNamara and Vucetic,
Rosenberg J.A. made the following observations in his reasons:

Again,
I can see no basis in principle for refusing to follow McNamara and Vucetic
on this issue.  I appreciate the point made in Trieu that the essence of
a conspiracy is an agreement, but it is not an agreement in the abstract; it is
an agreement to attain a common goal, a particular unlawful object. . . . 

 

Admittedly,
including party liability for aiding or abetting pursuit of the unlawful object
blurs the line between the conspiracy and the substantive offence.  The
distinction, however, is that party liability for conspiracy requires proof of
an agreement; there is no requirement of proof that the unlawful object was
attained.  Liability as a party to the substantive offence requires proof that
the substantive offence was committed.  Thus, in this case, the appellant could
be guilty of conspiracy if he aided or abetted the sisters within the meaning of
s. 21(1)  to pursue their unlawful object, even if they ultimately did not carry
out the plan or the deceased had survived the attempt on her life.  [paras. 26
and 27]

[38]                         
To sum up, the cases illustrate two strands of
authority.  The first, favoured in Trieu, is narrower, grounding party
liability on aiding or abetting the agreement itself, specifically its
formation.  The second, as endorsed in McNamara, is broader, including
within the ambit of party liability aiding or abetting the furtherance of the
conspiracy’s unlawful object.  The question remains which of these two
approaches should be adopted.

(2)        The
Approach to Be Followed

[39]                         
The scope of party liability for conspiracy
turns on a proper understanding of the elements of the offence of conspiracy. 
That is because, to be a party to an offence, a person must aid or abet the
principals “in the commission of the offence”: R. v. Briscoe, 2010 SCC
13, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 411, at para. 16.  With respect to the offence of
conspiracy, this Court in Papalia held that “[t]he actus reus is
the fact of agreement” (p. 276).  Aiding or abetting the formation of an
agreement between conspirators (as contemplated in Trieu) amounts to
aiding or abetting the principals in the commission of the conspiracy, and
should therefore lead to party liability for conspiracy.

[40]                         
Earlier in these reasons, I explained why, as a
matter of law, a person can be found liable as a party to the offence of
conspiracy.  Once that is accepted, I see no reason in principle or policy why
the limited form of party liability contemplated in Trieu should not be
criminalized.[1] 
The parties and the intervener have submitted no authorities or academic
writings to the contrary — and I know of none.  Nor do those who advocate the
more expansive approach to party liability sanctioned by McNamara
question the Trieu model as a basis upon which party liability
for the offence of conspiracy may be grounded.  Indeed, in the present case,
Rosenberg J.A. recognized it as such.

[41]                         
It follows, in my view, that the Trieu
model represents a legitimate basis upon which party liability for the offence
of conspiracy may be found.  I hasten to add that a review of the jurisprudence
in Canada and elsewhere reveals that there are few reported cases where the
facts have come within the Trieu paradigm.  Trieu itself was not
such a case.  And the only authority that has come to my attention is People
v. Strauch, 240 Ill. 60 (1909).  In that case, a father introduced his son
to another person with the intention that they enter into a conspiracy, which
they did.  The father was convicted as a party to the conspiracy for aiding and
abetting its formation.

[42]                         
That brings me to the broader approach endorsed
in McNamara and the central issue in this appeal — namely, whether party
liability can attach to someone who knows of a conspiracy and who does (or
omits to do) something for the purpose of furthering its unlawful object.

[43]                         
With respect to those who hold a different view,
I have concluded that it should not.  Party liability should be restricted to
conduct that aids or abets the formation of the agreement that comprises
the essence of the crime of conspiracy.  In all other cases, a conviction for
conspiracy will not lie absent proof of membership in the conspiracy.  

[44]                         
As I have explained, agreement is a central
element to the offence of conspiracy.  Conversely, an act done in furtherance
of the unlawful object is not an element of the offence of conspiracy. 
Although such acts can serve as circumstantial evidence to support the
existence of a conspiracy, they are not themselves a component of the actus
reus of conspiracy.  Indeed, a conspiracy can be established in the absence
of any overt acts done in furtherance of its unlawful object. In other words,
“[t]he crime of conspiracy is complete once the agreement is reached”: Trieu,
at para. 31.

[45]                         
It follows, in my view, that the broader
approach as endorsed in McNamara must be rejected.  Aiding or abetting
the furtherance of the unlawful object does not establish aiding or abetting
the principal with any element of the offence of conspiracy.  It cannot ground
party liability for conspiracy.

[46]                         
The conclusion I have reached is consistent with
the following observation from a Harvard Law Review article, with which
I agree:

But to aid and abet a crime it
is necessary not merely to help the criminal, but to help him in the commission
of the particular criminal offense.  A person does not aid and abet a
conspiracy by helping the “conspiracy” to commit a substantive offense, for the
crime of conspiracy is separate from the offense which is its object.  It is
necessary to help the “conspiracy” in the commission of the crime of
conspiracy, that is, in the commission of the act of agreement.  Only
then is it justifiable to dispense with the necessity of proving commission of
the act of agreement by the defendant himself.  In all other cases, to convict
the defendant of conspiracy it is necessary to prove not only knowledge on his
part that he was helping in a wrongful enterprise, but also knowledge on
another’s part that he intended to do so, and at least a tacit agreement to
give and accept such help. [Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.]

 

(“Developments
in the Law: Criminal Conspiracy” (1959), 72 Harv. L. Rev. 920, at pp.
934-35)  

[47]                         
In an article entitled “Conspiracies and
Attempts”, in National Criminal Law Program, Substantive Criminal Law (1990),
vol. 1, D. Doherty (then judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario), expressed the
same view:

The aiding
and abetting provisions [s. 21(1)(b) and (c) of the Code]
should apply to conspiracy charges.  They must, however, be applied with
caution.  Those sections require that the assistance be rendered for the
purpose of assisting the commission of the crime.  In the context of a
conspiracy charge, the alleged acts of assistance or encouragement should have
to be done for the purpose of aiding or assisting the act of agreeing. 
Conduct which aids or assists in the achievement of the object of the
conspiracy should not be equated with assistance in the making of the
conspiracy.  [Emphasis added; p. 36.]

(See also M. Manning and
P. Sankoff, Manning, Mewett & Sankoff:  Criminal Law (4th ed.
2009), at p. 316.)

[48]                         
Those who prefer the McNamara approach
fear that persons who have not become members of the conspiracy, but who have
nonetheless done things to further the conspiracy’s unlawful object, will,
despite their moral culpability, slip through the cracks — that is, unless the
unlawful object of the conspiracy is attained or attempted, in which case they
could be charged as parties to the substantive offence or to an attempt to
commit that offence.

[49]                         
Thus, in the case at hand, the fear is that, had
R and T not killed their mother or attempted to do so, the appellant would have
ended up going free, despite his efforts to further the planned killing, unless
the Crown could prove that he entered into the agreement formulated by R and T
and thus became a member of the conspiracy.

[50]                         
Much as I appreciate the concern raised by those
who prefer the more expansive McNamara approach, viewed realistically, I
consider it to be more imaginary than real.  

[51]                         
In R. v. Alexander (2005), 206 C.C.C.
(3d) 233 (Ont. C.A.), a case involving various charges, including conspiracy to
extort, Doherty J.A. stated the following:

The appellants’ submissions stand on firm legal footing.  The actus
reus of the crime of conspiracy lies in the formation of an agreement,
tacit or express, between two or more individuals, to act together in pursuit
of a mutual criminal objective.  Co-conspirators share a common goal borne out
of a meeting of the minds whereby each agrees to act together with the other to
achieve a common goal.

 

It follows from the mutuality of objective requirement of the actus
reus that a conspiracy is not established merely by proof of knowledge of
the existence of a scheme to commit a crime or by the doing of acts in
furtherance of that scheme.  Neither knowledge of nor participation in a
criminal scheme can be equated with the actus reus of a conspiracy:  see
R. v. Lamontagne (1999), 142 C.C.C. (3d) 561 (Que. C.A.), at 575-76; R.
v. Cotroni, supra, at pp. 17-8.  Knowledge and acts in furtherance
of a criminal scheme do, however, provide evidence, particularly where they
co-exist, from which the existence of an agreement may be inferred. 
[Emphasis added; citations omitted; paras. 46-47.]

I agree with the
emphasized comment, but would state it slightly differently and in somewhat
more emphatic terms.

[52]                         
In my view, where a person, with knowledge of a
conspiracy (which by definition includes knowledge of the unlawful object
sought to be attained), does (or omits to do) something for the purpose of
furthering the unlawful object, with the knowledge and consent of one or more
of the existing conspirators, this provides powerful circumstantial evidence
from which membership in the conspiracy can be inferred.  To be precise, it
would be evidence of an agreement, whether tacit or express, that the unlawful
object should be achieved.  Ultimately, that issue is one for the trier of
fact, who must decide whether any inference other than agreement can reasonably
be drawn on the evidence.  But, as I will explain, the case at hand illustrates
how a constellation of such facts can make a finding of membership a virtual
certainty.

[53]                         
In so concluding, I note that conspiracies are
often proved by way of circumstantial evidence.  Direct evidence of an
agreement tends to be a rarity.  However, it is commonplace that membership in
a conspiracy may be inferred from evidence of conduct that assists the unlawful
object.  Justice Rinfret made this basic point in Paradis v. The King,
[1934] S.C.R. 165, some eight decades ago:

Conspiracy, like all other crimes, may
be established by inference from the conduct of the parties. No doubt the
agreement between them is the gist of the offence, but only in very rare cases
will it be possible to prove it by direct evidence.  [p. 168]

[54]                         
Furthermore, it is not necessary that all
members of a conspiracy play, or intend to play, equal roles in the ultimate
commission of the unlawful object.  Indeed, members in a conspiracy need not
personally commit, or intend to commit, the offence which each has agreed
should be committed: R. v. Genser (1986), 39 Man. R. (2d) 203 (C.A.),
aff’d [1987] 2 S.C.R. 685.[2] 
Any degree of assistance in the furtherance of the unlawful object can lead to
a finding of membership as long as agreement to a common plan can be inferred
and the requisite mental state has been established.

[55]                         
I do not gainsay the possibility that someone,
with knowledge of an ongoing conspiracy, could do something for the purpose of
furthering the unlawful object without the knowledge or consent of the existing
conspirators.  An example would be where A and B conspire to kill C.  D learns of the conspiracy and
wishes to facilitate the murder.  Unbeknownst to A or B, D prevents
a warning message from reaching the intended victim, C: W. R. LaFave, Substantive
Criminal Law (2nd ed. 2003), vol. 2, at p. 270.  In
such circumstances, an agreement, tacit or otherwise, between the person
providing the assistance (D) and the existing conspirators (A and B)
would be a fiction as neither A nor B was aware of, or agreed to, D’s efforts.

[56]                         
That situation does not arise here, and I leave
for another day whether a person providing “clandestine” assistance in
furtherance of the unlawful object of an ongoing conspiracy could be found
liable of any crime if the conspirators did not commit or attempt to commit the
substantive crime that formed the object of the conspiracy and if his own
efforts did not rise to the level of an attempt at the substantive offence.  

(3)        Aiding
or Abetting a Pre-Existing Agreement

[57]                         
Beyond the debate between the narrower and
broader approaches, a question arises as to whether, within the narrower
approach, the Trieu model should be limited only to those who aid in the
formation of a new agreement to pursue an unlawful object or whether its
reach should extend to those who aid or abet a pre-existing agreement.  

[58]                         
In support of its position that the latter approach
should be followed, the Crown relied in part on this Court’s recent decision in
R. v. Vu, 2012 SCC 40, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 411.  In particular, the Crown
maintained that because conspiracy has been identified as a continuing offence
(Bell v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 471, at p. 488), party liability can
attach to anyone who aids or abets the agreement at any point during the life
of the conspiracy.

[59]                         
In Trieu, Costigan J.A. opined that
because conspiracy is an ongoing crime, party liability can arise after the
initial agreement is formed if, for example, a person aids in the addition of a
new member to join an existing conspiracy (para. 34).  Justice Doherty also
took the position that party liability attaches to someone who encourages or
assists others to join an existing agreement: “Conspiracies and Attempts”, in
National Criminal Law Program, Substantive Criminal Law (1990), vol. 1,
at p. 37.  These authorities observe, and I agree, that aiding or encouraging
someone to become a member of a pre-existing conspiracy facilitates that new
member’s commission of the offence of conspiracy — that is, the act of
agreement.  To be consistent in principle, party liability should thus extend
to assistance or encouragement that results in the addition of a new member to
a pre-existing conspiracy.

[60]                         
In this case, the Crown argued that the
appellant could become a party to the conspiracy by encouraging the sisters to
continue their conspiracy when there were signs that they might abandon it
(R.F., at para. 34).  As well, at least one American author has suggested that
a person might be found liable as a party to the offence of conspiracy “by
facilitating the continuance of the conspiracy as by ‘providing the group with
a hideout so that it does not have to disband’” (C. R. Williams, “Complicity in
a Conspiracy as an Approach to Conspiratorial Liability” (1968), 16 U.C.L.A.
L. Rev. 155, at p. 162, citing “Developments in the Law: Criminal
Conspiracy”, at pp. 934-35).  The same author suggests that “encouraging one or
more persons to follow through with already formulated conspiratorial plans”
might also attract party liability (p. 162).

[61]                         
I would not give effect to the Crown’s
argument.  As a preliminary matter, the argument goes beyond the limited
situation endorsed by Costigan J.A. in Trieu and by Doherty J. in his
article.  And as to the substance of the Crown’s point, though I acknowledge
that these acts can be viewed as aiding or abetting the agreement itself, such
behaviour is equally if not more consistently characterized as aiding or
abetting the furtherance of the unlawful object, and thus captured by the McNamara
model.  As I explained earlier, the McNamara model should not lead to
party liability for conspiracy.  The Crown should thus not be able to achieve
through the back door what principle has denied from the front.

[62]                         
  In my view, the Crown’s argument in favour of
criminalizing aiding or abetting a pre-existing agreement (short of adding a
new member to the agreement) is a solution in search of a problem.  As I have
explained, these acts, which aid or abet the furtherance of the unlawful
object, provide circumstantial evidence from which membership can be inferred. 
In cases where the circumstantial evidence falls short of establishing
membership, there are other charges open to the prosecution.  In some
instances, the Crown will be able to rely on party liability to charge the
substantive offence that forms the object of the conspiracy, or an attempt to
commit that offence; in other instances, the offence of counselling the
substantive offence may apply.

[63]                         
To sum up, party liability to a conspiracy is
limited to cases where the accused encourages or assists in the initial
formation of the agreement, or when he encourages or assists new members to
join a pre-existing agreement. 

C.     Application to this Case

[64]                         
In light of my conclusion that party liability
does not extend to acts done in furtherance of the unlawful object of the
conspiracy, I agree with the appellant that party liability should not, in the
circumstances, have been left to the jury.  There is no evidence that the
appellant aided or abetted the formation of the agreement to murder A.K. or
aided or encouraged a new member to join the existing conspiracy.  That said,
like the Court of Appeal, I am satisfied that the error, though significant,
could not possibly have affected the verdict.  

[65]                         
The evidence implicating the appellant as a
member of the conspiracy was overwhelming.  The Crown presented a powerful body
of evidence from which the jury could find that the appellant, with knowledge
of the conspiracy between R and T, provided advice and offered assistance to
them, with their knowledge and consent, for the purpose of facilitating the
killing of their mother.  As he said in his MSN conversation with T, shortly
before the murder occurred, “I’m involved this much, I’m willing to help you
out with any of it [T]” (A.R., at p. 197).  That, along with other evidence
which implicated the appellant in providing the Tylenol 3 pills and attending a
restaurant after the killing to provide R and T with an alibi, provided the
jury with all the evidence it needed to find an agreement between the appellant
and R and T that the murder should be carried out.  Nothing more was needed to
establish the appellant’s membership in the conspiracy.  It is immaterial that
the appellant, unlike R and T, took no part in the actual killing of A.K.  Once
the jury rejected his explanation that he was not being serious, as it must
have, a finding of guilt on the basis of membership was inevitable.

[66]                         
I should point out that in the circumstances,
the decision on the part of the Crown to charge the appellant with conspiracy
to commit murder very much softened the blow that could otherwise have befallen
him.  The assistance he provided to R and T in facilitating the murder, which
they eventually committed, could well have led to a charge of first degree
murder against him.

[67]                         
Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal from
conviction.  I do so mindful of two alternate grounds of appeal raised by the
appellant.  

[68]                         
First, the appellant submits that evidence
admitted under the co-conspirators’ exception to the hearsay rule did not
satisfy the principled approach to hearsay.  Specifically, he complains that
statements made by T should not have been admitted for their truth because T
was available as a witness and could have been called by the Crown.  I would
not give effect to this submission.  Defence counsel at trial did not raise
this issue with the trial judge.  Had he done so, the Crown may have chosen to
call T as a witness.  In the circumstances, defence counsel’s decision not to
raise the matter could well have been a tactical choice — and as no issue is
taken with the competence of trial counsel, I see no need to address this
ground further.

[69]                         
Second, the appellant says that the trial judge
failed to instruct the jury that the co-conspirators’ exception applied only to
membership and not to party liability.  Once again, defence counsel at trial
did not raise this issue with the trial judge.  Moreover, the instructions
given by the trial judge on the co-conspirators’ exception referred to use of
that evidence only to prove membership.  There was no suggestion that the
evidence could be used to prove party liability.  That being so, I would not
give effect to this ground.

[70]                         
 Furthermore, in light of my conclusion that the
facts of this appeal do not give rise to party liability for the offence of
conspiracy, this is not an appropriate case to determine how, if at all, the
framework for the co-conspirators’ exception established by R. v. Carter,
[1982] 1 S.C.R. 938, might apply in the case of a party to a conspiracy.

[71]                         
As a final matter, I note that there are
conflicting appellate decisions on the applicability of the co-conspirators’
exception where conspirators are tried separately:  R. v. Naicker, 2007
BCCA 608, 229 C.C.C. (3d) 187, leave to appeal refused, [2008] 1 S.C.R. xi; R.
v. Simpson, 2007 ONCA 793, 230 C.C.C. (3d) 542, leave to appeal refused,
[2008] 2 S.C.R. xi.  This issue, however, was not raised before us or in the
courts below.  Accordingly, I see no need to consider it.

IV.    Conclusion

[72]                         
The aiding and abetting of a conspiracy is an
offence known to Canadian law.  The offence is made out where the accused aids
or abets the actus reus of conspiracy, namely the act of agreeing. 
It follows that the approach adopted in Trieu is the only basis upon
which party liability for the offence of conspiracy may be found.  The McNamara
approach is rejected.

[73]                         
I caution, however, that the behaviour captured
by McNamara may well support a charge of conspiracy.  As indicated,
where a person with knowledge of a conspiracy does (or omits to do) something
for the purpose of furthering the unlawful object, with the knowledge and
consent of one or more of the existing conspirators, this provides powerful
circumstantial evidence of his membership in the conspiracy.

[74]                         
The approach I have adopted brings a measure of
simplicity and clarity to the law.  Party liability to a conspiracy is limited
to cases where the accused encourages or assists in the initial formation of
the agreement, or where he encourages or assists new members to join a
pre-existing agreement.  

[75]                         
For the reasons above, I would dismiss the
appeal from conviction.

V.     Appeal from Sentence

[76]                         
Before this Court, the appellant also sought to
appeal his sentence, even though he did not apply for or receive leave to do
so.  I see no basis for granting leave to appeal from sentence.  Accordingly, I
would not consider the proposed sentence appeal.

I should point out that on the Trieu model, if A brings B and C
together in the expectation that they will enter into a conspiracy, but B and C
do not do so, A cannot be found liable of the offence of attempted conspiracy
since no such offence exists at law.  See Déry.

on appeal from the superior court of québec

                    Criminal
law — Evidence — Informer privilege — Individual with informer privilege with
one police force providing information relating to himself and others to second
police force — Whether individual has status of police informer with second
police force — Whether implicit promise of confidentiality by second police
force exists as result of nexus between two police forces.

                    B
approached a first police force to give information about violent crimes and
was promised confidentiality by that police force.  Two days later, the first
police force transferred B and the information he had provided to the Sûreté du
Québec (“SQ”).  Over the next five years, B continued to cooperate with the SQ
and to give information about serious crimes.  At the end of that period, the
Crown ordered the SQ to redact B’s name and any information that could identify
him from all documents and to put those documents under seal.  It also brought
an application to determine if B benefitted from police informer privilege with
the SQ.  The application judge found that B did not have informer status.

                    Held
(Rothstein and Cromwell JJ. dissenting):  The appeal is allowed and
the matter remitted for reconsideration.

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Fish, Abella, Moldaver and Karakatsanis JJ.:
 While the application judge recognized that a promise of confidentiality could
be either explicit or implicit, he undertook no analysis into whether an
implicit promise could have been inferred.  In particular, the application
judge failed to make any findings about whether B’s transfer from the first
police force to the SQ, the relationship between the two police forces, and the
similarities in B’s relationships with both, could have led someone in B’s
position to believe, on reasonable grounds, that the status he had with the
first police force would continue with the second.

                    The possibility of an implied promise of confidentiality emerges from
this record based on the nexus between the first police force and the SQ and
the SQ’s failure to clarify to B what his status was.  B’s interactions with
the SQ originated in his relationship as a confidential informant with the
first police force and the two police forces cooperated in handling B over the
following years.  In addition, the evidence is undisputed that no one ever told
B that he ceased to be a confidential informant when he was transferred to the
SQ, even though it is also undisputed that he repeatedly asked the SQ to
clarify his status. 

                    B
approached the first police force to provide information about violent crimes. 
He was promised informer privilege with respect to the information that he
provided to that force.  In its investigations, the SQ used confidential
information B had given to the first police force prior to the SQ’s
involvement. 

                    Based
on B’s information, the two police forces worked together and dealt with B interchangeably. 
An SQ officer acknowledged that the first police force and the SQ were
effectively operating together in respect of an investigation that developed
around B’s information.  This interconnection is also reflected in a letter
sent by an officer of the first police force, which acknowledges B’s
confidentiality with the first force and implies that that force believed that
B had a similar status with the SQ. 

                    In
addition to the temporal and operational nexus between the two forces, B insistently asked what his status was and never received a clear
answer.  This may well have led someone in B’s position
to reasonably believe that his identity would be protected.  While the SQ
officers were adamant that they did not think of B as an informer, they
do not appear to have shared this view with B.  B was promised confidentiality
by the first police force because his cooperation put his life at risk.  The
risk did not change when he was transferred to the SQ two days later and there is no doubt that the SQ knew of B’s protected status with the
first police force.  At the very least, the SQ sent mixed signals to B
concerning the confidentiality of his statements.  The net effect of these
mixed signals from the SQ on B’s reasonable expectation of confidentiality must
be decided at a new hearing. 

                    The
fact that one police force has granted informer status to an individual is not,
on its own, a sufficient basis for a claim of informer privilege with another
police force.  However, given the nexus between the
forces in handling B, and given the essential continuity of B’s relationship
with both, B may well have had reasonable grounds to believe that the
protection promised by the first police force would continue with the ongoing
flow of information that he was providing to the SQ.

                    Per
Rothstein and Cromwell JJ. (dissenting):  To decide this case, the
concrete realities of it and the limits of appellate review must first be
assessed.  The realities are that the application judge expressly rejected B’s
evidence that his status as a confidential police informer was ever promised or
even discussed.  He further found that the police had done nothing that would
permit B to understand that he was to become a confidential police informer.  While
it may in some rare cases be theoretically possible for a person to be both a
Crown witness and a confidential police informer, it was not possible in B’s
situation.  The application judge recognized this as does B’s own counsel
before this Court.  The fact that the police have an obligation to protect a
person has nothing to do with whether that person is a confidential police informer. 
Thus, there is nothing inconsistent with the police position that, on the one
hand, they felt obliged to protect B and on the other, that B was not a
confidential police informer. 

                    Any
implication that B inquired about his status as a police informer and was not
given a straight answer is not supported by either the application judge’s
findings or by this record.  In fact, the officers who testified on this issue
repeatedly asserted that a conversation about B’s status as a source or
confidential informer simply never occurred.  Indeed, none of the officers
involved failed to give B a straight answer about whether he was a confidential
source because there were no such discussions.

                    It
is not open to an appellate court to reweigh the evidence in the record or to
draw inferences from the evidence, which the application judge refused to draw,
absent some clear and determinative error on the part of the judge.  Thus, it
is not open to this Court on appeal to draw any inference from this record that
B inquired whether or not he was a source and did not receive a straight answer. 
Such an inference is not only contrary to the evidence that the application
judge accepted but it is also contrary to the judge’s express finding of fact
that the SQ did nothing that could have led B to believe that he would become a
confidential police source. 

                    On
the issue of alleged police promises of confidentiality, the application judge
was alive to and expressly noted that there was inconsistency in the evidence. 
A review of the record shows that there was indeed inconsistency or confusion in
the evidence about what was or was not confidential.  Sorting this out is the
job of the application judge, not of an appellate court.  The judge did so and
there is no basis to interfere with his findings.

                    The
application judge did not fail to consider whether a promise of confidential informer
status could be implicit in this case.  Rather, the judge’s factual findings
and the record amply support the conclusion that he was careful to consider
whether any promise was made implicitly as well as explicitly, even though B’s
evidence was solely to the effect that the SQ had made repeated explicit
promises.  This was the only basis for his professed belief that he had informer
status. 

                    The
judge was alive to B’s dealings with other police agencies.  Having heard that
evidence, however, he found as a fact that the evidence in the case required
that B’s dealings with the SQ be considered differently.  The judge referred to
several differences in support of this conclusion, which is amply supported by
the evidence. 

                    In
light of the application judge’s extensive findings, there is no evidence to
support the view that there may have been some implicit promise in this case.  In
fact, this possibility is inconsistent with B’s own clear
and unequivocal evidence that the claim of informer privilege arose solely from
alleged express promises, which the application judge concluded had never been
made.  Moreover, the judge accepted police evidence that there was never even
any thought of making B a confidential informer and that they did nothing that
could let B understand that he had that status.  The judge also found that it
was some years after B’s initial dealings with the SQ that B started to claim
the status of a confidential police informer.  These findings leave no room for
the imputed or implied promise theory. 

                    Finally,
the judge’s conclusions that B actually knew that he did not have informer
privilege and that B’s claim of that status was an after-the-fact exercise of
opportunism make irrelevant any possibility that some hypothetical person in
B’s circumstances might have thought that the promise was implicit.  B knew he
had no such promise and provided the information anyway.  B was a disappointed
suitor for a potentially lucrative co-operating witness contract and an
opportunist, not a police informer.

                    In
light of the record, there is no reason to interfere with the application
judge’s findings of fact.  Nothing in this case, however, should be taken as
undermining the importance of the police being clear with potential sources about
their status; quite the contrary.  Given the important role that
informer status plays in the detection and prosecution of crime, courts must
not undermine its effectiveness by condoning police actions that leave
potential informers uncertain or confused as to their status.  The application
judge in this case was clearly alive to these concerns, as he ought to have
been, and reached the conclusions he did after a careful and thorough review of
all of the evidence.  His decision should not be disturbed.

                    The
judgment of McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Fish, Abella, Moldaver and Karakatsanis
JJ. was delivered by

[1]                             
Abella J.  — This appeal involves an individual, “B”,[1] who was guaranteed
confidentiality by one police force and then transferred to another. The second
police force failed to answer B’s repeated questions about his status, nor did
it at any time clarify what that status was.  The disposition of this case
rests on the consequences of the information vacuum created by the second
police force and, in particular, on whether an inference could reasonably have
been drawn that an implicit promise of confidentiality was made based on the
nexus between the two police forces. 

[2]                             
The application judge held that B’s status as a
confidential informant with one police force did not automatically make him a
confidential informant for the other. The application judge also found that B
lied about being expressly promised confidential informer status by the second
police force. But the inquiry should not have ended there.  What remained
unanswered was whether, due to the interaction between the police forces and
other police conduct, there was a nexus between the two police forces and, if
so, whether B was implicitly promised that the confidentiality he enjoyed with
one police force would continue to the other. The application judge accepted
the testimony of officers in the second police force concerning their
interactions with B. Significantly, that testimony included acknowledgments
that B repeatedly asked what his status was, and was never clearly told that he
was not a police informer.

[3]                             
The application judge concluded that B’s status
with each police force was to be treated differently. He never explained why. B placed himself at risk by providing the Sûreté du Québec (“SQ”) with information leading to the investigation and
prosecution of violent crime.  I see an error in the
application judge’s failure to make any findings about whether the
transfer, the relationship between the two police forces, and the similarities
in B’s relationships with both, could have led someone in B’s position to
believe, on reasonable grounds, that the status he had with the first police
force would continue with the police force to which he was transferred.

[4]                             
The record reveals that these are live issues.
None of the application judge’s findings address them, even accepting all of
the findings delineated by Justice Cromwell. This, with respect, leaves a key
question unanswered, namely, whether an implicit promise of confidentiality was
made in these circumstances.

Background

[5]                             
Motivated by fear for his safety and a desire
for vengeance, B met with two officers of the first police force in order to
give them information.  B’s information implicated a number of people who were
involved in violent criminal activity and in which he admitted to having been
involved as well.  B was promised confidentiality and given an informant code
in that police force’s system.  The police force then released B, but because
the criminal activity was outside its authority, the force transmitted the
information it got from B to the SQ.

[6]                             
 Two days later, B was transferred to the SQ and
two SQ officers arrested him for his crimes. B continued to want to cooperate
and to give information both about his crimes and his prior criminal
activities.  In the next several days, B made a number of statements to the SQ
relating to them.

[7]                             
B was given an informant code in the SQ’s system
and, for five years, continued to cooperate with the SQ.  Most of B’s
declarations to the SQ were preceded by a statement promising him that the
information he provided would not be used against him in a proceeding, except
for perjury, but that charges could be brought against him if they were
supported by independent evidence.

[8]                             
During the course of those five years, B pleaded
guilty to one of his violent crimes and was sentenced for it. 

[9]                             
At the end of the five years, the Crown ordered
the SQ to redact B’s name and any information that could identify him from all
documents and to put those documents under seal.   A few months later, two SQ
officers went to the penitentiary to have B sign a document entitled [translation] “Waiver of Informer
Privilege” — a waiver of his right to invoke police informer privilege.  He did
not sign.   Thereafter, B’s name does not appear in any new documents, and was
replaced with the word “source”.

[10]                         
 The Crown brought an application to clarify B’s
status and determine if he benefitted from a police informer privilege that
assured the confidentiality of his identity.  The hearing took place in closed
session, with documents under seal.

[11]                         
At the hearing, B testified that he was told by
the SQ on several occasions that he was an informer.  He relied on the fact
that he was attributed an informant code by the SQ, that he was asked to sign a
“Waiver of Informer Privilege”, and that he was identified as a “source” in any
documents created after the Crown requested the general redaction.  For its
part, the Crown argued that the SQ expected B to become a cooperating witness;
that B was told on many occasions that his statements could be used against
him; that B’s identity was not concealed by the SQ in documents and statements
prior to the sealing of the documents; and that the police had made limited
disclosure of one of B’s statements on one occasion. The Crown suggested that
this was inconsistent with B’s testimony that he had been promised that
his identity would remain protected.    

[12]                         
The application judge found that the first
police force’s officers had promised to keep B’s identity confidential in
exchange for the information he provided.  All of B’s statements to that police
force, therefore, were protected by informer privilege.  This is not contested
by any of the parties.

[13]                         
The application judge concluded, however, that [translation] “[t]he evidence requires
that [B’s] situation be viewed differently depending on whether information was
being disclosed to the [first police force]  or to investigators from the
Sûreté du Québec”.  As to B’s status with the SQ, the application judge saw the
evidence as presenting “two diametrically opposed versions” of events.  The
application judge rejected B’s evidence that the SQ had expressly told him that
he was a confidential informer, and accepted the SQ’s denial that any such
promise was made.    

[14]                         
While he noted that it was [translation] “odd”
that the police would ask a person to renounce his right to invoke police
informer privilege if it had never been offered in the first place, the
application judge nonetheless ultimately accepted the testimony of the Crown’s
witnesses and found that B’s testimony was not credible.  He therefore
concluded that B had never been promised police informer status by the SQ in
exchange for his statements. 

[15]                         
But the application judge undertook no analysis
into whether the promise was implicit in the circumstances because of the nexus
between the first police force, who had expressly granted B informer status,
and the SQ, to whom the first force immediately transferred B because they
lacked jurisdiction over the crimes he was describing. That oversight was based
on the application judge’s conclusion that B’s relationships with the first
police force and the SQ had to be treated differently.  The application judge
therefore ignored B’s relationship with the first force entirely when assessing
his status vis-à-vis the SQ.  

[16]                         
The application judge never explained why the
two forces had to be treated differently, nor did he make any findings related
to the issue. Instead, his analysis unfolded based on this unexplored
assumption. Yet B only became involved with the SQ due to his collaboration
with the first police force as a confidential informer.  The failure to
consider this nexus, in my respectful view, meant that the application judge
did not consider whether the police conduct gave rise to an implicit promise of
protected status.  In other words, would the police conduct have led someone in
B’s position to believe, on reasonable grounds, that his protected status would
continue when he and his information were transferred to the SQ?

[17]                         
I would set aside the application judge’s order
and direct that a new hearing take place to determine B’s status in light of
the nexus between the police forces.

Analysis

[18]                         
In R. v. Barros, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 368,
this Court held that “not everybody who provides
information to the police thereby becomes a confidential informant” (para.
31).  The Court was clear, however, that “the promise [of protection and
confidentiality] need not be express [and] may be implicit in the circumstances”
(para. 31, citing Bisaillon v. Keable, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 60). The legal question is whether, objectively,
an implicit promise of confidentiality can be inferred from the circumstances. 
In other words, would the police conduct have led a person in the shoes of the
potential informer to believe, on reasonable grounds, that his or her identity
would be protected? Related to this, is there evidence from which it can
reasonably be inferred that the potential informer believed that informer
status was being or had been bestowed on him or her? An implicit promise of
informer privilege may arise even if the police did not intend to confer that
status or consider the person an informer, so long as the police conduct in all
the circumstances could have created reasonable expectations of
confidentiality.

[19]                         
The application judge recognized that the
promise of confidentiality could be either explicit or implicit, but he
undertook no analysis into whether an implicit promise could have been inferred
from the circumstances of the relationship between the two police forces. In
fairness, a theory based on an implicit promise of confidentiality was not
specifically argued before the application judge. The arguments before him
centred on B’s claims that SQ officers had expressly and repeatedly told
him that his identity would remain confidential, which the officers denied.
Once the application judge found against B on that point, he effectively
overlooked the possibility that the police conduct, even in the absence of any
express statements, could have amounted to an implicit promise of
confidentiality.

[20]                         
Justice Cromwell states that there is no live
issue as to whether B received an implicit promise of confidentiality,
because the application judge effectively found that B knew that he did
not have informant status with the SQ. With respect, those were not the
application judge’s findings. I agree that if there had been a finding that B
actually knew that he did not have informant status, the inquiry would end
there. But there was no such finding. What the application judge did was to
reject B’s claims that the SQ expressly promised him confidential
informer status. He invoked B’s [translation]
“doubtful credibility . . . and . . . obvious opportunism”. In other words, the
application judge found that B lied in saying that the SQ officers expressly
promised him confidentiality in order to bolster his claim. That does not,
however, amount to a finding that B knew all along that he did not benefit from
confidentiality with the SQ. 

[21]                         
Similarly, B’s failure to testify about an
implicit promise does not necessarily mean that no such promise was made or
that he knew that informer status had been withheld. While B may have been found
not to be credible about receiving explicit promises of confidentiality,
the evidence in the record of a nexus between the police forces leaves open the
possibility of an implicit promise. B’s “obvious opportunism” and lack of
credibility do not, in the circumstances of this case, close the door to
finding an implicit promise of confidentiality, nor do they dispense
with the need for the application judge to examine the nexus between the
investigations and determine whether it gave rise to such a promise.  It is
hard to speculate what the application judge’s findings might have been
had he specifically turned his mind to the issue.

[22]                         
For me, the possibility of an implied promise of
confidentiality emerges from this record based on the nexus between the first
police force and the SQ, and the SQ’s failure to clarify to B what his status
was. First, B’s interactions with the SQ originated in his relationship as a
confidential informant with the first police force and the two police forces
cooperated in handling B over the following years. In addition, the evidence is
undisputed that no one ever told B that he ceased to be a confidential
informant when he was transferred to the SQ, even though it is also undisputed
that he repeatedly asked the SQ to clarify his status. 

[23]                         
The key issue is the nexus between the police
forces. B advanced the argument that all police forces
are “indivisible” with respect to police informer privilege such that, where
one police force extends a promise of confidentiality to an informer, that
status will continue to attach to the person when he or she is transferred to
another force.  I see no need for such a blunt “indivisibility” rule.  The fact
that one police force has granted informer status to an individual is not, on
its own, a sufficient basis for a claim of informer privilege with another
police force.

[24]                         
This is not to say that B’s transfer from one
police force to another is irrelevant to whether B had reason to believe that
he had been given informer privilege by the SQ. Given the interactions between
the two police forces in handling B, and given the essential continuity of B’s
relationship with both forces, in my view B may have had reasonable grounds to
believe that the protection promised by the first police force would continue with
the ongoing flow of information that he was providing to the SQ.

[25]                         
B approached the first police force in order to
provide information about violent crimes.  He was
promised informer privilege with respect to the
information that he provided to that force from their initial meeting onwards.  One of the two officers who had been at that meeting explained
that he perceived a strong need for confidentiality as of that first meeting,
given the risk to B’s safety and the sensitive information he was providing
concerning serious criminal activity:

[translation] We can’t afford to put [his] safety at risk. 
One thing that’s absolutely certain is that we wouldn’t have time to, as we
say, . . . “code” [him] at that time; there’s a coding procedure and
all that.  But in our minds, everything Named Person B told us . . . went into
a classified file to protect [his] . . . shall we say, secrets. 

 

. . . 

 

 

. . . everything that was said .
. . [h]ad to remain highly confidential, and there was evidence there that
related to past investigations, [violent crimes].   We couldn’t afford to
. . . we couldn’t give it a low classification.  It had to be given a
high classification . . . . 

[26]                         
In its investigations, the SQ used confidential
information B had given to the first police force during their initial
meetings, prior to the SQ’s involvement. Significantly, that information was
unrelated to the charges against B, and included a list of
individuals involved in violent criminal activity. In other words, while it is
true that the SQ arrested B for a violent crime that he committed, the SQ
treated B as much more than merely a suspect in a serious crime. B was
expected, and in fact continued to provide the SQ with information about
violent criminal activity, just as he had done with the first police force. 

[27]                         
There is no doubt that the SQ knew of B’s
protected status with the first police force.  One of the SQ officers who
arrested B acknowledged that when the SQ picked B up, they knew that B had
provided [translation] “a lot of
information” to the first police force, that B wanted to cooperate by providing
information, that he was “protected” by that other
force, and that the SQ would have to continue to protect him:

[translation] Well, we knew from the beginning that Named Person B wanted to give
information, there was no secret about it, and when we took charge of Named
Person B, it was because the [first police force] told us [he] was implicated in
[violent criminal activity, for which] the Sûreté du Québec [was] responsible.
. . .  So we met [him] as a [violent crime] suspect, but we knew that this
person . . . wanted to co-operate with the Sûreté.  We knew that
[he]’d given information to the [first police force].  We knew that this was a
person who was protected by the [first police force].  We knew that we were the
ones who would continue to protect [him].  So, we were in a sense [his]
controllers. [Emphasis added.]

[28]                         
 Another SQ officer who had dealt with B from
the beginning acknowledged that he knew that B was coded as a “source” by the
other police force when he first talked to him upon his transfer from that
force.  The exchange at the hearing was as follows:

[translation]

 

Q     Was [he] already classified as a “source” by the Quebec
police?

 

. . .

 

A     I would say, to the best of my knowledge, I would say no.

 

. . .

 

Q     Did you know that [he] had been one for the [first police
force]  or that [he] still was one for the [first police force]?

 

A     A “source” for the [first police force]?

 

Q     Yeah.

 

A     It’d been coded that way . . . . [Emphasis
added.]  

 

[29]                         
Notes taken two years after B’s arrest by an
officer of the first police force following a conversation with an SQ officer
(introduced as fresh evidence), confirm that the first police force put the SQ
on notice that B benefitted from confidentiality:

[translation]

 

[The SQ officer and I]
discussed [B] and the information that source had given [the two officers of
the first police force who first met with B].

 

Informer privilege was
discussed.  On this subject, I said that [B] had the privilege because [he] had
given the information as a source and [he] had an expectation of
confidentiality.

 

I told [the SQ officer] that in
my opinion, though I’m not a lawyer, if the information is confidential and if
it is included in [any document], it should be redacted.  To be confirmed with
a lawyer.

[30]                         
For five years, B continued to provide the SQ
with wide-ranging information dealing with violent crimes. SQ officers kept
going back to him as a source, and his information led to the investigation and
prosecution of many other crimes.

[31]                         
During the years when he was being questioned, B
knew that he was being dealt with interchangeably by both police forces.  At
various points, he stayed under the first police force’s guard or at that
force’s premises and was picked up there by SQ officers. 
On at least three occasions, an officer of the first
force met with B along with SQ officers. 

[32]                         
At the hearing, an SQ officer acknowledged that
the first police force and the SQ were effectively operating together in
respect of an investigation that developed around B’s information. In order to
show his good faith, B had surrendered various items to the SQ, including
thousands of dollars.  The SQ turned the money over to the first police force.
When asked why the SQ turned the money over to that force, the SQ officer noted
that [translation] “[the first force] was on the
case, was . . . participating in the case”.  He referred to the joint
handling of B as “a sort of interorganizational project”. 

[33]                         
This interconnection is also reflected in a
letter sent by an officer of the first police force to the SQ with respect to
the money, which acknowledges B’s confidentiality with the first force and
implies that that force believed that B had a similar status with the SQ. The
officer asked the SQ to return the money to B because
the only evidence that the money was the proceeds of crime was given by B to
the SQ under a promise that it would not be used against him. He indicated that

[translation]
given the status of [B] with the Sûreté du Québec and the [first police force],
and given our obligation to keep this status confidential, we have been
unable to gather any other evidence that could be used.  [Emphasis added.]

[34]                         
In other words, the relationship between B and
the SQ was not only connected to the first police force in an ongoing way, it
was not significantly different from that between B and the first force. Both
police forces warned him that he would receive no immunity in respect of his
own criminal acts, and both forces expected him to become a cooperating witness
in other cases. Based on B’s information, the two police forces worked together
and dealt with B interchangeably. 

[35]                         
This evidence of a close connection between the
first police force and the SQ establishes a foundation upon which
someone in B’s position may reasonably have seen himself as being part of a
joint, ongoing operation between the two police forces: the first force had
given him an express promise of informer privilege, and the SQ, to whom he was
transferred consensually for jurisdictional reasons, took advantage of the
relationship and information that flowed from this protection.

[36]                         
In addition to the temporal and operational
nexus between the two forces, the evidence is
undisputed that B insistently asked what his status was and never received a
clear answer. An SQ officer who had dealt with B since his arrest testified
that around the time of his transfer to the SQ, B [translation] “was
worried about what was going to happen to [him]”, and that he was “deeply
concerned” about this.  It was a source of stress for B, who was “extremely
afraid” that he would be killed.   Another SQ officer testified that B was
asking about his status two years after his transfer. The application judge
found that B was still asking about his status two years after that. 

[37]                         
The SQ’s conduct in failing to clarify B’s
status to him despite being repeatedly asked to do so, may well have led
someone in B’s position to reasonably believe that his identity would be
protected. It bears emphasizing that no one ever told B that he was not
a confidential informant with the SQ.   One of the SQ
officers who arrested B, for instance, testified that he did not discuss B’s
status with him when he first took B into SQ custody, because B had already
“started the process” with the first police force:

[translation]

 

Q     Was [his] testimony as a cooperating witness, [his] status
discussed . . . .

 

A     It was not discussed.

 

Q     . . . at that time?

 

A     No, because [he]’d already started with the [first police
force]. Named Person B, [he] was in a process with [that force], we knew
that [he]’d given a lot of information to the [first force].  We knew that
because we’d met the guys from that force.  So I don’t know what Named Person B
might’ve been thinking at that time.  [He] . . . was in a process
in [his] mind, that’s for sure, for sure . . . because
. . . [he] was cooperating with [the first force].  [Emphasis
added.]

Although this officer was
referring to the process of becoming a cooperating witness, the “process” B had
started with the first police force included a promise of confidentiality made
only two days earlier. 

[38]                         
While the SQ officers were adamant that
they did not think of B as an informer, they do not appear to have shared this
view with B. B was promised confidentiality by the first police force because
his cooperation put his life at risk. The risk did not change when he was transferred
to the SQ two days later. From that point onward, B
repeatedly voiced concerns about his confidentiality, his safety, and the
uncertainty and confusion he felt while waiting for the possibility of a
cooperating witness contract to materialize.

[39]                         
There is no doubt that much of the focus of B’s
questions related to whether the cooperating witness contract was forthcoming
and to the type of protection that he would be given under it. But there is
also no doubt that he voiced inquiries that raised confidentiality concerns.
Where B’s status was in flux and unclear as a result of his transfer from one
police force to another, the SQ’s failure to clarify his status may have given
rise to a reasonable belief in informer status, whether or not he actually asked
a specific question like, “Will I be treated as a police informer in the event
of failure to conclude a cooperating witness contract?” 

[40]                         
In these circumstances, the fact that nobody
clarified for him whether the confidentiality promised by the first police
force continued to apply to his dealings with the SQ could well have led him to
believe that the protection he had with the first force continued pending the
cooperating witness contract.  

[41]                         
The fresh evidence also illustrates the
ambiguity generated by the SQ’s approach to B’s status. Two documents introduced as fresh evidence
were written by one of the SQ officers who had been involved with B since his
transfer. These documents followed a discussion the SQ
officer had two years after B’s arrest with an officer of the first police
force about B’s status. In these documents, B was referred
to as a “source”, as was the practice with informers, rather than by name. Many
other documents prepared by SQ officers refer to B by his name. In other words,
SQ officers inconsistently referred to B, sometimes designating him by his real
name, and sometimes calling him an informer. Their confusion may well have led
B to reasonably assume that his confidential status remained unchanged upon his
transfer from the first police force to the SQ.

[42]                         
Justice Cromwell concludes that B could not
reasonably have believed that the SQ considered him an informer, given the
expectation that he would become a cooperating witness. But informer privilege
is not necessarily inconsistent with being a cooperating witness. B’s position at the hearing was that he believed he would remain a
police informer until he secured a cooperating witness contract with the Crown.
In other words, his identity would remain confidential until the Crown confirmed
that it intended to call him as a witness and provide certain advantages in
exchange for his testimony. 

[43]                         
As this Court recognized
in Barros, the same person can be an informer entitled to privilege in
one matter, and a witness whose identity is disclosable in another:

Once a police informer goes into the
“field” and acts as a police agent, the informer privilege is no longer
applicable to prevent disclosure of his or her identity in respect of the
events in which he or she acted as an agent. . . . This does not mean, of
course, that the informer loses protection in other cases where he or she has
not stepped out of the protected role. [Emphasis added; para. 33.]

Witnesses can even
testify without having to disclose that they supplied confidential information
to the police in that same matter, as this Court noted in R. v. Leipert,
[1997] 1 S.C.R. 281, at para. 17: “[Informer privilege] applies to a witness on
the stand. Such a person cannot be compelled to state whether he or she is a
police informer . . .”. This possibility has been recognized since Attorney-General
v. Briant (1846), 15 M. & W. 169, 153 E.R. 808, in which Pollock C.B.
held that a Crown witness could not be asked, “Did you give the information?”
that led to the institution of penal proceedings. Finally,
while informers typically waive privilege when they agree to testify, nothing
prevents them from keeping their privilege until there is a firm decision to
testify by both the informer and the prosecution.

[44]                         
SQ officers gave B several reassurances that may
have reinforced his view that he was an informer until he became a
cooperating witness. One of the two SQ officers who arrested B explained to him
that he would never have to testify in relation to any of the information he
provided unless a cooperating witness contract was signed: 

[translation]

 

A     . . . And I also explained to [him] that if [he] didn’t sign a
contract, [he] would never have to testify about any of the things [he]’d given
us under a promise. . . .

 

Q     Under a promise of . . . that it couldn’t be used against
[him]?

 

A     That’s it. . . .  [He] wouldn’t have to
testify, because the contract is so that the person will testify . . .
and that’s the point of the contract . . . .  

 

Q     If there was no contract, well, [he] wouldn’t have to
testify. . . . 

 

A     That’s it.

[45]                         
Moreover, another SQ officer testified that he
always made it clear to B that his statements were confidential:

[translation]

 

Q     But Named Person B asked you several times: “Hey, my
statements, what’re you doing with them?  Will they stay confidential?  Don’t
show that to anyone.”

 

A     They were always confidential.

 

Q     They were always confidential?

 

A     Yes.

 

Q     But you were always clear with Named Person B that they were
confidential?

 

A     They were always confidential. The only thing . . . 
When I say confidential, it’s that those statements weren’t shown to other
accused, or potential accused, or even “accusables” . . . .
[Emphasis in original.]

 

He also said that he repeatedly
reassured B that none of his statements had ever been disclosed:

[TRANSLATION]

 

Q     But [he] was told they were confidential?

 

A     As far as I know, [his] statements were never disclosed in any
case.  Except for [one time] . . .  we didn’t disclose any
statements.  In fact, it bothered me at times, and I would tell [him]: “Look, don’t
worry, nothing in the file, nothing’s been disclosed”.

[46]                         
 This officer said that there was only one
exception to the confidentiality which generally applied to B’s statements: on
one occasion, a statement was disclosed in another investigation. The SQ did so
without B’s knowledge or consent. The exceptional use of B’s statements a few
years after the start of his relationship with the SQ is hardly revelatory of
whether B could reasonably have believed that his identity was being protected
throughout that time.

[47]                         
It is true that B gave statements to the SQ
after being cautioned that they could be used as evidence in court against
third parties. But these cautions must be juxtaposed against the repeated
reassurances from SQ officers that B’s statements would remain confidential,
and that B would never have to testify on those subjects unless and until
he became a cooperating witness. At the very least, the SQ sent mixed signals
to B concerning the confidentiality of his statements, and never clearly denied
that he benefitted from confidentiality. In my view, the net effect of these
mixed signals from the SQ on B’s reasonable expectation of confidentiality must
be decided at a new hearing. 

[48]                         
Significantly too, five years after B’s transfer
to the SQ, the Crown ordered the SQ to redact all documents that could identify
B, and asked that a signed waiver of privilege be obtained from B. SQ officers
repeatedly visited B for that purpose. Had there been certainty that B’s status
was not protected, these steps would not have been necessary. The
application judge acknowledged that the Crown’s request for a waiver of
privilege was [translation]
“contradictory” and “odd” given the SQ officers’
position that they had never promised B confidentiality, concluding: “Had the
intention been to confuse, it could not have been done better.” 

[49]                         
All of this, including the uncontradicted
evidence that B was not told by the SQ what his status was, makes it possible
that someone in B’s circumstances could reasonably believe that the confidentiality
he was promised by the first police force continued when they transferred him
to the SQ.  I would therefore allow the appeal and remit the matter for
reconsideration in light of these reasons.

                    Cromwell J.  (dissenting) — 

I.  Overview

[50]                         
The appellant, B, provided information about
criminal activity ― his own and that of others ― to the Sûreté
du Québec (“SQ”).[2]  
The issue here is whether B had confidential informer status with respect to
the information.   The application judge, after a hearing at which B and a
number of police officers testified, decided that B did not have that status. 
This appeal challenges that conclusion. 

[51]                         
My colleague Abella J. would hold that the
application judge’s ruling must be set aside and the matter reheard,
essentially for two reasons.   First, the application judge “undertook no
analysis” into whether the promise of confidential informer status was implicit
in the circumstances (paras. 15 and 19).   Second, this issue which the
application judge failed to consider is a live issue on this record because
there is evidence, including new evidence, to support the conclusion that “the
police conduct [would] have led someone in B’s position to
believe, on reasonable grounds, that [his status was] protected” (para. 16).
The failure to consider this live issue therefore requires a new hearing.  I
cannot subscribe to my colleague’s conclusion or the reasons for it.  My
disagreement is based on the following interrelated points.

[52]                         
First, the analysis of the appeal in my view
must take place in the context of the concrete realities of this case and
within the proper limits of appellate review. Respectfully, my colleague’s
analysis is directed towards hypothetical possibilities that are either
contrary to clear findings by the application judge or have no air of reality
on the record before the Court. 

[53]                         
Second, the application judge, as I see it, did
not fail to consider whether a promise of confidential informer status could be
implicit in this case.  In my view, the judge’s factual findings and the
record amply support the conclusion that he considered that possibility.

[54]                         
Third, as I read the record in light of the
application judge’s extensive findings, there is no evidence to support the
view that there may have been some implicit promise in this case.  In fact,
this possibility is inconsistent with B’s own evidence and with the
circumstances under which B was treated by the SQ. Moreover, the application
judge specifically considered whether an implicit promise had been made and
made explicit findings of fact that the SQ never did anything that could
allow B to understand that he would become a confidential police informer. 
As I see it there is no live issue on this point.

[55]                         
Fourth, the application judge found as a fact
that B actually knew from his first dealings, and during his subsequent
dealings, with the SQ that he had no promise that he would be a confidential
source for the SQ and that the claim of informer status was an after-the-fact
exercise in opportunism on B’s part.  This conclusion, amply supported by the
record, makes irrelevant what some hypothetical person in B’s position might
have thought.  B thought no such thing and, knowing he did not have any promise
of confidentiality, supplied information to the SQ for a number of years.  As
the application judge found, B’s assertion of informer privilege came only when
the Crown, in the context of discharging disclosure obligations in another
prosecution, thought it advisable to have B’s status clarified by a judicial
determination.  The judge dismissed B’s after-the-fact claims as showing [translation] “obvious opportunism” on
his part. 

[56]                         
I would dismiss the appeal.

II.     Issues, Facts and Proceedings

A.     Introduction

[57]                         
The appellant, B, provided information about
criminal activity — his own and that of others — over a number of years to the
SQ in the hopes of being retained as a [translation]
“co-operating witness” and of receiving the type of remuneration and other
benefits normally commensurate with this type of co-operation.    Ultimately,
individuals (some of whom are parties to this appeal and are referred to as the
“Other Individuals”) were charged with several violent crimes and it is in the
context of their trial that the question of B’s possible status as a
confidential police informer arises.

[58]                         
If information provided by B met the Stinchcombe
standard, it would normally have to be disclosed: R. v. Stinchcombe,
[1991] 3 S.C.R. 326.  However, B claimed to have confidential police informer
status: therefore, B’s identity as the supplier of the information to the SQ
was privileged and must not be disclosed.  The Crown’s position, however, is
that B has no such status.  

[59]                         
B’s status of course could significantly affect
the scope of the Crown’s disclosure obligation to the Other Individuals at
their trial.  If B is a confidential source with respect to certain information,
then B’s identity as the supplier of that information must be kept
confidential, along with any other information that could reveal B’s identity
as the source in that regard.  None of this confidential information could be
disclosed, subject only to an accused establishing that it falls within the
“innocence at stake” exception or unless both B and the police waive the
privilege.  Otherwise, the confidentiality is absolute and disclosure cannot be
made.  The impact on disclosure is thus potentially considerable.

[60]                         
The Crown applied to the application judge for a
determination of this issue and the application judge held that B was not a
confidential informer with respect to information he supplied to the SQ. 

B.          
Issues

[61]                         
The principal issues, as the appeal has evolved,
are these: 

1.           
What are the concrete realities of this case and
the proper limits of appellate review which form the basis for consideration of
the appeal? In my view, the judge’s express findings of fact, read in light of
the record leave no room for appellate intervention with respect to his
conclusion that B was not a confidential source for the SQ.

2.           
Did the application judge fail to consider
whether a promise of confidential informer status could be implicit in this
case?  In my view he did not.   

3.           
Is there a live issue on this record as to
whether there may have been an implicit promise of informer privilege by the
SQ? In my view there is not.  

4.           
Is the application judge’s finding of fact that
B actually knew that he did not have confidential informer status fatal to B’s
claim?  In my view it is.

C.     Background Facts

         (1)      The Appellant Seeks Out the Police

[62]                         
The appellant, motivated by a desire to avenge
himself against others and to make amends for his past criminal activity,
contacted the police.  He sought to provide information about past crimes and
to assist in their prosecution.  

[63]                         
Soon thereafter, the appellant was put under
arrest by the SQ, cautioned and detained for his criminal activity.  Of course,
that warning would have included advice that anything B said could be used as
evidence.  During the application hearing, Crown counsel read out the warning
given to B by the SQ before taking B’s statements regarding his criminal
activity.  

[translation]

 

Q     And when [he] told you then: My name is . . . . I’m going to
read you a warning.  You can sit down.  I want to inform you that you’re under
arrest. . . .

 

. . .

 

Q     . . . you have the right to remain silent.  We must inform you
that we are police officers.  You are not required to say anything, and you
must understand clearly that if you wish to speak, everything you say will
be taken down . . . and can be used as evidence against you. [Emphasis
added.]

 

[64]                         
The appellant gave a statement to the SQ
regarding his involvement in criminal activity, going so far as to bring SQ
officers to the crime scene.  B was told by the police at the outset that B
would be held to account for his crime.  It was therefore clear to B that those
matters were not subject to any sort of confidentiality obligation.  B’s
arrest, detention and cautioning by the SQ are in every respect consistent with
that advice.

[65]                         
I also underline the application judge’s finding
that B stated that from the beginning of his co-operation with the police, B
both wanted and expected to testify at future trials.  In the circumstances
here, as the application judge found, B could not possibly become a Crown witness
and a confidential police informer with the SQ.  

[66]                         
The next day, the appellant was arrested and
cautioned for another crime.  Again, B freely made a statement discussing
several subjects, including the extent of B’s involvement in that crime.  

[67]                         
I underline the cautions given to B by the SQ to
the effect any statements could be used in evidence.

[68]                         
The appellant’s co-operation subsequently
continued to intensify, as he provided the SQ with further statements
implicating other individuals in serious crimes.  Several of these statements
were made under a promise by the SQ that they would not be used as
incriminating evidence against the appellant.  

[69]                         
The SQ officers involved, realizing that the
appellant could possibly be of great use to them in solving other cases,
started to evaluate whether he could make a suitable co-operating witness.  

[70]                         
As a result of their frequent meetings, they
registered the appellant as an informer in the SQ database, apparently to
enable them to incur secret expenses for him.  Indeed, though this type of code
was normally used to identify confidential informers in its database, the SQ
was clear that it had been attributed to the appellant for purely
administrative imperatives.  As an SQ officer testified, this registration was
warranted because secret expenses could only be reimbursed if incurred for the
benefit of an individual who had such a code assigned to him in the SQ
database.  

[71]                         
Soon after his first meeting with the SQ, the
latter also submitted the appellant to a polygraph test, one of the important
preliminary steps to obtaining co-operating witness status.  

         (2)      The Appellant Shows Signs of Impatience 

[72]                         
While the administration of the polygraph test
could have been interpreted by the appellant as an encouraging sign that a co-operating
witness contract was forthcoming, B was not appeased.  He soon thereafter
became nervous about the Crown’s lateness in formalizing his status as a
co-operating witness and voiced this to the SQ.  He insisted on being promptly
informed of the state of his co-operating witness application and on receiving
clarification about his status in the meantime.  He threatened, at one point,
to starve himself and stop co-operating with the SQ until he was formally
recognized as a co-operating witness.

[73]                         
The appellant testified that his insistence led
the SQ to tell him that he would be considered a confidential police informer
until it received instructions as to whether his co-operating witness candidacy
was approved.  The SQ police officers who testified, on the other hand, denied
ever making such a promise.  Their view of the situation was that he was in the
process of becoming a co-operating witness (and some explicitly told him this)
and that the idea of making him a confidential informer had not crossed their
mind at that time.  The application judge accepted the police evidence and
rejected that of B.  The appellant continued to cooperate with the SQ for a
time after this episode.  

         (3)      The Appellant Continues Co-operation With the
SQ 

[74]                         
Almost a year after being arrested, the
appellant was informed by officers that the Crown had decided against enrolling
the appellant as a co-operating witness.  The Crown had decided against calling
B as a witness in future trials and therefore that status was in the Crown’s
view unnecessary.

[75]                         
The SQ later informed B that there was a
possibility that B would be offered a co-operating witness contract
nonetheless.  The appellant accepted the police’s offer and a co-operative
relationship between the SQ and the appellant was re-established.  

[76]                         
After B resumed active co-operation with the SQ,
he later gave several statements to the SQ.  It is worth noting here that
though it was made clear to the appellant that these statements could not be
used against him in a court of law, it was also made clear that they
could be used as evidence in the trials of third parties. As I shall
discuss and the application judge rightly found, in these circumstances, the
roles of potential witness and police informer were completely inconsistent, as
B would well have understood.  

[77]                         
Subsequently, the appellant had occasional
dealings with the SQ, either in person or by phone, providing additional
information.  On these occasions, the SQ provided assurances that a
co-operating witness contract was probably forthcoming.  

         (4)      Non-completion of the Co-operating Witness
Contract

[78]                         
The following year, SQ officers met with the
appellant to transmit, on behalf of the Crown, a new offer in a case before the
court.  The SQ officers also informed him that he would, for the time being, be
considered a special witness (a witness who benefits from police protection
because of the sensitive nature of the information that he may be called upon
to testify on, but who does not obtain the financial advantages normally
commensurate with being a co-operating witness).  They assured him however that
his co-operating witness application was still pending.  

[79]                         
A few weeks later, the appellant contacted the
SQ, seeking assurances about the progress of his co-operating witness
application.  The appellant testified that he was told by an SQ officer, with
another officer present, that his contract was forthcoming and that, in any
event, he was considered a confidential police informer in the meantime. 
Again, this is denied by the SQ. The officer, on the other hand, claims only to
have told him that he wanted him to testify in court, and assured him that he
was taking care of him and his safety.  According to the officer, the option of
granting the appellant confidential informer status was never contemplated
because he was always sure that the appellant would be given a co-operating
witness contract.  As noted earlier, the application judge accepted the police
evidence.

[80]                         
What is uncontested, however, is that the
evaluation process was progressing.  Officers took the appellant to other
SQ-controlled premises later that same year, where he made full disclosure of
his criminal past — a prerequisite to the signature of a co-operating witness
contract.  He also met with Crown prosecutors a few days later.

[81]                         
A few months later, the appellant was questioned
again with the assurance that his statements would not be used against him in a
court of law.  He was questioned regarding several inconsistencies between
different statements he had made to the police and to Crown prosecutors.  It is
clear that his credibility was being tested, as is often done when evaluating
the suitability of a co-operating witness candidate and his potential for
providing convincing testimony in court.  

[82]                         
However, the Crown ultimately decided against
entering into the arrangement because it did not intend to have him testify for
the moment.  He would therefore not be retained as a co-operating witness.  

         (5)      The Crown Attempts to Clarify Appellant’s
Status

[83]                         
The Crown, having decided not to retain the
appellant as a co-operating witness, sought to clarify the appellant’s status
in order to properly discharge its disclosure obligations.  While this was
being sorted out, the Crown, as a measure of precaution, ordered that the
appellant’s name and any information capable of leading to the discovery of his
identity be redacted from various documents. 

[84]                         
Chief among its concerns was its desire to
clarify whether or not the appellant benefited from informer privilege, for if
he did, much of his statements even if otherwise subject to disclosure would
not be so subject.  In an effort to clear up this issue, the Crown sent a
police officer to meet with the appellant and ask him whether he would agree to
sign a document whereby he would undertake not to seek to invoke informer
privilege regarding the information he had provided the SQ.  The appellant
refused.  The Crown therefore brought a motion before the court seeking to
determine whether or not the appellant benefited from informer privilege. 
After witness testimony and argument by counsel, the judge held that B did not
benefit from informer privilege in regard to that information.  

D.  Judgment Below

[85]                         
After having reviewed this Court’s decisions in Bisaillon
v. Keable, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 60; R. v. Leipert, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 281; Named
Person v. Vancouver Sun, 2007 SCC 43, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 253, and the Ontario
Court of Appeal’s decision in R. v. Babes (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 465,
the application judge held that in order for informer privilege to apply, the
police had to explicitly or implicitly promise a claimant that his identity as
the provider of information would be kept confidential.  He added that the
burden rested on the individual claiming informer privilege to demonstrate, on
a balance of probabilities, that he was entitled to benefit from it.  

[86]                         
The appellant testified about this issue during
the hearing, admitting that the purpose for initially coming forward to the
police was to get revenge.  B further testified that he hoped to become a
co-operating witness and that B’s statements would not be used against B in a
court of law.  Nevertheless, the appellant testified that he believed he
benefited from informer privilege because he had been assured of this many
times by several SQ officers.  According to B, he had been told that he would
be considered a confidential informer as long as the hoped-for co-operating
witness agreement with the Crown had not been finalized.  B’s position
throughout was that the SQ had made an explicit promise of informer status. 
B’s position in his evidence was never that he had inferred from police conduct
that they were promising B informer status or that anything done by the police
force fed any such inference.

[87]                         
The Crown also called several SQ officers to
testify in that regard.  They all indicated that the appellant had never been considered
a confidential informer and had never been told so.  In fact, they indicated
that they always had in mind that B was in the process of becoming a
co-operating witness and would testify in future court proceedings.  The
prospect of granting B informer privilege had, according to them, simply never
been on their radar.

[88]                         
After having considered the testimonial and
documentary evidence before him, the application judge proceeded to identify
the elements which supported the parties’ respective positions.  

[89]                         
In support of the appellant’s position, the
application judge noted the fact that the SQ in some respects treated B as it
would a confidential informer and had invited him to sign a document whereby he
would undertake not to seek to invoke informer privilege regarding the
information he had provided the SQ.

[90]                         
In support of the opposite conclusion, the
application judge noted, amongst other things, that (1) the appellant wished to
become a police agent and expected to have to testify in future trials, (2) B
was arrested for violent criminal activity and the information that he gave the
SQ in that regard was used against B, (3) B gave a statement soon after his
first meeting with the SQ knowing that this could lead to charges of violent
criminal activity, (4) the SQ never produced any source reports regarding the
information gathered from him, (5) B was offered immunity and an undertaking
not to testify in a prosecution, (6) one of the appellant’s statements was
disclosed in the course of another investigation (this is incompatible with the
confidentiality owed to an individual benefiting from informer privilege), and
that (7) the appellant gave several statements in regards of which he was
warned they could be used as evidence in the trial of others.

[91]                         
Having completed this exercise, the application
judge acknowledged that it was certainly surprising to [translation] “ask someone considered to be a possible
witness to waive [his] police informer privilege [some] years after having
assigned [him] an identifier reserved for sources”.  He also found quite
strange that the Crown asked the appellant to undertake not to seek to invoke a
privilege that only the SQ police officers could have granted and that they
maintained never having granted.  

[92]                         
Nevertheless, the application judge remained of
the view that no express or implied understanding existed between the SQ and
the appellant that he would be conferred confidential informer status. Contrary
to Justice Abella’s suggestion that the key question of whether there was an
implicit promise of confidentiality was left unanswered, this question was in
fact specifically answered in the negative by the application judge. 
Recognizing that the evidence was contradictory, he largely rejected the
appellant’s testimony as lacking credibility, and instead accepted the evidence
of the SQ officers.  

[93]                         
The application judge further found that the
appellant had always, since his first meeting with the SQ, understood
that he would testify in other trials.  B’s insistence on obtaining confidential
informer status was sparked, the application judge found, by disappointment
with not being signed on as a co-operating witness and the fruitlessness of the
negotiations with the witness protection programme. The application judge was
of the view that the appellant seized the opportunity of trying to invoke
informer privilege when the Crown tried to obtain an undertaking not to seek to
invoke informer privilege; on account of this, the appellant’s behaviour, the
application judge opined, was that of an obvious opportunist.  Considering this
express finding that B only sought to assert privilege after the fact, it is my
view that we can conclude that, contrary to my colleague’s statement at para.
20, this does “amount to a finding that B knew all along that he did not
benefit from confidentiality with the SQ”. 

[94]                         
With all that having been said, the application
judge concluded that an analysis of the testimonies and the exhibits leads to
the overriding conclusion that the appellant did not benefit from informer
privilege in regard to the information provided to the SQ, but was rather a
compellable witness in the trial of other individuals. The judge further found
that the SQ had never done anything that would allow B to understand that he
would become a confidential police informer.

III.    Analysis

A.     What Are the Concrete Realities of This Case?

[95]                         
At the outset, I think it is important to note
the concrete realities of the case and the limits of appellate review against
which the appellant’s submissions must be assessed.  As I see it, there are
several matters that must be kept in mind.

[96]                         
First, the application judge expressly rejected
B’s evidence including the evidence that his status as a confidential police
informer was ever promised, or even discussed. He further found that the police
had done nothing that would permit B to understand that he was to become a
confidential police informer. It is worth setting out in full some key parts of
the application judge’s findings in this regard:

           [translation] Officers . . . who were
in regular contact with [B] from [the time of his first meeting with the SQ],
all state that they always dealt with [him] as a witness to crimes and that
they at no time suggested to [him] that they would one day consider [him] a
police informer should [he] not be granted a co-operating witness contract. 
[B] states categorically that the opposite is true and that the officers in
question formally undertook to do so on several occasions.

 

. . .

 

           The Court
accordingly accepts the version of the police witnesses, who have always, since
[B’s first meeting with the SQ], made it clear that they intended to have [B]
testify publicly about [his] disclosures, and who have always told [him] so
without ever suggesting to [him] that [he] might become a police informer
should there be no contract with the Crown.

 

. . .

 

           . . . the Court
must on the basis of the evidence as a whole find that there was no agreement, either
express or tacit, between [B] and the officers . . . under which
[he] had the status of a police informer . . . . [Emphasis added.]

 

[97]                         
Second, while it may in some rare cases be theoretically possible
for a person to be both a Crown witness and a confidential police informer, it
was not possible in B’s situation. The application judge recognized this as
indeed does B’s own counsel before this Court. Moreover, the application judge
specifically rejected as a matter of fact B’s evidence that he was promised
confidential informer status pending the resolution of the co-operating
witness process and accepted the police evidence that they did nothing
that could have led B to understand that he had confidential police informer
status at any point in their dealings.

[98]                         
Third, the fact that the police have an obligation to protect a
person has nothing to do with whether that person is a confidential police
informer. There is nothing inconsistent with the police position that, on the
one hand, they felt obliged to protect B, and on the other that B was not a
confidential police informer.

[99]                         
Fourth, it is not open to an appellate court to
reweigh the evidence in the record or to draw inferences from the evidence
which the application judge refused to draw absent some clear and determinative
error on the part of the application judge. In my respectful view, my colleague
Abella J.’s reasons run afoul of this important principle in more than one
respect.  

[100]                     
Consider, for example, my colleague’s repeated
references to B’s inquiries concerning his “status”.  In effect, my colleague
suggests that B asked repeatedly about whether he was a police informer and was
not given a straight answer.  Respectfully, that is not an inference that may
be fairly drawn from this record or the application judge’s findings of fact. 

[101]                     
B’s testimony that he was assured that he had
the status of a confidential police informer pending the outcome of the
co-operating witness contract process was specifically rejected by the
application judge. On the contrary, the judge found expressly that the police,
since B’s first meeting with the SQ, had always manifested the intention to
call B to testify publicly about his revelations to them and that their
discussions with him never allowed him to understand that he could become a
confidential source. 

[102]                     
According to the police witnesses, whose
evidence the judge accepted, B’s preoccupation was with getting a co-operating
witness contract — a contract that he could reasonably expect would provide
financial and other benefits.  It was about the progress of the process of
being given such a contract, not whether B was a confidential informer, that B
repeatedly inquired and in response to which the police advised that the
process was ongoing and that the Crown had the final decision.  Any implication
that B inquired about his status as a police informer and was not given a
straight answer is, respectfully, not supported by either the application
judge’s findings or by this record. In fact, the officers who testified on this
issue repeatedly asserted that a conversation about B’s status as a “source” or
“confidential informer” simply never occurred. For example, an officer
testified in the following manner:

[translation]

 

Q     But when [he] had these questions, do you remember that Named
Person B asked you: “Yeah, but then, if [he] doesn’t sign, what will you do
with me?

 

A     No.

 

Q     What am I?

 

A     No.

 

Q     . . . What are you doing with the statements?”

 

A     No.  We always worked with the idea that [he] would become a
co‑operating witness.  When I worked with [him], we took down statements,
we went looking for evidence.  It was clear to us that it was going to be given
to Crown prosecutors so that charges would be laid.  But I, anyway, it had been
explained to [him] how [he] would become a co­‑operating witness, that
is, that there were people who would be deciding that.  So we always worked
with the idea that [he] would become a co‑operating witness. 

Another officer’s
testimony on this issue is also instructive:

[translation]

 

Q     And Named Person B, when [he] spoke with you, am I right to
say that [he] told you a number of times: “I want to be a ‘source’, I don’t
want you to give my statements to anyone” . . . .

 

A     No, Named Person B . . . .

 

Q     . . .

 

A     No, Named Person B, [his] statements were targeted, and we
used them . . .  Named Person B, every time [he] was with us,
[he] knew we were using [his] statements.

Yet another officer
provides a similar answer to this question:

[translation]

 

Q     Did you . . . at the beginning of your relationship, if I can
call it that . . . as controller with Named Person B, discuss
possible avenues for Named Person B at the level, to help you out a bit
. . . .  Did you describe [him], did you say “OK, you’re a ‘source’,
special witness or co‑operating witness in any event”?

 

A     Me, I never spoke . . . .   Me, in my work
there, the status of Named Person B, [he] was always going to become a co‑operating
witness, become a witness in the case.  It was always that. 

 

. . .

 

Q     But did you not also answer [him] that, at any rate, in the
meantime, you are a “source”?

 

A     No.  No.  [He] was always regarded as . . . .  In my
mind, [he] was going to testify.  It was a surprise when we learned that [he]
would not be testifying.  It was a surprise. 

In other words, none of
the officers involved failed to give B a straight answer about whether he was a
confidential source because there were no such discussions and the very idea of
B being or becoming a source never even crossed their minds. 

[103]                     
In my view, it is not open to this Court on
appeal to draw any inference from this record that B inquired whether or not he
was a “source” and did not receive a straight answer. Such an inference
is not only contrary to the evidence which the application judge accepted but
it is also contrary to the judge’s express finding of fact that the SQ did
nothing that could have led B to believe that he would become a confidential
police source.

[104]                     
My colleague also, in my respectful view,
oversteps the bounds of appellate review with respect to the issue of alleged
police promises of confidentiality. On this, the application judge was alive to
and expressly noted that there was a lack of clarity and consistency in the
evidence. A review of the record shows that there were indeed some
inconsistencies in the police evidence on this issue and that the term
“confidential” was used in several different senses. The judge even interjected
during the testimony of an officer in order to clarify the sense in which the
officer was using the term confidential. 

[105]                     
The apparent confusion about what was or was not
confidential is evident in the police testimony. For example, an officer — in
the passage cited by my colleague Abella J. at para. 44 — states that if B does
not sign a contract, he will not have to testify and his statements will not be
used against him, implying a certain level of confidentiality. Later, however,
he testified to having on one occasion acted in a way that was inconsistent
with B being a confidential source and insisted that B is not a “source”
because with a “source” you cannot divulge his identity.  Similarly, another
officer is inconsistent in his testimony about confidentiality. While in the
passage cited by my colleague at para. 45, the officer states that B’s
statements were “always confidential”, he also testifies to the fact that B was
never a police informer nor a confidential “source”.  On the other hand, the
evidence of another officer consistently contrasts B’s situation with that of a
police informer — whose identity and statements must be kept secret — and
states that there was no confidentiality. 

[106]                     
Sorting this out was the job of the application
judge, not of an appellate court.  The judge adverted to this issue (among
others) and made findings that the evidence showed that B in this case could
not be at the same time a police informer and prosecution witness, that the police
had consistently manifested the intention to call B as a witness and that the
police had never let B understand that he would become a confidential police
informer. There is in my view no basis to interfere with these clear findings.

[107]                     
With those matters in mind, I turn to the remaining issues.

B.     Did the Application Judge Fail
to Consider Whether a Promise of Confidential Informer Status Could Be Implicit
in This Case?

[108]                     
My colleague Abella J. finds that the
application judge’s ruling ought to be quashed because he did not consider
whether a promise of confidential informer status could be implicit. 
Respectfully, I do not agree that the judge failed to consider the question. 
Several considerations lead me to this view.

[109]                     
The judge was alive to B’s dealings with other
police agencies.  Having heard that evidence, however, he found as a fact that
the evidence in the case required that B’s dealings with the SQ be considered
differently.  The judge referred to several differences in support of this
conclusion, which is amply supported by the evidence. 

[110]                     
B had contacted the police for the purpose of
providing them with information.    During the initial encounter with the SQ, B
was taken into custody and arrested for his crime.  As I have reviewed above, B
made a number of statements.  While in some cases, B was promised that the
statements would not be used as evidence against B, in many cases it was made
perfectly clear to B, and B clearly understood, that they could be used as
evidence in court against others.  That use of B’s statements, of
course, is completely inconsistent with any notion that B’s identity as the
supplier of that information would remain confidential.  In short, the dealings
with the SQ consisted of plea bargaining and protracted negotiations of a
possible co-operating witness contract, which contemplated B testifying for the
Crown in public trials.

[111]                     
These considerations lead me to the view that
the application judge did not fail to consider whether a promise of
confidential informer status could be implicit.  Rather, the judge was careful
to consider whether any promise was made implicitly as well as
explicitly, even though B’s evidence was solely to the effect that the SQ had
made repeated explicit promises. This was the sole basis for his professed
belief that he had informer status. In any event, as I will discuss in the next
section, the existence of a supposed “implicit promise” was never a live issue
on this record. 

C.     Is There a Live Issue on This Record as to Whether There
may Have Been an Implicit Promise of Informer Privilege by the SQ?

[112]                     
I see no basis on this record for thinking that
a reasonable person in the position of B would or could reasonably think his
identity as the supplier of the information would remain confidential.  This
point requires considerable reference to the record as well as to the judge’s
findings of fact.

[113]                     
To begin, it is critical to understand B’s own
evidence before the judge.  B consistently maintained that he had received
numerous, explicit promises from the SQ that he had the status of a
confidential informer pending the negotiation of his “co‑operating
witness” contract.  B’s position in his testimony was never that his perception
of the SQ’s actions led him to believe that his identity was protected.  According
to B’s own testimony, the supposed understanding of the obligation of
confidentiality arose solely from express promises to that effect by officers
of the SQ.  

[114]                     
During the application hearing, the appellant
was very clear about the basis upon which he claimed informer privilege: The
police had explicitly promised him informer privilege status.  Indeed,
at the beginning of his testimony, B indicated asking the SQ what his status
would be shortly after the beginning of his co-operation.  According to him,
this is what happened:

[translation]

 

[B]  Then, after that, I spoke with the police about . . .
. “What will my status be?  Are you going to sign me to a contract?  Are you
going to sign me . . . .”  “No, before the contract Named Person B,
everything you tell me will remain confidential.  There are always
. . . .  There are 3 types of status: a ‘source’, a special witness
or you’re a co‑operating witness.”  OK.  “So now, for now, you’re a
‘source’.”  “Oh yeah?”  “Yeah, so everything you tell us now, for us it’s
. . . you have no charges now, so we take it and that’s all.” 

 

[115]                     
He added that for some months after his first
contact with the SQ, he was regularly told by SQ officers that they could not
tell him whether or not he would be retained as a co-operating witness, but
that, in any event, he was a confidential informer in the meantime:

[translation]

 

[B]  They said: “. . . [W]e can’t say you’re a special witness,
we don’t know that Named Person B, you aren’t a co-operating witness, we don’t
know that.  So you’re a ‘source’”.

[116]                     
Later in his testimony, the appellant identified
the individuals who allegedly expressly told him that he would be considered a
confidential informer until his co-operating witness candidacy was settled.

[117]                     
Never in his testimony did the appellant suggest
that his understanding of his alleged confidential status had its origins in
anything other than repeated express promises by the SQ.  B never suggested in
evidence that his dealings with the SQ had given the impression that he had that
status.  All of the SQ officers testified that not only had no such promises
ever been made but that the possibility of B becoming a confidential informer
had never been discussed with B or considered by them.

[118]                     
The application judge made clear findings of fact
regarding the probative value that he attached to the appellant’s testimony. 
He found that it lacked credibility, and that the appellant himself had always,
since his first meeting with the SQ, understood that he would testify in the
trial of other individuals (and therefore his identity could necessarily not
remain confidential).  This is consistent with the numerous cautions given to
the appellant in relation to the many statements given to the SQ.  The
application judge further found that the appellant’s request for informer
privilege was essentially a vain attempt by a disgruntled individual to get
back at the Crown and the SQ for the unfair treatment he believed he had
experienced in relation to his desire to become a co-operating witness.  The judge
found as a fact that it was only after B was asked to renounce any intention to
claim informer privilege that B started to claim the status of confidential
informer.  Moreover, as noted, the judge also found as a fact that the SQ never
did anything that could have allowed B to understand that he was or might be a
confidential police informer. In short, the application judge disbelieved the
bulk of the appellant’s version of facts, including his allegation that an
explicit promise had been made to him.  Significantly, the appellant does not
contest the application judge’s devastating findings of credibility regarding
his testimony. 

[119]                     
In addition to rejecting the centrepiece of the
appellant’s version of facts, the application judge found as a matter of fact
that the SQ officers had always had in mind to have the
appellant testify and that they had never intended to
make him a confidential informer.  This corresponds largely to what the SQ
officers who testified said and is, in my view, a perfectly defensible finding
of fact, on the record before us.  

[120]                     
To sum up, the appellant’s own testimony was
clear and unequivocal that the claim of informer privilege arose solely from
alleged express promises — promises which the application judge concluded had
never been made.  Moreover, the judge accepted police evidence that there was never
even any thought of making B a confidential informer and that they did
nothing that could let B understand that he had that status. The judge also
found that it was some years after B’s initial dealings with the SQ that B
started to claim the status of a confidential police informer. These findings
leave no room for the imputed or implied promise theory.  

[121]                     
Moreover, as I touched on earlier, we know that
SQ officers arrested the appellant for his criminal activity soon after their
first meeting.  The appellant was cautioned and specifically informed that
anything he would say could be used against him in a court of law.  We also
know that throughout his relationship with the SQ, his statements were
generally accompanied by a warning that either the evidence could be used
against him, or, at the very least, that it could be used in the trial of
others.  The record discloses that the appellant understood this.

[122]                     
Indeed, when cross-examined by the Crown, the
appellant clearly stated that he understood that his first statements to the SQ
could be used against him and entered into evidence in a public trial:

[translation]

 

Q     So you, when they tell you “it can be used as evidence against
you”, what do you understand that to mean?

 

A     Well, it can be used as evidence against me.  That’s what I
understand; it’s clear.

 

Q     In what context can it be used as evidence against you?

 

A     Well, it can be used as evidence against me.  What do you want
me to say? . . .

 

Q     During what?  During the trial?  During a public trial? 
So it means that that statement will be used if they say. . . . 

 

A     Exactly.  Yes, Yes.  

 

Q     Do you understand that clearly?

 

A     Yes.  Yes.  [Emphasis added.]

[123]                     
And later, again during his testimony on
cross-examination, the Crown attorney read to the appellant a portion of the
transcript of one of his interviews conducted after his arrest by the SQ. 
Therein, an SQ officer explained to the appellant that he had a right to
counsel and that anything he would say could be used as evidence in an eventual
trial.  The Crown attorney then asked the appellant if he had properly
understood what the SQ had told him:

[translation]

 

Q     You understood clearly what you were told at that time?  You
knew that it could be used . . . .

 

A     Yes.

 

Q     . . . as evidence in court?

 

A     Yes.  Yes.

 

[124]                     
Not only did the appellant understand that the
statements he gave the SQ could be used against him, he even stated that he
hoped, at first, to get a co-operating witness contract precisely because he
hoped they would not be if he acquired that status:

[translation]

 

Q     Did, did you hope to have a co‑operating witness
contract?

 

A     At first, I hoped to have one, because I didn’t want my
statements to be held against me, since . . . .

 

. . .

 

Yes,
I hoped to at first.  But then, they kept on telling me: “No, Named Person B,
we’ll cross that bridge when we get there.” [Emphasis added.]

 

[125]                     
On account of this evidence, it appears to me
that the application judge did not err in deciding that the appellant
understood that the information he provided the SQ could be used in public
trials and that his identity as the purveyor of that information would not
remain confidential, and therefore that he did not benefit from informer
privilege in regard to that information.  The SQ had
told him that at the time of their first contact with B and reiterated it when
he started making his statements.  

[126]                     
In any event, even had he had such an
expectation, this expectation as well as any belief that the police had acted
on it and guaranteed him confidentiality would have been unreasonable.  Indeed,
the very fact that he was cautioned several times that his statements could at
the very least be entered into evidence against others in public trials is
fundamentally incompatible with an expectation or belief in a guarantee of
confidentiality.  

[127]                     
My colleague Abella J. mentions several elements
which she believes support her position that the appellant could have believed,
on reasonable grounds, that he benefited from informer privilege. 
Respectfully, I find none to be persuasive.

[128]                     
When he was formally charged and cautioned, he
would have known that everything he said from that point on could be used as
evidence in a court of law.  Being treated in that fashion by the police is
absolutely incompatible with any notion that it would have somehow led someone
to believe that his or her identity as the purveyor of statements to them would
be kept confidential.  B of course would have fully understood this.

[129]                     
 I have already discussed my colleague’s
suggestion that B repeatedly asked the SQ about his status and did not receive
a straight answer.  Neither the application judge’s conclusions nor the record
permit any such inference to be drawn.  I have also referred to the police
evidence about confidentiality; the application judge considered this evidence
and found that the SQ had done nothing that would allow B to infer that he was
a confidential police informer.  My colleague also places weight on some
documents to support the possibility that B thought he had been implicitly
promised confidential source status.  The reason that this cannot be so,
however, is that there is no evidence that B was even aware of them.  The
documents could therefore not bear on his belief.  The police officers who were
in a position to provide the appellant with confidential informer status
testified that they never had in mind to make the appellant a confidential
informer.  The only “status” he had with the SQ, in their mind, was that of an
individual in the process of becoming a co-operating witness.  This testimony
was accepted by the application judge.  

[130]                     
My colleague points to the fact that the appellant
was referred to as a source in two documents while having been named in many
others. My colleague concludes that this inconsistent treatment of B may have
led B to reasonably assume that he had confidential status with the SQ.
Respectfully, this is not an inference that is open on this record.  B never
suggested any such thing during his extensive testimony.  Moreover, there is no
evidence that this fact was known by the appellant at the relevant time and it
therefore cannot have given rise to any implied promise in the appellant’s
mind.  If this evidence is seen as undermining the SQ’s evidence that it never
considered giving B confidential source status, that use is directly contrary
to clear findings of fact by the application judge.  Finally, the evidence is
inconsequential placed in the correct factual context.  The appellant is
referred to by name in many documents and this is incompatible with the police
having an actual desire to keep his identity confidential.  The evidence of the
documents provides no basis to set aside the application judge’s finding of
fact that the SQ did not ever treat B as a confidential source.  The fact that
B was not aware of any of this at the time of course means that this could not
have given rise to any implied promise of confidentiality.  

[131]                     
Finally, counsel for the appellant made much of
the fact that the Crown tried to get the appellant to sign a document whereby
he would undertake not to seek to invoke informer privilege regarding the
information he had provided the SQ.  At the outset, it bears mentioning that
the document in question did not assume that the appellant was a confidential
informer.  Rather, it only asked the appellant to provide assurances that he
would not seek confidential informer status in the future.  In any
event, the evidence is clear that this initiative came from the Crown and not
the SQ.  While the Crown may have had its reasons to seek such assurances, I do
not think that this can be used, without supporting evidence, to conclude that
the SQ thought the appellant was a confidential informer or that it gave rise
to a reasonable belief that an implied promise of confidentiality had been
given. This point was fully considered by the application judge and rejected.

[132]                     
To conclude, I am of the view that the implicit
promise of confidentiality was never a live issue on this record.  

D.     Is the Application Judge’s Finding of Fact That B Actually
Knew That He Did Not Have Confidential Informer Status Fatal to B’s Claim? 


[133]                     
The application judge in effect found that B actually
knew that his identity was not protected with respect to the information
given to the SQ. My colleague maintains that there was no such finding, but I
respectfully disagree.  This finding, in my view, is supported by the evidence
and fatal to the suggestion that there could be some implied understanding to
the contrary.  To develop this point, I must touch first on some principles of
the law about confidential informers and then return to examine the application
judge’s findings.

[134]                     
The traditional view is that informer privilege
has “contract-like” elements of offer and acceptance.  The privilege arises
where a police officer promises protection and confidentiality to a prospective
informer in exchange for information.  In a clear case, confidentiality is
explicitly sought and agreed to:  R. v. Barros, 2011 SCC 51, [2011] 3
S.C.R. 368, at paras. 31-32; R. v. Basi, 2009 SCC 52, [2009] 3 S.C.R.
389, at para. 36.  This promise may be express or implied: Bisaillon,
at p. 105. While the subjective intent of the police may be relevant to
assessing the evidence, subjective intent on their part to confer the privilege
is not a necessary element of the test for whether the privilege has been
conferred.  All of the leading cases from this Court put this rule on this
“contract-like” basis.

[135]                     
I therefore agree with my colleague Abella J.
when she says that the test for whether there was an implicit promise of
confidentiality in this case is whether the police conduct would have led
someone in B’s position to believe, on reasonable grounds, that such a promise
had been made in exchange for the information provided.  There is thus both a
subjective and an objective element:  the alleged source must in fact believe
that confidentiality was promised in exchange for the information and that
belief must be reasonable, judged from the point of view of a reasonable person
in the alleged source’s position.  If there is such a belief and it is
reasonable, an implicit promise has been established.

[136]                     
I note that appellant’s counsel in this Court
agrees that the alleged source must believe that the protection has been
accorded. As appellant’s counsel put it, [translation]
“B’s belief and perception as to his status as an informer is of prime
importance”.    

[137]                     
I emphasize this fundamental point because I am
respectfully of the view that my colleague has lost sight of it in her
analysis.  My colleague spends much effort in trying to demonstrate that if B
had believed that he had been promised confidentiality, that belief would have
been reasonable.  I of course do not accept that contention.  But be that as it
may, the reasonableness of the belief of some hypothetical person in B’s
situation is not sufficient to establish the existence of the privilege unless
B also established that he actually believed that the implicit promise had been
made. There can be no such finding here and that is fatal to B’s claim.   

[138]                     
I repeat that B’s position in his extensive
testimony was never that there was some sort of implicit promise. B’s alleged
belief was based solely on alleged express — and repeated — promises of being
given confidential informer status.  There is no basis in fact to support the
conclusion that B in fact believed that he was an informer. Quite the contrary.

[139]                     
The judge correctly noted that the evidence
showed that in the circumstances of this case, B could not be at the same
time a prosecution witness and a police informer with respect to the
information given to the SQ.  The application judge also proceeded on the basis
that in the circumstances here, this would have been clear to B.  The
application judge makes repeated reference to B’s knowledge that he would be a
witness and to the cautions which he had heard and signed that made this
explicit.  This approach cannot be faulted and accords with the evidence.

[140]                     
  So far as I am aware, there is no hard and
fast rule that a confidential informer cannot become a witness to testify
regarding the very information he provided to police in confidence.  However,
as a practical matter, such situations would be extremely rare.  It is hard to
see how an informer could testify about certain things without making it
obvious that he was a source of the police knowledge about those things.  In
other words, such testimony could only rarely if at all be given without
creating a risk that the informer’s identity as the purveyor of the privileged
information would be discovered, an outcome, I would emphasize, the Crown is
under a legal obligation to do all in its power to avoid.  As a practical matter,
unless both the Crown and the witness agree to renounce it, informer
privilege must be seen as barring, for all practical purposes, the Crown from
calling an informer to testify at trial about the very information provided to
the police in confidence.  The two roles are almost invariably incompatible. 
Of course, a potential witness would fully understand this as it will generally
be obvious that the testimony will reveal the source of the information.   The
application judge, as noted, concluded that this was the situation in this
case. It is also important to remember that the application judge specifically
rejected B’s evidence that B was expressly promised the status of confidential
informer pending the decision about the possible co-operating witness contract.

[141]                     
Taking all of the evidence into account, the judge concluded that
B knew he was to be a witness in relation to the information
that he provided to the SQ and this necessarily required B to know that he was
not a confidential informer.  Moreover, and perhaps even more significantly,
the judge found that it was only some years after B’s first dealings with the
SQ and his being told that his evidence would not for the moment be required
that B’s behaviour gradually changed. The judge also found that it was only
after B was requested to sign the renunciation of any intention to claim
informer privilege and the unsuccessful negotiations with the witness
protection service that he asserted confidential informer status.  In short,
the judge concluded that B knew all along that he had no informer protection
and that B’s assertion to the contrary was an after-the-fact exercise of
obvious opportunism.

[142]                     
In my view, these clear and strong findings are
supported by a mountain of evidence, not the least of which is that B in his
testimony before the judge at no time suggested that his belief that informer
protection had been accorded depended on anything other than express promises
by members of the SQ to that effect.  The judge found, of course, that there
were no such express promises and indeed that the SQ officers did nothing that
would let B understand that any such promise was being made.  

[143]                     
  The judge’s conclusions that B actually knew
that he did not have informer privilege and that B’s claim of that status was
an after-the-fact exercise of opportunism make irrelevant any possibility that
some hypothetical person in B’s circumstances might have thought that the
promise was implicit.  B knew he had no such promise and provided the
information anyway.  B was a disappointed suitor for a potentially lucrative
co-operating witness contract and an opportunist, not a police informer.

[144]                     
To conclude on this point, B never claimed to
have a subjective belief that he had been promised confidentiality in exchange
for the information provided to the SQ on any basis other than express
promises. In light of the application judge’s findings, there is no evidence to
support the view that B in fact had any such subjective belief on any basis.
This, to my way of thinking, makes irrelevant what some hypothetical person in
B’s position might reasonably have believed.

[145]                     
In light of the record and the findings of fact
of the application judge in this case, there is, in my view, no reason to
interfere with the application ruling. However, I would underline that I share
the application judge’s view that the police and the prosecution could have
handled this matter in a more satisfactory manner. Nothing that I have said,
therefore, should be taken as undermining the importance of the police being
clear with potential sources about their status; quite the contrary. 

[146]                     
Police informer status plays an important role in the
investigation and prosecution of crimes. As this Court noted in Leipert,
at para. 10, “[t]he rule is of fundamental importance to the workings of a
criminal justice system”. In order for it to be effective, the protection
provided to police informers must be virtually inviolable, subject only to the
narrow innocence at stake exception. Indeed this Court has previously described
the privilege as “absolute”: Vancouver Sun, at para. 4.

[147]                     
Both the police and the public at large benefit from the
existence of this privilege because it encourages people to come forward to
assist in police investigations:

                           Police
work, and the criminal justice system as a whole, depend to some degree on the
work of confidential informers.  The law has therefore long recognized that
those who choose to act as confidential informers must be protected from the
possibility of retribution.  The law’s protection has been provided in the form
of the informer privilege rule, which protects from revelation in public or in
court of the identity of those who give information related to criminal matters
in confidence.  This protection in turn encourages cooperation with the
criminal justice system for future potential informers. 

 

(Vancouver Sun,
at para. 16)

[148]                     
Given the important role that informer status plays in the
detection and prosecution of crime, courts must not undermine its effectiveness
by condoning police actions which leave potential informers uncertain or
confused as to their status. Police actions which amount to deliberate attempts
to confuse a person about his status, or even inadvertent actions that have the
same effect, reduce confidence in the protection provided by informer
privilege. That reduced confidence discourages people with information about
criminal activity from reporting to the police, which erodes a powerful
investigative avenue. 

[149]                     
The application judge in this case was clearly alive to these
concerns, as he ought to have been, and reached the conclusions he did after a
careful and thorough review of all of the evidence. His decision should not be
disturbed.

[150]                     
I must now turn briefly to two further issues.

E.      Should a New Hearing Be Granted on the Basis That the
Application Judge Failed to Pay Heed to the Principles Established by Our Court
in R. v. Basi?

[151]                     
The Other Individuals submit that the
application judge did not follow the principles established in Basi and
therefore disregarded their rights to full answer and defence.  However, as I
find that the appellant does not benefit from informer privilege, the Other
Individuals would be entitled to whatever relevant discloseable evidence came
out of the SQ’s dealings with the appellant.  It follows that any procedural
failings on the part of the application judge, if there were such, did not in
the end prejudice the Other Individuals.  

F.  Would Any Privilege Have
Been Lost Through Disclosure of B’s Identity?

[152]                     
The Other Individuals submit that even if the
privilege arose, it would have been lost through disclosure of B’s identity.  
As in my view, the privilege did not arise, I do not have to address this
issue. I simply note that it seems to me that this issue would have to be
decided if one were of the view that the privilege may have indeed arisen.

[1]                            
Wagner J. — The Crown appeals from a judgment in which the Quebec Court
of Appeal reversed the trial judge’s decision and acquitted the respondent of
dangerous operation of his motor vehicle and of thereby causing bodily harm to
Michel Bisson and the death of Michel Rostand, contrary to s. 249  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .

[2]                            
It is common ground that passing on a double
line does not on its own suffice to establish the respondent’s criminal
liability.  All the circumstances of the case must be considered.

[3]                            
The trial judge made no fatal error in finding
the respondent guilty.

[4]                            
She took the relevant factors and all the
circumstances into account.

[5]                            
The Court of Appeal’s intervention was therefore
not warranted.

[6]                            
For these reasons, the appeal is allowed.  The
judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal dated September 8, 2011 is set aside,
the judgment of the Court of Québec dated September 14, 2010 is restored, and
the case is remanded to the Court of Québec in the judicial district of
Baie-Comeau for sentencing submissions.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

                    Criminal
law — Appeals — Trial judge convicting accused of several charges involving
physical and sexual abuse — Court of Appeal setting aside convictions and
ordering new trial — Whether appeal raises question of law — Whether Court of
Appeal erred in setting aside convictions and ordering new trial.

 

                    Held
(Fish J. dissenting):  The motion to quash the appeal should be dismissed.
 The appeal should be allowed and the convictions should be restored. 

 

                    Per McLachlin C.J.
and Abella, Rothstein, Moldaver, Karakatsanis and Wagner JJ.:  The trial
judge did not apply wrong legal principles in assessing the reliability of the
complainant’s evidence or in his application of the burden of proof. This
appeal raises a question of law, namely whether the trial judge was required to
self-instruct on the dangers of convicting because the complainant’s evidence
related to events from the distant past; suffered from various frailties; and
stood alone where confirmatory evidence might reasonably have been expected to
exist.

 

                    Per
Fish J. (dissenting):  The reasons of the majority in the Court of Appeal
contain no assertion — either express or implied — that the trial judge was
required as a matter of law to self-instruct on the dangers mentioned by
Justice Karakatsanis.  Moreover, the dissent in the Court of Appeal is not
based on any disagreement, real or imputed, with the majority’s reasons
regarding self-instruction. Rather, it relates to questions of fact or, at
best, questions of mixed fact and law. Pursuant to s. 693(1) (a) of
the Criminal Code , the Crown may only appeal to this Court on any
question of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents, which plainly
is not the case here.

                    Christine Bartlett-Hughes and Holly Loubert, for the appellant.

Michael Dineen, for the respondent.

 

                    The
judgment of McLachlin C.J. and Abella, Rothstein, Moldaver, Karakatsanis and
Wagner JJ. was delivered by

[1]                             
Karakatsanis J. — We are satisfied, for the reasons of
Laskin J.A., that the trial judge did not err, and more particularly, did not
apply wrong legal principles in assessing the reliability of the complainant’s
evidence or in his application of the burden of proof.

[2]                             
The majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal
found that the approach taken by the trial judge in assessing the complainant’s
evidence was based on wrong legal principles (2012 ONCA 117, 288 O.A.C. 164). 
In particular, the majority held that in the circumstances of this case, the
trial judge was required to self-instruct on the dangers of convicting because
the complainant’s evidence related to events from the distant past; suffered
from various frailties; and stood alone where confirmatory evidence might
reasonably have been expected to exist, and his failure to do so constituted a
legal error.

[3]                             
Laskin J.A. disagreed.  In his view, the issue
of whether to self-instruct in this manner was discretionary on the part of the
trial judge and there was no requirement that he do so as a matter of law.  We
agree with his assessment of the matter.  Viewed in that light, his dissenting
reasons raise a question of law:  see R. v. J.M.H., 2011 SCC 45, [2011]
3 S.C.R. 197, at paras. 29-30.

[4]                             
The respondent’s motion to quash the appeal is
dismissed.  The appeal is allowed and the convictions are restored, for the
reasons of Laskin J.A.

                    The following
are the reasons delivered by 

[5]                             
Fish J. (dissenting) — Unlike Justice Karakatsanis, and with the greatest
of respect, I would grant the respondent’s motion to quash this appeal.  

[6]                             
My colleague writes:

. . . the majority [in the Court of
Appeal] held that in the circumstances of this case, the trial judge was
required to self-instruct on the dangers of convicting because the
complainant’s evidence related to events from the distant past; suffered from
various frailties; and stood alone where confirmatory evidence might reasonably
have been expected to exist, and his failure to do so constituted a legal
error. [Emphasis added; para. 2.]

[7]                             
I have three observations in this regard.

[8]                             
First, I am unable to find in the reasons of the
majority any assertion ― express or implied ― that the trial judge
was required as a matter of law to self-instruct on the dangers mentioned by my
colleague.  

[9]                             
Rather, Blair J.A., speaking for the majority,
merely described as “sensible” the “idea that trial judges should consider the
‘need to self-instruct on the frailties of evidence concerning events
from the distant past’ . . . for all of the reasons summarized in McGrath”
(2012 ONCA 117, 288 O.A.C. 164, at para. 41; citing R. v. McGrath,
[2000] O.J. No. 5735 (QL) (S.C.J.), at paras. 11-15 (emphasis added)). 

[10]                         
Moreover, there is no dispute that the factors
set out by my colleague are all present in this case.  And I agree that it is
sensible, as Justice Blair held, for trial judges to “consider the need to
self-instruct” on the frailties of the evidence in cases where these factors
are likewise present.

[11]                         
My second observation is that nothing in the
reasons of Laskin J.A., the dissenting justice in the Court of Appeal, suggests
that he was of a different view in this regard. On the contrary, Justice Laskin
agreed that it may be sensible for trial judges to consider the need to
self-instruct in such cases, but added that they are not legally required to do
so expressly (paras. 70-71). 

[12]                         
Justice Blair did not say that they were. 
Rather, as we have seen, he simply found it logical or prudent ―
“sensible”, as he put it ― for trial judges to consider the
need for a self-instruction of this sort. He then took care to add that “[e]ach
case will depend upon its own circumstances”, and made plain that he did “not
mean to suggest that some type of formal instruction need necessarily be given”
(para. 41).  

[13]                         
Justice Blair’s ensuing statement confirms, in
my view, that an express self-instruction was not legally required by
the majority in the court below, even where the factors mentioned by Justice
Karakatsanis are present, as in this case.

[14]                         
What is required, the majority held, is
that “the trial judge’s reasons should demonstrate that he or she is alert to
the frailties of, and the risks associated with, such evidence, and to the need
to address it with that careful scrutiny” ― and, even then, only “[w]here
. . . there are objective reasons to scrutinize carefully the
reliability of a witness whose testimony is central to the proof of guilt”
(para. 41 (emphasis added)). 

[15]                         
This was so in the present case, according to
Justice Blair, and applied as well “in this type of case generally” (para. 41).

[16]                         
On a fair reading of these passages, and with
respect, I am unable to agree with Justice Karakatsanis that the majority in
the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge was legally required  “to
self-instruct on the dangers of convicting because the complainant’s evidence
related to events from the distant past; suffered from various frailties; and
stood alone where confirmatory evidence might reasonably have been expected to
exist”.  

[17]                         
My third observation ― in itself
dispositive of the present appeal ― is this: Justice Laskin’s dissent was
not based on his disagreement, real or imputed, with the majority’s
reasons regarding self-instruction by the trial judge in this case, or
self-instruction by trial judges generally in cases of this sort.  That is
apparent both from the Order of the Court of Appeal and, perhaps more
significantly, from Justice Laskin’s own reasons.

[18]                         
According to the Order:

        THIS COURT ORDERS
that the appeal is allowed and a new trial ordered. 

 

        THE HONOURABLE
JUSTICE LASKIN DISSENTING HELD that the learned trial judge did not err in
his approach to the assessment of the reliability of the [complainant]’s
evidence.  Further, he held that the trial judge did not err in holding that
the absence of police and school records corroborating the [complainant]’s
evidence that she had reported that sexual abuse had taken place did not create
a reasonable doubt when weighed against the other evidence of the complainant. 
Accordingly he would have dismissed the appeal.  [A.R., vol. I, at p. 106]

[19]                         
The Order of the Court of Appeal is in full
conformity with Justice Laskin’s expressly stated reasons for disagreeing with
the majority.  He sets out the grounds of his dissent in these terms:

I
have read the reasons of my colleague, Blair J.A.  He would allow the appeal,
set aside the convictions and order a new trial.  He would do so for two
reasons.  First, he concludes that the trial judge did not properly assess the
reliability of the complainant’s evidence.  Second, he concludes that the trial
judge failed to consider whether the absence of documentary evidence that might
have corroborated the complainant’s evidence gave rise to a reasonable doubt. 

 

I
respectfully disagree with both of these conclusions.  Throughout his lengthy
reasons, the trial judge considered not just the credibility, but the
reliability of the complainant’s evidence.  Indeed, at several points he did so
expressly.  He addressed various concerns about the complainant’s testimony
that bore on the accuracy of her evidence.  And, perhaps most important, he
held that it would be unsafe to act on two of the alleged incidents of sexual
abuse and disregarded the complainant’s evidence of those incidents.  He did so
not because he found her evidence lacking in credibility, but because he found
that her evidence on those two incidents was not sufficiently reliable. 

 

The
trial judge also considered the effect of the absence of police and school
records, but remained convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the appellant’s
guilt on the basis of the complainant’s evidence.  That was his call to make. 
I would dismiss the appeal. [paras. 64-66] 

[20]                         
Neither the Order of the Court of Appeal nor the
reasons of Justice Laskin are capable of supporting the Crown’s submission that
this appeal raises a question of law.  The grounds of Justice Laskin’s dissent
raise questions of fact or, at best, questions of mixed fact and law.

[21]                         
Pursuant to s. 693(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , the Crown may only appeal to this Court “on any
question of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents”, which
plainly is not the case here. 

[22]                         
With respect for those who are of a different
view, I would therefore quash this appeal for want of jurisdiction.

on appeal from the court of appeal for nova scotia

                    Criminal Law — Defences
— Duress — Abused wife paying “hit man” to murder husband who has threatened
her life — Whether duress is available in law as a defence where the threats
made against the accused were not made for the purpose of compelling the
commission of an offence — Statutory and common law parameters of defence of
duress — Whether stay of proceedings is appropriate in circumstances of case.

                    R
was the victim of a violent, abusive and controlling husband.  She believed
that he would cause her and their daughter serious bodily harm or death and
that she had no safe avenue of escape other than having him killed. She spoke
to an undercover RCMP officer posing as a hit man and agreed to pay him $25,000
to kill her husband.  She gave $2,000, an address and a picture of her
husband to the officer.  She was arrested and charged with counselling the
commission of an offence not committed contrary to s. 464 (a) of the
Criminal Code .  The trial judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
that the requisite elements of the offence were established.  The only issue at
trial was whether the defence of duress applied.  The trial judge accepted R’s
evidence that the sole reason for her actions was intense and reasonable fear
arising from her husband’s threats of death and serious bodily harm to herself
and their daughter.  The trial judge found that the common law defence of duress
applied and acquitted R.  On appeal, for the first time, the Crown argued that
duress was not available to R in law. The Court of Appeal upheld the acquittal. 

                    Held (Fish J. dissenting in part):  The
appeal should be allowed and the proceedings should be stayed. 

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Deschamps, Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell, Moldaver
and Karakatsanis JJ.:  The
defence of duress is only available when a person commits an offence while
under compulsion of a threat made for the purpose of compelling him or her to
commit the offence.  This was not R’s situation and the defence of duress was
not available to her.  If an accused is threatened without compulsion, his or
her only defence is self‑defence.

                    The Court of Appeal erred in law
in finding that there was no principled basis upon which to exclude R from
relying on the defence of duress.  Although the defences of duress and self‑defence
are both based on the idea of normative involuntariness and both apply where
the accused acted in response to an external threat, significant differences
between these defences justify maintaining a meaningful juridical difference
between them.  The rationale underlying each defence is profoundly distinct.  Duress,
like the defence of necessity, is an excuse.  The act, usually committed
against an innocent third party, remains wrong but the law excuses those who
commit the act in a morally involuntary manner, where there was realistically
no choice but to commit the act. Self‑defence, in contrast, is a
justification based on the principle that it is lawful in defined circumstances
to resist force or a threat of force with force.  The victim, also the
attacker, is the author of his or her own misfortune.  Generally, the
justification of self‑defence ought to be more readily available than the
excuse of duress.  Thus, if infliction of harm on
a person who threatened or attacked the accused is not justified by the law of
self‑defence, it would be curious if the accused’s response would
nonetheless be excused by the more restrictive law of duress.  Duress, which is an amalgam of statutory
and common law elements, cannot be extended to apply where the accused meets
force with force in situations where self-defence is not available.  Duress is, and must remain, an applicable defence only in situations
where the accused has been compelled to commit a specific offence under threats
of death or bodily harm. 

                    This
appeal underlines the need for further clarification of the law of duress.  The
statutory version of the defence applies to principals and the common law to
parties.  The statutory version of the offence also excludes a long list of
offences from its operation.  Nonetheless, the defence of duress, in its
statutory and common law forms, is largely the same and both forms share the
following common elements: there must be an explicit or implicit threat of
present or future death or bodily harm — this threat can be directed at the
accused or a third party; the accused must reasonably believe that the threat
will be carried out; there must be no safe avenue of escape,
evaluated on a modified objective standard; there must be a close temporal
connection between the threat and the harm threatened; there must be proportionality
between the harm threatened and the harm inflicted by the accused, also
evaluated on a modified objective standard; and the accused cannot be a party
to a conspiracy or association whereby he or she is subject to compulsion and
actually knew that threats and coercion to commit an offence were a
possible result of this criminal activity, conspiracy or association. 

                    The circumstances of this case are
exceptional and warrant a stay of proceedings.  Although the appeal should be
allowed, it would not be fair to subject R to another trial.  The abuse she
suffered and the protracted nature of these proceedings have taken an enormous
toll on her.  The law of duress was unclear which made resort to the defence at
trial unusually difficult.  Furthermore, the Crown changed its position about
the applicable law between the trial and appeal process, raising a serious risk
that the consequences of decisions made during the
conduct of R’s defence cannot be undone in the context of a new trial. 

                    Per Fish J. (dissenting
in part):  The defence of duress was not available to R and the acquittal must
be set aside.  However, a judicial stay of proceedings is not warranted on the
record.  A stay is a drastic remedy of last resort and available only in the
clearest of cases.  These criteria are not satisfied.  A new trial should be
ordered, leaving it to the Crown to decide whether the public interest requires
a new trial in the particular circumstances of the case.

I.       Introduction

[1]                             
This appeal raises a novel question: may a wife,
whose life is threatened by her abusive husband, rely on the defence of duress
when she tries to have him murdered? The Nova Scotia courts concluded that she
may and acquitted the respondent, Nicole Ryan, of counselling the commission of
her husband’s murder. The Crown appeals. 

[2]                             
As we see it, the defence of duress is available
when a person commits an offence while under compulsion of a threat made for
the purpose of compelling him or her to commit it. That was not Ms. Ryan’s
situation. She wanted her husband dead because he was threatening to kill her
and her daughter, not because she was being threatened for the purpose of
compelling her to have him killed. That being the case, the defence of duress
was not available to her, no matter how compelling her situation was viewed in
a broader perspective. It is also our view, however, that the uncertainty
surrounding the law of duress coupled with the Crown’s change of position
between trial and appeal created unfairness to Ms. Ryan’s defence in this case.
As a result, we would allow the appeal and enter a stay of proceedings. 

[3]                             
The appeal presents an opportunity to bring more
clarity to the law of duress in Canadian criminal law. Some of the relevant law
is statutory, but aspects of the provisions have been found to be
unconstitutional.  Other aspects of the relevant law are judge-made. The
patchwork quilt nature of the present law has given rise to significant
uncertainty about the parameters of both the statutory and common law elements
of the defence and the relationship between them.  In relation to this larger
issue, our view is that the common law and statutory versions of the defence
may be substantially harmonized in the manner we will set out in detail later in
our reasons.

II.  Overview of Facts and
Proceedings

A.  Facts

[4]                             
The respondent, Nicole Ryan, has been the victim
of a violent, abusive and controlling husband.  She believed that he would
cause her and their daughter serious bodily harm or death as he had threatened
to do many times.  

[5]                             
In September of 2007, she began to think about
having her husband murdered. Over the course of the next seven months, she
spoke to at least three men whom she hoped would kill him. In December 2007 or
January 2008, she paid one man $25,000 to carry out the killing, but he then
refused, demanding more compensation. She approached another person and was
contacted by a third, an undercover RCMP officer, posing as a “hit man”. On
March 27, 2008, she met with this individual and agreed to pay him to kill her
husband. The agreed upon price was $25,000, with $2,000 paid in cash that day.
The killing was to take place the coming weekend. Later that same night, she
provided an address and a picture of her husband to the “hit man”. Shortly
after, she was arrested and charged with counselling the commission of an
offence not committed contrary to s. 464 (a) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .

[6]                             
At trial, there was no issue that the elements
of the offence had been proved and the trial judge, Farrar J. (as he then was),
indicated that he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the requisite
elements of the offence of counselling the commission of an offence had been
established. He based this conclusion on the respondent’s admission that the
Crown had proved a prima facie case and on the audio and video tapes of
recorded conversations with the undercover officer and a statement made on
arrest (trial judge’s reasons, at paras. 4-6). The only issue at trial was
whether the respondent’s otherwise criminal acts were excused because of
duress. The accused had raised that the common law defence of duress applied.
The Crown argued that on the facts of this case, the components of
duress were not present.  But it did not argue at trial, as it did later on
appeal, that the defence of duress was not available in law to the
respondent (transcript, at pp. 22-23; trial judgment, 2010 NSSC 114 (CanLII), at
paras. 7-8). 

[7]                             
The trial judge accepted the respondent’s
evidence that the relationship and the events she had described relating to
that relationship were true. For example, Mr. Ryan’s violent and threatening
behaviour included outbursts at least once a week, where he would throw things
at the respondent’s head, physically assault her and threaten to kill her (trial
judgment, at para. 17).  The respondent testified that Mr. Ryan often told
her that he would kill her and their daughter if she ever tried to leave him
(para. 33), and that he would “burn the fucking house down” while she and her
daughter were inside (para. 45). 

[8]                             
The trial judge had no difficulty in concluding
that Mr. Ryan was a manipulative, controlling and abusive husband who sought to
control the actions of the respondent, be they social, familial or marital. The
judge found that the respondent’s sole reason for her actions was her fear of
her husband which arose from his threats of death and serious bodily harm to
herself and their daughter (paras. 149-52). He also was satisfied that the
respondent had led evidence to the requisite standard that she reasonably
believed that Mr. Ryan would cause her and her daughter serious bodily injury
and that there was no safe avenue of escape other than having him killed.  

[9]                             
The judge concluded that the respondent was in a
very vulnerable state, had lost a considerable amount of weight, was
dissociated and despondent. She had an intense and reasonable fear of Mr. Ryan,
was feeling helpless, felt she had lost control and felt she was threatened
with annihilation. While she had engaged the police and other agencies in an
effort to assist her in the past, the evidence was that her problems were
viewed as a “civil matter”.  She felt so vulnerable that the phone call of the
undercover police officer appeared to her as the solution to all her problems
(para. 73). On the basis of these findings, the trial judge found that the
common law defence of duress applied, and acquitted the accused.

[10]                         
The Crown appealed but the Court of Appeal
unanimously upheld the trial judge’s verdict of acquittal. On the appeal, for
the first time, the Crown took the position that duress was not available in
law as a defence to the respondent on these facts. Duress, the Crown contended,
applies only when an accused is forced by threats to commit an offence against
a third party (2011 NSCA 30, 301 N.S.R. (2d) 255, at para. 56). MacDonald
C.J.N.S. (Saunders and Oland JJ.A. concurring) rejected the Crown’s submission.
Simply put, the Court of Appeal found that the focus of the defence of duress
is to absolve an accused of criminal liability when his or her conduct is
morally involuntary. Therefore, the analysis should focus on the accused’s
predicament and not on who did what to whom in who’s presence. It followed that
the respondent should not be denied the defence of duress simply because the
victim was not a third party, but the aggressor. The court saw no principled
basis to justify a distinction between the aggressor as opposed to a third
party being the targeted victim.

[11]                         
The court reviewed the case law in this area
which emphasizes the need for triers of fact to fully understand the plight of
battered spouses who, having reacted to threats from their abusive partners,
rely on the defence of duress. MacDonald C.J.N.S. also highlighted the need for
the defence to be sufficiently flexible, when appropriate, to accommodate the
dark reality of spousal abuse. 

III.    Analysis

A.     Issues

[12]                         
The appeal raises three issues:

1.         Is
duress available in law as a defence where the threats made against the accused
were not made for the purpose of compelling the commission of an offence?

2.         If
not, and the appeal must therefore be allowed, what order should be made and,
in particular, in the unusual circumstances of this case, should a stay of
proceedings be entered?

3.         Can
the law of duress be clarified and how?

B.     Is Duress a Possible Defence?

[13]                         
The Crown asserted that the defence of duress is
not open to the accused, on the facts of this case. The Court of Appeal
reasoned that, if the respondent had herself attacked her husband, self-defence
would represent a potential avenue of defence (para. 99).  The court saw “no
principled basis to justify a distinction between the aggressor as opposed to a
third party being the targeted victim” (para. 99). In other words, while duress
has traditionally applied where the person making the threat and the victim are
different, this fact does not justify restricting duress to that sort of
situation. As the Court of Appeal commented, it would be “ironic” that the
respondent might have a defence of self-defence if she had attacked her husband
herself, but no defence where she responded to the same threat by hiring
someone else to kill him (para. 99). In short, the Court of Appeal thought it
appropriate to develop the common law of duress in order to fill a gap in the
law of self-defence.

[14]                         
The Crown argues that the Court of Appeal
wrongly held that there was no principled basis for refusing to extend the
defence of duress to cover these facts. In order to address this argument, we
need to review the state of the common law defence of duress.

[15]                         
We begin our analysis with R. v. Hibbert,
[1995] 2 S.C.R. 973, which touched on the question of the differences and
relationship between duress, necessity and self-defence. One of the issues in
Hibbert was whether the common law defence of duress incorporated the
requirement that no “safe avenue of escape” be available to the accused. Lamer
C.J. approached this question by examining the juristic nature of the defence
of duress and its relationship to other common law defences (para. 46). This
led him to consider the relationship between self-defence, duress and
necessity.  

[16]                         
In this case, unlike in Hibbert, we must
resolve the question of whether the differences between duress and self-defence
justify maintaining a meaningful juridical difference between them. In our
view, and with great respect to the contrary view of the Court of Appeal, they
do. In other words, we conclude that the Court of Appeal erred in law when it
found that there is “no principled basis” upon which the respondent should be
excluded from relying on the defence of duress.

[17]                         
With respect to the relationship between duress
and necessity, Lamer C.J. in Hibbert concluded that the “the
similarities between the two defences are so great that consistency and logic
require that they be understood as based on the same juristic principles” and
that to do otherwise “would be to promote incoherence and anomaly in the
criminal law” (para. 54). Their common foundation is that both are excuses,
“based on the idea of normative involuntariness” (para. 54), as Dickson J. (as
he then was) had found in the case of the defence of necessity in Perka v.
The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 232. The relationship among duress and necessity
on one hand and self-defence on the other was less clear. All three apply in
“essentially similar” situations:  each is concerned with providing a defence
to what would otherwise be criminal conduct because the accused acted in
response to an external threat (para. 60). As the then Chief Justice explained
in Hibbert, 

                            [t]he
defences of self-defence, necessity and duress all arise under circumstances
where a person is subjected to an external danger, and commits an act that
would otherwise be criminal as a way of avoiding the harm the danger presents. 
[para. 50]

[18]                         
However, there are also significant differences
among the defences. As Lamer C.J. explained, 

a distinction can be drawn between
self-defence, on the one hand, and duress and necessity, on the other, that
might well provide a basis for a meaningful juridical difference. In cases of
self-defence, the victim of the otherwise criminal act at issue is himself or
herself the originator of the threat that causes the actor to commit
what would otherwise be an assault or culpable homicide . . . . In this sense,
he or she is the author of his or her own deserts, a factor which arguably
warrants special consideration in the law. In cases of duress and necessity,
however, the victims of the otherwise criminal act . . . are third parties,
who are not themselves responsible for the threats or circumstances of
necessity that motivated the accused’s actions. [Emphasis in original; para.
50.]

[19]                         
In this passage, the Chief Justice alludes to
two differences that “[may] well provide a basis for a meaningful juridical
difference” between duress and self-defence (para. 50). 

[20]                         
First, self-defence is based on the principle
that it is lawful, in defined circumstances, to meet force (or threats of
force) with force: “an individual who is unlawfully threatened or attacked must
be accorded the right to respond” (M. Manning and P. Sankoff, Manning
Mewett & Sankoff: Criminal Law (4th ed. 2009), at p. 532). The
attacker-victim is, as the Chief Justice put it, “the author of his or her own
deserts” (para. 50). On the other hand, in duress and necessity, the victim is
generally an innocent third party (see D. Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law: A
Treatise (6th ed. 2011), at p. 511). Second, in self-defence, the victim
simply attacks or threatens the accused; the motive for the attack or threats
is irrelevant. In duress, on the other hand, the purpose of the threat
is to compel the accused to commit an offence. To put it simply, self-defence
is an attempt to stop the victim’s threats or assaults by meeting force with
force; duress is succumbing to the threats by committing an offence.

[21]                         
However, these are not the only differences
between duress and self-defence. It seems to us that there are two other
significant differences which must be taken into account.

[22]                         
One is that self-defence is completely codified
by the provisions of the Criminal Code .  Thus, Parliament has established
the parameters of self-defence in their entirety. They are no longer found,
even in part, in the common law. Duress, on the other hand, is partly codified
and partly governed by judge-made law as preserved by s. 8(3) of the Code.


[23]                         
Another is that the underlying rationales of the
defences are profoundly distinct. The rationale underlying duress is that of
moral involuntariness, which was entrenched as a principle of fundamental
justice in R. v. Ruzic, 2001 SCC 24, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 687, at
para. 47: “It is a principle of fundamental justice that only voluntary
conduct — behaviour that is the product of a free will and controlled body,
unhindered by external constraints — should attract the penalty and stigma of
criminal liability.” It is upon this foundation that we build the defences of
duress and necessity. As Lamer C.J. put it in Hibbert, the
underlying concept of both defences is “normative involuntariness”, in other
words, that there is “no legal way out” (para. 55). While the test to be
met is not dictated by this generally stated rationale underlying the defence,
its requirements are heavily influenced by it. As was discussed in Perka,
defences built on the principle of moral involuntariness are classified as
excuses. The law excuses those who, although morally blameworthy, acted in a
morally involuntary manner. The act remains wrong, but the author of the
offence will not be punished because it was committed in circumstances in which
there was realistically no choice (Ruzic, at para. 34; Perka, at
p. 248). The principle of moral involuntariness is “[a] concessio[n] to human
frailty” in the face of “agonising choice” (Ruzic, at para. 40; Stuart,
at p. 490). The commission of the crime is “remorselessly compelled by normal
human instincts” (Perka, at p. 249). As LeBel J. put it in Ruzic:
“Morally involuntary conduct is not always inherently blameless” (para. 41).

[24]                         
Despite its close links to necessity and duress,
self-defence, on the other hand, is a justification (Perka, at pp. 246
and 269). It “challenges the wrongfulness of an action which technically
constitutes a crime” (Perka, at p. 246; see also H. Parent, Traité de
droit criminel (2nd ed. 2005), vol. 1, L’imputabilité, at pp. 587-88).
For different views, see S. G. Coughlan, “Duress, Necessity, Self-Defence and
Provocation: Implications of Radical Change?” (2002), 7 Can. Crim. L.R.
147, at p. 158; see also Manning and Sankoff, at p. 342, and K.
Roach, Criminal Law (4th ed. 2009), at p. 294. In determining
whether the defence is available, less emphasis is placed on the particular
circumstances and concessions to human frailty and more importance is attached
to the action itself and the reason why the accused was justified in meeting
force with force. 

[25]                         
We do not, for the present purpose, need to
delve too deeply into the distinction between justifications and excuses and
questions of exactly how and when the distinction is to be drawn in all cases.
For the purposes of this appeal, the distinction simply expresses an underlying
difference in principle between the two defences: while in a case of duress we
excuse an act that we still consider to be wrong, the impugned act in a case of
self-defence is considered right. The question then, is whether these
differences support a principled distinction between duress and self-defence.
In our view they do, for two main reasons.

[26]                         
Given the different moral qualities of the acts
involved, it is generally true that the justification of self-defence ought to
be more readily available than the excuse of duress. And so it is.  Unlike
duress, self-defence does not require that any course of action other than
inflicting the injury was “demonstrably impossible” or that there was “no other
legal way out”.  Under the former self-defence provisions, for example, a person
who is the victim of an unprovoked unlawful assault is entitled to use as much
force as is necessary to defend himself, provided he does not intend to cause
death or grievous bodily harm (s. 34(1); see Parent, pp. 605-6). Under the
recently adopted provisions in Bill C-26, self-defence is available in
circumstances in which a person believes on reasonable grounds that force is
being used against him or her and responds reasonably for the purpose of
self-defence (s. 34(1)).

[27]                         
Thus, if infliction of harm on a person who
threatened or attacked the accused is not justified by the law of self-defence,
it would be curious if the accused’s response would nonetheless be excused by
the more restrictive law of duress. For the sake of the coherence of the
criminal law, the defence of self-defence ought to be more readily available,
not less readily available, than the defence of duress in situations in which
the accused responds directly against the source of the threat. 

[28]                         
These distinctive underlying principles of self-defence
and duress take on added significance when we remember that in Canadian law,
self-defence is exhaustively codified, whereas duress is an amalgam of
statutory and common law elements.  This means that the courts must take care
not to use the flexibility of the common law to develop duress in ways that
circumvent limitations and restrictions imposed by Parliament on the defence of
self-defence. This would amount to judicial abrogation of parts of the Criminal
Code . The courts intervene to interpret and apply the statutory rules
governing self-defence, not to set them aside in the absence of a
constitutional challenge.

[29]                         
Duress cannot be extended so as to apply when
the accused meets force with force, or the threat of force with force in
situations where self-defence is unavailable. Duress is, and must remain, an
applicable defence only in situations where the accused has been compelled to
commit a specific offence under threats of death or bodily harm. This clearly
limits the availability of the offence to particular factual circumstances. The
common law elements of duress cannot be used to “fill” a supposed vacuum
created by clearly defined statutory limitations on self-defence.  

[30]                         
This is even clearer when one considers — as
explained above — the fundamental distinctions between both defences.  Not only
is one a justification and the other an excuse, but they also serve to avoid
punishing the accused in completely different situations. If, for example, the
accused was threatened with death or bodily harm without any element of
compulsion, his or her only remedy is self-defence. If, on the other hand, the
accused was compelled to commit a specific unlawful act under threat of death
or bodily harm, the available defence is duress. In a case where there was a
threat without compulsion, the accused cannot rely on duress simply because he
or she did not employ direct force and thus, was excluded from relying on the
self-defence provisions of the Code. As Glanville Williams’ latest
editor, Dennis J. Baker, wrote about the availability of “pure” duress (as
opposed to duress of circumstances, which is an entirely different defence):
“On principle, the offence must be one expressly or impliedly ordered by the
villain, the order being backed up by his threat. (Or the defendant must have
believed that.) . . . As a matter of justice the defence should only be
available where the defendant commits a crime that he has been directly coerced
to commit” (Textbook of Criminal Law (3rd ed. 2012), at paras. 25-037
and 25-039).

[31]                         
Consider the result arrived at by the Court of
Appeal in this case. The respondent responded to threats against her and her
child of bodily harm and death in ways which, in the view of the Court of
Appeal, would not entitle her to rely on the defence of self-defence. We add
that the appeal to the Court was also presented on the assumption that
self-defence was not potentially open to the respondent on these facts.  For
the purposes of these reasons, we do not need to decide this point. If this is
the case, the extension of the law of duress to meet the respondent’s situation
has made the law incoherent at the level of principle. Following the logic of
the Court of Appeal’s conclusions, duress, which deals with wrongful but
excused conduct would be more readily available than self-defence, which
addresses rightful conduct, in a situation in which the accused responded to
threats by trying to eliminate them. And yet, according to the underlying
rationale, excuses ought to be more restrictively defined than justifications (see,
e.g., Stuart, at p. 511). 

[32]                         
The difficulty that this creates is not, in our
view, limited to a lack of analytical tidiness. The result of this case is in
effect a judicial amendment of the law of self-defence. This point is
underlined by the fact that neither in the sources cited by the parties nor in
our own research has duress been extended to a case in which the threat was not
made for the purpose of compelling the commission of an offence and the victim
was the person making the threat. 

[33]                         
In our opinion, the Court of Appeal erred in law
in finding that duress is a legally available defence on these facts. Duress is
available only in situations in which the accused is threatened for the purpose
of compelling the commission of an offence.

C.     Remedy

[34]                         
The next issue is what order should be made,
given our conclusion that the Court of Appeal erred in law and the appeal of
the Crown should be allowed. In our view, the interests of justice require that
a stay of proceedings be entered as the Court is authorized to do in the
clearest of cases by s. 695 of the Code (see, e.g., R. v. Hinse,
[1995] 4 S.C.R. 597, at para. 23; R. v. Provo, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 3, at pp.
18-23). 

[35]                         
It is apparent that the law of duress was
unclear, which made resort to it as a defence unusually difficult. Coupled with
that consideration is the problem in this case that the Crown changed its
position about the applicable law between the trial and the appeal process. The
trial proceeded on the basis that duress was available as a matter of law to
Ms. Ryan if the facts supported it. She therefore went to trial on the basis
that the issues were mainly the factual ones relating to whether she had
pointed to evidence capable of raising a reasonable doubt about the various
components of duress. Presumably, decisions about the conduct of the defence
were made on this basis and might have been made differently had the legal
position later adopted by the Crown on appeal, that duress was not open to her
in law, been known at the time of trial. There is therefore a serious risk that
some of the consequences of those decisions could not be undone in the context
of a new trial and this raises concern about the fairness of ordering a new
trial.  In addition, the abuse which she suffered at the hands of Mr. Ryan took
an enormous toll on her, as, no doubt, have these protracted proceedings,
extending over nearly five years, in which she was acquitted at trial and
successfully resisted a Crown appeal in the Court of Appeal. There is also the
disquieting fact that, on the record before us, it seems that the authorities
were much quicker to intervene to protect Mr. Ryan than they had been to
respond to her request for help in dealing with his reign of terror over her. A
stay of proceedings is warranted only in the clearest of cases (see R. v.
Power, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at p. 615). In our opinion, Ms. Ryan’s
case falls into the residual category of cases requiring a stay: it is an
exceptional situation that warrants an exceptional remedy. In all of the circumstances,
it would not be fair to subject Ms. Ryan to another trial. In the interests of
justice, a stay of proceedings is required to protect against this oppressive
result (see Power, at pp. 615-16; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and
Immigration) v. Tobiass, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391, at para. 91).

D.     Can the Law of Duress be
Clarified?

[36]                         
This appeal underlines the need for further
clarification of the law of duress. The statutory version of the defence
applies to principals and the common law to parties. Important aspects of the
statutory version were found to be unconstitutional in Ruzic, and the
provision remains in place with two significant deletions as a result. The
statutory version of the defence excludes a long list of offences from its
operation, but various courts have found some of these exclusions to be
unconstitutional. For example, in R. v. Fraser (2002), 3 C.R. (6th) 308,
the Nova Scotia Provincial Court declared the following:

                        . . . s. 17  of the Criminal Code  in so far as it
eliminates the defence of duress and/or necessity in offences concerning
robbery is of no force and effect as being contrary to the Canadian Charter
of Rights and Freedoms  and in particular s. 7  of the Charter . [para.
5]

There is uncertainty
about the similarities and differences between the common law and the statutory
versions of the defence.  Within the limits of the judicial role, in the
development of the law, additional clarification is needed.

[37]                         
In our view, after the decision of the Court in Ruzic,
some reappraisal and some adjustment of both the interpretation of the
statutory version of the defence and of the common law seems necessary. We
begin with a recapitulation of what was decided in Ruzic and then
address the various components of the statutory and common law versions of the
defence.

                 (1)      An Overview of Ruzic

[38]                         
In Ruzic, the Court dealt with the constitutionality of
parts of the statutory defence of duress, located in s. 17  of the Criminal
Code . The accused in Ruzic admitted importing heroin from Serbia
into Canada. She argued that she should be excused from criminal liability
because a third party in Serbia had threatened to harm her mother unless she
committed the offence, and the Serbian police would not have been able to
protect her mother. The accused conceded that her claim of duress did not
satisfy the immediacy and presence preconditions of the statutory defence. She
challenged the constitutionality of s. 17 , which reads as follows:

                        17.       A person who commits an offence under compulsion by threats
of immediate death or bodily harm from a person who is present when the
offence is committed is excused for committing the offence if the person
believes that the threats will be carried out and if the person is not a party
to a conspiracy or association whereby the person is subject to compulsion, but
this section does not apply where the offence that is committed is high treason
or treason, murder, piracy, attempted murder, sexual assault, sexual assault
with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm, aggravated
sexual assault, forcible abduction, hostage taking, robbery, assault with a
weapon or causing bodily harm, aggravated assault, unlawfully causing bodily
harm, arson or an offence under sections 280 to 283 (abduction and detention of
young persons). 

[39]                         
In upholding the accused’s acquittal based on
the defence of duress, a unanimous Court in Ruzic held that portions of
s. 17  violated s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and
were not saved by s. 1 .

[40]                         
In its analysis, the Court first addressed the
question of whether it is a principle of fundamental justice that morally
involuntary conduct should not be punished. The principle of moral
involuntariness recognizes that “[a] person acts in a morally involuntary
fashion when, faced with perilous circumstances, she is deprived of a realistic
choice whether to break the law” (Ruzic, at para. 29). In concluding
that the principle of moral involuntariness was indeed a principle of
fundamental justice, the Court noted that the treatment of criminal offenders
as autonomous and freely choosing agents is a key organizing principle of
criminal law. As a result, it is a violation of s. 7  of the Charter  to
convict a person who has no realistic choice and whose behaviour is, therefore,
morally involuntary.

[41]                         
The Court then considered whether the immediacy
and presence requirements in s. 17  infringe the fundamental principle of moral
involuntariness by limiting the defence of duress to a person who commits an offence
under a threat of immediate bodily harm from a person present when the offence
is committed. The Court concluded that the immediacy and presence requirements,
taken together, preclude threats of future harm and thereby infringe the Charter .
The underinclusiveness of s. 17  violates the liberty and security interests
protected under s. 7  because of the potential to convict persons who, placed
under duress by threats of future harm, have not acted voluntarily. This
violation is not justifiable under s. 1 .

[42]                         
The Court clarified that s. 17  requires only
that the threat be made to the accused, not that the object of
the threatened harm be the accused herself. Therefore, under s. 17 , the threat
of harm need not be directed at the accused personally but may be directed
against a third party. Additionally, the Court confirmed its previous decisions
in Paquette v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 189, and Hibbert,
which held that s. 17  applies only to persons who commit offences as
principals, while the common law defence of duress remains available to parties
to an offence. Finally, the Court declined to address the question of whether
the list of excluded offences in s. 17  violates the Charter , as
none of the offences at issue in the appeal was contained in the list (para. 19).

                    (2)      The Statutory Defence of Duress
Post-Ruzic

[43]                         
What, therefore, remains of s. 17  after Ruzic?
The Court did not strike down s. 17  in its entirety; it was found
unconstitutional only “in part” (para. 1). As a result, the following four
requirements of the statutory defence remain intact after the Court’s ruling in
Ruzic:

1.         there
must be a threat of death or bodily harm directed against the accused or a
third party;

2.         the
accused must believe that the threat will be carried out; 

3.         the
offence must not be on the list of excluded offences; and

4.         the
accused cannot be a party to a conspiracy or criminal association such that the
person is subject to compulsion.

[44]                         
However, the Court in Ruzic did not leave
the statutory defence in place simply stripped of its unconstitutional
portions. The Court supplemented the interpretation and application of s. 17 
with elements from the common law defence of duress, which it found to be “more
consonant with the values of the Charter ” (para. 56). In other
words, the Court in Ruzic used the common law standard to interpret the
affirmative requirements of the statute (see D. M. Paciocco, “No-one Wants to
Be Eaten: The Logic and Experience of the Law of Necessity and Duress” (2010),
56 Crim. L.Q. 240, at p. 273). 

[45]                         
Where ambiguities or gaps exist in the partially
struck-down s. 17 , the common law defence of duress operates to clarify and
flesh out the statutory defence:

The analysis of duress in common law
will also be useful as it will shed some light on the appropriate rules which
had to be applied to the defence of the accused in the case at bar and which
will now be applied in all other cases, once s. 17  of the Criminal Code 
is partially struck down. [Emphasis added; Ruzic, at para. 55.]

[46]                         
In Ruzic, the Court articulated and
analyzed the following three key elements of the common law defence of duress,
which now operate in s. 17  cases alongside the four requirements remaining in
the statutory defence: (1) no safe avenue of escape; (2) a close temporal
connection; and (3) proportionality (see Parent, at pp. 549-50).

                    (a)      No Safe Avenue of Escape

[47]                         
The defence of duress “focuses on the search for
a safe avenue of escape” (Ruzic, at para. 61). Following the decision in
Hibbert, the Court in Ruzic concluded that the defence does not
apply to persons who could have legally and safely extricated themselves from
the situation of duress. In order to rely on the defence, the accused must have
had no safe avenue of escape, as measured on the modified objective standard of
the reasonable person similarly situated.

                    (b)      A Close Temporal Connection 

[48]                         
There must be “a close temporal connection
between the threat and the harm threatened” (Ruzic, at para. 96). The
close connection between the threat and its execution must be such that the
accused loses the ability to act voluntarily. The requirement of a close
temporal connection between the threat and the harm threatened is linked with
the requirement that the accused have no safe avenue of escape. As the Court in
Ruzic indicated, a threat that is “too far removed in time . . . would
cast doubt on the seriousness of the threat and, more particularly, on claims
of an absence of a safe avenue of escape” (para. 65).

[49]                         
As long as the immediacy and presence
requirements in s. 17  remained intact, the safe avenue of escape and close
temporal connection factors had little relevance. A threat of immediate death
or bodily harm which the recipient believes will be carried out by a person
present ensured a close temporal connection and would most likely leave no safe
avenue of escape. However, once the immediacy and presence requirements were
struck from s. 17 , the common law requirements of no safe avenue of escape and
the close temporal connection became a critical means of assessing whether the
accused’s actions were morally involuntary. 

[50]                         
In addition, once the immediacy and presence
requirements were struck, it followed that the accused’s belief that the threat
would be carried out must be evaluated on a modified objective standard of the
reasonable person similarly situated. Section 17  provides that a person will be
excused “if the person believes that the threats will be carried out”.
On its face, therefore, the section requires a purely subjective belief, a
lower standard that made sense when the threat was clearly immediate and the
threatener physically present on the scene. Once the immediacy and presence
requirements are removed, however, measuring the accused’s belief that the
threat will be carried out necessarily demands a higher standard of evaluation.
In other words, the accused’s actual belief must also be reasonable.

[51]                         
By reading in the requirements of safe avenue of
escape and close temporal connection, the purely subjective standard becomes an
evaluation based on a modified objective standard. These two elements, in
conjunction with the belief that the threat will be carried out, must be
analyzed as a whole: the accused cannot reasonably believe that the threat
would be carried out if there was a safe avenue of escape and no close temporal
connection between the threat and the harm threatened.  

[52]                         
The addition of the common law requirements to
replace the now defunct immediacy and presence elements of s. 17  thus act to
temper the once purely subjective belief as to the threat.  Furthermore, they
bring the statutory provision in line with the principle of moral
involuntariness. Considering that society’s opinion of the accused’s actions is
an important aspect of the principle, it would be contrary to the very idea of
moral involuntariness to simply accept the accused’s subjective belief without
requiring that certain external factors be present. Citing R. v. Howe,
[1987] A.C. 417 (H.L.), at p. 426, Baker agrees that “[t]he threat ‘must
involve a threat of such a degree of violence that “a person of reasonable
firmness” with the characteristics and in the situation of the defendant could
not have been expected to resist’” (para. 25-015). He specifically mentions
that there must be reasonable grounds for the accused’s belief that the threat
would be carried out (paras. 25-015 and 25-016).

                    (c)      Proportionality

[53]                         
The defence of duress requires proportionality
between the threat and the criminal act to be executed. In other words, the
harm caused must not be greater than the harm avoided. Proportionality is
measured on the modified objective standard of the reasonable person similarly
situated, and it includes the requirement that the accused will adjust his or
her conduct according to the nature of the threat: “The accused should be
expected to demonstrate some fortitude and to put up a normal resistance to the
threat” (Ruzic, at para. 62). 

[54]                         
Proportionality is a crucial component of the
defence of duress because, like the previous two elements, it derives directly
from the principle of moral involuntariness: only an action based on a
proportionally grave threat, resisted with normal fortitude, can be considered
morally involuntary. Furthermore, since the principle of moral involuntariness
was judged to be a principle of fundamental justice in Ruzic, it must be
read into s. 17  in order to comply with the statutory interpretation rule that
courts must prefer the constitutional interpretation of a statute. 

                    (3)     The Common Law Defence of Duress
Post-Ruzic

[55]                         
Following this Court’s analysis in Ruzic,
we can conclude that the common law of duress comprises the following elements:

•                    
an explicit or implicit threat of death or
bodily harm proffered against the accused or a third person. The threat may be
of future harm. Although, traditionally, the degree of bodily harm was
characterized as “grievous”, the issue of severity is better dealt with at the
proportionality stage, which acts as the threshold for the appropriate degree
of bodily harm;

•                    
the accused reasonably believed that the threat
would be carried out; 

•                    
the non-existence of a safe avenue of escape,
evaluated on a modified objective standard; 

•                    
a close temporal connection between the threat
and the harm threatened;

•                    
proportionality between the harm threatened and
the harm inflicted by the accused. This is also evaluated on a modified
objective standard; 

•                    
the accused is not a party to a conspiracy or
association whereby the accused is subject to compulsion and actually knew that
threats and coercion to commit an offence were a possible result of this
criminal activity, conspiracy or association. 

[56]                         
We will discuss these elements in turn.

                    (a)      Threat
of Death or Bodily Harm

[57]                         
For an accused to be able to rely on the common
law defence of duress, there must have been a threat of death or bodily harm.
This threat does not necessarily need to be directed at the accused (Ruzic,
at para. 54). It can be either
explicit or implied (R. v. Mena (1987), 34 C.C.C. (3d) 304 (Ont. C.A.),
at p. 320; see also R. v. McRae (2005), 77 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.)).

[58]                         
The strict immediacy or imminence requirement
found in the defence of necessity was not imported into the common law defence
of duress. Rather, this immediacy requirement is “interpreted as a requirement
of a close connection in time, between the threat and its execution in such a
manner that the accused loses the ability to act freely” (Ruzic, at
para. 65). This position was also held in Langlois, where Fish J.A. (as
he then was) held that the issue is not the immediacy or imminence of the
threat, but whether “the accused failed to avail himself or herself of some
opportunity to escape or to render the threat ineffective” (R. v. Langlois (1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 28 (Que. C.A.), at p. 50). The lack of a strict immediacy requirement not only strengthens
the assertion that threats can be made to third parties, but also supports the
conclusion in Ruzic, at para. 86, that the threats made can be of future
harm. 

[59]                         
The harm threatened must be death or bodily
harm. Traditionally, courts have qualified this bodily harm as needing to be
“grievous” or “serious” (see, e.g., Hibbert, at paras. 21 and 23). However, this higher threshold
is not necessary in light of the existence of the proportionality requirement —
inherent in the principle of moral involuntariness — which acts as the ultimate
barrier for those who seek to rely on the defence. 

[60]                         
At section 2, the Criminal Code  defines
the term “bodily harm” as “any hurt or injury to a person that interferes with
the health or comfort of the person and that is more than merely transient or
trifling in nature”. Removing the “grievous” or “serious” element of the bodily
harm requirement and dealing with the requisite degree of harm at the
proportionality stage will not unduly broaden the common law defence of duress.
The two-pronged nature of the proportionality requirement, a concept which we
will more fully develop below, will prevent such an outcome. First, the harm
caused must be measured against the harm threatened. Second, the accused must
meet society’s standards for the reasonable person similarly situated, which
includes a capacity to resist the threat to some degree. 

[61]                         
Theoretically, it could be possible to have
caused less harm than threatened, yet still not be afforded the defence of
duress because the behaviour and reaction of the accused as a whole is judged
unacceptable for that individual in that particular circumstance. For example,
inflicting quite minor harm in reaction to the threat of quite minor harm might
fulfill the “equal or lesser harm” requirement, but would certainly not
constitute a situation where society would be ready to excuse the act as
morally involuntary. 

[62]                         
If the threat is of insufficient seriousness,
the offence committed in reaction to that threat cannot be proportional. The
voluntariness of an act depends on its proportionality: an individual cannot
claim to have lost the ability to act freely when the harm threatened does not
meet society’s threshold. For these reasons, the degree of bodily harm that
will make the defence available is best dealt with at the proportionality
stage. 

[63]                         
Therefore, in order to fulfill this first
requirement of the common law defence of duress, there must have been an
explicit or implicit, present or future threat of death or bodily harm,
directed at the accused or a third person. 

                    (b)      Reasonable Belief that Threat Will
Be Carried Out

[64]                         
In addition, the accused must have reasonably
believed that the threat would be carried out. This element is analyzed on a
modified objective basis, that is, according to the test of the reasonable
person similarly situated. 

                    (c)      No Safe Avenue of Escape

[65]                         
This element of the common law defence was
specifically addressed in Ruzic, at para. 61. Once again, the test,
evaluated on a modified objective basis, is that of a reasonable person
similarly situated:

The courts will take into consideration
the particular circumstances where the accused found
himself and his ability to perceive a reasonable alternative to committing a
crime, with an awareness of his background and essential characteristics. The
process involves a pragmatic assessment of the position of the accused,
tempered by the need to avoid negating criminal liability on the basis of a
purely subjective and unverifiable excuse. 

In other words, a
reasonable person in the same situation as the accused and with the same
personal characteristics and experience would conclude that there was no safe
avenue of escape or legal alternative to committing the offence. If a
reasonable person similarly situated would think that there was a safe
avenue of escape, the requirement is not met and the acts of the accused cannot
be excused using the defence of duress because they cannot be considered as
morally involuntary. 

                    (d)      Close Temporal Connection

[66]                         
The element of close temporal connection between
the threat and the harm threatened, mentioned above, serves to restrict the
availability of the common law defence to situations where there is a
sufficient temporal link between the threat and the offence committed. 

[67]                         
This requirement in no way precludes the
availability of the defence for cases where the threat is of future harm. For
example, the accused in Ruzic was able to rely on the defence even
though the threat was to harm her mother in the event that she did not smuggle
the drugs from Belgrade to Toronto as ordered, a task that would take several
days to accomplish.

[68]                         
The first purpose of the close temporal
connection element is to ensure that there truly was no safe avenue of escape
for the accused. If the threat is too far removed from the accused’s illegal
acts, it will be difficult to conclude that a reasonable person similarly
situated had no option but to commit the offence. The temporal link between the
threat and the harm threatened is necessary to demonstrate the degree of
pressure placed on the accused. 

[69]                         
The second purpose of the close temporal
connection requirement is to ensure that it is reasonable to believe that the
threat put so much pressure on the accused that between this threat and the
commission of the offence, “the accused los[t] the ability to act freely” (Ruzic,
at para. 65). It thus serves to determine if the accused truly acted in an
involuntary manner. 

                    (e)      Proportionality

[70]                         
Proportionality is inherent in the principle of
moral involuntariness. “[T]his involuntariness is measured on the basis
of society’s expectation of appropriate and normal resistance to pressure” (Perka,
at p. 259). Part of the analysis involves making a determination of whether the
harm threatened is equal to or greater than the harm caused. 

[71]                         
The test for determining whether an act was
proportional is therefore two-pronged, and was set out by Dickson J. in Perka,
at p. 252:

There must
be some way of assuring proportionality. No rational criminal justice system,
no matter how humane or liberal, could excuse the infliction of a greater
harm to allow the actor to avert a lesser evil. . . . According to
Fletcher, this requirement is also related to the notion of voluntariness [(G.
P. Fletcher, Rethinking Criminal Law (1978), at p. 804)]:

. . . if the gap between the
harm done and the benefit accrued becomes too great, the act is more likely to
appear voluntary and therefore inexcusable. . . . Determining this threshold is
patently a matter of moral judgment about what we expect people to be able
to resist in trying situations. A valuable aid in making that judgment is
comparing the competing interests at stake and assessing the degree to which
the actor inflicts harm beyond the benefit that accrues from his action. [Emphasis added.]

[72]                         
In other words, the “moral voluntariness” of an
act must depend on whether it is proportional to the threatened harm. To
determine if the proportionality requirement is met, two elements must be
considered: the difference between the nature and magnitude of the harm
threatened and the offence committed, as well as a general moral judgment
regarding the accused’s behaviour in the circumstances. These elements are to
be evaluated in conjunction on a modified objective basis. 

[73]                         
The first element of proportionality requires
that the harm threatened was equal to or greater than the harm inflicted
by the accused (Ruzic, at para. 62; see also R. v.
Latimer, 2001 SCC 1, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 3, at
para. 31). The second element of proportionality requires a more
in-depth analysis of the acts of the accused and a determination as to whether
they accord with what society expects from a reasonable person similarly
situated in that particular circumstance. It is at this stage that we examine
if the accused demonstrated “normal” resistance to the threat. Given that the defence of duress “evolved
from attempts at striking a proper balance between those conflicting interests
of the accused, of the victims and of society” (Ruzic, at para. 60),
proportionality measured on a modified objective standard is key.

[74]                         
The evaluation of the proportionality
requirement on a modified objective standard differs from the standard used in
the defence of necessity, which is purely objective. While the defences of
duress and necessity share the same juristic principles, according to Lamer
C.J. in Hibbert, this does not entail that they must employ the same
standard when evaluating proportionality. The Court in Ruzic noted that
the two defences, although both categorized as excuses rooted in the notion of moral or normative
involuntariness, target different types of situations. 
Furthermore, the temporality requirement for necessity is one of imminence,
whereas the threat in a case of duress can be carried out in the future. It is
therefore not so anomalous that the courts have attributed differing tests for
proportionality, especially when we consider that the defences may apply under
noticeably different factual circumstances. 

                    (f)       Participation in a Conspiracy or
Criminal Association 

[75]                         
This statutory element has been recognized as
also relevant to the common law.  Recent jurisprudence has concluded that those
who seek to rely on the common law defence of duress cannot do so if they knew
that their participation in a conspiracy or criminal association came with a
risk of coercion and/or threats to compel them to commit an offence (see R.
v. Li (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 360 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 20-33; R. v.
Poon, 2006 BCSC 1158 (CanLII), at para. 7; R. v. M.P.D., 2003 BCPC
97, [2003] B.C.J. No. 771 (QL), at para. 61). 

[76]                         
In Li, the Ontario Court of Appeal stated
that voluntarily joining a conspiracy or criminal organization also has an
impact on whether there was a safe avenue of escape. In that case, the accused
persons had approached a criminal organization of their own volition and had
later been threatened by this same group. In its analysis on the presence of an
air of reality, the court stated the following:

As can be
seen, the Supreme Court [in Ruzic] recognized the juxtaposition
between a safe avenue of escape and the voluntary assumption of the risk in the
first place. Both are front and centre in the case in appeal. In
considering the appellants’ claim that calling the local police would have been
ineffective because they not only feared for themselves but also for their
families in China and elsewhere, the court should be reminded of their
initiative in approaching the Snakeheads in the first place, and the fact that
the threats of retaliation against them and their families was sweetened by the
inducement of retiring their debts to this organization. [Emphasis added; para.
32.]

[77]                         
The Court of Appeal’s conclusion stands for the
proposition that courts must take into account the accused’s voluntary
assumption of risk, a natural corollary of the unavailability of the defence of
duress to those who wilfully engage in criminal conspiracies or organizations.
This is consistent with the principle of moral involuntariness. An accused
that, because of his or her criminal involvement, knew coercion or threats were
a possibility cannot claim that there was no safe avenue of escape, nor can he
or she truly be found to have committed the resulting offence in a morally
involuntary manner.  

[78]                         
Therefore, to rely on the common law defence of
duress, the accused must not be a party to a conspiracy or association whereby
he or she is subject to compulsion and actually knew that threats and
coercion to commit an offence were a possible result of this criminal activity,
conspiracy or association. In Ruzic, at para. 70, LeBel J. states:
“Like s. 17 of the Criminal Code ,
the English jurisprudence has precluded resort to the defence where the threats
are made by a criminal organization which the accused voluntarily joined and knew
might pressure him to engage in criminal activity (R. v. Lewis (1992),
96 Cr. App. R. 412 ; R. v. Heath, [1999] E.W.J. No. 5092 (QL))” (emphasis
added).  

[79]                         
There is division of
opinion as to whether the accused’s knowledge of potential threats or coercion
is evaluated on a subjective or objective standard. According to Yeo,
the above-cited conclusion in Ruzic is consistent with Australian law,
which only denies the defence of duress to those who were actually aware of the
risk of being coerced by the criminal association (S. Yeo,
“Defining Duress” (2002), 46 Crim. L.Q. 293, at p. 315). A subjective
standard is also applied in the United States (United States v.
Burnes, 666 F.Supp.2d 968 (D. Minn. 2009); United States v. Gamboa,
439 F.3d 796 (8th Cir. 2006); United States v. Montes, 602 F.3d 381 (5th
Cir. 2010)). Baker, however, seems to reject a purely
subjective standard. According to him, the test should be whether the accused “[r]ecklessly
or negligently placed himself in a situation in which it was probable that he
would be forced to commit a criminal act” (para. 25-044). 

[80]                         
We think that the subjective standard is more in
line with the principle of moral involuntariness. If the accused voluntarily
puts him or herself in a position where he or she could be coerced, then we
cannot conclude that there was no safe avenue of escape and that the ensuing
actions were morally involuntary. 

IV.    Summary

[81]                         
The defence of duress, in its statutory and common law forms, is
largely the same.  The two forms share the following common elements:

•                    
There must be an explicit or implicit threat of present or future
death or bodily harm. This threat can be directed at the accused or a third
party. 

 

•                    
The accused must reasonably believe that
the threat will be carried out. 

 

•                    
There is no safe avenue of escape. This element
is evaluated on a modified objective standard. 

•                    
A close temporal connection between the threat
and the harm threatened.

•                    
Proportionality between the harm threatened and
the harm inflicted by the accused. The harm caused by the accused must be equal
to or no greater than the harm threatened. This is also evaluated on a modified
objective standard. 

•                    
The accused is not a party to a conspiracy or
association whereby the accused is subject to compulsion and actually knew that
threats and coercion to commit an offence were a possible result of this
criminal activity, conspiracy or association. 

[82]                         
Certain differences remain.  

[83]                         
The first is that, as was established in Paquette
and confirmed in Ruzic, the statutory defence applies to
principals, while the common law defence is available to parties to an offence.
The second is that the statutory version of the defence has a lengthy list of
exclusions, whereas it is unclear in the Canadian common law of duress whether
any offences are excluded. This results in the rather incoherent situation that
principals who commit one of the enumerated offences cannot rely on the defence
of duress while parties to those same offences, however, can. 

[84]                         
This is an unsatisfactory state of the law, but
one which we think we are not able to confront in this case.  Although we had
the benefit of extensive argument about the parameters of the common law and
statutory defences of duress, understandably no argument was presented about
the statutory exclusions. In addition, some courts have found some of these
exclusions to be constitutionally infirm. We accordingly leave to another day
the questions of the status of the statutory exclusions and what, if any,
exclusions apply at common law.

V.     Disposition

[85]                         
We would allow the appeal and enter a stay of
proceedings. 

                    The following are the reasons delivered by

[86]                         
Fish J. (dissenting in part) — I agree with Justices LeBel and Cromwell,
for the reasons they have given, that the defence of duress was not available
to the respondent in this case.  As a result, the respondent’s acquittal must
be set aside. 

[87]                         
With respect, however, I am not persuaded that a
judicial stay of proceedings is warranted on the record before us.

[88]                         
The criteria for granting a stay ― a
drastic remedy of last resort ― are well established (see Charkaoui v.
Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 SCC 38, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 326, at paras. 75-76; R. v. Regan,
2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297, at paras. 53-54; Canada (Minister of
Citizenship and Immigration) v. Tobiass, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391, at paras. 53
and 86; and R. v. O’Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, at para. 82).  The
Court has made clear that a stay of proceedings is available only in “the
clearest of cases” (Charkaoui, at para. 76; O’Connor, at para. 82).  

[89]                         
These criteria, in my view, are
not satisfied in this case.

[90]                         
Accordingly, I would instead order a new trial,
leaving it to the Crown to determine, in the exercise of its discretion,
whether the public interest requires that a new trial be had.  In making this
determination, the Crown should bear in mind the particular circumstances of
the case: On one hand, the trial judge’s factual findings favourable to the
respondent; on the other, uncontested evidence that the respondent considered
for seven months having her husband killed, paid a “hit man” $25,000 to do the
job and, when that failed, attempted twice more to arrange for her husband’s
demise.

on appeal from the court of appeal for manitoba

                    Criminal
law — Offences — Uttering threats — Elements of offence — Mens rea — Respondent
repeatedly telling ex‑girlfriend that he would kill her — Ex‑girlfriend
testifying that words uttered by accused did not intimidate her or cause her
fear as accused frequently talked in that manner — Whether trial judge erred in
law in determining that accused did not have requisite mens rea — Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 264.1(1) (a).

                    While
the accused was incarcerated, he had a telephone conversation with his ex‑girlfriend
during which he repeatedly told her that he would kill her upon his release if
she proceeded with her planned abortion of their child.  The accused was
charged with uttering threats.  At trial, the ex‑girlfriend testified
that the words uttered by the accused had not intimidated her or caused her
fear as the accused frequently talked in that manner.  The accused was
acquitted, the trial judge having a reasonable doubt whether the accused
intended his words to intimidate or be taken seriously.  The Court of Appeal
dismissed the Crown’s appeal. 

                    Held
(McLachlin C.J. and Abella and Rothstein JJ. dissenting):  The appeal
should be dismissed.

                    Per
Fish, Cromwell, Moldaver and Wagner JJ.:  It is an essential element of
the offence under s. 264.1(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  that
the accused intended his or her words to intimidate or to be taken seriously. 
The trial judge properly considered the words uttered in the context of the
evidence of the recipient of the threats and concluded that the evidence left
her with a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused had the requisite
intent.  There is no basis on which to conclude that the trial judge committed
any error of law in concluding as she did. 

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and Abella and Rothstein JJ. (dissenting):  The trial
judge erred in making the perception of the recipient of the threat the
determinative factor in the assessment of the accused’s intent.  The nature of
the relationship between the accused and the recipient of a threat forms part
of the circumstances surrounding the offence.  However, whether the recipient
of a threat takes that threat seriously is not an element of the mens rea
of the accused.

                    The
judgment of Fish, Cromwell, Moldaver and Wagner JJ. was delivered by

I

[1]                             
Fish J. — This appeal from a judgment of the
Manitoba Court of Appeal comes to us as of right, pursuant to s. 693(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code . 

[2]                             
In virtue of that provision, the Attorney
General may appeal to this Court “on any question of law on which a judge of
the court of appeal dissents”.  Here, the question is whether the trial judge,
in acquitting the respondent Kelly Joseph O’Brien, erred in law as to the mens
rea of the offence with which he was charged.  I agree with the majority in
the Court of Appeal that she did not (2012 MBCA 6, 275 Man. R. (2d) 144).

[3]                             
I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

II

[4]                             
The respondent was charged with uttering a threat
to cause death or bodily harm to another person, contrary to s. 264.1(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .   He was charged as well, in
a separate count, with threatening to damage that person’s property, contrary
to s. 264.1(1) (b).

[5]                             
In her brief reasons for judgment, delivered
orally, the trial judge held ― correctly, in my view ― that the actus
reus of the offence created by s. 264.1(1) (a) is “the actual
speaking or uttering of the threats of death or serious bodily harm”.  And,
again correctly, the trial judge held that the mens rea “is that the
words are meant [to convey] a threat.  In other words they are meant to
intimidate”.

[6]                             
This understanding of the essential elements of
a charge under s. 264.1(1) (a) conforms fully with the governing
decisions of this Court. 

[7]                             
Speaking for the Court in R. v. Clemente,
[1994] 2 S.C.R. 758, at p. 763, Cory J. stated:

                        Under
the present section the actus reus of the offence is the uttering of
threats of death or serious bodily harm. The mens rea is that the words
be spoken or written as a threat to cause death or serious bodily harm; that
is, they were meant to intimidate or to be taken seriously. [Emphasis deleted.]

See, to the same effect,
R. v. McCraw, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 72, at p. 82.

[8]                             
Moreover, before rendering judgment, the trial
judge took care to recess the proceedings for the express purpose of reviewing
the decision of this Court in Clemente.  In her reasons for judgment, as
I have already mentioned, she then proceeded to set out her understanding of
the law in full conformity with that decision.

III

[9]                             
At no point in her reasons did the trial judge
state, as the Crown contends, that she was acquitting the accused solely
because the recipient of the threats did not take them seriously. 

[10]                         
Rather, after setting out the law correctly, the
trial judge quite properly felt bound “to consider the words [uttered by Mr.
O’Brien] in the context of the evidence of [the person to whom they were
directed]”.  That evidence was relevant and therefore admissible for the purpose
of assessing the context in which the words were spoken. 

[11]                         
As Cory J. explained in Clemente, at p. 762:

                        .
. . the question of whether the accused had the intent to intimidate, or that
his words were meant to be taken seriously will, in the absence of any
explanation by the accused, usually be determined by the words used, the
context in which they were spoken, and the person to whom they were directed.

[12]                         
Manifestly, the trial judge asked herself the
right question.  Her answer was that the evidence left her with a reasonable
doubt whether Mr. O’Brien had acted with the requisite mens rea of the
offence with which he was charged.  And she entered an acquittal for that
reason.

IV

[13]                         
I agree with the Crown that it is not an
essential element of the offence under s. 264.1(1) (a) that the recipient
of the threats uttered by the accused feel intimidated by them or be shown to
have taken them seriously.  All that needs to be proven is that they were intended
by the accused to have that effect. 

[14]                         
Here, the trial judge was left with a reasonable
doubt in that regard.  Another judge might well have decided otherwise, but for
the reasons given, I am not persuaded that the trial judge committed the error
of law imputed to her by the Crown in concluding as she did.

[15]                         
I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

                    The reasons of
McLachlin C.J. and Abella and Rothstein JJ. were delivered by

[16]                         
Rothstein J. (dissenting) —  Kelly O’Brien was charged
with two counts of uttering threats contrary to s. 264.1(1)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C-46 , and two counts of breach of probation. 

[17]                         
The charges arose as a result of statements made
by Mr. O’Brien during a telephone call to his ex-girlfriend, Ms. W, while he
was incarcerated. Ms. W was pregnant with his child and was planning to have an
abortion because she suspected him of having had an affair with another woman.
Mr. O’Brien told Ms. W that he would kill her if she went through with the
abortion. 

[18]                         
The actus reus of uttering threats has
been conceded by Mr. O’Brien and is not in issue in this appeal. The only issue
before this Court is whether the trial judge properly assessed the mens rea of
the offence of uttering threats. 

[19]                         
At trial, Mr. O’Brien’s counsel submitted that
if “at the end of the day [the recipient of the threats] simply just didn’t
feel threatened . . . just didn’t feel scared it’s my respectful
submission that the offence at law has not been made out” (A.R., at p. 57). On
the other hand, the Crown submitted that “in law . . . it matters not
that the words were not taken seriously” (A.R., at p. 57). 

[20]                         
 The learned trial judge, referring to R. v.
Clemente, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 758, said in the course of argument that while
“the comments have to be uttered with the intent to intimidate or instill
. . . fear. . . . The case also indicates that such threats
have to be taken seriously” (A.R., at p. 59). The trial judge then retired to
review Clemente.

[21]                         
After a short adjournment, she returned to the
courtroom to deliver her oral reasons. In dealing with the mental element, the
trial judge stated that she had a reasonable doubt about “the mens rea
of the offence because of the evidence of Ms. [W], the fact she did not take
[the threats] seriously” (A.R., at p. 4).

[22]                         
Respectfully, the trial judge’s holding
misinterprets the mens rea of the offence of uttering threats as set out
in Clemente and R. v. McCraw, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 72. The Clemente
test asks the question: “Looked at objectively, in the context of all the
words written or spoken and having regard to the person to whom they were
directed, would the questioned words convey a threat of serious bodily harm to
a reasonable person?” (p. 762, quoting McCraw, at p. 83).

[23]                         
The trial judge did not ask herself what a
reasonable person would objectively perceive. Rather, she asked herself what
Ms. W perceived.  According to Clemente, the trial judge was
required to determine whether the reasonable person would consider that the
words were uttered as threats by “regard[ing] them objectively, and review[ing] them in light of the
circumstances in which they were uttered, the manner in which they were spoken,
and the person to whom they were addressed” (p. 763). Accordingly, the relationship between Mr.
O’Brien and Ms. W is not irrelevant. It forms part of the context and
circumstances surrounding the offence. However, whether
the recipient of a threat takes the threat seriously is not, in and of itself,
an element of the mens rea of the accused.

[24]                         
Here, the trial judge erred in making Ms. W’s
perception the determinative factor in assessing the accused’s intent to
instill fear in her and to intimidate her so that she would not have the
abortion. 

[25]                         
I am not unmindful of the “cautio[n] [to]
appellate judges not to dissect, parse, or microscopically examine the reasons
of a trial judge” (R. v. C.L.Y., 2008 SCC 2, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 5, at para.
11, referring to R. v. Morrissey (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.),
at pp. 203-5). However, in my respectful opinion, the error of law made by the
trial judge is self-evident.

[26]                         
I would accordingly allow the appeal, enter a
conviction and remit the matter to the Provincial Court of Manitoba for
sentencing.

orders — Accused who had previously been convicted for multiple alcohol‑related
driving offences and breaches of probation orders and undertakings pleading guilty
to the charge of driving a motor vehicle while impaired by drugs or alcohol — Crown
requesting order of forfeiture of motor vehicle — Whether trial judge erred in
refusing to issue order.

Held:  The appeal
should be allowed and the forfeiture order granted.

                    In applying s. 490.41(3)  of
the Criminal Code , the trial judge held that he was bound to consider
the objectives and principles of sentencing set out in s. 718  and
following of the Code.  This error is fatal to his conclusion.  The respondent
failed to satisfy this Court that the impact of forfeiture would be
“disproportionate” within the meaning of s. 490.41(3) .  The order of
forfeiture sought by the Crown should therefore be granted.

the Crown, upon his conviction, sought forfeiture of the truck driven by Mr.
Manning at the time of his arrest.  

[2]                             
The trial judge declined to grant the order of
forfeiture requested by the Crown.

[3]                             
Our sole concern here is with s. 490.41(3)  of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , which, in its relevant part,
reads as follows:

                                     .
. . if a court is satisfied that the impact of an order of forfeiture made
under subsection 490.1(1) or 490.2(2) would be disproportionate to the nature
and gravity of the offence, the circumstances surrounding the commission of the
offence and the criminal record, if any, of the person charged with or
convicted of the offence, as the case may be, it may decide not to order the
forfeiture of the property or part of the property and may revoke any restraint
order made in respect of that property or part.

[4]                             
In applying that provision here, the trial judge
held that he was bound to consider the objectives and principles of sentencing
set out in s. 718 and following of the Criminal Code .  

[5]                             
We agree with the Quebec Court of Appeal (2011
QCCA 900 (CanLII)) that the trial judge erred in this regard: see R. v.
Craig, 2009 SCC 23, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 762, at para.  13. 

[6]                             
Unlike the Court of Appeal, however, and with
the greatest of respect, we believe that the trial judge’s error is fatal to
his conclusion.  

[7]                             
Moreover, on the record as we have it, we are
not satisfied that the impact of the order of forfeiture sought by the Crown
was “disproportionate”, within the meaning of s. 490.41(3)  of the Criminal
Code .  In concluding otherwise, the trial judge erroneously emphasized Mr.
Manning’s personal circumstances and failed to give appropriate weight, as
required by s. 490.41(3) , to Mr. Manning’s criminal record, including five convictions
for alcohol-related driving offences and three for breaches of probation
orders or undertakings. 

[8]                             
Accordingly, we would allow the appeal and grant
the order of forfeiture sought by the Crown.

on appeal from the court of appeal for alberta 

                    Criminal
law — Defences — Provocation — Whether objective and subjective elements of
provocation established, lending an air of reality to this defence — Whether
victim’s provoking comments were sudden, in the sense that accused was caught
unprepared and surprised by them — Whether defence of provocation should have
been submitted to jury — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 
232 . 

                    In
2006, K’s lifeless body was discovered.  He had been shot twice.  Days later, P
was arrested.  He confessed to killing K.  According to P, K had been extorting
money from him for 18 months by threatening to reveal details about his
offshore investments to the Canada Revenue Agency, and by threatening to harm
his mother if he chose to stop paying or went to the police.  P decided that he
had had enough.  He went to K’s home to end the extortion and threats.  He
brought along a loaded handgun in order to intimidate K but did not immediately
take out his gun.  Rather, he attempted to get K to agree to put an end to the
extortion.  K responded that he would continue the extortion and that he had
“great fucking insurance”, a comment that P took as an implied threat against
his mother.  At this point, P said he “snapped”.  He retrieved his gun and shot
K in the back and then in the head.

                    P
was charged with second degree murder.  At the trial by jury, P admitted to
killing K but argued that the defence of provocation applied.  Finding that
there was some evidence on the objective and subjective elements of the defence
of provocation, the trial judge left the defence with the jury.  The jury
rejected the defence, and found P guilty of second degree murder.  He appealed
his conviction, arguing inter alia that the trial judge erred in her
instructions to the jury on provocation.  The majority of the Court of Appeal
dismissed the appeal, holding that the defence of provocation was properly left
with the jury and that there were no errors in the instructions to the jury. 

                    Held: 
The appeal should be dismissed.

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell, Moldaver and Wagner JJ.: 
On the evidence in this case, there was no air of reality to the defence
of provocation and the defence should not have been left to the jury.  The
conviction for second degree murder, however, is affirmed.

                    Where
the evidence requires the drawing of inferences in order to establish the
objective or subjective elements of the defence of provocation, the trial judge
may engage in a limited weighing to determine whether the elements of the
defence can reasonably be inferred from the evidence.  For the purposes of the
application of the air of reality test, we must assume that the version of
events described in an accused’s confession is true.  That said, an air of
reality cannot spring from bare, unsupported assertions by the accused. 
Defences supported only by bald assertions that cannot reasonably be borne out
by the evidence, viewed in its totality, should be kept from the jury.

                    K’s
threat against the safety of P’s mother and the history of the relations
between K and P, provide a minimal evidential foundation for the objective
element of the defence.  However there was no air of reality to the subjective
element of the defence of provocation.  That element includes a requirement of
“suddenness” which applies to both the act of provocation and the accused’s
reaction to it.  The trial judge committed an error of law by only considering
whether there was evidence to support the contention that P had killed K before
there was time for his passion to cool.  She did not examine whether the record
could support a finding that K’s provoking comments were sudden, in the sense
that P was subjectively caught unprepared and surprised by them.

                    The
record cannot reasonably support an inference that P was caught unprepared by K’s
statements as K had made similar statements repeatedly in the past.  Viewed in
its totality, the evidence suggests that before setting out to visit K, P
contemplated the possibility that K would persist with his extortion and
threats, and that in that case, he would need to kill K to end them.  A
contention that P was caught unprepared is outside the range of reasonable
inferences that can be drawn from this evidence.  It is supported by little
more than P’s bald assertions that he “snapped” and “everything was just
automatic”.  

                    Per
Fish J.:  The trial judge did not err in leaving to the jury the defence
of provocation, nor did she commit a reviewable error in instructing the jury
as she did.

                    Where
there is direct evidence as to all elements of a defence, the trial judge must
put the defence to the jury.  Whether the evidence is true, or at least raises
a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, is a matter ultimately
reserved to the jury.  In this case, the accused’s evidence at trial
constitutes direct evidence and relates the facts upon which his defence of
provocation rests.  Accordingly, the appellant discharged his evidentiary
burden with respect to both the objective and subjective components of his
defence of provocation.  The mere fact that the deceased had made similar
threats in the past does not mean that the accused would have anticipated, or
been prepared for, subsequent threats of the same sort.  A reiterated threat or
insult can cause a previously unprovoked person to “snap”.  Here, the alleged
provocative act was not the deceased’s failure to end the extortion; rather, it
was his sudden utterance — “I got great fucking insurance” — which P understood
as a threat to his mother’s life.  P’s detailed evidence of the circumstances
surrounding the alleged provocation can hardly be equated with a “bare
assertion” that he was provoked.  The passages in P’s confession identified by
the Chief Justice as supporting a loss of self‑control constitute direct
evidence of the suddenness of the provocation and must be taken as true. 
Whether those passages are inconsistent with other evidence, however, is a
determination that must properly be left to the jury.  In the result, the
appeal fails for the reasons of the majority in the Court of Appeal.

the respondent.

                    The judgment of McLachlin
C.J. and Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell, Moldaver and Wagner JJ. was delivered by

                    The Chief Justice — 

I.    Background

[1]                             
On November 10, 2006, Brian Kullman’s body was
discovered in the Elbow Falls area southwest of Calgary, Alberta.  He had been
shot twice — once in the back, and once in the head. 

[2]                             
Five days later, the appellant, Bill Pappas, was
arrested as he was about to board a plane for London, England.  The police
interrogated him and he confessed to killing Kullman.  

[3]                             
Pappas explained to the police his version of
the events leading to Kullman’s death.  Pappas contended that Kullman had been
extorting money from him for approximately 18 months by threatening to reveal
details about his offshore investments to the Canada Revenue Agency, and by
threatening to harm his mother if he chose to stop paying or went to the
police. According to Pappas, two of Kullman’s associates had visited his mother
as a threatening gesture, and had thereafter told him, “You say no to Brian —
you say no to Brian and next time it won’t be a social visit”: A.R., vol. II,
at p. 239.  

[4]                             
Pappas, as he put it, decided that he had had
enough.  He loaded his 9 millimetre handgun with four hollow point bullets and
went to Kullman’s condominium.  The ostensible purpose of the visit was to
store a bicycle in Kullman’s basement.  The real purpose was to end the
extortion and threats.  Pappas told the police that he brought the gun along
only to intimidate Kullman.  But he also explained that he chose this kind of
bullet because it was particularly lethal.  

[5]                             
During his visit to the condominium, Pappas
raised the subject of extortion several times with Kullman, attempting to get
him to agree to put an end to it.  He did not immediately take out his gun, but
instead kept it concealed on his hip. On the way to the basement where the bike
would be stored, Pappas tried one more appeal, saying, “Brian, just please —
let’s just end this”.  In response, Kullman said, “Buddy, why the fuck should
I? You’re the best cash out I have and I got great fucking insurance”:  A.R.,
vol. II, at p. 241.

[6]                             
Pappas took the reference to “insurance” as an
implied threat against his mother.  At this point, he said, he just “snapped”,
his “mind shut down and everything was just automatic”:  A.R., vol. III, at p.
64, and vol. II, at p. 304.  He retrieved the gun, cocked the hammer, and shot
Kullman in the back at close range.  Kullman screamed and began to fall, and
Pappas fired again.  Finally, as the victim lay on the floor in distress,
Pappas moved the handgun to within 7 or 8 inches of Kullman’s head and shot him
in the left side of his head. 

[7]                             
Pappas pulled Kullman’s body up the stairs and
loaded it in Kullman’s car.  After returning to the basement and setting a fire
to cover his tracks, he drove to Elbow Falls where he rolled the body down an
embankment.  Several days later, he also disposed of Kullman’s credit card and
of bloodstained clothes in the garbage cans behind a convenience store and a
gas station.

[8]                             
In his confession, Pappas admitted that he had
forged a cheque from Kullman to himself for $2,500 and deposited it into his
bank account, and that he had used Kullman’s credit card.

[9]                             
Throughout, Pappas insisted that he had murdered
Kullman to save his mother from harm. 

[10]                         
Pappas was charged with second degree murder for
the killing of Kullman.

II.  The Trial and Appeal

[11]                         
At the trial by jury, Pappas’ confession was
entered by the Crown as evidence.  Pappas did not testify, but relied on his
confession as evidence on the issue of provocation.  Maintaining that he
“snapped” and killed Kullman following the implied threat to harm his mother,
he argued that the defence of provocation applied to reduce the verdict from
murder to manslaughter.

[12]                         
The trial judge initially took the view that the
provocation defence lacked an air of reality.  However, after hearing defence
submissions on the matter, she concluded: 

I am satisfied that if the
jury were to believe the evidence of Mr. Pappas on this issue of provocation
properly, there is some evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly
instructed could find there has been provocation. I acknowledge that the
evidence on the objective and subjective test is not strong. But it is there. 
[A.R., vol. I, at p. 5]

 

[13]                         
The jury rejected the defence of provocation,
and found Pappas guilty of second degree murder. 

[14]                         
Pappas appealed his conviction, arguing inter
alia that the trial judge’s instructions to the jury on provocation
contained several errors.  The Crown argued that the instructions were
error-free.  In addition, the Crown contended that there was no air of reality
to the defence and that it never should have been left with the jury.

[15]                         
The majority of the Court of Appeal, per
O’Brien and Rowbotham JJ.A., dismissed the appeal.  It held that the defence of
provocation was properly left with the jury and that there were no errors in
the instructions to the jury: 2012 ABCA 221, 533 A.R. 294.

[16]                         
Berger J.A., dissenting, agreed with the
majority that the defence was properly left with the jury but found several
errors in the instructions to the jury.

[17]                         
Mr. Pappas now appeals to this Court.  Before
us, four issues arise:

(1) Was the defence
of provocation properly left to the jury? (The Crown contends it was not,
making it unnecessary for this Court to consider whether the charge on the
defence was in error.)

(2) Did the trial
judge fail to adequately instruct the jury that the post-offence conduct had no
bearing on the issue of provocation?

(3) Did the trial
judge misstate the accused’s motive?

(4) Did the trial judge err by stating the suddenness instruction
disjunctively, requiring rejection of the defence if either the extortion or
the threat was not sudden?

[18]                         
For the reasons that follow, I would accept the
Crown’s argument that there was no air of reality to the defence of
provocation.  This makes it unnecessary for me to consider the other issues
raised by the appellant.

III.  Discussion

[19]                         
For ease of reference, I set out s. 232  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 :

232. (1) Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced
to manslaughter if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion
caused by sudden provocation.

 

(2)
A wrongful act or an insult that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control is provocation for the
purposes of this section if the accused acted on it on the sudden and before
there was time for his passion to cool.

 

(3)
For the purposes of this section, the questions

 

(a)
whether a particular wrongful act or insult amounted to provocation, and

     

(b)
whether the accused was deprived of the power of self-control by the
provocation that he alleges he received, 

 

are
questions of fact, but no one shall be deemed to have given provocation to
another by doing anything that he had a legal right to do, or by doing anything
that the accused incited him to do in order to provide the accused with an
excuse for causing death or bodily harm to any human being.

 

(4)
Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder is not necessarily
manslaughter by reason only that it was committed by a person who was being
arrested illegally, but the fact that the illegality of the arrest was known to
the accused may be evidence of provocation for the purpose of this section.

Was the Defence of Provocation
Properly Left to the Jury?

[20]                         
The Crown contends that on the evidence in this
case, there was no air of reality to the defence of provocation.  I agree.  I
will first discuss the air of reality test, and then the objective and
subjective elements of the defence of provocation.

(1) The Air of Reality Test

[21]                         
As discussed in the companion case R. v.
Cairney, 2013 SCC 55, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 420, before leaving the defence to the jury, the trial judge must find
that there is an air of reality on both the objective and subjective elements
of the defence.  The question is whether a properly instructed jury acting
reasonably could be left in a state of reasonable doubt as to whether the
accused is guilty of murder, on the basis of the defence of provocation.  There
must be an evidential foundation for both the objective and subjective elements
of the defence, which s. 232(3)  of the Criminal Code  states are
questions of fact.

[22]                         
The air of reality test requires courts to tread
a fine line: it requires more than “some” or “any” evidence of the elements of
a defence, yet it does not go so far as to allow a weighing of the substantive
merits of a defence: R. v. Mayuran, 2012 SCC 31, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 162, at
para. 21.  A trial judge applying the air of reality test cannot consider
issues of credibility and reliability, weigh evidence substantively, make
findings of fact, or draw determinate factual inferences:  R. v. Cinous,
2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 87; R. v. Fontaine, 2004 SCC
27, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 702, at para. 12.  However, where appropriate, the trial
judge can engage in a “limited weighing” of the evidence, similar to that
conducted by a preliminary inquiry judge when deciding whether to commit an
accused to trial: see R. v. Arcuri, 2001 SCC 54, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828,
cited by McLachlin C.J. and Bastarache J. in Cinous, at para. 91. 

[23]                         
The ability of the trial judge to engage in
“limited weighing” depends on the type of evidence on the record.  “If there is
direct evidence as to every element of the defence, whether or not it is
adduced by the accused, the trial judge must put the defence to the jury”: Cinous,
at para. 88.  The trial judge may not engage in any weighing of direct
evidence, since this would require a consideration of the inherent reliability
of the evidence. 

[24]                         
“Direct evidence is evidence which, if believed,
resolves a matter in issue”: Cinous, at para. 88, citing D. Watt, Watt’s
Manual of Criminal Evidence (2001), at § 8.0.  However, “the mere
assertion by the accused of the elements of a defence does not constitute
direct evidence, and will not be sufficient to put the defence before a jury”: Cinous,
at para. 88.  An air of reality “cannot spring from what amounts to little more
than a bare, unsupported assertion by the accused”, which is otherwise
inconsistent with the totality of the accused’s own evidence: R. v. Park,
[1995] 2 S.C.R. 836, at para. 35, per L’Heureux-Dubé J. For example, in R.
v. Gauthier, 2013 SCC 32, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 403, this Court, per Wagner J., suggested that a single
statement made by an accused that is otherwise inconsistent with the accused’s
“principal narrative” is insufficient to give an air of reality to a defence:
paras. 60-61.

[25]                         
Where the evidence instead requires the drawing
of inferences in order to establish the elements of a defence, the trial judge
may engage in a limited weighing to determine whether the elements of the
defence can reasonably be inferred from the evidence.  “The judge does not draw
determinate factual inferences, but rather comes to a conclusion about the
field of factual inferences that could reasonably be drawn from the evidence”: Cinous,
at para. 91.  In conducting this limited weighing, the trial judge must examine
the totality of the evidence: Cinous, at para. 53; Park, at para.
13, per L’Heureux-Dubé J. 

[26]                         
As discussed in Cairney, in cases where
there is a real doubt as to whether the air of reality test is met, the defence
of provocation should be left to the jury.  However, this principle does not
exempt the trial judge from engaging in a limited weighing of the evidence,
where appropriate.  The fact remains that the trial judge exercises a
gatekeeper role in keeping from the jury defences that have no evidential
foundation.  Defences supported only by bald assertions that cannot reasonably
be borne out by the evidence, viewed in its totality, should be kept from the
jury.  

[27]                         
In the present appeal, Pappas relies upon his
confession as providing the grounds for the defence of provocation.  For the
purposes of the application of the air of reality test, we must assume that the
version of events described in that confession is true: Cinous, at
paras. 53 and 119.  The question is whether a properly instructed jury acting
reasonably could be left in a state of reasonable doubt as to the presence of
each of the elements of the defence of provocation.  There must be an
evidential foundation for both the objective and subjective elements of the
defence.  I will now examine each of these in turn.

(2) The Objective Element

[28]                         
The objective element asks whether there was a
wrongful act or insult by the deceased, sufficient to deprive an ordinary
person of the power of self-control.  Pappas argues that his confession
provides evidence of a wrongful act or insult, in the form of Kullman’s
statement that he had “great fucking insurance”.  Pappas’ confession describes
a sequence of events in which he had been consistently extorted for an 18-month
period and in which his mother had been the target of threats.  He contends
that Kullman’s reference to insurance caused him to finally snap. 

[29]                         
Unlike the companion case Cairney, this
appeal does not raise the issue of self-induced provocation.  Pappas did not
initiate an aggressive confrontation.  He did not confront Kullman at gunpoint;
his weapon remained concealed on him until the moment when he was allegedly
provoked.  Nor did he approach Kullman in an otherwise aggressive manner that
could predictably have induced threatening behaviour.  Rather, Pappas contends
that he tried to reason with Kullman, by asking him if the extortion could
cease.

[30]                         
The relevant question is thus whether an
ordinary person, placed in Pappas’ circumstances, would have been deprived of
self-control upon being told, “You’re the best cash out I have and I got great
fucking insurance”.

[31]                         
On the one hand, the ordinary person standard
must be contextualized to take into account the history of the relations
between Pappas and Kullman.  Pappas had been the target of ongoing extortion
and the safety of his mother had repeatedly been threatened. 

[32]                         
On the other hand, the ordinary person standard
seeks to ensure that only “behaviour which comports with contemporary society’s
norms and values will attract the law’s compassion”:  R. v. Tran, 2010
SCC 58, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 350, at para. 30.  The particular circumstances in
which the accused finds himself are relevant in determining the appropriate
standard of human behaviour against which to measure the accused’s conduct: Tran,
at para. 34.  Pappas had engaged in tax evasion that Kullman was threatening to
reveal to the Canada Revenue Agency.  He did not go to the police with respect
to Kullman’s extortion or threats.  Rather, he armed himself and attempted to dissuade
Kullman in person.  Arguably, this behaviour runs contrary to the ordinary
person standard.

[33]                         
Nevertheless, as discussed in the companion case
Cairney, what would suffice to cause an ordinary person to lose
self-control is a question of degree that the jury is well placed to decide,
and one which, in cases of doubt, should be left to the jury.  The nature of
Kullman’s comments — a perceived threat against the safety of Pappas’ mother —
and the history of the relations between Kullman and Pappas, provide a minimal
evidential foundation for the objective element of the defence.

(3) The Subjective Element

[34]                         
In my view, there was no air of reality to the
subjective element of the defence of provocation.  The subjective element is
two-fold: “. . . (1) the accused must have acted in response to the
provocation; and (2) on the sudden before there was time for his or her passion
to cool”:  Tran, at para. 36.  

[35]                         
Of particular relevance to this appeal is the
requirement of “suddenness”.  The defence of provocation does not apply to
killings that are purely the result of vengeance or of anger, without any
attendant loss of self-control:  Tran, at para. 38; R. v. Parent,
2001 SCC 30, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 761, at para. 10.  To determine whether there was
an actual loss of self-control, the common law has long asked whether the
accused acted “on the sudden”.  The requirement of suddenness has two
dimensions: (i) the wrongful act or insult must be sudden, in that the accused
is subjectively unprepared for it and is caught by surprise, and (ii) the
accused must kill “on the sudden”, before there is time for his passion to cool:
Tran, at para. 38; R. v. Tripodi, [1955] S.C.R. 438, at p. 443.

[36]                         
In my view, the trial judge committed an error of law by only
considering one of the two dimensions of “suddenness”.  She considered whether
there was evidence to support the contention that Pappas had killed Kullman
suddenly, before there was time for his passion to cool.  Indeed, the trial
judge reasoned that there was an air of reality to the subjective element on
the following basis:

Mr. Pappas did say that it was the
word “insurance” that set him off, and he reacted immediately to that.  It is not up to me to weigh the sufficiency of that evidence.  I
am satisfied that there is an air of reality to the defence.  [Emphasis added;
A.R., vol. I, at p. 5.]

However, she did not examine
whether the record could support a finding that Kullman’s provoking comments
were sudden, in the sense that Pappas was subjectively caught unprepared and
surprised by them.  This is an error of law, as “suddenness applies to
both the act of provocation and the accused’s reaction to it”: Tran, at
para. 38.  

[37]                         
The record cannot reasonably support an inference that Pappas was
caught unprepared by Kullman’s statement that he would continue the extortion
and that he had “great fucking insurance”.  Kullman had made similar statements
repeatedly in the past.  Viewed in its totality, the evidence suggests that
before setting out to visit Kullman, Pappas contemplated the possibility that
Kullman would persist with his extortion and threats, and that, in that case,
he would need to kill Kullman to end them.

[38]                         
The principal narrative of Pappas’ confession is that he had
resolved to put an end to the extortion and to the threats against his mother,
through whatever means necessary.  He brought a gun loaded with hollow point
bullets to his encounter with Kullman.  When asked why he chose these bullets,
he explained:

If you want to stop someone you use a
hollow point. You don’t use a regular ball round ‘cause that goes through them.
It doesn’t do any kind of damage. . . . It wasn’t supposed to be like that but
it kept building up. So, I bought them.  [A.R., vol. II, at p. 262]

[39]                         
 At several points in his confession, Pappas referenced his
decision to do whatever was necessary to end the extortion and the threats to
his mother.  He described that he felt that the threats left him with little
choice other than to confront Kullman:

You can’t imagine what it feels like
being put in [a] corner and then having to choose.  I didn’t wanna hurt him. I
didn’t care about me but it was my mom.  What was I supposed to? [sic]
He gave me no choice when he sent his friends — when he sent his friends
there.  He gave me no choice after that.  I started — I made — I made my
decision.  [A.R., vol. II, at p. 255]

He described how the ongoing extortion and threats
led him to make the “choice”, and how “[a]fter 18 months [of extortion] it
became very simple” — “[i]t was either [Kullman] or my mom”: A.R., vol. II, at
p. 259-61.  He went on to explain how, when he was standing outside the door to
Kullman’s condominium, he flashed back to the moment when Kullman’s associates
visited his mother.  He said, “So, as soon as that image crossed my mind that’s
it, ‘Gun’s staying with me’. . . . [Kullman] made his choice, I made mine right
there”: A.R., vol. II, at p. 294.  He described in detail how Kullman’s
repeated refusals to put an end to the extortion gradually made it clear he
would have to resort to using the gun he had brought:

We just started talking about things and I was
trying to tell him — I was trying to literally put my foot down right there,
trying to draw the line right there. . . . And, ah, he’s going, “Well, like I
say, you know, I mean I’ve got really good insurance”, you know? “And I’ve got
a good pay day coming up”, you know? . . . or so and he had good insurance. And
it just, you know, I’m trying to talk him out of it or so. It’s like I’m trying
to, you know, “Don’t go there, Brian.  Come on, man. Don’t go there”, because I
had something here on my hip . . . and I’m trying to do everything I can to
keep — to steer Brian away from that . . . .

 

. . .

 

I mean literally every time he would open his
goddamned mouth he would take one step closer to making me do what I had to do
and I didn’t want to go there.  [Emphasis added; A.R., vol. II, at pp. 299
and 302.]

[40]                         
The only passages in Pappas’ confession that
support a loss of self-control are the ones in which he describes his reaction
upon hearing Kullman once again make reference to the fact that he had
“insurance”:

It — it was just the way he said it. It
was just the way he said the word “insurance”. I knew what that meant. . . .
[A]fter that it was just my mind shut down and everything was just automatic. I
drew my gun, I chambered a round, I fired.  [A.R., vol. II, at p. 303]

At this point, Pappas said that he
“snapped”.  

[41]                         
 The contention that Pappas was caught
unprepared by Kullman’s comments is outside the range of reasonable inferences
that can be drawn from this evidence.  It is supported by little more than
Pappas’ bald assertions that he “snapped” and “everything was just automatic”.  Viewed in its totality, the evidence suggests that Pappas’ mind
was prepared for the possibility that Kullman might reject his pleas to end the
extortion, “making [him] do what [he] had to do”.  His narrative, viewed as a
whole, describes a progressive building up of the resolve to kill Kullman. 
Accepting Pappas’ evidence that he “snapped” as true, this was not the result
of a sudden insult striking an unprepared mind.  It was simply the final stage
of doing what he had come to do — killing Kullman if that was necessary to stop
the extortion and threats.

[42]                         
For these reasons, I conclude that there was no
air of reality to the subjective element of the defence of provocation on the
evidence.  The defence should not have been left to the jury.  Any errors in
the trial judge’s instructions to the jury regarding provocation were thus
irrelevant, and I need not examine the appellant’s other grounds of appeal.

IV.  Conclusion

[43]                         
I would dismiss the appeal and affirm the
conviction for second degree murder.

                    The following are the reasons
delivered by

                    Fish J. — 

I

[44]                         
Like the Chief Justice, but for different
reasons, I would dismiss this appeal and affirm the appellant’s conviction at
trial. 

[45]                         
Unlike the Chief Justice, however, and with the
greatest of respect, I agree with the Court of Appeal’s unanimous conclusion
that the trial judge did not err in leaving to the jury the appellant’s defence
of provocation (2012 ABCA 221, 533 A.R. 294).  

[46]                         
The Court of Appeal divided only as to the
adequacy of the trial judge’s charge to the jury.  In this regard, I agree with
the majority that the trial judge committed no reviewable error in instructing
the jury as she did.

[47]                         
In the result, the appeal fails.

II

[48]                         
There is no dispute that trial judges must leave
for the jury’s consideration every defence available on the record, subject
only to exceptional circumstances which have no application here.  To do
otherwise is to usurp the function of the jury and to deprive the accused of an
enshrined right under our system of justice.  

[49]                         
This is not new law.  In Henderson v. The
King, [1948] S.C.R. 226, for example, Kellock J. recognized that “[i]t is a
paramount principle of law that when a defence, however weak it may be, is
raised by a person charged, it should be fairly put before the jury” (p. 241;
see also Taschereau J., at p. 237).   

[50]                         
For some offences, the accused may choose trial
by jury; for others, as in this case, trial by jury is mandatory.  In either
instance, absent a directed verdict of acquittal, the determination of guilt or
innocence falls exclusively within the province of the jury.  That bedrock
principle is violated whenever a trial judge withholds from the jury a defence
that it is entitled — indeed, required by law — to consider. 

[51]                         
This case hardly invites concern over the
submission of weak defences to juries.  On the contrary, it illustrates why our
system of justice supposes that juries, properly instructed by judges, can be
trusted to reject defences that do not raise in their minds a reasonable doubt
as to the guilt of the accused.  That is what happened here.  The trial judge
felt bound to put to the jury the appellant’s defence of provocation — though
she found, understandably, that the evidence in support of the defence was “not
strong”.  And the jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably, rejected the
defence. 

[52]                         
In determining whether a defence must be
submitted to the jury, trial judges must take care not to infuse what has come
to be known as the “air of reality” test with any significance beyond the
governing standard that has prevailed for centuries.  That standard, though not
always formulated in identical terms, has never varied in substance:  A defence
must be put to the jury if there is any evidence upon which a properly
instructed jury, acting reasonably, could be left with a reasonable doubt as to
the guilt of the accused.  

[53]                         
The phrase “air of reality” connotes neither
plausibility nor likelihood.  The “air of reality test [is not] intended to
assess whether the defence is likely, unlikely, somewhat likely, or very likely
to succeed at the end of the day”:  R. v. Buzizi, 2013 SCC 27, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 248, at para. 16, citing R.
v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 54.  Moreover, in
determining whether to leave a defence to the jury, the trial judge assumes
that the evidence relied upon by the accused is true:  R. v. Fontaine,
2004 SCC 27, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 702, at para. 72; Cinous, at para. 53.  

[54]                         
The trial judge is not permitted to make
determinations about the credibility of witnesses, weigh the evidence, make
findings of fact, or draw determinate factual inferences:  R. v. Gauthier,
2013 SCC 32, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 403, at para. 25; Fontaine, at para. 72; Cinous, at para.
54.  Indeed, the “air of reality” test has been found by this Court to be
“reasonable” and “valid” precisely because the trial judge does not
weigh the evidence and thus “cannot be accused of usurping the role of the
jury or violating the accused’s rights”:  R. v. Osolin, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at p. 691.

[55]                         
In the present
context, I find particularly apt this passage from the concurring reasons of
Sopinka J. in Osolin, at pp. 653-54:  

With respect
to the defence of mistaken belief, I agree with Cory J. that s. 265(4) “simply
sets out the basic requirements which are applicable to all defences” (p. 676)
and that it requires no more of the accused than the discharge of an
evidentiary burden to adduce or point to some evidence on the basis of which a
reasonable jury properly instructed could acquit.  I believe we are all in
agreement in this respect.  Indeed, this is the basis for our determination
that it is constitutional.  The term “evidentiary burden” and the definition I
have set out are well known to trial judges and well accepted.  I cannot
understand how the addition of the term “air of reality” helps in understanding
the duty of a trial judge with respect to this defence.  I am concerned that
when an attempt is made to add to the definition of a basic concept in the
criminal law, it only creates confusion.

[56]                         
While the Court has recognized that a “limited
weighing” of the evidence will be permitted, exceptionally, where the evidence
relied on by the accused is circumstantial, no weighing is permitted with
respect to direct evidence.  As the Chief Justice explains, “[t]he trial judge
may not engage in any weighing of direct evidence, since this would require a
consideration of the inherent reliability of the evidence” (para. 23).  

[57]                         
Accordingly, where there is direct evidence as
to all elements of a defence, the trial judge must put the defence to the jury
since, “[b]y definition, the only conclusion that needs to be reached in such a
case is whether the evidence is true” (Cinous, at para. 88).  And
whether the evidence is true, or at least raises a reasonable doubt as to the
guilt of the accused, is a matter ultimately reserved to the jury.  

[58]                         
In this case, the appellant’s evidence at trial
constitutes direct evidence and relates the facts upon which his defence of
provocation rests.  Where an accused gives evidence as to all the elements of
the defence, as the appellant did in this case, the trial judge is bound to
leave the assessment of that evidence to the jury:  R. v. Faid, [1983] 1
S.C.R. 265, at p. 276.

[59]                         
According to the Chief Justice, “[t]he air of reality test . . . requires more
than ‘some’ or ‘any’ evidence of the elements of a defence” (para. 22 (emphasis
added)).  In my respectful view, one should not impute to this passage a
meaning that it cannot have been intended to bear.  

[60]                         
As the Court made plain
in Cinous:

The full question is whether there is
evidence (some evidence, any evidence) upon which a properly instructed jury
acting judicially could acquit.  If there is any or some such
evidence, then the air of reality hurdle is cleared.  If there is no
such evidence, then the air of reality hurdle is not cleared. [Emphasis in
original; para. 62.]

And, leaving no room for
doubt in this regard, the Court later reiterated “the full question, which is
whether there is evidence (some evidence, any evidence) on the basis of
which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could base an acquittal if
it believed the evidence to be true” (para. 83 (emphasis added)).

[61]                         
I recognize that the Court, in R. v. Mayuran,
2012 SCC 31, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 162, at para. 21, stated that “[i]t is not enough
for there to be ‘some evidence’ supporting the defence (Cinous, at para.
83).”  This passage must be read in line with established authority, including
the paragraph in Cinous to which it refers.  As appears from that very
paragraph, the Court has consistently held that the decisive question is
whether there is evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could
reasonably acquit:  Fontaine, at para. 71; Cinous, at para.
83; R. v. Thibert, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 37, at para. 7; Faid,
at p. 276; Parnerkar v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 449, at p. 454. 

[62]                         
These principles are well settled.  They align
with the trust our criminal justice system places in the collective good sense
of juries.  And, they breathe life into the accused’s Charter  rights to
be presumed innocent (s. 11 (d)) and to have the benefit of a jury trial
where the maximum punishment for the alleged offence is at least five years
imprisonment (s. 11 (f)).

III

[63]                         
I turn now to the application of these
principles to the facts of this case.

[64]                         
I agree with the Chief Justice that the
appellant discharged his evidentiary burden on the objective component
of his defence of provocation.  In my respectful view, he met his evidentiary
obligation on the subjective component as well.  

[65]                         
The subjective component (or “element”) of the
defence of provocation requires that the accused acted (1) in response
to the provocative act or conduct; and (2) on the sudden before there was time
for his or her passion to cool:  Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , s. 232 ; see also R. v. Tran, 2010 SCC
58, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 350, at
para. 36.  The Chief Justice emphasizes that the second, “suddenness” portion
of the inquiry applies to both the provocation itself and the accused’s
reaction to it (para. 36).  In her opinion, there is no evidentiary basis upon
which a jury could reasonably conclude that the wrongful provocation was
sudden, in the sense that it surprised Mr. Pappas by catching his mind
unprepared.

[66]                         
The appellant’s evidence was that the deceased
had been extorting him for 18 months leading up to the killing (A.R., vol. II,
at p. 238).  When Mr. Pappas resisted, the deceased implied that he was
prepared to have Mr. Pappas’s mother killed (p. 239).  On the night in
question, the appellant did carry a concealed weapon.  He testified, however,
that he did not intend to use it (pp. 242, 245 and 292-93).  The deceased
responded to Mr. Pappas’s overtures by again implicitly threatening to kill his
mother (p. 303).  At this point, according to Mr. Pappas, his “mind shut down
and everything was just automatic. I drew my gun, I chambered a round, I fired”
(p. 304).

[67]                         
The sudden and unexpected nature of the
deceased’s provocative act emerges from the timeline of events on the night of
the killing.  Describing the deceased’s offer to give him money for a plane
ticket, and the deceased’s subsequent veiled threat to kill his mother, Mr.
Pappas testified:

He does me a favour from his point of
view one minute . . . and then the next minute he just told me what’s going to
happen . . . if I don’t get back and [indiscernible]
his fucking expensive toys. [A.R., vol. II, at p. 244]

[68]                         
Accepting this evidence as true, Mr. Pappas
plainly acted “on the sudden” — he “didn’t think about it” (A.R., vol. II, at
p. 241), but reacted immediately to the deceased’s provocation before there was
time for his passion to cool.  Indeed, the Chief Justice accepts that this
satisfies one dimension of the subjective “suddenness” inquiry.

[69]                         
According to the Chief Justice, however, the
record cannot support a finding that the provocation itself was sudden
because the deceased “had made similar statements repeatedly in the past”
(para. 37).

[70]                         
In R. v. Cairney, 2013 SCC 55, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 420, Justice Abella
addresses the manifest difficulties presented by a “predictability of
consequences” approach with regard to the objective element of provocation. 
The same holds true for the subjective element — the mere fact that the
deceased had made similar threats to the accused in the past does not mean that
the accused would have anticipated, or been prepared for, subsequent threats of
the same sort.  Plainly, a reiterated threat or insult can cause a previously
unprovoked person to “snap”.

[71]                         
The Court explicitly addressed this very
possibility in Thibert.  In considering whether a provocation is
“sudden” in the sense that it strikes upon a mind unprepared for it, the Court
held that

the background and history of
the relationship between the accused and the deceased should be taken into
consideration.  This is particularly appropriate if it reveals a long history
of insults, leveled at the accused by the deceased. . . . “[T]he last affront
may be comparatively trivial, merely the last straw that makes the worm turn,
so to speak”.  [para. 20]

 

(Citing
G. Williams, Textbook of Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1983).)

[72]                         
In this regard, the Chief Justice focuses on
whether Mr. Pappas’s “mind was prepared for the possibility that Kullman might
reject his pleas to end the extortion” (para. 41).  With respect, however, the
alleged provocative act was not the deceased’s failure to end the
extortion; rather, it was his sudden utterance — “I got great fucking
insurance” — which Mr. Pappas understood as a threat to his mother’s life
(A.R., vol. II, at p. 241).  This is amply supported by Mr. Pappas’s evidence
that he shot the deceased in order to protect his mother (A.R., vol. II, at pp.
240-42, 247 and 254-55).

[73]                         
Nor am I able to share the Chief Justice’s
characterization as “little more than . . . bald assertions” the appellant’s
evidence that he was unprepared for the deceased’s comments (para. 41).  

[74]                         
In Osolin, this Court affirmed that, in
order for a defence to be put to the jury, there must be “evidence beyond [a]
mere assertion” of the elements of the defence (pp. 686-87).  Using the defence
of provocation as an example, the Court held that while a “bare assertion” by
the accused — “I was provoked” — would not suffice, the “requisite evidence may
come from the detailed testimony of the accused alone” (p. 687 (emphasis
added)).

[75]                         
Read in this light, Mr. Pappas’s detailed
evidence of the circumstances surrounding the alleged provocation, including
his perceptions and explanations for his actions, can hardly be equated with a
“bare assertion” that he was provoked. 

[76]                         
Neither can Mr. Pappas’s description of the
provoking act be considered a single statement that is inconsistent with his
“principal narrative”:  Gauthier, at para. 61, cited by the Chief
Justice, at para. 24.  

[77]                         
I agree with the Chief Justice that the “only
passages in [Mr.] Pappas’ confession that support a loss of self-control are
the ones in which he describes his reaction upon hearing Kullman once again
make reference to the fact that [Kullman] had ‘insurance’” (para. 40).  These
descriptions constitute direct evidence of the suddenness of the provocation
and must be taken as true.  As such, they demonstrate that the appellant
discharged his evidentiary burden on the “sudden provocation” element of the
defence.

[78]                         
Whether these passages are “inconsistent” with
other evidence, however, necessarily requires a weighing of the evidence and an
assessment of its reliability.  That determination must properly be left to the
jury.  And the trial judge’s decision whether to leave the defence to the jury
must, in any event, be based on “the construction of the evidence most favourable
to the accused’s position” (Cinous, at para. 98).  The trial judge in
this case therefore committed no error in finding that Mr. Pappas’s evidence —
if accepted as true in whole or in part — was capable of supporting the
inference that the deceased’s comments constituted a sudden and unexpected act
of provocation.

IV

[79]                         
For the foregoing reasons, I am unable to agree
with the Chief Justice that the trial judge committed a reviewable error in
leaving the appellant’s defence of provocation to the jury.  As mentioned at
the outset as well, I would nevertheless dismiss the appeal for the reasons of
the majority in the Court of Appeal.

                    Criminal
law — Defences — Provocation — Self‑induced provocation — Whether fact
that accused induced act or words said to constitute provocation precludes defence
of provocation from being left to jury — Whether objective and subjective elements
of provocation established, lending an air of reality to this defence — Whether
defence of provocation should have been submitted to jury — Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 , s. 232 .

                    C
shot and killed his long‑time friend F.  At the time, C was living with F
and R, who was C’s cousin and F’s common law spouse.  F had a history of
physically abusing R.  On the day in question, F was drinking, became angry
with R and started to verbally abuse her.  C overheard F tell R that if her
back had not been sore, he would have thrown her across the kitchen.  At F’s
request, C left the room.  He retrieved a loaded shotgun.  Disturbed by the
argument that he was overhearing, C sat in another room, contemplating what to
do.  He decided to scare F to teach him a lesson and deter future aggression
against R.  He walked up to F, who was talking on the telephone and struck the
phone with the muzzle of the shotgun.  He then began to lecture F on his abuse
of R.  F reacted by saying, “What are you gonna do, shoot me? You don’t have
the guts to shoot me.”  F then started to leave the apartment.  When C called
out to F to “get back here”, F said: “Fuck you, you goof.  This is none of your
business, I’ll do with [R] whatever I want.”  F then walked out of the
apartment.  C followed him into the stairwell, where he shot F, killing him.  C
was charged with second degree murder and tried before a jury.  He argued that
he lacked the necessary intention to be guilty of murder, and in the
alternative that he had been provoked by F’s words to him.  The trial judge,
apparently concluding that there was some evidence to support all the elements
of the defence of provocation, charged the jury on that defence.  The jury
acquitted C of second degree murder and convicted him of manslaughter.  The
Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal and ordered a new trial.

                    Held
(Fish and Abella JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and Rothstein, Cromwell, Moldaver and Wagner JJ.:  The
trial judge erred in leaving the defence of provocation with the jury as there
was no air of reality to the defence.

                    The
air of reality test is intended to assess whether a properly instructed jury
acting reasonably could have a reasonable doubt as to whether the subjective
and objective elements of the defence of provocation are made out.  The
objective element of the defence of provocation asks whether there was some
evidence upon which a jury could have a reasonable doubt that an ordinary
person in C’s circumstances — which include having initiated a confrontation at
gunpoint — would be deprived of the power of self‑control by F’s
insults.  The history and background of the relationship between the victim and
the accused is relevant and pertinent to the “ordinary person” test, as are all
factors that would give the act or insult special significance to an ordinary
person.  However, that does not change the fact that a certain threshold level
of self‑control is always expected of the “ordinary person”.

                    While
the cases on self‑induced provocation do not always distinguish between
the objective and subjective elements of the defence, read generally they
confirm that the accused’s conduct may be relevant to both elements of the
defence and that it must be considered with other contextual factors to
determine whether there is an air of reality to the defence.  Self‑induced
provocation is not a special category of the defence attracting special
principles.  Rather, it describes a particular application of the general
principles that govern the defence of provocation.  There is no absolute rule
that a person who instigates a confrontation cannot rely on the defence of
provocation.  The fact that the victim’s response to the accused’s
confrontational conduct fell within a range of reasonably predictable reactions
may suggest that an ordinary person would not have lost self‑control,
although it must be weighed together with all other relevant contextual
factors.  As in all cases where the defence is raised, whether it goes to the
jury depends on whether the evidence provides an air of reality to it.

                    In
this case, there was evidence sufficient to support the subjective element —
that C in fact acted in response to the provocation before his passion had time
to cool.  However, there was no air of reality to the objective element of the
defence.  C argues that F’s words constituted a threat of imminent domestic
abuse sufficient to cause an ordinary person to lose self‑control.  However,
F was no longer behaving aggressively towards R when C approached.  His moment
of anger against R had passed.  The record simply does not support the
contention that an ordinary person would have viewed the victim’s words as a
threat of imminent domestic violence against R, leading to a loss of self‑control.

                    What
is left is a concern on C’s part to prevent future abuse against R and C’s
declared intention to achieve this by extracting a promise at gunpoint from F
to stop abusing her.  An ordinary person who seeks to extract a promise at
gunpoint would not be surprised if the person confronted rebuffs the overture
as did F here.  There is nothing on the record to support the element of sudden
shock required to cause an ordinary person to lose self‑control.  It
follows that a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could not have had a
reasonable doubt about whether F’s conduct was sufficient to deprive an
ordinary person of self‑control.

                    Per Fish and Abella JJ.
(dissenting):  The trial judge must determine whether the evidence is
reasonably capable of supporting the inferences necessary to make out the defence
of provocation.  In relation to the objective element, the judge must determine
whether there is evidence that could raise a reasonable doubt about whether the
accused was faced with a wrongful act or insult sufficient to deprive an
ordinary person of self‑control.  To determine how the “ordinary” person
would react to a particular insult, it is necessary to take the relevant
context and circumstances into account, including the history and background of
any relationship between the victim and the accused.  The assessment of the
evidence relevant to the objective element should not be skewed by placing
predominant emphasis on the aggressive conduct of the accused at the
determinative expense of the whole context.

                    F’s
words and the reaction they would elicit from an ordinary person cannot be
appreciated without considering the whole context, and, in particular, the
history of the relationship between C and F.  F and C were close friends.  The
only source of conflict between them was F’s long history of domestic violence
against R, C’s cousin whom he thought of as his “little sister”.  F had been
attacking R for over a decade. The assaults were frequent — often weekly.  They
were also severe.  C knew all about the assaults since R had repeatedly taken refuge
with C and his wife, and R was sometimes so badly injured that she was unable
to go to work.

                    Removing
the defence of provocation from the jury turns on the characterization that C
initiated an “aggressive confrontation”.  On another view of these facts,
however, F initiated the confrontation when he started verbally abusing and
threatening C’s cousin — acts that could, in light of F’s history of relentless
domestic abuse, readily and reasonably be interpreted as a prelude to another
brutal assault.  A jury might well conclude that the objective element of
provocation was met based on a credible threat that F would again abuse C’s
cousin, R.

                    While
F’s dismissive attitude towards C might have been predictable, a jury
could infer from the full context of this case that an ordinary person would
not predict F’s response that he would keep beating R if he felt like
it.  The objective element of the defence of provocation should be informed by
contemporary norms, including Charter values.  These do not include
aggressively proprietary attitudes about a spouse.  It is therefore troubling
to conclude, as the majority does, that it was “predictable” for F to react to
C’s warning by confirming his intention to continue inflicting domestic
violence.  It is difficult to accept that an expressed intention to continue
assaulting a spouse could ever be considered “predictable”.

                    The
trial judge’s decision to leave the provocation defence with the jury was
therefore proper.

                    The judgment of McLachlin C.J.
and Rothstein, Cromwell, Moldaver and Wagner JJ. was delivered by

                    The Chief justice — 

I.    Background

[1]                             
The law has long recognized that murder may be
reduced to manslaughter if the deceased provoked the attack by a wrongful act
or insult, causing the accused to act in the heat of passion.  This is called
the partial defence of provocation.

[2]                             
But what happens if the act of provocation by
the deceased was in response to an aggressive confrontation initiated by the
accused?  That is the problem at the heart of this case — sometimes referred to
as the problem of self-induced provocation.

A.  The Facts

[3]                             
The accused, Michael John Cairney, shot and
killed his long-time friend Stephen Ferguson.  At the time, Cairney was living
with Ferguson and Frances Rosenthal, who was Cairney’s cousin and the common
law spouse of Ferguson.  Ferguson had a history of drinking and physically
abusing Rosenthal.

[4]                             
On the day in question, Ferguson, who had been
drinking, became angry with Rosenthal because she had put a roast in the oven
that he wanted to cook himself.  Ferguson started to verbally abuse Rosenthal. 
Cairney overherd Ferguson tell Rosenthal that if her back had not been sore, he
would have thrown her across the kitchen.

[5]                             
At Ferguson’s insistence and Rosenthal’s
request, Cairney left the room. He retrieved a loaded shotgun from a duffle bag
in the closet.  Disturbed by the argument that he was overhearing, he sat in
the bathroom for five to ten minutes, contemplating what to do.  He decided to
scare Ferguson using the shotgun in order to teach him a lesson and deter
future aggression against Rosenthal.  He walked up to Ferguson, who was having
a conversation on the telephone, and smashed the phone with the muzzle of the
shotgun.  He then began to lecture Ferguson on his abuse of Rosenthal.

[6]                             
Ferguson reacted by saying, “What are you gonna
do, shoot me? You don’t have the guts to shoot me.” He then started to leave
the apartment. Cairney called out to Ferguson, “Get back here, I want to talk
to you.” At this point, Ferguson said the words relied on by the defence as
provocation, “Fuck you, you goof. This is none of your business, I’ll do with
Fran whatever I want”: A.R., vol. II, at p. 384. He then walked out of the
apartment.  Cairney followed him out of the apartment and to the stairwell.  He
shot Ferguson in the stairwell, killing him.

B.  The Trial

[7]                             
Cairney was charged with second degree murder
and tried before a jury.  He argued that he lacked the necessary intention to
be guilty of murder, and in the alternative that he had been provoked by
Ferguson’s words to him.

[8]                             
The Crown objected to the defence of provocation
going to the jury, maintaining that the defence had no air of reality in the
circumstances. After several exchanges with counsel, the trial judge inquired:

And so the
issue for me is whether there’s some evidence on each of the four questions,
the four components of provocation. And I can’t weigh that evidence.  I just
have to — if there is any evidence, then the issue has to be left to the jury.
[A.R., vol. I, at p. 129]

[9]                             
The trial judge then held that since there was
no evidence that Cairney had set Ferguson up deliberately to be able to advance
a provocation defence, she would leave the defence to the jury:

There’s
nothing in the evidence to suggest that Mr. Cairney planned in advance to
murder Mr. Ferguson and to set him up so that he would be in a position to
advance a provocation defence to turn murder into manslaughter; therefore, I
will allow provocation to go to the jury. [A.R., vol. I, at p. 151]

[10]                         
The trial judge, apparently concluding that
there was some evidence to support all the elements of the defence of
provocation, charged the jury on that defence.  The jury acquitted Cairney of
second degree murder and convicted him of manslaughter.

C.  The Court of Appeal

[11]                         
The Crown appealed the acquittal on second
degree murder, arguing, among other things, that there was no air of reality to
the defence of provocation.  The Alberta Court of Appeal agreed and ordered a
new trial: 2011 ABCA 272, 513 A.R. 345.

[12]                         
The Court of Appeal reviewed the test for
provocation, which consists of an objective element (that the act or insult was
of a nature to deprive an ordinary person of self-control) and of a subjective
element (that it actually deprived the accused of self-control), and concluded
that the objective element was not met.  Ferguson’s dismissive behaviour and
insulting remarks were not enough to provoke a loss of control in an ordinary
person:

Measured by an objective standard, and with concerns for the
encouragement of reasonable and non-violent behaviour, we are satisfied that
the victim’s oral retorts to Cairney’s threats of violence were not of
sufficient gravity to cause a loss of control.  Having initiated the unlawful
confrontation which led to Ferguson’s retorts, Cairney ought reasonably to have
understood that his conduct would elicit such a reaction on the victim’s part. 
Cairney had no reason to anticipate docile acquiescence from Ferguson in the
circumstances.  The reaction was foreseeable and, in any event, not of sufficient
gravity to provoke a murderous response. [para. 45]

[13]                         
The Court of Appeal also found that the
subjective element was not satisfied.  Cairney had not acted “suddenly”: para.
47.  He may have been angry that Ferguson had dismissed him so casually, but
the ensuing act of shooting Ferguson in the stairwell was not committed in the
heat of uncontrollable passion, in its view.

[14]                         
Since neither element was met, the trial judge
erred in leaving the defence of provocation to the jury.  The Court of Appeal
acknowledged the trial judge’s conclusion that the defence of provocation was
only one of the routes by which the jury could have reduced murder to
manslaughter; it could also have done so because it did not find intent to
kill.  It was impossible to know what factors entered into the mind of each of
the jurors.  It followed that the instruction with respect to provocation may
reasonably be viewed as having a material bearing on the deliberations of the
jurors and the jury’s verdict, and a new trial should be ordered.

D.  Legislation

[15]                         
Section 232  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1985, c. C-46 , provides:

232. (1) Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced
to manslaughter if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion
caused by sudden provocation.

 

(2)
A wrongful act or an insult that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control is provocation for the purposes of this section if the
accused acted on it on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to
cool.

 

(3)
For the purposes of this section, the questions

 

(a)
whether a particular wrongful act or insult amounted to provocation, and

 

(b)
whether the accused was deprived of the power of self-control by the
provocation that he alleges he received,

 

are questions of fact, but no
one shall be deemed to have given provocation to another by doing anything that
he had a legal right to do, or by doing anything that the accused incited him
to do in order to provide the accused with an excuse for causing death or
bodily harm to any human being.

 

(4) Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder is not
necessarily manslaughter by reason only that it was committed by a person who
was being arrested illegally, but the fact that the illegality of the arrest
was known to the accused may be evidence of provocation for the purpose of this
section.

II.  Discussion

[16]                         
The appellant says that the defence of
provocation had an air of reality on the evidence and that the trial judge
correctly left it to the jury. The Court of Appeal wrongly interfered with the
jury’s acquittal on murder, he asserts.

[17]                         
While the arguments are variously stated, the
case presents one basic issue: What is required to give an air of reality to
the defence of provocation where the provocative conduct of the deceased came
about as a result of the accused initiating an aggressive confrontation?

[18]                         
This in turn raises two questions.  First, when
must the defence be submitted to the jury? This is the threshold air of reality
question.  Second, does the fact that the accused induced the act or words said
to constitute provocation preclude the defence from being raised successfully?

A.  When Must the Defence Be
Submitted to the Jury — The “Air of Reality” Question

[19]                         
The trial judge appears to have acted on the
view that, provided there was any evidence supporting the elements of
the defence of provocation, she was required to leave the defence to the jury.

[20]                         
The Court of Appeal, by contrast, conducted a
detailed examination of the evidence that went into the merits of the defence.

[21]                         
Neither of these approaches is strictly correct.
“[T]he air of reality test [is not] intended to assess whether the defence is
likely, unlikely, somewhat likely, or very likely to succeed at the end of the
day”: R. v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 54, quoted
by Fish J. in R. v. Buzizi, 2013 SCC 27, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 248, at para.
16.  The question is whether a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could
have a reasonable doubt as to whether the elements of the defence of
provocation are made out: R. v. Tran, 2010 SCC 58, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 350,
at para. 41; R. v. Mayuran, 2012 SCC 31, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 162, at para.
21.  The trial judge may engage in a limited weighing of the totality of the
evidence to determine if a jury acting reasonably on that evidence could draw
the inferences necessary to have a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused
is guilty of murder, on the basis of the defence of provocation; see the
companion case R. v. Pappas, 2013 SCC 56, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 452. This
Court, per Abella J., described the appropriate approach to the air of
reality test in Mayuran:

In
determining whether a defence has an air of reality, there must be an
examination into the sufficiency of the evidence. It is not enough for there to
be “some evidence” supporting the defence (Cinous, at para. 83). The
test is “whether there is (1) evidence (2) upon which a properly instructed
jury acting reasonably could acquit if it believed the evidence to be true” (Cinous,
at para. 65). For defences that rely on indirect evidence or defences like
provocation that include an objective reasonableness component, the trial judge
must examine the “field of factual inferences” that can reasonably be drawn
from the evidence (Cinous, at para. 91). [para. 21]

[22]                         
If this air of reality test is met, the judge
should leave the defence to the jury.  While judges must ensure that there is
an evidential foundation for the defence, they should resolve any doubts as to
whether the air of reality threshold is met in favour of leaving the defence to
the jury.

[23]                         
This appeal turns on the application of the air
of reality test to the objective element of the defence of provocation. As will
be discussed further below, one of the requirements of the defence is that an
ordinary person placed in the circumstances of the accused would have been
deprived of self-control. Thus, the question is whether there was some evidence
upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could have a reasonable
doubt that an ordinary person in Cairney’s circumstances — which
include having initiated a confrontation at gunpoint — would
be deprived of the power of self-control by Ferguson’s insults.

B.  The Elements of the Defence of
Provocation

          (1)   Historical Development of the Defence

[24]                         
At common law, as under s. 232  of the Criminal
Code , the defence of provocation consists of two elements — one subjective and one objective.

[25]                         
Historically, the first requirement was that the
accused have lost self-control as a result of the act or acts of the deceased. 
This was called the subjective element; the issue was simply whether the
accused in fact (i.e. subjectively) lost his self-control as a result of the
deceased’s acts.

[26]                         
The second requirement, which emerged
progressively as a means of limiting the availability of the defence, was that
the provoking act be capable of depriving a reasonable man (or ordinary person)
of his self-control.  This was called the objective element.

[27]                         
In the early cases, it was enough to establish
the subjective element. The defence originated in the 16th century concept of
“chance-medley” killings. These killings occurred “by chance (without
premeditation) upon a sudden brawle, shuffling, or contention”: E. Coke, The
Third Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England: Concerning High Treason,
and Other Pleas of the Crown, and Criminal Causes (1809, first published in
1644), at p. 57; G. Coss, “‘God is a righteous judge, strong and patient: and
God is provoked every day’. A Brief History of the Doctrine of Provocation in
England” (1991), 13 Sydney L. Rev. 570, at pp. 573-74.  They were not
premeditated and occurred in the heat of passion. They thus carried a lower
degree of moral culpability than premeditated, cold-blooded killings: Tran,
at para. 13.

[28]                         
However, the common law soon developed a means
of restraining the situations in which the defence was available. This
historical development was described in Tran:

. . .
the courts set out to create greater certainty by establishing specific
categories of “provocative events” that were considered “significant” enough to
result in a loss of self-control. In the seminal case, R. v. Mawgridge
(1707), Kel J. 119, 84 E.R. 1107, Lord Holt C.J. set out four categories of
provocation. [para. 15]

The use of limited categories in which the defence
was available reflected the belief that “people ought not to yield to
certain types of provocation, and that if they did the law should offer no
concession to them”: A. J. Ashworth, “The Doctrine of Provocation” (1976), 35 Cambridge
L.J. 292, at p. 295 (emphasis in original).

[29]                         
The use of categories as a means of limiting the availability of the
defence eventually gave way to a formal standard — individuals raising the defence were held to the
standard of self-control expected to be exercised by the “reasonable man”: R.
v. Welsh (1869), 11 Cox C.C. 336; Tran, at para. 16.

[30]                         
In addition, the common law precluded the defence from being raised
successfully in cases where the accused had intentionally sought a provocative
act in order to manufacture a pretense for killing: Mason’s Case (1756),
Fost. 132, 168 E.R. 66; A. J. Ashworth, “Self-Induced Provocation and the
Homicide Act”, [1973] Crim. L.R. 483, at pp. 484-85. For example, in Mason’s
Case, the accused lost a fight to his victim in a tavern. He thereafter
returned, wearing a concealed knife, and again challenged his victim to a
fight. The victim attempted to hit the accused, who pulled out his concealed
knife. The court held that the accused was not truly provoked by the victim’s
blows, but rather had sought out the provocation in order to have a pretense to
commit a murder.

[31]                         
In Canada, these common law approaches to restricting the availability
of the defence were both incorporated in the codification of the defence of
provocation: The Criminal Code, 1892, S.C. 1892, c. 29, s. 229. They
survive to this day. Section 232(2)  of the Criminal Code  contains the
common law’s objective requirement: only a wrongful act or an insult that is
“of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the
power of self-control” can constitute provocation. Section 232(3)  precludes
“manufactured” provocation from grounding the defence, by providing that “no
one shall be deemed to have given provocation to another . . . by doing
anything that the accused incited him to do in order to provide the accused
with an excuse for causing death or bodily harm to any human being”.

          (2)   The
Modern Defence of Provocation

[32]                         
The elements of the defence of provocation were described by this Court
in Tran.

[33]                         
First, there is a two-fold objective element: “. . . (1) there must be a
wrongful act or insult; and (2) the wrongful act or insult must be sufficient
to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control”: Tran, at para.
25.

[34]                         
Second, there is a two-fold subjective element: “. . . (1) the accused
must have acted in response to the provocation; and (2) on the sudden before
there was time for his or her passion to cool”: Tran, at para. 36.

[35]                         
The bulk of the argument by the parties centred on the ordinary person
requirement: Would an ordinary person lose self-control after having initiated
a confrontation at gunpoint?  Cairney argues that the ordinary person standard
must be contextualized to the circumstances of this appeal, taking into account
the fact that for years he had been a powerless witness to Ferguson’s physical
abuse of his cousin Rosenthal, whom he loved like a sister.  The Crown, on the
other hand, contends that no ordinary person would seek out a confrontation at
gunpoint, and thereafter be surprised and lose self-control when the person who
is being threatened reacts dismissively.

          (a)   The
Purpose of the Ordinary Person Standard

[36]                         
The “ordinary person” element of the defence of provocation is something
of a paradox. The ordinary person does not lose control and kill someone in the
first place. However, the defence of provocation recognizes human frailties
that can lead to violence. As Professor Renke writes:

The
reality is that individuals will, in (what should be) extreme circumstances,
respond to provocations with homicidal violence. For centuries, the courts have
consistently recognized the potential for violence in our hearts and have
explained the provocation excuse as a concession to our human frailty — not just the frailty of the accused, but our frailty.
[Emphasis in original.]

 

(“Calm
Like a Bomb: An Assessment of the Partial Defence of Provocation” (2009), 47 Alta.
L. Rev. 729, at p. 769)

[37]                         
The law seeks to recognize this human weakness,
without going so far as to condone socially unacceptable acts of violence. The
“ordinary person” element serves to ensure that only losses of self-control
which comport “with contemporary society’s norms and values will attract the
law’s compassion”: Tran, at para. 30. As this Court underscored in R.
v. Thibert, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 37, per Cory J., the “ordinary person”
element implicitly entails a balancing exercise:

.
. . I think the
objective element should be taken as an attempt to weigh in the balance those
very human frailties which sometimes lead people to act irrationally and
impulsively against the need to protect society by discouraging acts of
homicidal violence. [para. 4]

          (b)   Contextualizing the Ordinary Person Standard

[38]                         
The “ordinary person” requirement limits the
availability of the defence of provocation, in order “to ensure that the
criminal law encourages reasonable and responsible behaviour”: Thibert,
at para. 14. The downside of the “ordinary person” standard is that, if applied
rigidly and in the abstract, it runs the risk of rendering the defence
unavailable in virtually all situations. As discussed, the truly ordinary
person in Canadian society does not kill a person who insults him or her. In response
to the potential unfairness that could result from a purely abstract conception
of the “ordinary person”, this Court has held that the standard must be applied
in a contextual manner:

.
. . the ordinary person must be taken to be of the same age, and sex, and must
share with the accused such other factors as would give the act or insult in
question a special significance. In other words, all the relevant background
circumstances should be considered.

 

(Thibert,
at para. 14)

[39]                         
As the appellant emphasizes in his submissions, “the history and
background of the relationship between the victim and the accused is relevant
and pertinent to the ‘ordinary person’ test”: Thibert, at para. 17.
Indeed, all contextual factors that would give the act or insult special
significance to an ordinary person must be taken into account: Thibert,
at para. 18.

[40]                         
However, the consideration of background
circumstances that contribute to the significance that an ordinary person would
attribute to an act or insult does not change the fact that a certain threshold
level of self-control is always expected of the “ordinary person”. For example,
characteristics of the accused such as “a propensity to drunken rages or short
tempered violence” are not relevant to the ordinary person test: Thibert,
at para. 15.  Only factors which contribute to the significance of an act or insult
should be taken into account when contextualizing the standard: Ashworth, “The
Doctrine of Provocation”, at p. 300.  The standard should not be adapted to
accommodate a particular accused’s innate lack of self-control; as “there is an
important distinction between contextualizing the objective standard, which is
necessary and proper, and individualizing it, which only serves to defeat its
purpose”: Tran, at para. 35.  As Professor Renke underscores,
“[p]rovocation should be recognized only at that point where the ordinary
person’s control has been taken to its limit, and that limit has been passed”: p.
772.

[41]                         
By appropriately contextualizing the ordinary person standard, the law
on provocation strikes a balance between recognizing human frailties that lead
to outbursts of violence, on the one hand, and the need to protect society by
discouraging acts of homicidal violence, on the other: Thibert, at para.
4.

          (c)   Self-Induced
Provocation

[42]                         
Self-induced provocation refers to the situation where the accused initiates
or invites the act or insult he says provoked him.  It is not a special
category of the defence of provocation.  The fact that the accused initiated or
invited the provocation is simply a contextual factor in determining whether
the subjective and objective elements of the defence are met.

[43]                         
The subjective component of the defence requires that “[t]he wrongful
act or insult must itself be sudden, in the sense that it ‘must strike upon a
mind unprepared for it’”: Tran, at para. 38, citing R. v. Tripodi,
[1955] S.C.R. 438, at p. 443. The subjective component is not met where the
accused in fact subjectively expected the victim’s response and, as a result,
did not act on the sudden. Depending on the circumstances, where the accused
precipitated the provocation, there may be no basis in the evidence for any
reasonable doubt as to whether the accused acted on the sudden.

[44]                         
The objective component asks whether the provoking act would cause an
“ordinary person” to lose his self-control, having regard to all the relevant
circumstances.  Again, depending on the circumstances, where the accused
precipitated the victim’s wrongful act or insult by aggressively confronting
him or her, there may be no basis in the evidence for any doubt as to whether
that act or insult would cause an ordinary person to lose self-control. The
fact that the victim’s response to the accused’s confrontational conduct fell
within a range of reasonably predictable reactions may suggest that an ordinary
person would not have lost self-control, although it must be weighed together
with all other relevant contextual factors.

[45]                         
It has been suggested that “the defence [of provocation] will not be
available where the accused is prepared for an insult or initiates a
confrontation and receives a predictable response”:  M. Manning and P.
Sankoff, Manning, Mewett & Sankoff: Criminal Law (4th ed.
2009), at p. 770 (emphasis added); see also D. Stuart, Canadian Criminal
Law: A Treatise (6th ed. 2011), at p. 590; H. Parent, Traité de droit
criminel, t. 1, L’imputabilité (3rd ed. 2008), at pp. 734-35.  This
is best understood not as an absolute rule, but as the usual result of
application of appropriate contextual factors to the question of whether an
ordinary person would have lost control.

[46]                         
The matter is always one of context, and in cases of
doubt, the question of whether the accused’s confrontational conduct undermines
the defence should be left to the jury.   In the case of Edwards v. The
Queen, [1973] A.C. 648, in which it was alleged that the accused’s acts of
blackmail gave rise to the victim’s provocative conduct, Lord Pearson
acknowledged that “[o]n principle it seems reasonable to say that . . .  a
blackmailer cannot rely on the predictable results of his own blackmailing
conduct as constituting provocation sufficient to reduce his killing of the
victim from murder to manslaughter”: p. 658. However, he went on to hold that
whether the inciting act would have this effect is a matter of fact that “would
in many cases be a question of degree to be decided by the jury”: p. 658; see
also Ashworth, “Self-Induced Provocation and the Homicide Act”, at p. 486.

          (d)  The
Cases on Self-Induced Provocation

[47]                         
While the cases on self-induced provocation do not always distinguish
between the objective and subjective elements of the defence, read generally
they confirm that the accused’s conduct in inciting provocation may be relevant
to both elements of the defence, and that it must be considered with other contextual
factors to determine whether there is an air of reality to the defence.

[48]                         
The accused’s conduct in inciting the alleged provocation was held to
deprive the defence of any air of reality in Salamon v. The Queen,
[1959] S.C.R. 404.  The accused had quarreled with the deceased, Joyce
Alexander, at an acquaintance’s house. The accused then returned alone to his
house, and waited for the deceased to come home as well. When the deceased
arrived, the accused started a confrontation during which he assaulted the
deceased, threw dishes at her and called her “a dirty name”: p. 407.
Eventually, the deceased retaliated by also calling the accused a dirty name,
at which point the accused shot her. This Court held that the defence of
provocation should not have been put to the jury:

The
evidence shows that from the time Joyce Alexander entered her home to that of
the fatal shot, the appellant, and not she, took, and kept throughout, the
initiative of the events leading to her death. He was evidently waiting for her
arrival. He started the quarrel during which she retaliated. . . . 

 

On
this evidence, [the] appellant cannot justify or excuse his actions in saying
that he was facing a situation characterized with suddenness, unexpectedness or
lack of premonition.
. . . There was no sudden provocation on the part of Joyce Alexander causing
sudden retaliation on his part. [Emphasis added; pp. 409-10.]

[49]                         
In R. v. Louison (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d)
266 (Sask. C.A.), aff’d [1979] 1 S.C.R. 100, the accused sequestered a taxi
driver in the trunk of his own taxi. When he later opened the trunk, the driver
sprung out and hit him with a hammer. The accused grabbed the hammer away, and
proceeded to smash the driver’s skull with it, killing him. At trial, the
accused argued that he acted in the heat of the passion aroused by the hammer
attack. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, per Culliton C.J., held that
the provocation was self-induced and that the driver’s attempt to escape was
objectively predictable:

In
my view there could not be a situation in which the appellant had and kept the
initiative throughout more completely than in the present case. . . . 

 

. . .

 

.
. . I am satisfied that any reasonable person who had treated the deceased
as did the appellant, would expect that person to use any means at his disposal
to try and effect his escape if the occasion to do so arose. The striking
of the appellant by the deceased is not an act for which his mind would be
unprepared or would take his understanding by surprise, or that would set his
passions aflame. Such an act was one that was not only foreseeable and
predictable, but was one to be expected if the deceased was afforded any
opportunity to escape. [Emphasis added; pp. 286-87.]

[50]                         
Similarly, in R. v. Squire, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 13, this Court found
that an off-duty police officer who had gone out looking to pick fights in bars
could not raise the defence of provocation, as no jury acting reasonably could
conclude that the accused had been provoked in such a manner as to deprive an
ordinary person of the power of self-control:

It must
be remembered that on the evidence the respondent was, throughout the
disgraceful incidents of the evening, a bad-tempered aggressor and that he
seized on the slightest confrontation by [the deceased] to again become the
aggressor. If, during the fight which followed . . . he suffered a couple of
kicks of indefinite violence, the provocation resulting therefrom could not
possibly have caused a police officer to draw his gun and fire five shots at
his assailant. [pp. 21-22]

[51]                         
More recent cases have also confirmed that the defence of
provocation may lack an air of reality when the accused initiated an aggressive
confrontation which resulted in predictable acts of provocation. In R. v.
Gibson, 2001 BCCA 297, 153 B.C.A.C. 61, the accused initiated a physical
fight with the deceased. He lost the physical confrontation. The deceased
pushed the accused away and made a dismissive gesture. The accused felt
humiliated and stabbed the deceased with a knife as he was walking away from
the scene of the confrontation. The British Columbia Court of
Appeal held that there was no air of reality to the defence of provocation,
since the provocation was not sudden and would not have caused an ordinary
person to have lost his self-control.  Ryan J.A. suggested that an ordinary
person who initiates a fist fight would not lose control when he receives blows
in retaliation:

. . . the
sequelae of a lost match (as in Squire, the not unexpected blows
exchanged during a consensual fight) are not such as to deprive the ordinary
person of his power of self-control. . . .  [T]he ordinary
person standard is adopted to fix the degree of self-control and restraint
expected of all in society. It recognizes human frailty when the threshold test
is passed and a person is provoked beyond the level of tolerance of the
ordinary person. Based on the evidence in this case no jury could find that
under the same circumstances an ordinary young man in the appellant’s place
would have been provoked by the actions, words and gestures of the deceased so
as to cause him to lose his power of self-control. [para. 86]

[52]                         
Implicit in the appellate court’s reasoning is
the conclusion that the victim’s response — inflicting
minor damage in the fight the accused had initiated and then walking away — was within the range of reasonably anticipated responses. No
other contextual factors suggested that an ordinary person would have lost
self-control in the circumstances.  Accordingly, there was no air of reality to
the defence.

[53]                         
In the Tran case, this Court held that an accused who knew
that his wife was seeing another man could not claim that finding her in bed
with that man had “str[uck] upon a mind unprepared for it”:  para. 45. The
accused in Tran had maintained the initiative throughout: he had entered
his estranged wife’s apartment unexpectedly, without being invited, and
proceeded to attack his wife and her lover when he found them in bed together.
Although this Court analyzed the predictability of the allegedly provocative
act only under the subjective component of the test, there was an implied objective
dimension to the analysis. An “ordinary person” who burst into his estranged
wife’s apartment — and who knew
that she had taken a new lover — could reasonably anticipate that he would
discover the wife and her lover in bed.

[54]                         
Finally, I come to the case Thibert. In Thibert, a
majority of this Court held that the defence of provocation was properly left
to the jury, notwithstanding evidence that the accused’s conduct had
precipitated the wrongful act or insult relied on as provocation.  The accused,
Thibert, who was distraught because his wife wanted to leave him and had begun
seeing another man, went to his wife’s workplace in an attempt to convince her
to stay with him. He had placed a loaded rifle in his car. He met his wife in
the parking lot adjacent to her workplace. The wife’s lover interrupted the
conversation. The accused took the rifle out of his car and pointed it at him. 
The deceased began walking towards the accused, with his hands on the wife’s
shoulders and swinging her back and forth, all the while challenging the
accused to shoot him. The accused shot him, and raised the defence of
provocation at trial.

[55]                         
A majority of this Court, per Cory J., held that the trial judge
had not erred in leaving the defence of provocation with the jury.  The majority
reasons focused predominantly on whether the accused could have subjectively
lost control as a result of the victim’s taunts. The majority concluded that,
since the accused did not expect to see his wife’s lover at the meeting, the
confrontation with the deceased was unforeseen. Accordingly, the majority held
that the subjective element could be met and that, by extension, there was an
air of reality to the defence: Thibert, at para. 27. The accused could
not be said to have sought out the confrontation, according to the majority’s
reasoning.  The reasons also referred to the significance that an ordinary
person in the accused’s circumstances would attribute to the taunts, but did
not explore how the objective element of the defence, as analyzed in this case,
would be met in a situation of self-induced provocation.  The majority appears
to have relied heavily on the fact that, although the case was close to the
line, deference should be shown to the trial judge who had left the defence to
the jury: para. 33. Thibert is distinguishable from the present case, in
which Cairney sought out a confrontation with Ferguson at gunpoint.

[56]                         
Taken as a whole, the cases support the view that the fact that
provocation is “self-induced” by the accused may be relevant to both the
objective and subjective components of the defence.   Self-induced provocation
is not a special category of the defence attracting special principles. 
Rather, it describes a particular application of the general principles that
govern the defence of provocation.  There is no absolute rule that a person who
instigates a confrontation cannot rely on the defence of provocation.  As in
all cases where the defence of provocation is raised, whether the defence goes
to the jury depends on whether the evidence provides an air of reality to it. 
However, the fact that an accused sought out an aggressive confrontation and
received a predictable response is a factor which may deprive the defence of an
air of reality.

III. Application

[57]                         
The question is whether on the evidence
Cairney’s defence of provocation possessed an air of reality. The trial judge
left the matter to the jury, although she appears to have applied a “some
evidence” test instead of the air of reality test.  The Court of Appeal
disagreed, finding that there could be no reasonable doubt as to whether the
objective or subjective elements of the defence were present.

[58]                         
In my view, this appeal can be resolved on the objective element of the
test, which asks whether there was a wrongful act or insult by
the victim, sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control.

[59]                         
The alleged wrongful act or insult was the deceased’s
words to Cairney when Cairney confronted him at gunpoint: “Fuck you, you goof. 
This is none of your business, I’ll do with Fran whatever I want.”

[60]                         
Cairney argues that these words constituted a threat of
imminent domestic abuse sufficient to cause an ordinary person to lose
self-control.  The record does not support this contention. Ferguson was
having a conversation on the telephone when Cairney approached.  He was no
longer behaving aggressively towards Rosenthal —
his moment of anger against Rosenthal had passed.  Moreover, Ferguson was
attempting to leave the apartment when he spoke those words. The record, as the
Court of Appeal concluded, simply does not support the contention that an
ordinary person would have viewed the victim’s words as a threat of imminent
domestic violence against Rosenthal, leading to a loss of self-control.

[61]                         
What we are left with is a concern on Cairney’s part to prevent future
abuse against Rosenthal, and Cairney’s declared intention to achieve this by
extracting a promise at gunpoint from Ferguson to stop abusing her.  An
ordinary person who seeks to extract a promise at gunpoint would not be
surprised if the person confronted rebuffs the overture, in words like those
used by the victim here.  Ferguson’s response fell within a range of
predictable responses. There is nothing on the record to support the element of
sudden shock required to cause an ordinary person to lose self-control.  It
follows that a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could not have had a
reasonable doubt about whether Ferguson’s conduct was sufficient to deprive an
ordinary person of the power of self-control.

[62]                         
There was evidence, provided by Cairney’s
testimony, sufficient to support the subjective element — that Cairney in fact
acted in response to the provocation before his passion had time to cool. The
Court of Appeal entered into a minute weighing of the evidence that went into
the merits of the defence, by examining whether Cairney’s passions had time to
cool during the time that he followed Ferguson to the apartment building’s
stairwell. This approach went well beyond the requirements of the air of
reality test — the test only requires that there be an
evidential foundation on which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably
could find that there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused is
guilty of murder, on the basis of the defence of provocation. However, the
Court of Appeal’s error in assessing the subjective element does not change the
outcome of this appeal, since there is no air of reality to the objective
element of the defence.

[63]                         
In this case deference to the trial judge is not
appropriate, since she appears not to have applied the correct test in deciding
whether to leave the defence of provocation to the jury.

[64]                         
I add the following, from the perspective of
policy as it applies to cases such as this. Violent confrontations like the
gunpoint lecture that led to the death of Ferguson are to be discouraged. Where
conduct of this nature occurs, it will generally play a role in assessing
whether the defence of provocation meets the air of reality test, particularly under
the objective element of the defence. The law does not condone the initiation
of gunpoint lectures, regardless of the cause that led the accused to pick up a
weapon.

[65]                         
Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal and
affirm the order for a new trial.

                    The
reasons of Fish and Abella JJ. were delivered by

[66]                         
Abella J. (dissenting) — I have had the benefit of reading the Chief
Justice’s reasons and agree that there was evidence to support the subjective
element of the provocation defence. With great respect, however, I disagree
with her conclusions on the objective element of the defence. In my view, the
trial judge did not err in leaving the defence with the jury.

[67]                         
The role of the trial judge in deciding what
defences to put to the jury is to act as gatekeeper and “review the evidence
[to] determine whether, if believed, it could permit a properly
instructed jury acting reasonably to acquit” (R. v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29,
[2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 87 (emphasis in original)).  This threshold
determination “is not aimed at deciding the substantive merits of the defence”,
and the trial judge must not make determinations of credibility, weigh
evidence, make findings of fact, or draw determinate factual inferences (Cinous,
at paras. 54 and 87).

[68]                         
For defences like provocation, the trial judge
must determine whether the evidence is reasonably capable of supporting the
inferences necessary to make out the defence (R. v. Tran, 2010 SCC 58,
[2010] 3 S.C.R. 350, at para. 41). When carrying out this “limited weighing” of
the evidence, the trial judge “does not draw determinate factual inferences,
but rather comes to a conclusion about the field of factual inferences that
could reasonably be drawn from the evidence” (Cinous, at para. 91; see
also R. v. Mayuran, 2012 SCC 31, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 162, at para. 21).

[69]                         
In relation to the objective element of
provocation, the judge must determine whether there is evidence that could
raise a reasonable doubt about whether the accused was faced with a wrongful
act or insult sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of self-control (Tran,
at para. 25).  To determine how the “ordinary” person would react to a
particular insult, it is necessary to take the relevant context and
circumstances into account, but without going so far as to accept idiosyncratic
characteristics of the accused that would subvert the objective standard (Tran,
at paras. 31-35). One clearly relevant contextual circumstance that informs the
inquiry is the history and background of any relationship between the victim
and the accused (R. v. Thibert, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 37, at paras. 16-19).

[70]                         
In this case, Ferguson’s words and the reaction
they would elicit from an ordinary person cannot be appreciated without
considering the whole context, and, in particular, the history of the
relationship between Cairney and Ferguson. The majority’s approach concentrates
mainly on one aspect of the evidence — Cairney confronting Ferguson with a gun
— to the exclusion of other evidence that could well have led the jury to
conclude that the objective element of provocation was met based on a credible
threat that Ferguson would again abuse Cairney’s cousin, Fran Rosenthal.

[71]                         
The predictability of the alleged provocation is
certainly relevant to the analysis. But the assessment of the evidence relevant
to the objective element should not be skewed by placing predominant emphasis
on the aggressive conduct of the accused at the determinative expense of the
whole context. An analysis that overwhelmingly focuses on whether the victim’s
acts were the predictable consequence of the accused’s aggressive conduct
appears to me to be too restrictive. It is noteworthy that two of the
commentators cited by the majority in support of denying the defence of
provocation “where the accused . . . initiates a confrontation and receives a
predictable response” in fact criticise such an approach (Morris Manning
and Peter Sankoff, Manning, Mewett & Sankoff: Criminal Law (4th
ed. 2009), at pp. 770-72; Don Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law: A Treatise (6th
ed. 2011), at p. 592).

[72]                         
Ferguson and Cairney were close friends. The
only source of conflict between them, which ultimately led to the killing, was
Ferguson’s long history of domestic violence against Fran Rosenthal, whom
Cairney thought of as his “little sister”.

[73]                         
Ferguson had been attacking Fran Rosenthal for
over a decade. The assaults were frequent — often weekly. They were also
severe: Rosenthal testified about incidents such as Ferguson hitting her in the
head with a golf club.  Cairney knew all about the assaults since Rosenthal had
repeatedly taken refuge with him and his wife.  She would show up bruised and
injured, sometimes so badly that she was unable to go to work.

[74]                         
Less than a year before the shooting, Cairney
had witnessed one of the attacks. He had found Ferguson kneeling on Fran Rosenthal’s
throat, choking her to the point of unconsciousness. Cairney had to push
Ferguson off of Rosenthal, and spent that entire night with Ferguson to ensure
that he did not attack her again. A few weeks before the shooting, Rosenthal
told Cairney that she had thought she was going to die that time.

[75]                         
The incident leading to the shooting had the
potential to turn into another assault. Ferguson suddenly became enraged and
started screaming at Fran Rosenthal. He called her a “fuckin’ bitch” and a
“fuckin’ cunt” and threatened her with: “If it wasn’t for your sore back, I’d
be throwing you against the walls right now.” He ordered Rosenthal to tell
Cairney to leave. When she did, Cairney expressed his concern to her that
Ferguson was going to start beating her. She did not deny it. In
cross-examination, she admitted that she wanted Cairney to leave because danger
to her was imminent and she did not want him to see it.

[76]                         
While the majority suggests that Ferguson was
“no longer behaving aggressively towards Rosenthal” and that “his moment of
anger against Rosenthal had passed” by the time Cairney confronted him, the
opposite inference can also be drawn from this record. Notably, Cairney’s
evidence about the progression of the fight between Ferguson and Rosenthal is
that it continued to escalate after Cairney left the room at Rosenthal’s
request. Cairney testified during cross-examination, for instance, that hearing
Ferguson screaming threats at Rosenthal was what led him to come back in and
confront Ferguson:

Q    And then in spite of your concerns about the potential for
violence then, you actually do leave the two alone for a while, in spite of
that explosive, you know, kind of powder keg situation. Right?

 

A    Right.

 

Q    And you come back with the gun, smash the phone. Right?

 

A    After I heard the argument escalating and Steve [Ferguson]
screaming at her.

 

Q    Oh, okay. What was Steve saying then in terms of the
argument escalating?

 

A    I believe the words were, You never fucking listen, you
fucking cunt. I heard Frannie yelling back at Steve. That’s when I had enough.
And all I wanted to do was scare Steve. I did not want to shoot him. [Emphasis
added.]

[77]                         
At that point, Cairney confronted Ferguson with
the gun and said:

Do you think you own her? Do you think
that she’s your property? Do you think that you can beat the shit out of her
anytime you want? I said, I had it up to here, buddy. I said, listen, here you
are all those months, when you’re not working and she’s buying your beer and
whatever and toting [sic] to your every whim, and whenever you get
pissed off about anything, you use her as your punching bag.

[78]                         
The response that caused Cairney to snap,
according to his testimony, was this: “Fuck you, you goof. This is none of your
business. I’ll do with Fran whatever I want.” The provocative act was not
Ferguson responding dismissively to Cairney pointing the gun. It was
his emphatic assertion that he would continue the conduct towards Fran
Rosenthal that Cairney had just confronted him about — “beat[ing] the shit out
of her” and using her as his “punching bag”.

[79]                         
The facts of this case illustrate the frailty of
making the availability of the provocation defence hinge on a “who started it?”
inquiry in circumstances involving a back-and-forth between the victim and the
accused. Removing the defence from the jury turns on the characterization that
Cairney initiated an “aggressive confrontation”. On another view of these
facts, however, Ferguson initiated the confrontation when he started verbally
abusing and threatening Cairney’s cousin — acts that could, in light of
Ferguson’s history of relentless domestic abuse, readily and reasonably be
interpreted as a prelude to another brutal assault.

[80]                         
Bielby J.’s decision to leave provocation to the
jury was therefore a proper one. Her review of the evidence relevant to the
objective element of provocation was flawless:

The event which Mr. Cairney
testified caused him to lose control was Mr. Ferguson telling him he was a goof
and that he would do what he wanted to with Fran, said as he walked away from
Mr. Cairney who had just told him to come back. That event must be considered
in the context of what occurred just before and in the context of Mr. Cairney’s
knowledge of the history of domestic violence between Mr. Ferguson and Ms.
Rosenthal. . . .

 

. . .

 

You must take into account
everything that was said or done at the time and must also consider Mr. Cairney
and Mr. Ferguson’s relationship and history. This includes evidence of Mr.
Cairney’s knowledge of prior incidents when Mr. Ferguson had struck or been
violent toward Ms. Rosenthal, including the one he personally witnessed the
prior summer when he saw Mr. Ferguson place his knee on her neck, leaving her
almost unconscious, where Mr. Cairney intervened to pull Mr. Ferguson off her,
the fact that she told Mr. Cairney she thought she was going to die that night
in a conversation held with him in January 2007 and the fact Mr. Cairney was
attempting to scold Mr. Ferguson over his demeaning and violent treatment of
Fran over the years.

[81]                         
The majority would, however, remove the defence
of provocation from the jury solely because Ferguson’s words “fell within a
range of predictable responses” to what it calls a “gunpoint lecture”.  While
Ferguson’s dismissive attitude towards Cairney might have been predictable,
it would, in my view, be open for a jury to infer from the full context of this
case that an ordinary person would not predict Ferguson’s response that
he would keep beating Rosenthal if he felt like it.

[82]                         
This Court said in Tran that the objective
element of the defence of provocation should be informed by contemporary norms,
including Charter values. These do not include aggressively proprietary
atavistic attitudes. It is therefore troubling, with respect, to
conclude that it was “predictable” for Ferguson to react to Cairney’s warning
by confirming his intention to continue inflicting domestic violence. It is
difficult to accept that an expressed intention to continue assaulting a spouse
could ever be considered “predictable”.

[83]                         
It is true that “[t]he law does not condone the
initiation of gunpoint lectures”, as the majority observes. The law never
condones the conduct that gives rise to the defence of provocation. That is why
provocation is only a partial defence, reducing the offence from murder to
manslaughter and why the defence of provocation in the circumstances of this
case in no way absolves the accused. Cairney’s nine-year prison sentence was
based on the fact that he caused Ferguson’s death by using a firearm in the
dispute.

[84]                         
I would allow the appeal and restore the
conviction and nine-year sentence for manslaughter.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

                    Criminal law — Charge to jury — Eyewitness
evidence — Whether trial judge instructed jury that it could convict accused
based on eyewitness evidence alone — If so, whether such an instruction would
constitute an error.

                    Criminal law — Evidence — Fresh evidence — Hair
clipping evidence relied upon by Crown to explain accused’s appearance at time
of arrest as well as after‑the‑fact change of appearance — New
forensic evidence reports and testimony to the effect that most hair clippings
did not originate from scalp — Whether accused’s motion to adduce fresh evidence
should be granted.

                    In
the early morning of July 6, 2002, two men, one wearing a blue/green
shirt, shot and killed C.M. in a Toronto nightclub.  E was seen leaving the
club in a car registered to the appellant H’s mother, with whom H lived.  Multiple
witnesses were able to confidently identify E as the shooter.  Given H’s
connection to the residence and a database lookup that revealed he had a prior
firearm conviction, the police considered him a suspect as well.  L.M., who
witnessed the shooting, was shown a lineup which included one photo of H that
was taken roughly two years earlier.  When asked about the identity of the
shooter in the blue/green shirt, she selected H’s photo.  Three weeks after the
shooting, L.M. participated in a second photo lineup which contained the photo
of H taken on the day of his arrest.  L.M. did not select any photo from this
sequence.  E and H were subsequently charged with the first degree murder of
C.M. and the attempted murder of his brother. 

                    The
Crown’s case against H consisted of testimony from L.M. and four pieces of
physical evidence: bullets found in a sock in a laundry hamper in H’s bedroom;
a white T‑shirt in the same hamper with one granule of gunshot residue on
it; hair clippings from a newspaper in the garbage of the bathroom nearest to
H’s bedroom; and hair clippings in an electric razor found in H’s nightstand. 
The Crown’s theory was that H shaved his head upon returning home from the
shooting.  This was necessary to explain the discrepancy between the eyewitness
testimony, which indicated that the second shooter had dreadlocks that were two
inches or longer, and the length of H’s hair when he was arrested, which was
very short.  It was also used to explain why L.M. was not able to identify H
based on the arrest photo shown to her three weeks after the shooting.  The
Crown also suggested that the haircut represented an after‑the‑fact
attempt by H to change his appearance to cover up his involvement in the
shooting.  The jury found E and H guilty of first degree murder of C.M. and
attempted murder of his brother.  In the Court of Appeal, H challenged his
conviction on the bases that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable and that the
trial judge erred in instructing the jury on eyewitness identification.  The
court found that the trial judge did not instruct the jury that it could
convict on L.M.’s testimony alone and held that the jury’s verdict was not
unreasonable because, despite weaknesses in L.M.’s eyewitness testimony, there
was other confirmatory evidence presented to the jury. 

                    While
the application for leave to appeal was pending before this Court, H filed a
motion to compel the Crown to release hair clipping
evidence for forensic testing.  H sought to forensically examine the hair
clippings to determine from what part of the body the clippings came.  This
Court allowed the motion.  H subsequently filed a motion to adduce the reports
and testimony of experts who conducted the forensic examination.

                    Held:
 The appeal should be allowed, the motion to adduce fresh evidence should be
granted and the matter should be remanded for retrial.

                    Per McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell and
Wagner JJ.:  It would have been an error to instruct the jury that it
could convict H based on L.M.’s testimony alone.  Where the Crown relies on an
eyewitness identification, the trial judge has a duty to caution the jury
regarding the well‑recognized frailties of identification evidence.  However,
a properly instructed jury may conclude, notwithstanding the frailties of
eyewitness identification, that the eyewitness’ testimony is reliable and may
enter a conviction on those grounds.  This may be so even where the Crown has
relied on only a single eyewitness.  However, where the Crown’s case consists
solely of eyewitness testimony that would necessarily leave reasonable doubt in
the mind of a reasonable juror, the trial judge must direct an acquittal upon a
motion for directed verdict.  L.M.’s testimony, in and of itself, would not
have permitted a reasonable juror to conclude without reasonable doubt that H
was one of the shooters and therefore, it would have been an error for the
trial judge to instruct the jury that it could convict H based solely on L.M.’s
evidence.  While L.M.’s
testimony on its own could not have supported an inference of guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt, the trial judge’s instruction, read as a whole, did not
instruct the jury that it could convict H based solely on her testimony.  Rather, in reviewing L.M.’s testimony, the trial judge described each
of the specific problems with her identification and instructed the jury that
it must look to confirmatory evidence.  The trial judge was not circumscribed
to instruct the jury as to the sufficiency of L.M.’s testimony using any
particular words and he must be afforded some latitude in determining the best
way to convey to the jury the relevant legal principles and how they apply to
the evidence adduced at trial.  The trial judge put great care into his jury
charge and, in particular, into the instructions as to eyewitness evidence.  L.M.’s
testimony in conjunction with the confirmatory evidence was sufficient to
support the conclusion that H was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and, thus,
there was no error in the jury charge.

                    The
motion to adduce fresh evidence should be granted and a new trial should be
ordered.  H’s fresh evidence consists of affidavits and cross‑examinations
of two forensic experts, in which each expert provides an opinion as to the
percentage of hairs in the newspaper and the razor that came from H’s scalp, as
opposed to his face or trunk.  The experts agreed that the samples taken were
predominantly facial hairs.  The Crown’s experts conducted a paper review and
testified that there was no evidence to support the proposition that the hair
clippings represented a head shave.  The overriding consideration upon a motion
to adduce fresh evidence is “in the interests of justice” and this requires
consideration of the principles enunciated in Palmer v. The Queen.  The
Crown has conceded that the expert evidence H seeks to adduce is credible.  Mere
lack of knowledge on the part of H’s trial counsel without any indication that
he inquired into the possibility of obtaining and presenting the evidence is a
factor against admitting the evidence for the first time on appeal.  However,
in view of the fact that this is a criminal case, involving charges of the most
serious nature, the evidence should not be excluded solely on the basis of a
lack of diligence.  It cannot reasonably be disputed that H’s fresh evidence
bears on a decisive issue.  The
evidence of hair clippings was used to explain the discrepancy between the
eyewitness description of the shooter and H’s actual appearance at the time of
arrest.  This was also how the Crown explained L.M.’s
inability to identify H based on his arrest photo.  The hair clippings were also adduced as evidence that
H had attempted an after‑the‑fact change of his appearance.  The evidence was directly relevant to whether H was in fact the
shooter in the blue/green shirt.  The fresh evidence that H seeks to adduce could
reasonably be expected to have affected the jury’s verdict.  The Crown relied
heavily on the haircut evidence at trial.  The significance of the hair
clippings was also reflected in the jury charge.  The Court of Appeal too
recognized that the hair clipping evidence was significant to the Crown’s case
and noted that the hair clippings allowed for a powerful inference of guilt.  Given
the significance of the haircut to the Crown’s case, the fresh evidence could
reasonably be expected to have affected the result.  For these reasons, H’s
motion to adduce fresh evidence should be granted.  The appropriate remedy here
is a new trial.

                    Per Fish J.:  There is agreement that the appellant’s motion to adduce
fresh evidence should be granted, that the appeal should be allowed and that a
new trial should be ordered.  However, the trial judge made a fatal error by
instructing the jury that it could convict the appellant on the evidence of L.M.
alone.  

                    Crown
counsel asked the judge to instruct the jury that they could convict the
appellant on the evidence of one eyewitness alone.  Counsel made clear that he
was referring specifically to the testimony of L.M.  In his closing address,
Crown counsel proceeded on the understanding that the trial judge would charge
the jury to that effect. At no point in his charge did the trial judge correct
these assertions by the Crown.  Pursuant to the Crown’s closing argument, the
jury would thus have assumed that it was entitled to convict the appellant
based solely on L.M.’s eyewitness identification.  This misapprehension of the
law was reinforced by the trial judge in his instructions to the jury.  Although
the trial judge urged caution, he informed the jury in unmistakable terms that
the testimony of one eyewitness could properly ground a conviction.  The jury
would therefore have understood that this rule applied unless instructed
otherwise for a particular witness.  No such instruction was ever given.  On
the contrary, the trial judge explained that identification evidence is
stronger if the accused was previously known to the witness.  This was
indisputably a direct reference to L.M.’s evidence implicating the appellant.  The
trial judge’s subsequent instructions regarding L.M.’s evidence further
reinforced Crown counsel’s uncorrected statement to the jury that they could
convict the appellant on her photo identification alone.  It is not possible in
light of this record to conclude that the trial judge did not instruct the jury
that it could convict the appellant on the evidence of L.M. alone.

                    Rothstein J. — 

I.         
Introduction

[1]                             
Leighton Hay was convicted of first degree
murder and attempted murder for a shooting that took place in a Toronto
nightclub.  He appeals his conviction on two grounds.  First, he argues that
the trial judge erred by instructing the jury that he could be convicted based
solely on the testimony of the one eyewitness who implicated him at trial. 
Second, he has filed a motion in this Court to adduce fresh evidence, which, he
says, warrants acquittal or a new trial.  

[2]                             
I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial
judge did not err in instructing the jury.  The eyewitness testimony against
Mr. Hay on its own could not have supported an inference of guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt; however, the trial judge’s instruction, read as a whole, did
not instruct the jury that it could convict Mr. Hay based solely on her
testimony.  

[3]                             
However, Mr. Hay’s motion to adduce fresh
evidence should be granted.  He has asked this Court to consider evidence from
two experts who have forensically examined hair clipping exhibits that the
Crown relied on at trial to establish that Mr. Hay shaved his head after the
shooting.  The evidence was used to explain the discrepancy between the
eyewitness description of the shooter and Mr. Hay’s actual appearance at the
time of arrest.  It was also adduced as evidence that Mr. Hay had attempted an
after-the-fact change of his appearance.  The fresh evidence indicates that the
hair clippings did not originate from Mr. Hay’s scalp.  In my view, Mr. Hay has
satisfied the standard for adducing fresh evidence articulated in Palmer v.
The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, at p. 775, and the appropriate remedy is a
new trial. 

II.      
Factual Background

[4]                             
In the early morning of July 6, 2002, two men
shot and killed Collin Moore in a Toronto nightclub.  The men also shot at
Collin’s brother, Roger Moore, who escaped with a graze to his forehead.  

[5]                             
The evidence at trial established that Collin
was hosting a monthly fundraising event at the nightclub.  Sometime after
midnight, three or four men arrived at the club and refused to pay the entry
fee.  Two of the intruders were Gary Eunick, who was seen wearing an orange
vest, and his brother, both of whom were known by multiple witnesses at the
club.  The intruders pushed their way into the lobby of the club.  When Collin
and Roger intervened, a fight broke out in which beer bottles were broken and
the glass door of the club was smashed.  

[6]                             
Following the fight in the lobby, Collin and
Roger retreated to the nightclub’s kitchen.  The intruders exited the club, at
which point Mr. Eunick was seen fidgeting with a gun in the parking lot. 
Minutes later, he and two of the other intruders, one wearing a blue/green
shirt, returned to the nightclub.  Mr. Eunick was armed with a semi-automatic
handgun and the man in the blue/green shirt carried a long barrel revolver. 
Mr. Eunick and the man in the blue/green shirt entered the kitchen, where they
shot Collin eight times, killing him.  They also shot at Roger, who was grazed
by a bullet and only slightly wounded.  

[7]                             
The owner of the nightclub saw Mr. Eunick
leaving the club in a green Honda and recorded the licence plate number.  The
car was registered to Lydia Hay, who resided at 6927 Chigwel Court, with her
daughter Lisa Hay, who was Gary Eunick’s girlfriend, and her son Leighton Hay,
the appellant.  The police arrived at the Chigwel residence within
approximately half an hour of the shooting, where they found the green Honda in
the driveway.  They surveilled the residence for approximately the next 10 hours.

[8]                             
While the police were surveilling the home, several
witnesses from the nightclub were shown photo lineups at the police station. 
Multiple witnesses were able to confidently identify Gary Eunick as the shooter
in an orange vest with the semi-automatic gun.  Given Mr. Hay’s connection to
the Chigwel residence and a database lookup that revealed he had a prior
firearm conviction, the police considered him a suspect.  Leisa Maillard, an
acquaintance of Collin Moore who was in the kitchen at the time the intruders
entered to shoot him, was shown a lineup containing a photo of Mr. Hay.  When
asked about the identity of the shooter in the blue/green shirt, she selected
Mr. Hay’s photo.  The details of that selection are discussed in more detail
later.  

[9]                             
Neither party proffered evidence as to whether
Mr. Hay’s photo was included in the lineups shown to witnesses other than Ms.
Maillard.  

[10]                         
At approximately noon, following the shooting,
Lisa Hay, Mr. Hay’s sister, emerged from the Chigwel residence and appeared as
though she was prepared to clean the green Honda.  At this point, the police
moved in, secured the residence, and arrested Gary Eunick and Leighton Hay. 
The men were subsequently charged with the first degree murder of Collin Moore
and the attempted murder of Roger Moore.

III.   
Procedural History

A.      
Trial Proceedings

[11]                         
Mr. Eunick and Mr. Hay were tried together on
both counts.  The Crown’s theory at trial was that Mr. Eunick and Mr. Hay were
the two men who entered the kitchen and shot at the Moore brothers. 

[12]                         
The identity of Mr. Eunick as one of the
shooters was never in serious doubt.  Mr. Eunick was identified by multiple
witnesses at the nightclub, including Collin Moore’s wife, who knew him, and
the club owner, who named him during his initial 911 call that night.  The
physical evidence connecting Mr. Eunick to the shooting was also overwhelming. 
The Crown introduced evidence of a palm print and blood found on the front door
of the nightclub that matched Mr. Eunick.  It also introduced evidence of
several items found scattered around the Chigwel residence that implicated Mr.
Eunick, including:  a shopping bag recovered from the back of the house
containing the orange vest he wore at the club, which had Mr. Eunick’s blood
and gunshot granules on it; a backpack containing a white T-shirt and blue
jeans, which had Mr. Eunick’s blood and gunshot residue on them; shoes in Lisa
Hay’s closet, which had glass shards in the treads from the broken door at the
club; bullets found in a sock in a hamper at the entrance to Mr. Hay’s bedroom,
one of which may have been cycled through (i.e. was at some point loaded in the
chamber of the semi-automatic handgun fired by Mr. Eunick); and Mr. Eunick’s
blood in the front passenger area of the Honda Civic.  

[13]                         
The Crown’s theory was that Mr. Hay was the
second shooter ― the man with the long barrel revolver wearing a
blue/green shirt.  Mr. Hay’s defence was that he never went to the club with
Mr. Eunick that night and was instead at home sleeping during the relevant
period.  

[14]                         
The Crown’s case against Mr. Hay consisted of
testimony from Ms. Maillard and four pieces of physical evidence: (1) the
aforementioned bullets in a sock, which were found in a laundry hamper at the
entrance of Mr. Hay’s bedroom; (2) a white T-shirt, which contained a particle
of gunshot residue, found in the same hamper; (3) hair clippings found in a
newspaper in the bathroom garbage; and (4) hair clippings found in an electric
razor in Mr. Hay’s nightstand.  An understanding of the relevance of each piece
of evidence and the overall strength of the Crown’s case is necessary to
evaluate Mr. Hay’s arguments on appeal. 

(1)     
Ms. Maillard’s Eyewitness Evidence

[15]                         
Ms. Maillard was the only eyewitness who
implicated Mr. Hay as one of the shooters.  She testified that she was in the
kitchen when the two shooters entered and that she focused her attention on the
shooter who was wearing the blue/green plaid button-up shirt with a white
T-shirt underneath and who carried a long barrel revolver.  She described him
as having two-inch long “picky” dreadlocks: A.R., vol. II, at p. 832.  According
to her testimony, she said to the shooter: “You don’t have to do this, you
know.  If you guys want to fight, just fight.  He has a wife and kids” (p. 835). 
At that point, the man turned to her, pointed his gun, and said, “Shut your
blood clot before I kill you” (ibid.).  Ms. Maillard continued to
focus on the man in the blue/green shirt, who moved further into the kitchen
and began firing at the Moore brothers.  After the fourth shot, she left the
kitchen and hid in the hallway.

[16]                         
As mentioned above, following the shooting, the
police suspected that Mr. Hay might be the second shooter and included his
picture in a photo lineup shown to Ms. Maillard.  The evidence at trial
established that the lineup contained 12 photos, one photo of Mr. Hay that was
taken roughly two years earlier and 11 photos depicting men with similar
features.

[17]                         
 Detective Derek Young provided Ms. Maillard
with a series of cautions before showing her the photo lineup.  In particular,
he informed her that he would be showing her a page with 12 photos on it that
may or may not include a photo of the suspect.  He informed her that she should
go through each of the 12 photos before selecting anyone and that she should
not rely heavily on facial features that might change.  He told her that if she
was able to identify the shooter with 100 percent positivity, she should say
so, and if not, she should provide a percentage on the likelihood that the
person she has selected was the suspect.

[18]                         
Det. Young’s and Ms. Maillard’s testimony
established that Ms. Maillard looked at each photo in the lineup and that when
she reached the photo depicting Mr. Hay, she became shaken up.  She pointed at
the photo and stated: “Out of all of these pictures this gentleman most fits
the description of the gentlemen I saw shooting”: A.R., vol. III, at p. 999. 
She stated to the investigating officer that in her belief, the photo of Mr.
Hay depicted the shooter in the blue/green shirt and on “a percentage scale I
would probably say maybe 80 percent” (pp. 979-80).  Det. Young then sought to
clarify her statement with the following exchange:

[Det. Young:]      Are you saying that this photograph depicts the
likeness about 80 percent of the person?

 

. . .

 

[Ms. Maillard:]     That’s
correct.

 

. . .

 

[Det. Young:]      That did
the shooting?

 

. . .

 

[Ms. Maillard:]     That’s
correct.

 

. . .

 

[Det. Young:]      But are you saying this is the person that did
the shooting?  I have to have a yes or no.

 

. . .

 

[Ms. Maillard:]     No, the photograph is about 80 percent . . . of
what depicts the likeness of the person that did the shooting. 

 

. . .

 

[Det. Young:]      Okay. 

 

. . .

 

[Ms. Maillard:]     I wish I could. [A.R., vol. III, at pp. 1014-16]

[19]                         
At trial, Ms. Maillard took the position that
she did intend to identify Mr. Hay as the shooter in the blue/green shirt.  She
explained her comment that the photo shared 80 percent of the likeness of the
shooter as follows:

I meant that
the photograph being a photocopy, about not being able to pick up the facial
hair, not being able to see, you know, knowing that it might not be a current
photograph of him, noting that his hair might be different, taking into account
all those factors that I was told and being — seeing someone get shot and
knowing that this is something very important that I was doing, picking
somebody, you know, out of a line-up that was responsible for a man dying, I
was being cautious.  [A.R., vol. II, at pp. 856-57]

[20]                         
According to Ms. Maillard’s testimony, a day or
two after the shooting, she called the police station “to find out whether or
not [her] I.D. was pretty much the right person or not”: A.R., vol. II, at pp.
893-94. 

[21]                         
Three weeks after the shooting, Ms. Maillard
participated in a second photo lineup, in which she was shown a number of
photographs in sequence and asked if any matched the shooter in the blue/green
shirt.  The photo sequence contained the photo of Mr. Hay taken on the day of
his arrest, following the shooting.  However, Ms. Maillard did not select any
photo from the sequence.  Ms. Maillard testified at trial that she just
“flipped through” the photos and stated that the arrest photo did not have a
gaunt face, as she had recalled the shooter at the club: A.R., vol. II, at p.
895. 

[22]                         
Finally, defence counsel elicited testimony from
Ms. Maillard that at the preliminary inquiry, she repeatedly identified Mr.
Eunick, not Mr. Hay, as the shooter in the blue/green shirt.  Ms. Maillard
testified that she erroneously pointed out Mr. Eunick because she was nervous
and scared, and because Mr. Hay had bulked up since the shooting.  

[23]                         
Ms. Maillard was not asked at trial if she could
make an in-court identification of Mr. Hay.  

(2)     
Physical Evidence:  Bullets, White T-Shirt and
Hair Clippings 

[24]                         
As mentioned above, the Crown introduced the
following physical evidence implicating Mr. Hay: (1) bullets found in a sock in
a laundry hamper in his bedroom, one of which may have been cycled through the
semi-automatic handgun fired by Mr. Eunick; (2) a white T-shirt in the same
hamper with one granule of gunshot residue on it; (3) hair clippings from a
newspaper in the garbage of the bathroom nearest to Mr. Hay’s bedroom; and (4)
hair clippings in an electric razor found in Mr. Hay’s nightstand.  

[25]                         
The bullets and white T-shirt implicated Mr. Hay
in the crime based on the location in which they were found ― the hamper
in his bedroom ― and the expert testimony associating them with the
shooting.  With respect to the bullets, the Crown’s firearms expert testified that
one of the unfired bullets found in the sock had been cycled through the
semi-automatic gun used by Mr. Eunick in the shooting.  Mr. Hay’s firearm
expert did not dispute the methodology or assumptions made by the Crown expert,
but testified that he was unable to reach the same conclusion.  It was
undisputed that if the bullets in the sock had any connection to the shooting,
it was to the semi-automatic gun fired by Mr. Eunick and not the long barrel
revolver used by the shooter in the blue/green shirt. 

[26]                         
The white T-shirt was tied to the shooting by
virtue of the eyewitness testimony that the shooter in the blue/green shirt was
wearing a white T-shirt underneath and the fact that the T-shirt was found on
the top of Mr. Hay’s laundry hamper with one speck of gunshot residue on it. 
The Crown’s theory was that Mr. Hay put the bullets and his white T-shirt in
the hamper upon returning home from the shooting.  

[27]                         
The defence argued that Mr. Eunick, who had
testified that he used the bathroom next to Mr. Hay’s bedroom upon returning
from the club, placed the bullets in Mr. Hay’s hamper, which was located just
inside the entrance to the bedroom.  In the process of doing so, Mr. Eunick
contaminated the white T-shirt on the top of the hamper with a single granule
of gunshot residue.  According to the defence, this was supported by the fact
that there was no gunshot residue found on any of the other items in the
hamper.  

[28]                         
The other physical evidence introduced by the
Crown was hair clippings obtained from two places: (1) a crumpled page of
newspaper dated three weeks earlier found in the waste basket in the bathroom
near Mr. Hay’s bedroom and (2) an electric razor found in the nightstand next
to Mr. Hay’s bed.  The evidence established that the hairs in the newspaper and
the razor were less than a centimeter long.  The hair was not submitted to a
forensic expert for trial and no expert testified regarding the hair.  

[29]                         
The Crown’s theory with respect to the hair
clippings was that Mr. Hay shaved his head upon returning home from the shooting. 
This was necessary to explain the discrepancy between the eyewitness testimony
― which indicated that the second shooter had dreadlocks that were two
inches or longer ― and the length of Mr. Hay’s hair when he was arrested
― which was very short.  It was also used to explain why Ms. Maillard was
not able to identify Mr. Hay based on the arrest photo shown to her three weeks
after the shooting.  The Crown also suggested that the haircut represented an
after-the-fact attempt by Mr. Hay to change his appearance to cover up his
involvement in the shooting.  

[30]                         
In addition to this physical evidence, the Crown
also introduced a videotape of the Chigwel Court residence recorded after Mr.
Eunick and Mr. Hay were arrested.  One scene in the video depicts a blue shirt
draped on a bunk bed in a second bedroom in the home.  However, the record does
not indicate that the Crown ever sought to seize the shirt, let alone submit it
for testing or present it to one of the eyewitnesses to make the case that it
was the blue/green shirt worn by the second shooter.  

(3)     
Jury Verdict

[31]                         
Based on the evidence described above, the jury
found Mr. Eunick and Mr. Hay guilty of first degree murder of Collin Moore and
attempted murder of Roger Moore.  

B.      
Ontario Court of Appeal, 2009 ONCA 398, 249 O.A.C. 24

[32]                         
In the Court of Appeal, Mr. Hay challenged his
conviction on the bases that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable and that the
trial judge erred in instructing the jury on eyewitness identification. 
Moldaver J.A., as he then was, wrote for a unanimous panel and dismissed the
appeal.  

[33]                         
The court held that the jury’s verdict was not
unreasonable because, despite weaknesses in Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness
testimony, there was other confirmatory evidence presented to the jury,
including the bullets and shirt found in Mr. Hay’s hamper and the hair
clippings, which allowed for the “powerful inference” that Mr. Hay shaved his
head after the murder to disguise his appearance (para. 36).  The court
acknowledged that the jury could have drawn multiple inferences from the
evidence presented, but concluded that this confirmatory evidence “put this
case over the unreasonable verdict threshold” (ibid.). 

[34]                         
With respect to the trial judge’s instruction to
the jury on eyewitness identification, Mr. Hay raised three arguments.  First,
he argued that the trial judge erroneously instructed the jury that it could
convict Mr. Hay on the evidence of Ms. Maillard alone.  The Court of Appeal
disagreed.  In its view, the trial judge did not instruct the jury that it
could convict on Ms. Maillard’s testimony alone.  Rather, the trial judge
instructed the jury that it must look to confirmatory evidence. 

[35]                         
Mr. Hay raised two other challenges regarding
the trial judge’s instruction on eyewitness evidence and challenged the trial
judge’s instruction on the planning and deliberation requirement for first degree
murder.  These challenges were rejected by the Court of Appeal and have not
been reargued before this Court.  

C.      
Motion for an Order to Release Exhibits 

[36]                         
While the application for leave to appeal was
pending before this Court, Mr. Hay filed a motion to compel the Crown to
release two pieces of evidence for forensic testing:  the hair clippings found
in the crumpled newspaper and the hair clippings found in the electric razor. 
Mr. Hay sought to forensically examine the hair clippings to determine from
what part of the body the clippings came.  This Court allowed the motion; see R.
v. Hay, 2010 SCC 54, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 206, at para. 10.  However, it
deferred consideration of any motion to adduce fresh evidence to be considered
with the appeal (para. 9).  

[37]                         
On December 1, 2010, the parties submitted a
proposed protocol for releasing the hair clippings and having them examined by
the Centre of Forensic Sciences.  This Court ordered that the hairs be released
and examined in accordance with that protocol.  Mr. Hay subsequently filed a
motion under s. 683  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , to
adduce the reports and testimony of experts who conducted the forensic
examination.

IV.       Issues

[38]                         
This appeal presents two issues:

(1)        Whether the trial judge erred by instructing the jury
that it could convict Mr. Hay based on Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness evidence
alone. 

(2)        Whether Mr. Hay’s motion to adduce fresh evidence should
be granted and if so, what is the appropriate remedy? 

V.      
Analysis

A.      
Jury Charge Regarding Eyewitness Testimony

[39]                         
Mr. Hay argues that the trial judge erred by
instructing the jury that it could convict him on Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness
testimony alone.  Like the Court of Appeal, I am of the view that Mr. Hay’s
argument should be rejected.  As I explain below, it would have been an error
to instruct the jury that it could convict Mr. Hay based on Ms. Maillard’s
testimony alone because it was too weak to establish Mr. Hay’s guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt.  However, read as a whole, the trial judge’s jury charge did
not instruct the jury that it could convict based on Ms. Maillard’s testimony
alone.  Rather, it instructed the jury that it must look to confirmatory
evidence.  It is not disputed that Ms. Maillard’s testimony in conjunction with
the confirmatory evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that Mr. Hay
was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and, thus, there was no error in the jury
charge. 

(1)      Whether It Would Have Been an Error to Instruct the Jury That It
Could Convict Mr. Hay Based on Ms. Maillard’s Testimony Alone

[40]                         
The credibility and weight that should be given
to eyewitness testimony is an issue committed to the ultimate trier of fact
― here, the jury: R. v. Mezzo, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 802, at pp.
844-45.  It is well established that where the Crown relies on an eyewitness
identification, the trial judge has a duty to caution the jury regarding the
well-recognized frailties of identification evidence; see Mezzo, at p.
845, citing R. v. Turnbull, [1976] 3 All E.R. 549 (C.A.); R. v.
Hibbert, 2002 SCC 39, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 445, at paras. 78-79 (per Bastarache
J., dissenting, although not on this point); R. v. Canning, [1986] 1
S.C.R. 991.  However, a properly instructed jury may conclude, notwithstanding
the frailties of eyewitness identification, that the eyewitness’ testimony is
reliable and may enter a conviction on those grounds.  This may be so even
where the Crown has relied on only a single eyewitness; see Mezzo, at p.
844; R. v. Nikolovski, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1197, at para. 23.

[41]                         
Although the duty to assess the credibility and
weight of an eyewitness’ evidence sits with the jury and, in some
circumstances, the testimony of one eyewitness will support a conviction, the
jury should not be permitted to convict on the basis of eyewitness testimony
that could not support an inference of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  In other
words, a jury should not be instructed that it may convict based on eyewitness
testimony alone where that testimony, even if believed, would necessarily leave
reasonable doubt in the mind of a reasonable juror; see R. v. Arcuri,
2001 SCC 54, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828, at paras. 21-25; R. v. Reitsma, [1998]
1 S.C.R. 769, rev’g (1997), 97 B.C.A.C. 303; R. v. Zurowski, 2004 SCC
72, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 509; United States of America v. Shephard, [1977] 2
S.C.R. 1067, at p. 1080.  Indeed, where the Crown’s case consists solely of
eyewitness testimony that would necessarily leave reasonable doubt in the mind
of a reasonable juror, the trial judge must direct an acquittal upon a motion
for directed verdict (Arcuri, at para. 21).  

[42]                         
In my view, it would have been unreasonable for
the jury to convict Mr. Hay based solely on Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness
testimony.  In addition to the usual frailties associated with eyewitness
identification and photo lineups, the evidence at trial established several other
problems with Ms. Maillard’s ability to identify Mr. Hay as the shooter.  As
described above, Ms. Maillard’s initial selection of Mr. Hay from the photo
lineup was accompanied by a statement that she was not identifying him as the
shooter, but as someone who shared 80 percent of the likeness of the shooter. 
Furthermore, within a couple of days of the shooting, Ms. Maillard called the
police to confirm whether the person she had selected was “pretty much the
right person or not”: A.R., vol. II, at pp. 893-94.  Also, the evidence
established that three weeks after the shooting Ms. Maillard was not able to
select Mr. Hay as the shooter based on his arrest photo taken the day of the
crime and that, at the preliminary inquiry, Ms. Maillard repeatedly identified
Mr. Eunick, not Mr. Hay, as the shooter in the blue/green shirt.  Each of these
events raised some doubt as to Ms. Maillard’s ability to identify Mr. Hay as
the second shooter.

[43]                         
To be sure, the Crown did adduce evidence to
address some of the problems with Ms. Maillard’s testimony.  It elicited
testimony from Ms. Maillard that, despite her statements to the contrary when
she selected Mr. Hay’s photo on the morning of the shootings, she did
intend to identify Mr. Hay as the shooter.  Furthermore, the Crown introduced
hair clippings found in Mr. Hay’s bathroom and electric razor to explain that
Ms. Maillard was unable to identify Mr. Hay based on his arrest photo because
he had cut his hair.  

[44]                         
In my view, however, this evidence does not
support the conclusion that Ms. Maillard’s testimony, on its own, provided a
basis for conviction.  Ms. Maillard’s testimony that she intended to identify
Mr. Hay as the shooter could not erase the reasonable doubt created by her
confirmation at the time of the photo lineup that she could not identify him as
the shooter and by her inability to identify Mr. Hay at the subsequent photo
lineup and at the preliminary inquiry.  Furthermore, although the Crown’s
explanation that Mr. Hay cut his hair after the shooting gave the jury a basis
for reconciling Ms. Maillard’s difficulty in identifying Mr. Hay in the second
photo lineup, the explanation itself relied on confirmatory evidence ―
the hair clippings.  It thus does not change the fact that Ms. Maillard’s
testimony, in and of itself, would not have permitted a reasonable juror
to conclude without reasonable doubt that Mr. Hay was one of the shooters.  

[45]                         
For these reasons, in my view, it would have
been an error for the trial judge to instruct the jury that it could convict
Mr. Hay based solely on Ms. Maillard’s evidence.  Indeed, in this appeal, the
Crown has not attempted to argue otherwise.  The Crown has instead argued that
the trial judge made no error because he never instructed the jury that it
could have convicted Mr. Hay based on Ms. Maillard’s testimony alone.  I turn
to that argument next. 

(2)     
Whether the Trial Judge Erred in Instructing the
Jury 

[46]                         
In my view, the Court of Appeal correctly held
that the trial judge made no error in instructing the jury regarding Ms.
Maillard’s eyewitness testimony. 

[47]                         
When reviewing a jury charge, “[a]n appellate
court must examine the alleged error in the context of the entire charge and of
the trial as a whole”:  R. v. Jaw, 2009 SCC 42, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 26, at
para. 32.  Where an impugned reference in a jury charge in isolation could be
understood to be an incorrect statement of the law, an appeal court will not
interfere if it is evident that, considering the charge as a whole, the jury
would have been properly instructed: ibid., at paras. 3 and 24.  

[48]                         
Furthermore, although appeal courts will
interfere when a jury has not been adequately instructed, a trial judge must be
afforded a certain degree of flexibility in instructing the jury; see R. v.
Avetysan, 2000 SCC 56, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 745, at para. 9.  A trial judge is
not required to use “any particular form of words” in instructing the jury
regarding the frailties of eyewitness evidence and, rather, must be afforded
considerable latitude in deciding how best to apprise the jurors about those
frailties: Turnbull, at p. 552; R. v. Candir, 2009 ONCA 915,
257 O.A.C. 119, at para. 110.  

[49]                         
In the present case the trial judge made the
following general remarks about the reliability of eyewitness evidence, prior
to revisiting in detail the evidence against Mr. Eunick and Mr. Hay: 

There
has been eyewitness testimony from a number of witnesses.  You must be very
cautious about relying on eyewitness testimony to find either of the two
accused persons guilty.  That caution is required because experience has taught
us that all identification evidence suffers from an inherent frailty.  Human
observations and recollections are notoriously unreliable in this area.

 

Indeed,
many cases of miscarriage of justice have been due to mistaken identification
by one or more responsible witnesses whose honesty was not challenged and who
had ample opportunity for observation, but whose identifications subsequently
proved to be erroneous.

 

You
may have no doubt that a witness or witnesses are certain in their own minds
that they observed and recognized the proper identifying characteristics, but a
convincing witness, who is perfectly honest, may also be mistaken.  A person
can be sure in his or her own mind about an identification and yet be
mistaken.  In that context, you must bear in mind the distinction between
credibility or truthfulness, as opposed to reliability or accuracy.

 

So
I repeat, ladies and gentlemen, you must be very cautious about relying on
eyewitness testimony alone to find either of the defendants guilty of any
crime.  In the past, there have been miscarriages of justice. Persons have been
wrongly convicted because eyewitnesses have made mistakes in identifying the
persons whom they saw committing the crime.

 

As
a result, you should look for confirmatory evidence to support the eyewitness
identification evidence.  If you find other evidence to support the eyewitness
identification evidence, you may decide that the frailties associated with a
conviction based only on identification evidence has been discounted.  It will
be up to you.

 

But
even if you find no confirmatory evidence ― even though you are to
exercise caution because of the frailties of eyewitness identification evidence
― you are, nevertheless, entitled to convict on the evidence of even a
single eyewitness if you accept that witness’ identification and find that it
proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  But you should exercise real caution
before convicting on this type of evidence alone. [Emphasis added; A.R., vol. V, at pp. 2145-46.]

Mr. Hay contends that the
last paragraph of this excerpt would have left the jury with the understanding
that it could have convicted him based on Ms. Maillard’s testimony alone.  

[50]                         
Taken in isolation, the statement that the jury
was “entitled to convict on the evidence of even a single eyewitness” may
appear to do that.  However, I agree with the Court of Appeal that such an
interpretation of the trial judge’s instruction is belied when the full context
of the jury charge is considered.  

[51]                         
As the Court of Appeal observed, the impugned
instruction was, as a general matter, a correct statement of the law.  As mentioned
above, a jury may convict on the basis of a single eyewitness’ testimony,
notwithstanding the frailties of eyewitness identifications, if the witness’
testimony could support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 

[52]                         
Furthermore, the impugned instruction was made
in the context of general instructions that applied to both Mr. Hay and his
co-defendant, Mr. Eunick.  With respect to Mr. Eunick, there were multiple
witnesses whose testimony could have supported a finding of guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt.  Witnesses Jennifer Moore and Hugh Robinson, for instance,
were both able to recognize Mr. Eunick from their past dealings and identify
him as one of the shooters during and immediately after the shooting. 

[53]                         
After the general instruction excerpted above,
the trial judge provided additional cautions regarding the frailties of
eyewitness testimony and then reviewed the evidence against each defendant. 
The trial judge’s instruction regarding the evidence against Mr. Hay did not
convey to the jury that it could convict Mr. Hay based solely on Ms. Maillard’s
testimony.  Rather, in reviewing Ms. Maillard’s testimony, the trial judge
described each of the specific problems with her identification, including her
inability to identify Mr. Hay at the second, sequential photo lineup ―
which he described as “a better way of showing photographs” than the first
photo lineup (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2178) ― and Ms. Maillard’s
misidentification at the preliminary inquiry.  After reviewing these problems
the trial judge stated:

You must be
very careful of the evidence of Ms Maillard because of the problems that I have
pointed out.  You should look for other evidence confirming her
identification. [Emphasis added; A.R., vol. V, at p. 2181.]

In addition, the trial
judge distinguished Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness account from the stronger
eyewitness evidence against Mr. Eunick: 

In the case
of Leisa Maillard, unlike Hugh Robinson and Jennifer Moore, she had never seen
the person she picked out of the lineup ― Leighton Hay ― before. 
Her evidence must, therefore, be approached with greater caution.  [A.R., vol.
V, at p. 2186]

[54]                         
I agree with the Court of Appeal that “[i]n the
face of those instructions, it is fanciful to think that the jury would have
convicted Hay solely on the eye-witness testimony of Ms. Maillard” (para. 48). 
Mr. Hay’s argument boils down to a contention that the trial judge was required
to say words such as “you may not convict Mr. Hay based on Leisa Maillard’s
testimony alone”.  However, the trial judge was not circumscribed to instruct
the jury as to the sufficiency of Ms. Maillard’s testimony using those
particular words.  He had a duty to “convey to the jury as trier of fact the
relevant legal principles and how they apply to the evidence adduced at trial”,
and he must be afforded some latitude in determining the best way to do so:  R.
v. Pickton, 2010 SCC 32, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 198, at para. 61.  A reasonable
juror instructed in the manner described above would not have interpreted the
impugned statement as an instruction that the jury could render a conviction
based solely on Ms. Maillard’s testimony; see Jaw, at para. 24.  

[55]                         
The record establishes that the trial judge put
great care into his jury charge and, in particular, into the instructions as to
eyewitness evidence.  The trial judge, for instance, gave a mid-trial
instruction to the jury regarding the frailties of eyewitness testimony
immediately after Ms. Maillard testified, in which he reiterated the problems
with her evidence.  At that time, he gave both parties an opportunity to object
and make submissions requesting additional instructions, but neither counsel
did so.  Furthermore, prior to instructing the jury at the end of the trial,
the judge held a pre-charge hearing, in which he accepted submissions on the
instructions relating to eyewitness testimony.  During that hearing, counsel
for the Crown and both defendants were all asked to consider the paragraph Mr.
Hay now impugns, and all counsel expressed satisfaction with its language. 
Counsel for Mr. Hay made several submissions regarding the problems with Ms.
Maillard’s identification, each of which the trial judge made note of and
subsequently included in his instructions to the jury.  At no time during any
of these hearings did any party express the view that the trial judge’s
instruction would convey to the jury that it could convict based on Ms.
Maillard’s testimony alone.  

[56]                         
For these reasons, I am of the view that the
trial judge did not err in instructing the jury and would dismiss this ground
of appeal. 

B.      
Motion to Adduce Fresh Evidence

[57]                         
As mentioned above, Mr. Hay has filed a motion
to adduce expert evidence regarding the forensic testing of the hair clippings
that the Crown introduced at trial.  Mr. Hay argues that the fresh evidence
establishes that the hair clippings did not come from a shave of Mr. Hay’s
scalp and that, as a result, acquittal or a new trial is warranted.  I explain
below that the motion to adduce fresh evidence should be granted and a new trial
should be ordered.  

(1)     
The Fresh Evidence

[58]                         
Mr. Hay’s fresh evidence consists of affidavits
and cross-examinations of two forensic experts, in which each expert provides
an opinion as to the percentage of hairs in the newspaper and the razor that
came from Mr. Hay’s scalp, as opposed to his face or trunk.  

[59]                         
Johanne Almer, a scientist at the Centre of
Forensic Sciences, examined the hairs introduced at trial.  In her initial
report, she concluded, based on an examination of the diameter and shape of the
individual hairs, that 68 percent of the hairs in the newspaper and 48 percent
of the hairs in the razor were indicative of facial or trunk origin.  The
remaining hairs could have been facial, trunk or scalp hair. 

[60]                         
Scientist Richard Bisbing, a second expert,
endorsed the methodology used by Ms. Almer.  After examining the hairs and Ms.
Almer’s work, he concluded that “the samples from the two items are
predominantly comprised of facial hairs” and that “[a]lthough the presence of
some scalp hairs cannot be excluded, there is no indication of a large number
of scalp hairs in either sample”: Application Record, vol. I, Tab D, at p. 3.

[61]                         
Mr. Bisbing recommended that a representative
scalp hair be obtained from Mr. Hay to improve the accuracy of the testing.  The
Crown consented.  After a representative scalp hair was obtained, Ms. Almer
conducted further examination and produced a second report affirming her
earlier conclusions.  She reported that if a particular outlier hair from Mr.
Hay’s scalp sample was excluded from her calculations, she would conclude that
at least 91 percent of the hairs from the newspaper and 70 percent of the hairs
from the razor did not originate from Mr. Hay’s scalp.  Mr. Bisbing also
conducted a second examination and agreed with Ms. Almer’s findings.  He
concluded: 

It can now be stated with a reasonable
degree of scientific certainty that the hairs from the clipper (Item 87) and
from the newspaper (Item 88) are populations of facial (beard) hair. Neither
sample contains a significant number of scalp (head) hairs to challenge this
conclusion.  [Application Record, vol. I, Tab E, at p. 3]

[62]                         
The Crown also hired two experts: David Exline,
a hair analyst, and Dr. Jeffrey Rosenthal, a professor of statistics.  Both
experts conducted a paper review of Ms. Almer’s and Mr. Bisbing’s reports
without personal examination of the hairs.  Much of the Crown experts’ analysis
focused on whether it was proper to exclude a hair obtained from Mr. Hay’s
scalp that Ms. Almer and Mr. Bisbing considered to be an outlier.  Both Mr.
Exline and Dr. Rosenthal testified that they would have included the outlier
hair.  However, both also testified that such inclusion would not have a
significant impact on the results and they would thus have reached conclusions
similar to Ms. Almer and Mr. Bisbing.  Consistent with Ms. Almer and Mr.
Bisbing, Mr. Exline testified that although he could not say with absolute
certainty that there were no scalp hairs among the hair clippings, there was,
as a scientific matter, no evidence to support the proposition that the hair
clippings represented a head shave.

(2)     
Whether the Motion to Adduce Fresh Evidence
Should Be Granted 

[63]                         
This Court considered the discretion of an
appellate court to admit fresh evidence under s. 610 of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, the predecessor of s. 683 , in Palmer.  The
overriding consideration upon a motion to adduce fresh evidence is “the
interests of justice”: Criminal Code , s. 683 ; Palmer,
at p. 775.  This requires consideration of the following principles: 

(1)   The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due
diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general
principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases:
see McMartin v. The Queen, [1964] S.C.R. 484.

 

(2)   The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon
a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial.

 

(3)   The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is
reasonably capable of belief, and 

 

(4)   It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when
taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected
the result. [p. 775]

Here, the Crown has
conceded that the expert evidence Mr. Hay seeks to adduce is credible and thus
satisfies the third factor.  As I explain below, the consideration of the
remaining factors leads to the conclusion that the fresh evidence should be
admitted. 

(a)      
Due Diligence

[64]                         
The due diligence criterion exists to ensure
finality and order — values essential to the integrity of the criminal process:
R. v. G.D.B., 2000 SCC 22, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at para. 19 (citing R.
v. M. (P.S.) (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (Ont. C.A.), per Doherty
J.A., at p. 411).  The due diligence requirement calls for an appellate court
to consider the reason why the evidence was not presented at trial: G.D.B.,
at para. 20.  However, this Court has recognized that “due diligence is not an
essential requirement of the fresh evidence test, particularly in criminal
cases” and that the “criterion must yield where its rigid application might
lead to a miscarriage of justice” (para. 19).  Nonetheless, it is an important
factor to be considered in the totality of the circumstances (ibid.).

[65]                         
Here, Mr. Hay submits that the fresh evidence
was not adduced at trial because his trial counsel was unaware that it was
feasible to perform forensic testing to determine whether hair clippings
originate from an individual’s scalp or another part of the body.  Mr. Hay has
submitted an affidavit from his trial counsel to that effect. 

[66]                         
In his reasons granting the order to release the
two exhibits for forensic testing, Cromwell J. inferred from the evidence
before him that it simply did not occur to any of the experienced criminal
lawyers that forensic testing of this nature was feasible:

This sort of forensic testing was not
conducted by the Crown in preparation for trial and was not requested on behalf
of the defence until several months after the appeal to the Court of Appeal had
been dismissed.  Defence counsel at trial indicates in his affidavit that he
was unaware that forensic analysis could distinguish between scalp and facial
hairs.  There is a letter in the record indicating that the applicant’s counsel
on the appeal to the Court of Appeal was similarly unaware of the feasibility
of such testing.  There is no evidence that the Crown was aware of this
possibility.  Given that it appears that no one requested such testing and the
potential importance of the result which might be obtained, I would infer that
it simply did not occur to any of the experienced criminal lawyers involved
that this testing was available.  [para. 8]

The parties have not
provided any reason why this conclusion should be reconsidered. 

[67]                         
In general, mere lack of knowledge on the part
of trial counsel without any indication that he inquired into the possibility
of obtaining and presenting the evidence is a factor against admitting the
evidence for the first time on appeal: McMartin, at pp. 490-91. 
However, in view of the fact that this is a criminal case, involving charges of
the most serious nature, I would not allow the evidence to be excluded solely
on the basis of a lack of diligence.    

(b)     
Whether the Evidence Bears on a Decisive or Potentially
Decisive Issue

[68]                         
It cannot reasonably be disputed that Mr. Hay’s
fresh evidence bears on a decisive issue.  As described above, the hair
clippings from Mr. Hay’s waste basket and electric razor were used in two
ways.  First, they were used to explain the discrepancy between the
eyewitnesses’ description of the shooter as having dreadlocks and the short
length of Mr. Hay’s hair at the time of his arrest.  This was also how the Crown
explained Ms. Maillard’s inability to identify Mr. Hay based on his arrest
photo.  Second, the hair clippings were used to implicate Mr. Hay by suggesting
that he had cut his hair immediately after the shooting as evidence of an
after-the-fact attempt to change his appearance.  

[69]                         
The evidence was therefore directly relevant to
whether Mr. Hay was in fact the shooter in the blue/green shirt.  

(c)      
Whether the Evidence Could Reasonably Be
Expected to Have Affected the Result

[70]                         
The fresh evidence that Mr. Hay seeks to adduce
could reasonably be expected to have affected the jury’s verdict.  The import
of the hair clippings is evident from comments made by the trial judge and
Crown counsel, the jury charge and the Court of Appeal’s analysis, each of
which I describe below. 

[71]                         
Although the Crown has sought to downplay the
significance of the hair evidence in this appeal, it relied heavily on the
haircut evidence at trial.  In his closing address, for instance, Crown counsel
painted the following picture for the jury:

When
they came home, they convened at the back of the house. Mr. Hay took off his
shirt and they began to task divide. They took Eunick’s bloody clothes to wash
them. At some point, an old piece of newspaper was laid out, and Leighton
Hay's short, short dreads were shaved off, possibly by himself but more likely
by Mr. Eunick because he knows how to cut hair. They were then dumped into the
toilet. They were taken off, and only the small hairs that weighed the least
stuck to that newspaper, and he crumpled it up and threw it in the garbage, and
that’s where it was, right on top, the last thing put in. Everything else was
flushed. 

 

Mr.
House makes something of the date of that newspaper. If I understood his
submission, the last time Leighton Hay would have shaved was June 18th. But
he keeps his hair shears for shaving in his night table. He shaved his head
that night. He threw the short dreads down the toilet. He left just the small
clippings in that piece of newspaper. 

 

Mr.
House, if he suggested to you ― and I thought he did ― that they
were all over the newspaper, they weren’t; they were wrapped up inside it.
Detective Sergeant Tony Smith testified to that. And he threw them in the
garbage. And the reason was to alter his appearance. There wouldn’t be much point
in hiding clothes and bullets, and leaving hair in the waste bin. It was in the
toilet. [Emphasis added; A.R., vol. VI, at pp. 128-29.]

[72]                         
Further, in comments made during the trial in
the absence of the jury and witnesses, the trial judge recognized that if the
Crown could establish that Mr. Hay shaved his head in the morning following the
shootings, it would be “powerful evidence” of his “identity” as the shooter and
that “he did it to alter his appearance”: A.R., vol. II, at p. 928.

[73]                         
The significance of the hair clippings was also
reflected in the jury charge.  The trial judge instructed the jury that because
Mr. Hay had a shaved head at the time of his arrest, the jury “must consider
whether the evidence establishes that Leighton Hay shaved his head that night
after he got home”: A.R., vol. V, at p. 2153 (emphasis added).  He
instructed the jury that it must consider confirmatory evidence before relying
on Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness testimony, given the frailties of eyewitness
identifications and her inability to identify Mr. Hay at the second photo
lineup and the preliminary inquiry.  He repeated multiple times that the
Crown’s explanation for Ms. Maillard’s inability to identify Mr. Hay based on
his arrest photo hinged on proving that Mr. Hay had cut his hair after the
murder, for which the only evidence was the hair clippings. 

[74]                         
The Court of Appeal too recognized that the hair
clipping evidence was significant to the Crown’s case.  In concluding that the
jury’s verdict was not unreasonable, the Court of Appeal explained that the
hair clippings allowed for a “powerful inference” of guilt which was sufficient
to “tip the scales and put this case over the unreasonable verdict threshold” (para.
36).  Given the significance of the haircut to the Crown’s case, Mr. Hay’s
fresh evidence indicating that the hair clippings did not come from a scalp
shave could reasonably be expected to have affected the result. 

[75]                         
For these reasons, I would grant Mr. Hay’s
motion to adduce fresh evidence.   

(3)     
The Appropriate Remedy

[76]                         
Having concluded that Mr. Hay’s motion to adduce
fresh evidence should be granted, I turn to the appropriate remedy.  This Court
has explained that where an appeal court is of the view that fresh evidence
would be conclusive of the issues in the case, it should dispose of the matter
accordingly: R. v. Stolar, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 480, at p. 492.  However,
where the fresh evidence is not so decisive that it would allow an immediate
disposition of the matter, but it nonetheless has sufficient probative force
that, if accepted by the trier of fact, it might have altered the result of the
trial, an appeal court should admit the evidence and direct a new trial: ibid.;
Palmer, at pp. 776-77.

[77]                         
The appropriate remedy here is a new trial.  As
I have explained above, the expert evidence indicating that the hair clippings
did not result from a scalp shave could reasonably be expected to have affected
the verdict.  However, it is not so decisive as to allow an immediate
disposition in the form of an acquittal.  The Crown, in its submissions on the
motion to adduce fresh evidence, has raised the possibility of certain
limitations or gaps in the expert evidence adduced in this appeal.  The
interests of justice require that the Court remit the matter for a new trial,
in which the Crown would have the opportunity to adduce evidence challenging
the reliability of the fresh evidence. 

VI.       Conclusion

[78]                         
For the foregoing reasons, Mr. Hay’s motion to
adduce fresh evidence is granted and the appeal is allowed.  The matter is remanded
for retrial.

                    The following are the reasons
delivered by

                    Fish J. — 

I

[79]                         
Like Justice Rothstein, and for the reasons he
has given, I would grant the appellant’s motion to adduce fresh evidence and
order a new trial.

[80]                         
Our sole disagreement relates to the trial
judge’s charge concerning the evidence of Leisa Maillard.  Justice Rothstein
finds that the trial judge did not instruct the jury that it could convict the
appellant, Leighton Hay, on the evidence of Ms. Maillard alone.  With respect,
I believe that he did.  

[81]                         
As we shall see, the trial judge and counsel
evidently thought so too.  The jury can hardly have understood the judge’s
charge differently.

[82]                         
This error is in my view fatal, though the
judge’s charge was otherwise flawless and eminently fair.  And I think it right
to add that the law in this regard is more certain now than it was at the time
of trial.

II

[83]                         
Leighton Hay stands convicted of first degree
murder and attempted murder.  Leisa Maillard was the only eyewitness who
implicated Mr. Hay in the fatal shooting of the victim.  In a photo lineup
conducted by the police, Ms. Maillard said she was “about 80 percent” sure that
Mr. Hay was the shooter, but could not answer that question “yes or no”.  She
did not identify Mr. Hay in court.  Other significant frailties in her evidence
are well set out in the reasons of Justice Rothstein (notably at paras. 15-23
and, compendiously, at para. 42).

[84]                         
In his pre-charge submissions, Crown counsel
nonetheless asked the judge to instruct the jury that they could convict Mr.
Hay on the evidence of one eyewitness alone (A.R., vol. V, at pp. 2004, 2008
and 2011).  Counsel made clear that he was referring specifically to the
testimony of Ms. Maillard (pp. 2008 and 2014).  Indeed, he could hardly have
been referring to anyone else: As mentioned earlier, no other eyewitness
implicated Mr. Hay.

[85]                         
Quite properly, Crown counsel assured the trial
judge that he “want[ed] to be able to fashion [his] closing address to the jury
in a way that’s responsible and consistent with what you’re going to be
telling them” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2014; unless otherwise indicated,
the emphasis throughout is mine).  The trial judge replied that he “[did not]
have a problem” with the Crown’s request and indicated that he would charge the
jury to that effect, though not necessarily in the wording proposed (pp. 2011
and 2014).

[86]                         
In his closing address, Crown counsel proceeded
on that understanding. This was apparent from the very outset:

I suspect
His Honour will also tell you, after considering the strength of eyewitness
testimony you’re entitled to convict on it alone if it persuades you,
beyond a reasonable doubt, that the person identified was the shooter.  [A.R.,
vol. VI, at p. 111]

[87]                         
The Crown then emphasized to the jury that this
principle applied to the testimony of Leisa Maillard:

The
lawyer [for Mr. Hay] has made much of the fact that [Ms. Maillard] said 80
percent.  She explained to you what she meant.  80 percent is of the picture,
because it may be an older picture. . . . If you accept her explanation —
there’s no reason not to — you can convict on the photo lineup and [her]
visceral reaction [to it] all alone.  If you’re troubled by it, then your
troubles will be wiped away by the overwhelming confirmatory evidence in this
case, which under Canadian law makes up for any frailties you might find in the
photo lineup. [A.R., vol. VI, at p. 117]

 

And again:

 

You
could, in this case, convict Leighton Hay on Leisa Maillard’s photo lineup . . . . [p. 119]

[88]                         
At no point in his charge did the able and
experienced trial judge correct these assertions by the Crown.  This confirms
to me, particularly in light of the pre-charge discussions, that they conformed
to the judge’s own understanding of the law.

[89]                         
Pursuant to the Crown’s closing argument, the
jury would thus have assumed that it was entitled to convict Mr. Hay based
solely on Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness “identification”.

[90]                         
Unfortunately, this misapprehension of the law
was soon to be reinforced by the trial judge in his own instructions to the
jury.

[91]                         
Early in his charge, the trial judge made clear
to the jury that “the main issue in this trial is the identity of the people
who murdered Collin Moore” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2144).  He then explained the
dangers associated with reliance on eyewitness evidence to establish guilt. 
Then, in some measure echoing Crown counsel’s prior submission, he instructed
the jury as follows: 

. .
. you should look for confirmatory evidence to support the eyewitness
identification evidence.  If you find other evidence to support the eyewitness
identification evidence, you may decide that the frailties associated with a
conviction based only on identification evidence [have] been discounted.  It
will be up to you.

 

But
even if you find no confirmatory evidence — even
though you are to exercise caution because of the frailties of eyewitness
identification evidence — you are, nevertheless, entitled to convict on the
evidence of even a single eyewitness if you accept that witness’
identification and find that it proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. [A.R.,
vol. V, at p. 2146]

[92]                         
Thus, although the trial judge urged caution, he
informed the jury in unmistakable terms that the testimony of one eyewitness
could properly ground a conviction.  The jury would therefore have understood
that this rule applied unless instructed otherwise for a particular witness. 
No such instruction was ever given.

[93]                         
More particularly, the trial judge never told
the jury that his general instructions that I have just quoted did not apply to
the testimony of Leisa Maillard.  On the contrary, soon afterward, he explained
that identification evidence is stronger if the accused was previously known to
the witness.  And he related this instruction specifically to “the
evidence against Leighton Hay” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2148).  This was
indisputably a direct reference to Ms. Maillard’s evidence implicating Mr. Hay.

[94]                         
In any event, there could be no confusion
regarding which defendant the trial judge was referring to when he instructed
the jury that it was “entitled to convict on the evidence of even a single
eyewitness” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2146).  Several eyewitnesses identified Mr.
Hay’s co-accused, Gary Eunick, as one of the shooters.  Only Mr. Hay was
identified by “a single eyewitness” — Ms. Maillard (ibid.). 
Accordingly, the only meaningful application of this general instruction was in
regard to Ms. Maillard’s testimony.

[95]                         
The judge’s subsequent instructions regarding
Ms. Maillard’s evidence, if anything, reinforced Crown counsel’s uncorrected
statement to the jury that they could convict Mr. Hay on her photo
identification alone — and reinforced as well the judge’s own instruction to
the same effect (reproduced above at para. 91).

[96]                         
For example, in terms virtually identical to the
judge’s general caution regarding eyewitness identification evidence, he later
instructed the jury that it “should look for other evidence confirming
her identification” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2181).  Manifestly, the term “should”
deprives this instruction of imperative force.  And, with respect, I am unable
to find in this or any other passage that the trial judge “instructed the jury
that it must look to confirmatory evidence” (my colleague’s reasons, at
para. 39).

[97]                         
Finally, near the very end of his charge, the
trial judge once again indicated to the jury that they could convict Mr. Hay on
the evidence of Ms. Maillard alone.  Without any suggestion that this was wrong
in law, the trial judge referred to Crown counsel’s submission that “just based
on Leisa Maillard’s evidence alone you should be sure that the shooter
was Leighton Hay” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2245).

[98]                         
As mentioned at the outset and with the greatest
of respect, I am unable in light of this record to conclude that the trial
judge did not instruct the jury that it could convict Mr. Hay on the evidence
of Ms. Maillard alone.

III

[99]                         
The Court of Appeal held, at para. 48, that
“[i]n the face of [the jury] instructions, it is fanciful to think that the
jury would have convicted Hay solely on the eye-witness testimony of Ms.
Maillard.”  My colleague Justice Rothstein agrees (para. 54).

[100]                     
Though patently speculative and certainly
unverifiable, that may in fact be so.  In light of the trial judge’s effort to
make clear to the jury that it should be cautious before convicting Mr. Hay
based solely on Ms. Maillard’s identification, it does appear unlikely that the
jury convicted Mr. Hay without any regard to the confirmatory evidence. 
Whether that is the case, however, is a question that we are neither called
upon nor entitled to resolve.

[101]                     
Rather, the issue that concerns us here is
whether the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury, and not with why
the jury decided as it did — a matter beyond our ken.

IV

[102]                     
As stated at the outset, I agree with Justice
Rothstein that the appellant’s motion to adduce fresh evidence should be
granted, that the appeal should be allowed and that a new trial should be
ordered.

allowed.

	HER HONOUR: This is an application for bail brought under the newly operating provisions of the Bail Act 2013 (NSW), in circumstances where the applicant has been charged with very serious offences under the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) of robbery armed with an offensive weapon, namely, a blood-filled syringe, as well as an offence of resisting officer in execution of duty and an escape police custody offence.
	
	
	The applicant is due for mention on 11 June at the Wyong Local Court. He has been in custody since arrest in October 2013. The application was adjourned while entry into a residential rehabilitation program was pursued. There is now evidence that the applicant has a bed available on 2 June in the Salvation Army Bridge program at Dooralong Transformation Centre.
	
	
	The Crown opposes bail in circumstances where it is submitted that the applicant poses an unacceptable risk, having regard to relevant matters specified in s 17(3) as to appearance, commission of a serious offence and safety of the victim, individuals and community. That is not an issue, but on the applicant’s case those risks can be sufficiently mitigated by conditions of bail proposed in relation to participation in the Salvation Army Bridge program earlier mentioned.
	
	
	The circumstances are such that there can be no question, in my view, that the applicant poses unacceptable risks contended for by the Crown, given the material before the Court. The risk assessment process which the legislation requires the Court to undertake is a predictive one, having regard to evidence or information considered to be credible or trustworthy in the circumstances, and made on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	It seems to me, having regard to the relevant matters which I have already mentioned, as well as the other relevant matters specified in s 17(3), including the applicant’s age and background, obvious drug and alcohol problems, and need for the rehabilitation, which this program offers, that the risks which he poses can be sufficiently mitigated by the imposition of bail conditions on strict terms.
	
	
	The parties have addressed me on the operation of the Bail Act, because there is no bed available to the applicant today in the rehabilitation program. That is available on 2 June. It is common ground between the parties that, in the circumstances, pursuant to s 12(3) the Court can grant the applicant bail for a specified period, namely, from 2 June until the applicant ceases participating in the program, at which point his bail would come to an end. That, it is common ground between the parties, does not amount to the imposition either of an accommodation requirement, which is dealt with in s 28 of the Act, and under s 28(3) is one available only to a child, at present there being no relevant regulations which could apply to these circumstances.
	
	
	It is also common ground that the proposed bail condition does not impose pre-release requirements, which are dealt with in s 29 of the Act. I agree with the parties’ submissions as to the operation of those aspects of the legislation, and I am satisfied that, in accordance with s 12(3), bail for a specified period of the kind proposed can be ordered by the Court in accordance with that provision.
	
	
	For all of those reasons, I am going to grant the application on strict conditions as to bail.

2634408,NSW Crime Commission v Nehme [2016] NSWSC 1410,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	By summons filed on 30 September 2016, the plaintiff seeks various orders under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act). All references to statutory provisions in these reasons are references to the Act unless otherwise stated.
	
	
	The summons sought an order pursuant to s 10A restraining dealings with any interest in property, including certain property described in Schedule One to the summons; orders pursuant to s 12(1)(b)(i) authorising the examination of the defendant concerning her financial affairs, including the nature and location of any property in which she has an interest; an order pursuant to s 12(1)(c1) requiring the defendant to furnish to the plaintiff within 21 days a statement verified on oath setting out full particulars of all her property as set out in Schedule Two to the summons; and an order pursuant to s 28A that the defendant pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds of her unexplained wealth (the unexplained wealth order).
	
	
	The orders sought in the summons, apart from the unexplained wealth order, were sought ex parte on the day of filing the summons, 30 September 2016.
	


The evidence in support of the application


	
	In support of its application the plaintiff relied on the following documents:
	


Affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 29 September 2016; and

Statement of Facts and Circumstances relied on in an application for a restraining order and an unexplained wealth order pursuant to r 1.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) dated 29 September 2016 (Statement of Facts and Circumstances).

Relevant statutory provisions


	
	Section 10A relevantly provides:
	


“10A Proceedings for restraining orders

(1)   Application for order

The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court, ex parte, for a restraining order in respect of specified interests, a specified class of interests, or all the interests, in property of any person (including interests acquired after the making of the order).

…

(3)   The Commission may only apply for a restraining order that relates to interests in property derived from external serious crime related activity if the person who has the interests is domiciled in New South Wales or the property is situated in New South Wales.

(4)   Notice to affected person of application

Despite the application for a restraining order being made ex parte, the Supreme Court may, if it thinks fit, require the Commission to give notice of the application to a person who the Court has reason to believe has a sufficient interest in the application. A person who is required to be notified is entitled to appear and adduce evidence at the hearing of the application.

(5)   Determination of applications

The Supreme Court must make a restraining order if the application for the order is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that:

(a)   in the case of an application in respect of an interest referred to in subsection (1) - the authorised officer suspects that:

(i)   the person whose interest is the subject of the application has engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities…

and stating the grounds on which that suspicion is based …

and the Court considers that, having regard to the matters contained in any such affidavit and any evidence adduced under subsection (4), there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.”


	
	The plaintiff’s application for an order under s 10A was made ex parte, as it is entitled to do under s 10A(1). I considered the documents relied upon in support of the application in chambers.
	


Consideration


	
	The plaintiff’s application is supported by the affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 29 September 2016. Mr Spark, who is an authorised officer of the plaintiff within the meaning of s 4(1) of the Act, deposes to his suspicion that the defendant has engaged in serious crime-related activity or crime-related activities (as defined by s 6), namely dishonestly obtain financial advantage by deception contrary to s 192E(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), which falls within the definition of “serious criminal offence” pursuant to s 6(2)(d) of the Act.
	
	
	Mr Spark sets out the grounds for his suspicion in [4] of his affidavit. He deposed to communications with Detective Senior Constable Graham Baxter regarding the Facts Sheet and questions Mr Spark posed to Detective Baxter. Detective Baxter confirmed in an email to Mr Spark that he drafted the Facts Sheet and that it was, to the best of his knowledge and belief, true. Detective Baxter confirmed that the defendant was charged and that her legal representative had indicated at a hearing in the Local Court that a plea of guilty was likely. I note that the Director of Public Prosecutions has elected to have the matter proceed on indictment in the District Court.
	
	
	Mr Spark inspected the plaintiff’s records which confirmed that the COPS data base had been inspected by one of the plaintiff’s officers and revealed that the defendant was charged on 24 February 2016 with offences specified in the Facts Sheet.
	
	
	Mr Spark also deposed to investigations he has caused to be made into the defendant’s property interests as a result of which he has ascertained that the defendant is the registered owner of the property described in Schedule One to the summons, being a houseboat known as “Dream On”. Mr Spark deposed to his knowledge of the potential for persons who own such chattels to dispose of them in the absence of a restraining order.
	
	
	Section 10A(5) provides, in substance, that I am obliged to make the order sought if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the officer suspects that the defendant has engaged in a crime-related activity and setting out the grounds for the suspicion. I consider that, having regard to the matters contained in the affidavit, there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.
	
	
	In all the circumstances I am satisfied that Mr Spark’s affidavit meets the requirements of s 10A(5) as to the matters which he suspects.
	
	
	I am also satisfied, having regard to Mr Spark’s affidavit, that there are reasonable grounds for his suspicion. I have been guided by what the High Court said in George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26; 170 CLR 104 at [14].
	
	
	I do not consider that it would be appropriate to require the plaintiff to notify the defendant of the application under s 10A(4) in light of Mr Spark’s evidence. I accept Mr Spark’s evidence as to the speed with which marine vessels can be transferred (or notifications of disposal backdated). Such transfers have the effect of defeating the operation of the Act and restraining orders made under it.
	
	
	The defendant is domiciled in New South Wales and the boat is situated in New South Wales. Accordingly, the Commission is entitled to make this application for a restraining order: s 10A(3).
	
	
	The orders, other than the restraining order, are designed to ensure that the plaintiff is apprised of the full extent of the defendant’s property interests. These orders are, accordingly, ancillary to the restraining order which, in terms, restrains dealing with any interest the defendant may have in property as defined by s 7. The Statement of Facts and Circumstances states that the plaintiff also seeks, in its summons, an unexplained wealth order.
	
	
	In all the circumstances, I consider it to be appropriate to make the orders.
	
	
	I note the undertaking given by the solicitor for the plaintiff, being the usual undertaking as to damages.
	
	
	On the basis of that undertaking I make orders in terms of the draft minute of order provided to me by the plaintiff, as set out below.
	


Orders


	
	Upon the Plaintiff giving the usual undertaking as to damages (the giving of which by its solicitor being noted), I make the following orders:

	Liberty is granted to the Plaintiff and Susan Nehme to apply on three (3) days’ notice.
	
	
	The costs of obtaining these orders shall be costs in the cause.
	
	
	Pursuant to Rule 36.4(1)(a) of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 these orders are to take effect as of the date hereof.
	
	
	The balance of the Summons be listed for mention before the Common Law Duty Judge on 30 January 2017.

2634433,R v RMW [2016] NSWCCA 211,"Judgment

INTRODUCTION


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: This was a difficult case.  For the reasons set out by Bellew J the offending was serious and a proper application of sentencing principles should have resulted in a fulltime custodial sentence.  When considering whether to re-sentence, this Court has to look at the circumstances as they presently are.  Accordingly with some reservations, I agree with Bellew J that the residual discretion should apply and the Crown appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	DAVIES J: I agree with Bellew J.
	
	
	BELLEW J: On 4 March 2015, following the entry of pleas of guilty in the Local Court, RMW (“the respondent”) was committed for sentence to the District Court in respect of the following offences:
	



	
	administering a poison to KW, namely Chloral Hydrate, so as to endanger the life of KW, with intent to injure KW (count 1);
	
	
	administering poison with intent to injure KW (count 2);
	
	
	assaulting KW (count 3); and
	
	
	assaulting KW (count 4).
	



	
	The offending in count 1 was contrary to s. 39 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (“the Act”) and carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. The offending in count 2 was contrary to s. 41 of the Act and carried a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. The offending in each of counts 3 and 4 was contrary to s. 61 of the Act and carried a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment.
	
	
	On 4 March 2016 the respondent was sentenced in the District Court as follows:
	



	
	Count 1 – imprisonment for 1 year and 10 months to commence on 4 March 2016 and to be served by way of an Intensive Corrections Order;
	
	
	Count 2 – imprisonment for 1 year to commence on 4 March 2016 to be served by way of an Intensive Corrections Order;
	
	
	Count 3 – imprisonment for 3 months to commence on 4 March 2016 to be served way of an Intensive Corrections Order; and
	
	
	Count 4 – imprisonment for 3 months to be commence on 4 March 2016 to be served by way of an Intensive Corrections Order.
	



	
	The Crown now appeals against the sentences imposed upon the respondent on the grounds more fully set out below.
	


THE FACTS


	
	A statement of facts was tendered before the sentencing judge and was in the following terms (noting that names have been anonymised so as not to identify the respondent’s child who was the victim of her offending):
	


Background

1. The offender was born on 14 January 1980 (now 35 years of age). She is married to PW and they have two children – the victim KW (DOB: 1 February 2006, now 9 years of age) and LW (DOB: 11 September 2003, now 12 years of age). The two children are now under the Parental Responsibility of the Minister until they reach the age of eighteen years. They are presently in the care of their maternal grandmother, RW.

2. KW was born at Gosford Hospital on 1 February 2006 suffering severe oxygen starvation at birth. She was transferred to Liverpool Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit where she experienced complications lasting eleven days. These complications included Neonatal seizures, meconium aspiration and severe respiratory distress.

3. These early complications left KW with brain damage, developmental delay of about three years, epilepsy and cerebral palsy. In March 2010, KW had a Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastronomy (PEG) tube inserted into her stomach due to concerns with her aspiration of food.

4. KW came under the care of the Paediatric Neurology Department at John Hunter Hospital on 18 October 2007 when she was twenty months old. She remains under their care, in particular under the care of Dr Robert Smith, Paediatric Neurologist.

5. During the years prior to the offences, KW had been confined to a wheelchair most of the time, fed by way of the PEG tube and was on a range of medications to assist with sleeping, control of epilepsy and the associated side effects of those medications.

6. From the time that KW first came under the care of the Paediatric Neurology Team until the arrest of the offender on 5 July 2013, KW was admitted to the John Hunter Children’s Hospital on forty four occasions. Thirty five of these admissions were unplanned/emergency admissions. Not all presentations at Hospital had an obvious or apparent medical cause. After excluding medical possibilities and acquiring other opinions from peers in the medical community, the medical team considered induced illness and/or poisoning. Over time, Dr Smith became increasingly concerned that the offender was inducing further illness in KW by poisoning her with overdoses of prescribed, or previously prescribed, medication.

7. On 3 April 2013, KW suffered a seizure which resulted in her losing consciousness and falling into a coma. She was transported by ambulance to Wyong Hospital and later transferred to John Hunter Hospital where she remained in Intensive Care in a coma state for over four weeks. Dr Smith states that the severity of this coma measured by length and initial severity/depth culminated in an extremely life-threatening situation. KW was unconscious, intubated and ventilated for three weeks.

8. After she came out of the coma, KW was transferred to a general ward and then suffered an unexplained dramatic relapse back into a coma on 4 May 2013. KW also had frequent intermittent periods of agitation without coma during recovery. These events all increased the medical team’s suspicion of poisoning. Documentation showed that periods of reduced consciousness followed closely the administration of either medication or fluids via the PEG tube by the offender. Suspicion was also increased by the fact that the offender almost never left the child’s bedside.

9. In addition to the 3 April 2013 admission, KW has suffered twelve unexplained life threatening coma episodes with no unified medical explanation.

10. Dr Smith was so concerned about the possibility of the offender inducing illness in the victim that he sought the help of the police. A referral was made to the Joint Investigation Response Team (JIRT) on 6 May 2013. By letter dated 8 May 2013, Dr Smith outlined his concerns to JIRT and requested the assistance of police to investigate those concerns.

11. A police investigation commenced and on 9 May 2013, a surveillance device warrant was issued permitting the placing of a surveillance device into the hospital room occupied by KW. During this hospital admission, the assaults committed by the offender were captured on the surveillance device.

Common Assault – 14 May 2013 – s.61

12. At about 12.31pm on 14 May 2013, the offender and KW were in the hospital room. KW was on her hospital bed trying to reach out to a portable DVD player sitting on the table over her bed. KW tried to pick up the DVD player but accidentally dropped it on to the floor. The offender grabbed KW by the arm and pushed her back onto the pillow before hitting her across the face. The offender said angrily “Don’t touch it”. KW put her hands to her head and then lay motionless. The offender said “Now you’ve broken it.” The offender shoved KW back roughly and pulled the sheet over her.

13. KW was seven years of age at the time of this offence and in hospital having recently awoken from a lengthy life threatening coma.

Common Assault – 16 May 2013 – s.61

14. At about 8.06am on 16 May 2013, the offender and KW were in the hospital room. KW was in her hospital bed and the offender was feeding her some cereal. The offender handed the container of dry cereal to KW and turned away. KW put her arm out and the container flopped sideways on the bed causing the cereal to spill out. The offender turned back, saw this and hit KW to the face with the back of her hand. The impact caused KW’s head to jerk backwards. The offender said “that’s enough” and KW cried. The offender angrily said “Don’t throw it.” KW continued to cry and rubbed her head. A nurse entered the room and said “Oh, we’re having a bad day.” The offender said “Yes, just a lack of sleep”. KW had been observed to sleep from 8.15pm to 8am the night before.

15. KW was seven years of age at the time of this offence and in hospital having recently awoken from a lengthy life threatening coma.

Use poison so as to endanger life with intent to injure 4on 5 July 2013 – s.39

16. During the police investigation, the offender continued to complain to medical staff about the poor sleeping habits of KW. The medical staff therefore arranged for KW to be admitted to John Hunter Hospital on 3 July 2013 for the purposes of a sleep study. A surveillance device was installed in the hospital room that KW was placed in.

17. Following KW’s admission to hospital, her sleep patterns were monitored by the staff and no issues were identified. KW appeared to have a full and restful night’s sleep on both 3 July and 4 July.

18. At around lunchtime on Friday 5 July 2013, the offender was informed that she was going home for the weekend and was to return to Hospital on Monday afternoon to be admitted to the specialist sleep unit for a fully monitored overnight visit. The offender had believed that KW would be spending the weekend in hospital.

19. The Officer in Charge of the investigation, Detective Senior Constable Donna Waite was monitoring the surveillance device during the afternoon of 5 July 2013. KW was calmly sitting in her bed reading a book. The offender then commenced feeding KW through her feeding tube. At around 2.26pm, the OIC observed the offender pour an unmeasured quantity of liquid directly from a bottle into KW’s PEG tube. At 2.27pm, the offender again poured an unmeasured quantity directly from the bottle into the PEG tube. At the time, the OIC was on the telephone to Dr Smith and conveyed what she was witnessing to him.

20. At around 2.31pm, a nurse entered the room and assisted the offender with a blockage of the PEG tube. The offender flushed the PEG tube with water. After the nurse left the room at around 2.34pm, the offender again poured an unmeasured quantity of liquid directly from the bottled into the PEG tube. The offender then placed the bottle into a sealed bag and concealed it. She flushed the tube again and at around 2.35pm made a notation in the log she had been keeping.

21. The offender then placed KW into a wheelchair and left the room. At around 2.45pm, the Nursing Unit Manager entered the hospital room occupied by KW and located the bottle used by the offender. It was identified as Chloral Hydrate, a sedative that Dr Smith had previously prescribed KW to assist her sleeping. After KW’s April admission for the life-threatening coma, Dr Smith and others had directed the offender not to use Chloral Hydrate anymore. Dr Smith had been very clear in directing that Chloral Hydrate not be used on KW because the medical team had concerns at that stage that it was involved in her coma episodes.

22. At around 3.15pm, the offender and KW returned to the room and it was clear that KW’s demeanour had changed. The offender lifted KW onto the bed. KW was agitated, shrieking and thrashing around in her bed. After a period of time, she became quieter and still.

23. At 3.16pm, the offender drew up an unmeasured quantity of Chloral Hydrate from the bottle with a syringe and injected it into KW’s PEG tube. The offender then concealed the bottle and flushed the syringe. The offender remained calm and controlled throughout the commission of this offence.

24. The offender then changed KW’s nappy and called for the nurse at 3.18pm. A nurse entered the room and the offender said “Can we test her obs? I was coming down anyway because she’s gone real doey, sleepy, just funny.” The offender laughed. The offender said “She’s just really doey, sleepy, slurred speech … She’s glassy eyed, she was happy and alert.” By 3.28pm, KW was non-responsive.

25. At 3.29pm KW’s medical team including Dr Smith attended the room. The offender said “She just started to go all funny about twenty minutes ago, all dopey and funny.” Whilst the medical team were present, KW’s condition deteriorated to the point where at around 3.40pm she was unconscious.

26. At 3.52, the offender was arrested in the hospital room. Once she was removed from the room to be transported to Waratah Police Station, medical staff drained the contents of KW’s stomach and she was moved to another room for observations. KW was initially profoundly unresponsive/comatose to the point that an intensive care consultation was requested at about 5pm. During that period she became less comatosed and was therefore observed on the ward until she roused at around 11.30pm later that night. KW was discharged from Hospital on 9 July 2013.

27. The now empty 200ml bottle of Chloral Hydrate was located in a makeup bag inside the offender’s handbag hanging in the wardrobe of the hospital room.

Interviews with the Offender

Administer poison with intent to injure charge – s.41

28. At 3.52pm, the offender was arrested and later transported to Waratah Police Station. She participated in a lengthy interview from 6.41pm to 8.32pm where she denied all the allegations despite being informed of the existence of the surveillance device in the hospital room.

29. During the course of the first interview, the offender stated that the Chloral Hydrate was stopped “’Cause the doctor thinks that it could be contributing to the coma states. It’s not a drug that you’re supposed to be using long term.” She further stated that “it was stopped two months ago. But we haven’t used it within that two month period.” Shortly after that, the offender stated that she had used it “probably three or four times” since KW’s discharge in May.

30. During the course of an interview with Psychologist Theresa Lindfield on 23 October 2013, the offender stated that she may have used Chloral Hydrate on KW after May 2013 up to a dozen times.

31. When asked during the first interview with police why she had used Chloral Hydrate after being told not to by Dr Smith, she states “Just ‘cause she won’t sleep and can’t get her to sleep. Don’t know what else to do. Know that she’s had it before.” The offender then admits that the last time she administered it was the Tuesday night prior to her arrest.

32. After the first interview, the offender was returned to the custody area and sometime later asked to speak to the OIC again. The offender participated in another interview at 9.46pm where she told police “I gave KW Chloral Hydrate this afternoon.”

33. The offender made the following admissions in her second interview:

That she gave KW about 15mls of Chloral Hydrate.

She was tempted to give her more but the bottle was empty.

“I thought she’d go have a sleep and then we can have a rest this afternoon that we’d be able to stay at the hospital and they’d help us and I can go home on my own.”

“I just wanted her to have a rest so I could have a rest and I just wanted people to help so we’d be able to stay at the hospital longer ‘cause, I think they’re gunna send us home this afternoon, I didn’t wanna go home.”

“I just thought she would … sleep this afternoon like she normally had at home with that dose and just sleep and been OK.”

The 200ml bottle of Chloral Hydrate emptied today was possibly issued by the pharmacy on 27 May 2013 and since then she had given it to KW on five separate occasions.

“… I knew that I shouldn’t have given her Chloral and Robert (Dr Smith) said not to give it …”

She does not recall hitting KW in the face.

34. A search warrant executed at the home of the offender on 5 July 2013 resulted in police locating another 200ml bottle of Chloral Hydrate at the home.

Chloral Hydrate and Endangering Life

35. Use of Chloral Hydrate on KW was commenced on 7 March 2009. A dose of 1 gram at night was commenced after a smaller dose of 500mg was not as successful. The largest dose KW was on was 12mls in September 2011.

36. Dr Smith describes Chloral Hydrate as being a good hypnotic frequently used in Paediatrics. Normally it would be used to foster good sleep patterns and then weaned if possible. The medical team developed concerns that continued use in KW may have been implicated in subsequent coma and/or withdrawal symptoms. Dr Smith recommended slow weaning off Chloral Hydrate commencing 8 January 2012. The offender was involved in the discussions about this process. By May 2012, KW was prescribed 8mls per night and by November 2012, 3mls per night. It was finally stopped during her April 3 2013 admission.

37. On 17 May 2013, Dr Smith wrote on KW’s chart that KW was “NOT FOR CHLORAL”.

38. Dr Smith and other members of the Neurology team had several discussions with the offender during which they clearly stated that they never wanted KW to have Chloral Hydrate again. The offender was resistant to this move which is why Dr Smith emphasised it in his entry in the medical notes.

39. Dr Smith states that the pouring of the medication directly into the PEG tube is “inappropriate, inaccurate and potentially extremely dangerous.” He further stated that it is “unpredictable and dangerous. For this reason it would have endangered the life of KW. Also at a time when the medical team had concerns that any administration of Chloral Hydrate may have been influencing the coma and was dangerous for KW. We had strongly and repeatedly advised RMW not to give Chloral Hydrate for this reason.”

40. Dr Smith states that a dose of 15mls would likely produce deep sleep/unconsciousness. The risk of side effects such as suppressed breathing becomes higher with such doses.

41. Professor William Allender provided an expert report stating that “Chloral hydrate may cause respiratory depression, depression, convulsions, arrhythmias, coma and if, sufficient of the drug is ingested, death. The risk is increased in the presence of other central nervous system depressants such as amitriptyline.” KW was being administered amitriptyline at the time.

42. The contents of KW’s stomach on 5 July and blood serum samples were analysed with the results indicating that Chloral Hydrate was present. The blood contained approximately 17mg of trichloroethanol per litre. Chloral Hydrate is rapidly converted to Trichloroethanol in the body. Therapeutic blood trichloroethanol concentrations range from 1.5 to 15mg/L whilst toxic concentrations generally range from 40mg/L. A wide range of blood trichloroethanol concentrations of 20 to 240mg/L, median of 119mg/L, have been reported for 14 cases of death due to Chloral Hydrate overdosage.

Current Status of KW

43. KW was removed from her mother’s care after the offender was arrested. She was in the care of her father, with the assistance of the offender’s parents, for a short time until he was arrested on unrelated matters.

44. Dr Smith is unable to provide an opinion on the extent of any permanent damage to KW as a result of the extended use of Chloral Hydrate on her. Dr Smith has concerns that the admission in April 2013 where KW needed prolonged resuscitation at the home is highly likely to have caused permanent neurological injury. Dr Smith thinks it is unlikely that they will be able to measure objectively the long term effect of repeated coma.

45. Dr Smith states “There has been a remarkable and enduring change unlike anything I have previously seen in my career. KW is active, alert, happy, assertive and moves with far more freedom than she ever has. I have withdrawn all of her medication with no problems. She has not had any seizures for a year. She has had no periods of coma. Her feeding tube or PEG tube has also been removed as she eats and drinks normally. She does not use her wheelchair.”

46. Once KW was taken from her mother’s care, her health improved dramatically and continues to do so. Specifically:

The PEG tube has been removed and KW is able to enjoy a normal diet.

KW has gained weight and is enjoying a more normal active lifestyle.

She does not need to use a wheelchair.


	
	It should also be noted that on the hearing of this appeal the Crown tendered an extract of the DVD footage taken on 5 July 2013. I have viewed that footage.
	


THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL

Ground 1 - The sentencing judge erred in finding that in administering the Chloral Hydrate, the respondent only intended to cause the victim to sleep in respect of the ss. 39 and 41 offences, leading to a manifestly inadequate sentence for those offences

The evidence on sentence


	
	The respondent gave oral evidence on sentence. In the course of her evidence in chief (at T10 L41-44), when asked why she had administered Chloral Hydrate to KW contrary to the medical advice that she had been given, the respondent said:
	


“It’s the only thing that helped to help her sleep”.


	
	Commencing at T20 L7 the respondent was again asked about her purpose in administering Choral Hydrate. She replied:
	


“That she would go to sleep and that I could sleep and that we could stay at the hospital, get the further answers that we needed”.


	
	The effect of the Crown’s cross-examination of the respondent (commencing at T30 L43) was, at least in part, to challenge her assertion that she intended nothing more than to induce KW to sleep. In the course of that cross-examination, the sentencing judge intervened (at T32 L45):
	


Q.   “So, against that background why would you then give her a dose which was above the highest she’d ever had when there was that concern that it might in fact have been a drug that contributed to that four week coma, why would you do that?

A   I’m unsure, I clearly wasn’t thinking straight”.

The reasons of the sentencing judge


	
	Commencing at ROS 5, the sentencing judge said:
	


“I accept that (the respondent) knew that the giving of the Chloral Hydrate was acting against medical advice and that the medical advice to stop the administrations of chloral hydrate was because Dr Smith was of the view that it might possibly be implicated in causing the life threatening coma in April 2013. However, there is no actual evidence before me which establishes that Chloral Hydrate was responsible for that life threatening coma. In my view, there is insufficient evidence for me to conclude that part of the thought process of the offender at the time of her commission of the s. 39 offence was that she consciously thought that what she was about to do might endanger the life of her child and notwithstanding that thought, deliberately went ahead and did something she believed might endanger her child.

The circumstances were that the child had been admitted into hospital for the purpose of a sleep test. The third day, which was the Friday, was to be the third of about five or six days, and the expectation held by the offender was that KW would remain in the hospital over the weekend. She was told some time Friday afternoon that that was not to be the case and that KW was to be discharged that very afternoon.

On her evidence she had been administering to her daughter the Chloral Hydrate on up to 12 occasions, mostly in the month of June, it would seem, for the purpose assisting KW to sleep, and that there had been no complications arising from that use, so far as she was aware.

It seems to me that the most likely scenario, and certainly the scenario that the Crown cannot dismiss as a possibility, is that she decided at 2.30 in the afternoon that the only way that she could cause the hospital staff to change their mind about releasing KW was if KW fell asleep at that point in time.

The fact is that she administered this medication in a way which was rough in terms of the calculation, although what was subsequently found on medical examination is not inconsistent with the quantities that she indicated that she had used, namely, a total of approximately 15mls.

Whilst it is correct to say that she had information in terms of what Dr Smith’s opinion was in relation to the Chloral Hydrate, it would seem that she did not necessarily share that view and she says that she had some four years of using this substance. Given that situation, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she did not simply consider that to administer it that afternoon would induce sleep, achieving the purpose of convincing the hospital to keep her in over the weekend for observation. 

I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she contemplated that what she was doing would endanger the life of her child, and I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she determined that she would go ahead to achieve her own purpose and put the life of her child at risk.

I accept that it was still a serious thing for her do, that is to deliberately induce loss of consciousness in her child in order that the child would be allowed to stay in hospital, the reason for which being that she simply could not cope. That may in fact have been perfectly correct, that she could not cope, but there were remedies for that, other than the administration of this medication to induce a loss of consciousness” (emphasis added in each case).


	
	Further, at ROS 11, his Honour said:
	


“I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she used the medication to render her daughter unconscious, which she had done on a number of occasions in the past in order to force sleep on her daughter, but that she did so on the this occasion on 5 July, not to put her daughter to sleep for the purpose of ensuring that she slept overnight, but rather to ensure that the medical staff then changed their mind and kept KW in over the weekend, and that she did that because she could not cope with the prospect of going home and the looking after her, and I accept that that decision was the culmination of the emotions of a woman who was largely responsible for a child who was developmentally delayed, suffered cerebral palsy and epileptic seizures, and who had been in and out of hospital for quite a few years, essentially for the better part of her life, seven years (emphasis added).”

Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that it was apparent from his findings that the sentencing judge had equated a loss of consciousness with sleep. It was submitted that it was not reasonably open to the sentencing judge to reach such a conclusion.
	
	
	Importantly, the Crown submitted that it was an element of the offending in each of counts 1 and 2 that the respondent intended to injure KW. It was submitted that an intention to induce sleep could not amount to an intention to injure and that accordingly, his Honour’s conclusions were at odds with the fundamental basis upon which the respondent’s pleas of guilty to the offending in counts 1 and 2 had been entered. The Crown pointed out that the word “injure” was not defined for the purposes of ss. 39 or 41 of the Act, and that its meaning had not been the subject of any judicial consideration. However, the Crown pointed to the dictionary definition of “injure” as including “physical damage to a person’s body”. Whilst the Crown accepted that an “injury” need not be permanent, it was submitted that it must be more than something that is merely transient. The Crown submitted that sleep does not physically damage a person’s body and could therefore not have constituted an “injury” for the purposes of the offending in either of counts 1 or 2.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the Crown submitted that in sentencing the respondent on the basis that she only intended to induce KW to sleep, the sentencing judge had failed to sentence the respondent on the basis of the pleas that she had entered. It was submitted that this error affected the entirety of the sentencing process and lead to a situation where the sentencing judge had sentenced the respondent on an incorrect basis.
	


Submissions of the respondent


	
	Counsel for the respondent submitted that the findings of the sentencing judge as previously set out were open, and were completely consistent with the finding which had been urged upon him by the Crown Prosecutor who appeared on the sentence proceedings. In these circumstances, it was submitted that the Crown’s submissions in this court represented a departure from the way in which the matter had been conducted at first instance.
	


Consideration


	
	As I have noted, the offending in count 1 was contrary to s. 39(1) of the Act which is in the following terms:
	


39 Using poison etc to endanger life or inflict grievous bodily harm 

(1) A person is guilty of an offence if:

(a) the person administers to another person, or causes another person to take, any poison, intoxicating substance or other destructive or noxious thing, and

(b) the poison, intoxicating substance or other thing endangers the life of, or inflicts grievous bodily harm on, the other person, and

(c) the person intends to injure, or is reckless about injuring, the other person.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years.

(2) If on the trial of a person charged with an offence against this section the jury is not satisfied that the offence is proven but is satisfied that the person has committed an offence against section 41 or 41A, the jury may acquit the person of the offence charged and find the person guilty of an offence against section 41 or 41A. The person is liable to punishment accordingly.


	
	For the purposes of s. 39(1)(c), count 1 to which the respondent pleaded guilty alleged that she intended to injure KW. By her plea, the respondent admitted that this was her intention.
	
	
	The offending in count 2 was contrary to s. 41 of the Act which is in the following terms:
	


41 Using poison etc to injure or to cause distress or pain

A person is guilty of an offence if:

(a) the person administers to another person, or causes another person to take, any poison, intoxicating substance or other destructive or noxious thing, and

(b) the person intends to injure, or to cause distress or pain to, the other person.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 5 years.


	
	For the purposes of s. 41(b), count 2 to which the respondent pleaded guilty alleged that she intended to injure KW. By her plea, the respondent admitted that this was her intention.
	
	
	His Honour’s findings with respect to the respondent’s intention are not entirely clear. In the highlighted parts of the passages extracted from the sentencing remarks which appear in [12] above, his Honour variously referred to KW falling asleep, and the respondent acting as she did in order to induce KW to sleep, before making reference to the respondent deliberately inducing a loss of consciousness in KW.
	
	
	Moreover, it is not entirely clear whether, in making the observations that he did in those passages as to the respondent’s intention, his Honour was referring to the offending in count 1, the offending in count 2, or both. Further confusion arises from the fact that although the respondent asserted that she intended to do no more than put KW to sleep, when asked by the sentencing judge himself why she acted as she did, the respondent said she was not sure, and wasn’t thinking straight. There was no reference to, much less any analysis of, these particular aspects of the respondent’s oral evidence by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	Reading the sentencing remarks as a whole, I am left to conclude from the highlighted passages set out in [12] above that his Honour accepted the respondent’s evidence in chief, and found that in respect of the offending in each of counts 1 and 2, the respondent had acted as she did with the intention of putting KW to sleep. If that was his Honour’s finding, it was one which was completely at odds with the respondent’s admission, by her pleas of guilty, that she intended to injure KW. Whilst the term “injure” is not defined for the purposes of either ss. 39 or 41, as a matter of common sense sleep could not amount to an injury. The evidence which was elicited from the respondent that in administering the Choral Hydrate she intended nothing more than to put KW to sleep, should have been met with an objection by the Crown, and rejected. It was entirely inconsistent with the pleas of guilty which had been entered by the respondent.
	
	
	I am also unable to accept the submission of counsel for the respondent before this court that his Honour’s finding was in accordance with that which was urged by the Crown on sentence, and that the position of the Crown before the court therefore represents a departure from its earlier position. A fair reading of the transcript of the Crown’s cross-examination of the respondent before the sentencing judge makes it clear that the Crown challenged the respondent’s evidence. Nothing said by the Crown in the course of submissions to the sentencing judge even remotely suggested that his Honour should make the finding that he appears to have made. On the contrary, in the course of final submissions the Crown (at T18 L20-21) specifically reminded the sentencing judge of the fact that the offences were committed with intent to injure KW.
	
	
	Ground 1 is made out.
	


Ground 2 - The sentencing judge erred in characterising the ss. 39 and 41 offences as “at the lowest level of objective seriousness”

The reasons of the sentencing judge


	
	Commencing at ROS 3, the sentencing judge said the following:
	


“These offences are reasonably unique, and given that the law requires just sentences to be imposed which reflect the criminality of the particular circumstances and the particular offender, it is important not to act on suspicion, and important for me to understand that the factual basis of any sentence must be proved by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt. That means that the Crown needs to negative any reasonable factual proposition that is less serious than the one they advocate.

Even at the lowest level of seriousness, this is a serious offence. However, it is in a different category, in my view, to cases where individuals administer substances such as heroin or actual poisons.

It must be remembered that this particular substance had been administered by RMW to her daughter for approximately four years. It is clear that she was well acquainted with the medication, well acquainted with the process and with what followed the administration of the substance, and it is clear from the material that she was of the view that it was the only medication that effectively assisted KW to asleep.

There is no evidence before me of any mistreatment of KW outside of these four counts, and indeed, bearing in mind the huge number of hospital admissions over the years, it is unlikely that, if this offender was in the habit of physically abusing her daughter, there would have been no physical sign of that detected by hospital staff.

All the other evidence in terms of character evidence is that she was a loving, committed mother, and I accept that to be the case. It means that the two common assaults, which are of themselves somewhat sickening in a sense, were out of character. It is also consistent with the proposition that this lady, after some seven years, had reached the end of her tether, and perhaps handicapped by her stubborn personality and belief that she could handle it herself, found herself in a position where she clearly could not cope.

I accept that the more serious factual conclusions that the Crown asks me to draw may reflect the true position, but I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it does.”

Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown acknowledged that a finding as to the objective seriousness of offending was essentially a matter for a sentencing judge, and was a matter in respect of which an appellate court would be reluctant to interfere. However, the Crown submitted that the sentencing judge’s conclusion as to the objective seriousness of the present offending was not reasonably open in circumstances where the respondent:
	


(i)   had been expressly warned by medical professionals that KW was not to be administered Chloral Hydrate because of the particular risks and dangers that it posed;

(ii)   had been expressly warned by medical professionals that such risks were very severe, and included the possibility of KW suffering from comas;

(iii)   chose to act completely contrary to the medical advice which she had been given, at a time when KW had recently been discharged from hospital after suffering two comas, one of which was more than four weeks in duration and which was life threatening both in its severity and degree;

(iv)   administered the Chloral Hydrate to KW in imprecise doses, higher than that which had ever been prescribed, and at a time when KW was under the care of medical professionals;

(v)   had acted in a way which seriously jeopardised the health and wellbeing of KW, for the purposes of ensuring that KW remained in hospital for the respondent’s own benefit;

(vii)   had brought the Chloral Hydrate into the hospital in a surreptitious way; and

(viii)   had lied to doctors, and to the police, about administering Chloral Hydrate to KW.


	
	The Crown further submitted that the distinction drawn by the sentencing judge between the circumstances of the present case, and cases where individuals administered “heroin or actual poison”, reflected a failure to take into account the fact that once the prescription for Chloral Hydrate was withdrawn by KW’s treating specialist, the respondent’s possession of it became an offence contrary to s. 16(1)(d1) of the Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966 (NSW).
	


Submissions of the respondent


	
	Counsel for the respondent submitted that the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending was wholly a matter for the sentencing judge. It was further submitted that the sentencing judge was entitled to have regard to the fact that the respondent had intended that any effect of the administration of the Chloral Hydrate upon KW be temporary. Counsel also pointed to the fact that at least in respect of the offending against s. 39, KW was in hospital and had medical care immediately available to her.
	
	
	It was further submitted that the sentencing judge was entitled to take into account that the use of the Chloral Hydrate did not represent something in the nature of an experiment by the respondent with a new and unknown drug, but occurred in circumstances where it had been administered under prescription over a period of four years, in a way which the respondent had found efficacious as far as KW was concerned.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent also relied upon paragraph [39] of the statement of facts. It was submitted that such paragraph encompassed “the quantification of the degree of endangerment” in which KW had been placed as a consequence of the respondent’s actions. Counsel stressed that any danger was expressed in terms of it being potential, as opposed to actual.
	


Consideration


	
	The characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is a matter “classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts.” It follows that this Court will be very slow to determine such matters for itself, or to set aside a judgment made at first instance by a sentencing judge exercising a broadly based discretion. Whether this Court will intervene depends upon whether or not the particular characterisation which a sentencing judge gives to the circumstances of the offence is one which is open: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 per Spigelman CJ at [37]. Notwithstanding such constraints, the present is a case in which this Court must intervene.
	
	
	The sentencing judge did not articulate, in any precise terms, his findings as to the objective seriousness of the offending. However, it would appear from reference to the “lowest level of seriousness” that he found that the respondent’s offending, in respect of all four counts, fell at that level. If that was his Honour’s finding, it was one which, for the reasons which are set out below, was not open, and which was completely contrary to the preponderance of the evidence.
	
	
	It would appear that the bases for his Honour’s finding were that:
	



	
	the offending was less serious than offending which involved the administration of heroin or poisons;
	
	
	the respondent was “well acquainted” with the medication, with the process for its administration, and with the consequences of such administration;
	
	
	the respondent’s view was that it was the only medication that effectively assisted KW to sleep;
	
	
	there was no evidence of any mistreatment of KW outside the four counts to which the respondent had pleaded guilty;
	
	
	the respondent was an otherwise loving and committed mother;
	
	
	the offending was out of character; and
	
	
	the offending had been motivated by the fact that the respondent was at the “end of her tether” in being able to care for KW.
	



	
	Further, although not expressly stated, it would appear that part of the basis of his Honour’s finding that the offending was at the lowest level of seriousness was his earlier determination that the respondent intended to do no more than put KW to sleep. For the reasons already explained, that finding was erroneous.
	
	
	His Honour made no reference at all to a number of the matters set out in [28] above. All of those matters were relevant to an assessment of the seriousness of the respondent’s offending. They supported a conclusion that such seriousness, in respect of all counts, fell at a substantially higher level than that found by his Honour.
	
	
	His Honour also appears to have completely overlooked the danger in which KW was placed as a consequence of the respondent’s offending in counts 1 and 2. Contrary to the submissions advanced by counsel for the respondent before this court, this was a case in which the offending in counts 1 and 2 placed KW in actual, as opposed to potential, danger. Part of the evidence on sentence (to which the sentencing judge did not refer) was a report of Dr Robert Smith dated 12 January 2015. Dr Smith is a Paediatric Neurologist who has been involved with the treatment of KW since October 2007. When asked to comment about the offending of 5 July 2013 (i.e. the offending contrary to s. 39) Dr Smith stated:
	


“I have been given to understand that an unspecified and unmeasured amount of Chloral Hydrate was poured from a bottle into the PEG. We never do this as it is unpredictable and dangerous. For this reason it would have endangered the life of (KW)” (emphasis added).


	
	Dr Smith’s opinion was entirely consistent with the fact that within a short time of the Chloral Hydrate being administered on 5 July, KW was rendered unconscious.
	
	
	Further, the finding of the sentencing judge that the respondent was “well acquainted” with the medication and its administration, along with his finding that it was the respondent’s view that it was the only medication which assisted KW to sleep, completely overlooked the fact that the respondent was also aware (as set out in the facts at [36]-[38]) that Dr Smith had ceased the administration of Chloral Hydrate in April 2013, and had informed the respondent in about May 2013 that he “never wanted (KW) to have Chloral Hydrate again”. That medical advice formed an important part of the background to the respondent’s offending. In these circumstances, the fact that the respondent’s familiarity with the medication, and her views as to its benefits for KW, were not to the point. The more important consideration was that she was well aware of the fact that KW’s treating specialist had determined, obviously in KW’s best interests, that Chloral Hydrate was not to be administered at all. Seized of that awareness, the respondent nevertheless administered it to KW in the hospital, on a number of separate occasions, in doses which, although unmeasured, were obviously large. Having done so, and in circumstances where the facts record (at [22]) that KW became “agitated, shrieking and thrashing around in her bed”, the respondent proceeded to deliberately mislead nursing staff at the hospital by informing them that KW had previously been otherwise “happy and alert”.
	
	
	Moreover, and whilst it may well have been the case that the respondent was, as his Honour described, “at the end of her tether”, she was present in the hospital at the time of her offending in counts 1, 3 and 4. Accordingly, she had available to her a substantial network of immediate support of which she could have availed herself at any time without any difficulty.
	
	
	Further, his Honour approached the assessment of the respondent’s offending in what might be described as a “global way”, with an apparent emphasis on the offending in counts 1 and 2. The offending in those counts was of an entirely different kind to that in counts 3 and 4, which involved the respondent engaging in gratuitous and completely unjustified violence upon an ill and helpless 7 year old child and, having done so, failing to afford the child any degree of comfort.
	
	
	In all of these circumstances, the apparent finding of the sentencing judge that the offending fell at the lowest level of seriousness was not open.
	
	
	Ground 2 is made out.
	


Ground 3 - The sentencing judge erred in failing to have regard to the extreme vulnerability of the victim and the significant breach of trust by the respondent

The reasons of the sentencing judge


	
	At ROS 9, the sentencing judge said the following:
	


“I have considered s. 3A which sets out the purposes of sentence. I have considered s. 5 and determined that no sentence other than a sentence of imprisonment would be appropriate having regard to the level of seriousness. I have considered section 21A both in terms of mitigating and aggravating factors”.


	
	The references by the sentencing judge to those sections were obviously references to sections of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Sentencing Act”). There were no references in his Honour’s reasons to any specific provisions of s. 21A in terms of mitigating and aggravating factors.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that it was clear from the facts that KW was a person of extreme vulnerability who was reliant upon the respondent for the most basic of her needs. In the Crown’s submissions, that vulnerability arose from the fact that KW:
	



	
	was a child of only 7 years of age;
	
	
	suffered from cerebral palsy, epilepsy, brain damage and developmental delays; and
	
	
	was confined to a wheelchair most of the time, and feed by way of a PEG tube.
	



	
	It was submitted that as a consequence of those factors, the respondent was in a significant position of trust.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the vulnerability of the victim, and the position of the trust of the respondent, were significant aggravating factors pursuant to ss. 21A(2)(l) and 21A(2)(k) respectively of the Sentencing Act, which the sentencing judge was required to take into account in imposing sentence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the passage of the remarks of the sentencing judge which I have extracted at [45] above represented the sole reference to aggravating and mitigating factors prescribed by the Sentencing Act. It was submitted that the sentencing judge had completely failed to refer to the position of trust held by the respondent, the breach of that position, and the extreme vulnerability of KW. In these circumstances, the Crown submitted that the statement of the sentencing judge that he had “considered” the aggravating and mitigating circumstances for which provision is made in s. 21A of the Sentencing Act was insufficient, and that his Honour had paid little more than “mere lip service” to the requirements of that section.
	
	
	The Crown further submitted that the failures of the sentencing judge in these various respects were heightened by the fact that KW’s vulnerability, and the respondent’s associated abuse of her position of trust, were arguably the most significant aggravating factors in the case. It was submitted that in such circumstances, there was an obligation upon the sentencing judge to expressly refer to them and that in the absence of having done so, this court should infer that he had failed to take them into account. This, it was submitted, resulted in the sentences being infected by error.
	


Submissions of the respondent


	
	Counsel for the respondent submitted that notwithstanding the fact that the sentencing judge had not made any “formulaic recitation” of aggravating and mitigating factors, his remarks on sentence nevertheless clearly demonstrated that he was “alive to these considerations”. It was submitted that the entire case was litigated on the basis of the relationship of mother and child, and the effect of the respondent’s role as caregiver upon her. It was submitted that in circumstances where issues of trust and vulnerability underlay the entirety of the case advanced on behalf of the respondent, the error asserted by the Crown was not made out.
	


Consideration


	
	The significance of particular mitigating and aggravating factors in the sentencing process will necessarily vary. However on the facts of the present case, KW’s vulnerability, the respondent’s position of trust, and her breach of that position, were obviously significant aggravating factors.
	
	
	In R v Mills [2005] NSWCCA 175; (2005) 154 A Crim R 40 Wood CJ at CL (with whom Grove J and Hoeben J (as his Honour then was) agreed) observed (at [39]):
	


“ ….. in relation to s. 21A of the Act, more is expected than lip service to the legislation. What is required is a clear identification of the relevant factors, the weight given to them, and their role in the structuring of the sentencing order: see R v Walker [2005] NSWCCA 109”.


	
	More recently, in RCW v R (No 2) [2014] NSWCCA 190; (2014) 244 A Crim R 541, R A Hulme J (with whom Bathurst CJ and Adams J agreed) said (in the context of the relevant considerations on sentence which are set out in s. 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)) at [58]:
	


“The use of shorthand expressions such as ‘I have taken into account all those matters set out in s. 16A’ … do not illuminate anything of the judge’s reasoning or conclusions: see, for example, R v McNamara [2005] NSWCCA 195 at [137] (Hall J) and DBW v R [2007] NSWCCA 236 at [33] (Spigelman CJ)”.


	
	In the present case, the sentencing judge failed to make any reference to, much less specifically identify, what were arguably the two most significant aggravating factors in the sentencing process. That failure occurred in circumstances where in his closing submissions, the Crown Prosecutor (at T24 L31-32) specifically referred to KW’s vulnerability as being a relevant consideration on sentence.
	
	
	I am driven to the conclusion that the provisions of s. 21A of the Sentencing Act were not considered properly, if at all, by the sentencing judge. I am fortified in that view by the fact that there is an obvious, and significant, disconnect between a statement that relevant aggravating factors had been taken into account, and a finding that the seriousness of the respondent’s offending fell at the lowest end of the scale.
	
	
	Ground 3 is made out.
	


Ground 4 – The sentencing judge erred in failing to partially accumulate the sentences

The reasons of the sentencing judge


	
	At ROS 9, the sentencing judge said the following:
	


“I will comply with the High Court’s decision in Pearce by imposing discrete sentences on each of the four counts but I will apply the principal of totality so that the total effective sentence represents the total effective criminality.

In my view it is appropriate in this case to impose concurrent sentences, so that the sentence imposed in relation to the section 39 offence will reflect the total criminality.”

Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown acknowledged that the extent of accumulation is a discretionary matter for a sentencing judge, in the exercise of his or her intuitive synthesis. However the Crown submitted that in the present case, not only was the criminality displayed in respect of each offence serious, the various offences themselves were discrete and independent, and had occurred on separate occasions. It was submitted that in these circumstance, one sentence could not be seen to encompass the criminality for the other offences, and that some degree of accumulation was required.
	


Submissions of the respondent


	
	Counsel for the respondent submitted that questions of accumulation were entirely a matter within the discretion of the sentencing judge. He further submitted that sentencing judge was entitled to form the view that all sentences should be concurrent.
	


Consideration


	
	In determining the issue of concurrency of sentences, the question to be asked is whether the criminality of one offence can be encompassed in the criminality of the other. If not, then the sentences imposed should be at least partially cumulative, otherwise there is a risk that the sentence will fail to reflect the totality of the relevant criminality: Franklin v R [2013] NSWCCA 122 at [44] per Hoeben CJ at CL (Hall and Davies JJ agreeing) citing Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41.
	
	
	Each episode of offending to which the respondent pleaded guilty reflected quite separate and distinct criminality. Count 1 involved offending committed within the hospital which, as I have pointed out, threatened KW’s life. The offending in count 2, although of the same kind as that in count 1, occurred in the home, at a time more proximate to the respondent receiving medical advice that KW was not to be administered Chloral Hydrate. The offending in counts 3 and 4 was quite different again. Although those two episodes of offending were separated in time by a period of approximately 3 hours, the criminality was of a different kind to that in counts 1 and 2.
	
	
	His Honour expressed no reasons at all to explain why he reached the view that the sentences should be concurrent. In all of these circumstances, this was not a case in which wholly concurrent sentences properly reflected the totality of the respondent’s criminality.
	
	
	Ground 4 is made out.
	


Ground 5 – The overall sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.

Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that an overall sentence of 1 year and 10 months imprisonment, to be served by way of an Intensive Corrections Order, was not sufficiently adequate to recognise the objective seriousness of the offending, and the particular circumstances in which it occurred.
	
	
	In terms of the offending contrary to ss. 39 and 41, the Crown repeated its earlier submissions as to the vulnerability of KW and the respondent’s abuse of her position of trust. The Crown further submitted that the offending in counts 3 and 4 had been committed by the respondent for trivial reasons, in circumstances where she had made no attempt to take any remedial action after she had struck KW.
	
	
	The Crown specifically acknowledged that there was evidence before the sentencing judge to support the conclusion that the respondent was suffering from depression. However, the Crown pointed out that the sentencing judge had found that there was no causal connection between that condition and the respondent’s offending. Whilst further acknowledging that the respondent’s depressive condition was relevant to the question of general deterrence, the Crown submitted that it remained necessary to denounce the respondent’s conduct. It was submitted that notwithstanding the medical evidence, the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate and below the range that could be justly imposed for offending of this nature, having regard to applicable sentencing standards.
	


Submissions of the respondent


	
	Counsel for the respondent submitted that the present case was “truly unique” and that the sentencing judge had correctly approached it as one which required individual justice. Counsel stressed, in particular, that the sentencing judge could not reasonably have ignored the effect, on the respondent, of a seven year period of being the victim’s primary carer. It was submitted that taking into account all of these factors, the sentence imposed was not manifestly inadequate.
	


Consideration


	
	The approach of the Crown to the present appeal was, in effect, to rely upon each of grounds 1 to 4 both individually, and as particulars of the manifest inadequacy asserted in ground 5. In dealing with grounds 1 to 4, all of which I have concluded are made out, I have made reference to the relevant aspects of the offending.
	
	
	For the reasons I have already expressed, the circumstances of the entirety of the respondent’s offending warranted a conclusion that its objective seriousness was of a substantially higher level than that determined by the sentencing judge. Whilst psychiatric reports before the sentencing judge set out matters which were properly taken into account in mitigation, the overall sentence imposed was, for the various reasons set out in dealing with grounds 1 to 4, manifestly inadequate. The offending required the imposition of a substantial full-time custodial sentence.
	


THE RESIDUAL DISCRETION

Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown properly acknowledged that in terms of the exercise of this court’s residual discretion, the present case was a difficult one. In doing so, the Crown accepted that there was some evidence before this court of the rehabilitation which the respondent had undergone since being sentenced. The Crown also accepted that the imposition of a full-time custodial sentence would have the obvious effect of interfering with that rehabilitation.
	
	
	However notwithstanding these matters, the Crown submitted that the sentences imposed were so far outside of the appropriate range that this court should intervene. It was submitted that in all of the circumstances, it was incumbent upon this court to denounce the respondent’s offending by the imposition of a full-time custodial sentence.
	


Submissions of the respondent


	
	Counsel for the respondent relied upon the fact that a considerable period of time had now passed since the matter was determined by the sentencing judge, in which the respondent had undertaken various obligations imposed upon her by the orders which had been made. Counsel provided to the court a series of documents which, it was submitted, generally demonstrated a commitment by the respondent to the obligations which had been imposed upon her by virtue of the orders made by the sentencing judge.
	
	
	Counsel for the respondent also relied upon an affidavit of the respondent of 15 August 2016 in which the respondent deposed to the fact that:
	



	
	she has engaged in regular counselling;
	
	
	she had commenced employment for 2 to 3 days each week in a business operated by her father; and
	
	
	she subsequently commenced full-time employment with another employer, and had satisfied her probationary period.
	



	
	The respondent also confirmed that she continues to see both of her children whenever she is permitted to do so, and that her children display considerable warmth towards her. In that respect, the general tenor of the respondent’s affidavit is that the re-establishment of those relationships is positive, both from the point of view of the respondent herself as well as that of each of the children.
	
	
	The respondent also relied upon an affidavit of Carolyn Buchanan who confirmed the respondent’s attendance for regular counselling.
	


Consideration


	
	It is incumbent upon the Crown to satisfy this court that the residual discretion to decline to intervene should not be exercised: CMB v Attorney-General for New South Wales [2015] HCA 9; (2015) 317 ALR 308 at [33]; [54]. In considering that question, it is relevant to observe that the imposition of the manifestly inadequate sentence in the present case was not caused or perpetuated by the conduct of the Crown before the sentencing judge, nor has there been any relevant delay in the Crown filing its Notice of Appeal or in notifying the respondent that such a step had been taken.
	
	
	As the Crown properly acknowledged, the imposition of something less than a full time custodial sentence at first instance is a matter which bears upon the question of whether this court should intervene. Notwithstanding the manifest inadequacy of the sentences which were imposed on the respondent, and the numerous errors which have been identified, I have come to the view that this court should not intervene.
	
	
	The affidavit evidence before this court makes it clear that the respondent has made a good degree of progress in her rehabilitation since the sentences were imposed. Even more significantly, there is evidence that although the respondent’s children have been removed from her care, she has been able to re-establish, at least to some degree, her relationship with each of them. That is obviously important to the respondent. Her impression, which I accept, is that it is also a positive factor from the point of view of each of the children.
	
	
	Intervention by this court would, for the reasons I have explained, result in the imposition of a substantial sentence of full-time custody. Although there is no specific evidence before the court, it is reasonable to assume that such a step would, at least for some period of time, completely sever the relationship that the respondent presently has with her children. Even if some steps could be taken to allow the respondent to see her children in custody, the circumstances in which she could do so would obviously be less than ideal. That would, in all likelihood, result in adverse consequences, not only for the respondent but for her children as well.
	
	
	It is for those reasons that I have concluded that this court should not intervene. That, of course, is not to detract from the unavoidable conclusion that the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate, and were infected by the numerous errors that have been identified.
	
	
	I propose the following order:
	



	
	The Crown appeal is dismissed.

LAI SIU CHIU JC
 
 The background
The plaintiffs are a firm of solicitors and the defendants are their insurers under a policy numbered LPL 4891 dated 20 February 1987 (`the policy`) covering professional liability for the period 2 January 1987 to 2 January 1988 to a limit of $300,000. In Suit No 2961 of 1987 (`the suit`) the plaintiffs were sued (as the third defendants) by one Lee Siew Chun (`Lee`) on a mortgage dated 2 July 1984 (`the mortgage`) in which the plaintiffs had acted purportedly for Lee as mortgagor. The first defendant in the suit was Sourgrapes Packaging Products Trading Pte Ltd (`Sourgrapes`) and the second defendant was Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd (`the bank`).
 Lee`s claim in the suit arose from the following facts:
(a) She jointly owned with her husband, Hoh Sou Yen (`Hoh`), a property situated at No 64 Lorong 24A Geylang (`the property`). In June 1984, Hoh died. She took out the title deeds to the property from the parties` safe deposit box before he passed away and gave them to her son Hoh Weng Cheong (`the son`) to photocopy as a precaution. A day after Hoh`s death, the son requested Lee to sign a piece of paper, which was written in English and which he said was a testimonial to his good character, which Lee did. 
(b) As it turned out, the piece of paper which Lee signed was not a testimonial for the son but the last two pages of a mortgage for the property, purportedly given by Lee and Hoh in favour of the bank as security for credit facilities granted by the bank to Sourgrapes, which company was controlled by the son`s brother-in-law and in which the son worked. Unknown to Lee, after she had signed the mortgage, the son forged Hoh`s signature thereon. 
(c) It was later discovered that a legal assistant of the plaintiffs, one Gurdaib Singh (`Singh`), had purportedly witnessed the signatures of Lee and Hoh on the mortgage and signed an attestation clause to the effect that the signatories had appeared before him and they were known to him personally. The attestation was untrue as the mortgage had been presented to Singh by the son with Hoh`s forged signature and already signed by Lee. For the forgery, the son pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months` imprisonment in July 1987 whilst his brother-in-law was acquitted. 
(d) Lee sued the plaintiffs vicariously for Singh`s act alleging (in paras 7, 8 and 11(c) of the statement of claim) that Singh had unlawfully conspired to cheat and defraud her. The bank joined the plaintiffs and Singh as third parties to the suit alleging that Singh made representations to them which were fraudulent, reckless and negligent. 
(e) In a judgment (`the judgment`) dated 17 December 1992 (reported at 
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 297
 ) the learned judicial commissioner Michael Hwang: 
(i) rejected Lee`s plea of non est factum and dismissed her action against the bank; 
(ii) found the plaintiffs vicariously liable for Singh`s negligent conduct and apportioned liability equally between Lee and the plaintiffs; 
(iii) held that the plaintiffs were entitled to a full indemnity from Singh. 
(f) In so far as it is relevant to this claim, Lee did not adduce any evidence to support her allegation of conspiracy against Singh and her counsel conceded that she had abandoned this aspect of her claim. Singh gave evidence on his own behalf and, on Singh`s conduct, the learned judicial commissioner made the following findings (at p 321)): 
(i) he had allowed the son to take the mortgage away for his parents (Lee and Hoh) to sign and had then witnessed the parents` signatures and had also signed the attestation certificate in the form prescribed by s 12(6)(b) of the Registration of Deeds Act (Cap 281, 1970 Ed); 
(ii) the two acts of Singh were negligent and fell short of the standard of reasonable care and skill expected from a reasonably competent solicitor however inexperienced; no attempt was made to defend his conduct on this score; 
(iii) it was an unusual case of solicitor`s negligence as Singh`s statements to a third party (the bank) resulted in loss to Lee; 
(iv) the negligent misstatements ought not to be analyzed in the context discussed in 
 Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners 
 but simply viewed as negligence in carrying out a solicitor`s professional duty because, unlike 
 Hedley Byrne 
, the misstatements made in this case resulted in loss to the solicitor`s own client, not to a third party; 
(v) in any event, Singh was negligent in not seeing Lee before witnessing her signature and attesting her acknowledgment, and this would not be a negligent misstatement, but a negligent act or omission; and 
(vi) whichever way one looked at the facts, there was no difficulty in concluding that Singh was liable for negligence.
 
 The O 14 application
Relying on the judgment (on which there was no appeal by any party), the plaintiffs brought this action claiming under the policy:
(i) a declaration that the plaintiffs are entitled to be indemnified by the defendants against their liability to Lee, including her costs; 
(ii) a declaration that the plaintiffs are entitled to be indemnified by the defendants against their own costs of defending the suit; 
(iii) interest; and 
(iv) costs on a full indemnity basis.
 Upon the defendants` solicitors entering an appearance to this suit, the plaintiffs applied for summary judgment supported by an affidavit of N Ganesan (`Ganesan`) who was a partner of the plaintiffs at the time this claim arose. In his affidavit, Ganesan, inter alia, stated:
(a) When Lee filed the suit against the plaintiffs, he instructed the plaintiffs` solicitors to inform the defendants and a claim was made under the policy. 
(b) When the plaintiffs were served with the writ, the plaintiffs notified the defendants and requested the latter to take action in accordance with the cover provided under the policy. 
(c) The defendants denied liability on the ground that the policy does not cover what gave rise to Lee`s claim, citing paras 7, 8 and 11 of the statement of claim. 
(d) As Singh had clearly been vindicated in the judgment in respect of the allegations of fraud and conspiracy made against him and the plaintiffs, there was no basis for the defendants` continued repudiation of liability and they were obliged to indemnify the plaintiffs in full for damages payable to Lee and for the expenses incurred by the plaintiffs in defending the suit.
 At the hearing before the learned assistant registrar on 17 November 1993, the defendants were granted unconditional leave to defend the plaintiffs` claim. The plaintiffs appealed against his decision and, when the appeal came up for hearing before me, I allowed the appeal and awarded the plaintiffs final judgment on their claim.
 The defendants in resisting the plaintiffs` application had filed an affidavit by their claims manager, Loh Kim Choo (`Loh`), who deposed to the following:
(1) On or about 23 November 1987, the defendants were informed by the plaintiffs that an action had been instituted against them by Lee. 
(2) At the trial of the suit, there was no adjudication on the issues of fraud, conspiracy, fraudulent and reckless misrepresentation. Therefore, Ganesan`s contention in his affidavit that the issues of fraud and conspiracy were dismissed is incorrect as no findings were made thereon. 
(3) Therefore, it was not true to say that the defendants had no basis to repudiate the policy under the relevant exclusion clause therein which states:
 
1 This policy shall not indemnify the insured against any claim:
(b) brought about or contributed to by any dishonest, fraudulent, criminal or malicious act or omission of the insured, or the predecessors in business of the said firm, or of any person at any time employed by the insured or such predecessors in business. 
It is reasonably clear that Singh had attested deliberately and knowingly to the fact that both mortgagors had personally appeared before him and affixed their signatures when in fact they did not and could not as Hoh had passed away the day before. 
(4) Singh`s conduct was not negligence contemplated under cl 1 of the policy which covers: 
(a) ... breach of professional duty as lawyers by reason of any negligent act or error or omission, whenever or wherever committed or alleged to have been committed ... 
Singh`s conduct constituted fraudulent misrepresentation as, by signing the attestation clause, he falsely represented to the bank that the mortgagors had appeared before him and voluntarily executed the instrument, with the intent that the bank would advance a loan in reliance thereon. 
(5) The relevant legal principles used to distinguish a negligent act from one which is intentional and therefore not covered by the terms of the policy are complex and by no means clear-cut, they have to be fully canvassed at trial.
 Ganesan filed a second affidavit in reply to Loh`s affidavit. He:
(a) refuted Loh`s argument that there are complex issues of law involved - either Singh`s act was negligent or it was not, the trial judge had made a finding of fact that Singh`s act was negligent only; 
(b) pointed out that Singh`s conduct was investigated by the commercial crime division of the Criminal Investigation Department (`CID`) and no charges were laid against him thereon. Instead the CID referred the matter to the Law Society `for whatever action [it] deemed fit`; 
(c) said the Law Society did investigate into the matter, Singh was brought before the disciplinary committee established under the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 1990 Ed) (`LPA`) who found him guilty of grossly improper conduct in the discharge of his professional duties within the meaning of s 80(2)(b) of the LPA but his conduct was not sufficiently grave as to warrant any further disciplinary action other than a reprimand. If indeed Singh had been guilty of fraud, it is inconceivable that he would only have been reprimanded; and 
(d) contended that there being no evidence put forward by the defendants to support their allegation of fraud other than a mere assertion, their defence was a sham.
 At the 0 14 hearing, counsel for the defendants relied on the definition of fraud in 
 Derry & Ors v Peek, Baronet 
 to support his contention that there are triable issues which warrant the case proceeding to trial. He submitted that, whilst there was no finding of fraud, there was a clear finding that the acts of Singh vis vis the bank`s solicitor was the cause of the loss and, as it was not disputed that Singh had no belief that the statements he made to the bank`s solicitor were true, therefore those acts are fraudulent. The defendants based their defence on the decision of Devlin J in 
 West Wake Price & Co v Ching 
 that a clause under a policy which provides cover for negligent acts will only extend cover to claims arising purely out of negligence but not if there is negligence as well as fraud.
 At the appeal stage, counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the decision of the learned assistant registrar should be reversed for the following reasons:
 
(i) There is no provision under Singapore law that renders it illegal to attest to a deed if the attestation is not true and, as there is no such provision, Singh`s act would only come within the principle of 
 Haseldine v Hosken 
 if it was done in pursuance of a fraud on either the bank or Lee. The defendants have not put forward any evidence that Singh was fraudulent and it was a finding of the court that Singh`s conduct was negligent not fraudulent. 
(ii) Lee`s claim against the plaintiffs was not based on fraud, it was a strict case of negligence; indeed, her counsel at the trial conceded that he could not lead any evidence on fraud. 
(iii) The burden of proof is on the defendants to prove their allegation of fraud, which standard is very high. 
(iv) The defendants` plea of fraudulent misrepresentation cannot be sustained as Singh acted in the capacity of a solicitor when he signed the attestation, he was not a party to the mortgage nor did he act as agent for any party - a misrepresentation which induces a contract gives a remedy to the party who was misled against the party who did the misleading, it does not give rights against third parties. 
(v) Whilst Singh knew that what he attested to was not true there was no evidence and no finding that he did so dishonestly so as to come within the exclusion clause. 
(vi) 
 Derry v Peek 
 is concerned with the tort of deceit and the definitions of `fraud` and `fraudulent` therein are not for all purposes, as examples `fraud` as in `fraudulent preference` under the Companies Act and in criminal law have different meanings. In whatever sense fraud is understood, the key ingredient required is the mental element - an intention to defraud must be present, and that was missing in Singh`s case. 
(vii) There is no evidence that Singh intended to deceive the bank to act to its detriment. 
(viii) In any case, no fraud was perpetrated on Lee as no representation was made to her, therefore there can be no liability to her under the 
 Derry v Peek 
 situation. 
(ix) The defendants deny liability for the reason that Singh committed a fraud on the bank but the plaintiffs are not asking the defendants to indemnify them against the bank`s claim - they are asking the defendants for an indemnity against Lee`s claim which has nothing to do with the tort of deceit. This is clear from the judgment where (at p 327D) it is stated:
 
This has been a sorry tale to hear, with all parties to a greater or lesser extent being victims of the fraud of the true culprits, who have not been sued. It is distressing that the parties who are guilty of 
 only negligence
 and who can ill afford the loss, have had to bear it in this case ... [Emphasis added.]
(x) The defendants have, therefore, not raised any credible defence.
 
 The decision
I accepted the arguments of counsel for the plaintiffs and, inter alia, awarded final judgment against the defendants in accordance with prayers 1 and 2 of the statement of claim with liberty to apply on prayers 3 and 4. Subsequent to the appeal, the parties appeared before me on 23 December 1993 to say that Lee`s claim for damages had been assessed and, accordingly, I ordered that the defendants pay to the plaintiffs, alternatively directly to Lee, the sums of:
(a) $256,537.02 (being 50% of the judgment sum in the suit); 
(b) $7,641.10 being interest thereon; and 
(c) further interest from 24 December 1993 until payment at 8% pa.
 The defendants have appealed against my decision and I now give my reasons.
 I had inquired of counsel for the defendants as to how he intended to prove fraud on the part of Singh should the case proceed to trial as no facts were stated in Loh`s affidavit to substantiate the allegation. Counsel explained that the defendants relied on the meaning of fraud set out in 31 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
(4th Ed), para 1059, that is: 
not only a misrepresentation known or believed by the representor to be false when made ... but ... mere non-belief in the truth was also indicative of fraud. Thus, whenever a person makes a false statement which he does not actually and honestly believe to be true, for purposes of civil liability, that statement is as fraudulent as if he had stated that which he did not know to be true, or knew or believed to be false. Proof of absence of actual and honest belief is all that is necessary to satisfy the requirements of the law, whether the representation has been made recklessly or deliberately; indifference or recklessness on the part of the representor as to the truth or falsity of the representation affords merely an instance of absence of such a belief.
 Counsel argued that Singh, by his attestation, informed the bank`s solicitor, Chan Weng Kee (Chan), that Lee and Hoh appeared before him, which Singh knew was false. Once he knew that the representation was false, Singh`s motive in making the misrepresentation is wholly irrelevant (see para 1061 of 
 Halsbury`s Laws 
, supra). The defendants have to prove that Singh, when he made the representation to Chan, had no honest belief in that representation. The only issue between the parties is how Singh`s act vis vis the bank should be characterized, which issue was not dealt with in the suit.
 I did not accept counsel`s foregoing argument. I could not visualize how the defendants would be able to resurrect the issue of fraud if this claim proceeded to trial, and counsel could not assist me. It bears mentioning that two other forums besides the trial judge in the suit (the CID and the Law Society) had taken the view that what Singh did was not tantamount to fraud but was only negligent. In order to prove fraud, the defendants would have to adduce fresh evidence from Chan and or some other representative(s) for the bank and I cannot imagine that their testimony will be any different from the evidence which has already been adduced in the suit. Counsel also said the defendants intended to rely on the judgment. Again, the defendants would not be able to prove fraud thereby as they must be deemed to accept the trial judge`s finding that Singh`s conduct was negligent, not fraudulent, a finding against which there is no appeal.
 I could not accept counsel`s argument that Singh`s acts came within the definition of fraud under the 
 Derry v Peek 
 situation. For the principles enunciated in 
 Derry v Peek 
 to apply, the defendants have to satisfy the following tests:
(a) that Singh was one party to the contract and that his conduct induced the other contracting party to enter into the contract; this was not what happened. Indeed Singh, like Lee (the contracting party), was deceived by the same person (the son). The representation made by Singh was not made to the representee, the contract was not between Singh and Lee but between Lee and the bank. Another peculiar aspect of the case was that there was not even a relationship of solicitor and client initially between Singh and Lee when the attestation clause was signed; Singh was then taking instructions from the son, who represented the borrower, Sourgrapes (although the trial judge held that a duty of care as between solicitor and client must be imputed to Singh towards Lee); 
(b) they would have to prove that Singh did not have an honest belief even though he may have made the false representation (1) knowingly, or (2) without belief in its truth, or (3) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false. If Singh, due to his inexperience, did not have the honest albeit naive belief that he was merely helping out someone (the son) who was a friend and whose parents could not come to his office, I cannot imagine that the trial judge, as well as the Law Society and the CID, would not have come to a different conclusion on his conduct.
 It seemed to me there would be such an uphill task for the defendants if they proceed to trial that there is little likelihood of their succeeding in their defence of fraud by Singh. It bears repeating that the plaintiffs` claim is for an indemnity against Lee`s claim, not against the bank`s claim. Therefore, even if Singh`s conduct can be said to be fraudulent against the bank, it is irrelevant to this claim. Under the circumstances, the distinction drawn in 
 West Wake Price & Co v Ching 
 between paying on `pure` negligence but not on `mixed` claims has no application.

 1.
GP SELVAM 
 
 The sale
Cur Adv Vult
The plaintiff, an engineer by training, runs a supermarket business in the United Arab Emirates known as Al-Aharam Supermarkets.
 2.In 1981, 1982 and 1983 he went to Brazil as a tourist to watch the carnival at Rio De Janerio. During his visits to Brazil he saw some precious stones in the shops. Other than this, he claimed, he had no understanding of precious stones.
 3.In September 1986 he visited Singapore. While walking along Orchard Road a display in the defendants` jewellery shop offering 70% discount caught his eye. He went into the shop. During his stay in Singapore he patronised the shop on a few occasions. From 10 to 14 September 1988 he made purchases evidenced by 12 invoices/cash memos. The total value of the purchases exceeded a million Singapore dollars. A substantial part of the purchases comprised amethysts, aquamarines, topaz, tourmalines and beryls. There were also small jewellery items. His purchases of 39 beryls were evidenced by five of the twelve invoices. The beryls were of three types: natural beryls (Maxixe), natural greenish yellow beryls and natural brownish beryls. At the bottom of each invoice was printed this sentence: `Goods sold are not returnable`.
 4.Each beryl purchased was accompanied by a certificate of gem identification issued by a Singapore company called International Gemological Laboratory (S) Pte Ltd (the IGL certificate). International Gemological Laboratory had its place of business very close to the defendants. The IGL certificates on their reverse side carried the following printed clauses: 
Important Limitations
 
The laboratory reports is not a guarantee valuation or appraisals and (IGL) has made no warranty or representation regarding this laboratory report or the colored stone described herein. This laboratory report contains a description of the characteristics of the colored stone based upon the application of the identification techniques used by IGL at the time of its examination.
 
By accepting this laboratory report, the client agrees (1) to release IGL, its officers, directors and employees from all liability for any loss, expense or damages of every kind and description and (2) IGL, its officers, directors and employees shall not be liable for any loss, damage or expense for any error in or omission from this laboratory report or for its issuance or use, even if caused by or resulting from the negligence or other fault of IGL or any of its employees.
 
The client agrees that this laboratory report is for his/her exclusive use. Neither IGL nor any of its employees shall be responsible for any action that may be taken based upon this laboratory report.
 
The client also agrees that in the event of any dispute arising out of this laboratory report the liability of IGL will be limited up to the fee paid for this report and in such a case IGL shall refund the fee to the client and shall be released from all liabilities and/or claim of whatsoever nature.
 
This laboratory report, the name and trademark of IGL may not be reproduced in whole or in part for purposes of advertising, publicity or promotion without express prior written authorisation from IGL.
 5.
 The claim
The purchases were sent to Switzerland by the plaintiff as air cargo consigned to his bankers. In Switzerland some of the gemstones were tested by a gemmological laboratory known as Gubelin. Gubelin reported that some of the beryls had been treated in that their colour weakened under action of strong illumination. The plaintiff brought the findings of Gubelin to the notice of the defendants and asked how the defendants wished to resolve the problem.
 6.The defendants` immediate reaction was short and to the effect that they were willing to exchange the blue beryls (Maxixe type) for amethysts. This was not acceptable to the plaintiff. He asserted that the certificates from Gubelin and IGL were not compatible. The Gubelin certificate, he said, revealed important information concerning the stones whereas the IGL certificates did not `indicate the usual technical information pertaining to the authenticity of the stones`. He declined to accept the intense blue beryls and the greenish yellow beryls and proposed to return them against refund of the moneys he had paid for them and the interest charges.
 7.The defendants had a change of heart and refused to accede to the plaintiff`s request for refund on the Maxixe blue beryls, and indeed any beryls he had purchased. Their reasons and response were as follows: 
Received your fax dated 28 January 1989. Please note that we cannot accede to your request of refund on the Maxixe blue beryls nor all the beryls you purchased. The reasons are as follows: 
(1) We have made it clear to you that `Goods sold are not returnable.` You have countersigned on each individual receipt. Please look at receipts faxed to you. 
(2) You have accepted the beryls as they are. The certification of the gems indicated on the certificates by IGL clearly shows that they are `Certificates of Gem Identification.` In fact during the course of purchase, you mentioned that you do not recognised the IGL certificates. To quote you: `They are just pieces of papers. I purchase what I like.` 
(3) The beryls were displayed in the shop and were purchased by you on your own accord without coercion. You agreed and paid the price. In view of the large purchase made by you we offered you several gift items. A list of the gift is enclosed. 
(4) Most colour stones in the market are either heat treated or enhanced in colour through irradiation. According to Guberlin`s report, the 126.65cts brownish yellow colour is stable even after five hours of strong illumination under ultra violet exposure. Sapphires and rubies are also enhanced in colour and are stable. 
(5) You mentioned that you wanted to purchase kunzite as well. According to the gem profile by David Federman, I quote: `Hot lights can, and do, turn this stone a whiter shade of pale, although colour loss is usually very gradual. Maxixe beryl are also in this category. 
(6) As for the blue beryl, the certification by IGL clearly indicates that they are of Maxixe type. All gemologists know what Maxixe means and we did not give you a false report. Unless you are still aware of what Maxixe type means. I quote a report from GIA:
 
The following is a direct quote from the Gemological Institute of America`s Assignment 29 of the 1980 copywrite edition on beryl, p 8:
 
`C Maxixe type beryl
 
In 1917, beryl of deep intense blue color was discovered in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The color sometimes likened to a cobalt blue, is unlike the color of Aquamarine. Sadly, it was found to fade drastically when exposed to light or heat. Because of this fading characteristic, the mine was closed soon after its discovery. Thus, any material with this distinctive color now on the market is probably artificially colored by gamma ray or short wave ultraviolet treatment.`
 
(7) You are making a comparison of the two reports by Guberlin, the other IGL. Gubelin gave you a more detailed representation of beryls but that does not imply that we have misrepresented you without, I quote you `indicate the usual technical information pertaining to the authenticity of the stones.` 
(8) Please do not re-negotiate after making purchases as the cost of the gems are negotiated through a package deal of aquamarines, amethysts, beryls and gifts. All prices were agreed by you throughout. The beryls were displayed in the counters. You took photos of them and negotiated the prices and selected the gifts.
 8.With that letter the defendants sent a list of 21 gift items they said they gave to the plaintiff. The plaintiff then decided to take legal action against the defendants. In the event he brought this action against the defendants for the return of the entire amount he paid under the five invoices. In the alternative, he claimed damages.
 9.
 The plaintiff`s case: tort, contract and collateral contract
The bases of his claim as set out in the statement of claim and the particulars furnished are as follows: . First, the plaintiff said that during his visits to the defendants` shop, the defendants represented to the plaintiff that:
 (1). the defendants were one of the biggest dealers in coloured gemstones in Singapore;
 (2). the defendants had a good reputation and could not afford to deal in inferior quality gemstones;
 (3). Mr Wong (the manager) and Mr Hung (the managing director) had considerable experience in coloured gemstones;
 (4). all the gemstones the plaintiff agreed to purchase were genuine, natural, without flaws and not treated in any way;
 (5). to support the representation made in (4) above, the IGL certificates identifying the coloured gemstones were produced to the plaintiff, showing that the gemstones were genuine and perfect;
 (6). if the plaintiff should in any way be dissatisfied with any of the gemstones after receiving an analysis from an independent gemological laboratory the defendant would accept such gemstone back and refund its full value;
 (7). the gemstones which the plaintiff agreed to purchase came from Brazil with which country the defendants had excellent connections.
 10.It was alleged that Mr Wong made several of the representations and Mr Hung made all the representations. All the representations were oral representations.
 11.The plaintiff added that he relied on the representations and was induced to purchase between 10 and 14 September 1988, a substantial number of gemstones as set out in the invoices. The gemstones purchased and reflected in invoices 54818, 54830, 54834, 54836 and 54841 subsequently proved to be defective in that they had been treated. The representations made by the defendants were untrue and/or were made negligently in that the defendant failed to exercise any or proper care to ascertain whether the gemstones were defective. The defendants failed to exercise any or proper care to ascertain whether the gemstones were of the quality and description as described to the plaintiff. In consequence the plaintiff suffered loss and damage.
 12.Secondly, the plaintiff contended that the representations set out under items (4), (5) and (6) above were included as terms of the contracts between the parties. The contracts were evidenced by the oral representations and the invoices. There were implied in the contracts the following terms: (a). that the gemstones being sold corresponded with their description in the said invoices/cash memos;
 (b). that the gemstones were of merchantable quality;
 (c). that the gemstones were fit for their intended purpose.
 13.The intended purpose was resale and it was communicated to the defendants. In any case such purpose was to be implied from the plaintiff`s conduct. The defendants were in breach of the contracts and the implied terms. In consequence the plaintiff suffered loss and damage.
 14.Thirdly, the representations were terms of a collateral contract or series of collateral contracts pursuant to which the plaintiff agreed to enter into the contracts. The defendants were in breach of the collateral contracts. In consequence the plaintiff suffered loss and damage.
 15.The gemstones in respect of which he brought the action were particularised as follows:

 . $677,528
 16.
 The defence
By their re-amended defence the defendants took issue with the plaintiff as follows: the defendants denied the plaintiff`s claim that he informed them that `he had only a limited knowledge of gemology and was purchasing gemstones for resale`.
 17.The defendants admitted having made the first three representations attributed to them but denied having made the next four representations. As regards the sixth representation, the defendants said that they expressly made it clear to the plaintiff that `goods sold are not returnable` which words were in bold letters on all the invoices/cash memos. The defendants further denied telling the plaintiff that they had excellent connections with several business dealers in gemstones. They admitted that all the gemstones sold to the plaintiff were from Brazil.
 18.The defendants went on to assert that at all material times they had expressly made known to the plaintiff that they were selling the gemstones to him subject to and in reliance on the IGL certificates given by International Gemological Laboratory containing the conditions and limitations printed on the back of the said certificates.
 19.The defendants admitted that the plaintiff purchased the gemstones as set out in the 12 invoices/cash memos but denied that the plaintiff was induced to purchase the gemstones by the representations of the defendants. The gemstones purchased by the plaintiff were displayed in showcases in the defendants` premises. The plaintiff selected the gemstones he purchased. Each gemstone he selected had an IGL certificate attached to it. At the time of making the purchases the plaintiff showed that he did not rely on the defendants or the contents of the IGL certificate.
 20.The defendants specifically denied that: (a). the gemstones were defective;
 (b). they did not correspond with the description in the said invoices/cash memos;
 (c). they were not of merchantable quality; and
 (d). they were not fit for their intended purpose.
 21.The defendants denied that the plaintiff made known to them the intended purpose for which the plaintiff purchased the gemstones or at all. The defendants thus denied fault and the plaintiff`s alleged claim for loss and damage and put him to strict proof of the same. The defendants denied that the gemstones sold were defective in that they had been treated as alleged or otherwise or as alleged in the plaintiff`s pleadings.
 22.As regards the damage the defendants said that the plaintiff has failed to take into account the discount and gifts they had given him.
 23.The defence, it will be noted, was essentially one of denial. No positive case as such was pleaded.
 24.
 Claim based on negligent misrepresentation
At the outset it would be apt to deal with the claim based on the tort of negligent misrepresentation. In 
Tai Hing Cotton Mill Ltd v Liu Chong Hing Bank Ltd
 
[1986] AC 80
 considering a claim by a bank against its customer for negligence in the running of the customer`s account, Lord Scarman said at p 107: 
Their lordships do not believe that there is anything to the advantage of the law`s development in searching for a liability in tort where the parties are in a contractual relationship. This is particularly so in a commercial relationship. Though it is possible as a matter of legal semantics to conduct any analysis of the right and duties inherent in some contractual relationships including that of banker and customer either as a matter of contract law when the question will be what, if any, terms are to be implied or as a matter of tort law when the task will be to identify a duty arising from the proximity and character of the relationship between the parties, their Lordships believe it to be correct in principle and necessary for the avoidance of confusion in the law to adhere to the contractual analysis.
 25.After 
 Tai Hing Cotton Mill 
 it became clear that where parties are in a contractual relationship and one of the parties could have protected himself against economic loss by suitable contractual arrangements, it would be inappropriate for him to bring an action in tort for economic loss. In any event he cannot recover damages greater than he would be able to obtain in contract. The law can see no sense in a situation where a party negotiating a contract and thereby assuming contractual obligations should at the same time be wary of a duty in tort. Obligations in tort and contract are different. If duties in tort are imposed on contractual obligations it may be difficult to reconcile them. This is especially so in the case of a contract for the sale of goods. See 
Simaan General Contracting Co v Pilkington Glass Ltd (No 2)
 
[1988] QB 758
, 
 Bank of New Zealand v Ginivan 
 [1991] 1 NZLR 178 and 
 Swiss Singapore Overseas Enterprise Pte Ltd v Horng Chang Enterprise Pte Ltd [ 
 2 SLR 478
.
 26.I would therefore not consider the claim based on tort. It will be observed that the misrepresentations relied on by the plaintiff to found his case in negligence are also part of his case based on contract. He is therefore not put to any serious disadvantage in being precluded from founding his case on tort.
 27.
 An understanding of gemstones
Understanding gemstones and the gemstone trade is the critical first step toward understanding the main issue for determination in this case.
 28.A gem is so designated because it is beautiful and attractive. The beauty may lie in colour as in the case of secondary gemstones or in lack of colour as in the case of diamonds. A gemstone to be called so must also comprehend the elements of rarity and durability so as to retain the polish and enhancement applied to it and to withstand the wear and tear of constant use and exposure to heat and light. In the case of a coloured gemstone it must possess the ability to retain its colour even when subjected to heat and light. Not all gems have these defining qualities in the same degree. When the absence of one or more of these qualities is pronounced, it is reflected in the merchantability of the stones with the debility. That is why there is much variation in the values of different minerals and of different gems of the same mineral.
 29.Furthermore gemstones are often viewed only as a capital investment in that they hold in such small form value against the pressures of inflation better than most investments. Thus longterm value in gemstones is based on beauty, rarity and their ability to hold their beauty almost infinitely. The optical quality of gemstones therefore can never be overstated. Value, of course, is a matter of market perception.
 30.
 Beryls
A beryl is a gemstone so called because it contains the mineral beryllium. It usually comes in different colours: emerald, green; aquamarine, blue; morganite, pink; and heliodor, golden. A blue beryl and a green beryl are commonly and commercially referred to as `aquamarine` and `emerald` respectively. Diamond, emerald, ruby and sapphire are principal gemstones. All others - including beryls except emeralds - are secondary gems.
 31.
 Maxixe beryls
Into the family of beryls there was in 1917 an intruder known as the Maxixe beryl. According to an article by K Nassau and DL Wood, 
 The Nature of the New Maxixe-Type Beryl 
 (1976), the Maxixe mine was discovered about 1917 in Brazil. The following is a summary of the article. (All italics for emphasis added by me.)
 32.The Maxixe mine was discovered in about the year 1917 in Brazil. Here a deep blue beryl occurred together with a pale pink tourmaline. Some 10kgs of facetable deep blue material as well as another 15kgs of pale material were removed before it was discovered that this beryl faded on exposure to light. Since there resulted much unpleasantness, the pit was filled in. Experiments were done on the new materials.
 33.It was found `that although both Maxixe and aquamarine beryls show a strong blue to almost colorless dichroism, in the Maxixe it is the ordinary ray that carries the blue color while in aquamarine it is the extraordinary ray that gives the blue color.`
 34.Based on the results they used the term `Maxixe-type` beryl for material which showed these three characteristics: (1) the unusual dichroism with more intense color in the ordinary ray; (2) narrow banded absorption in the 5,000A to 7,500A region in the ordinary ray only leading to the blue or green color; and (3) fading of this color on extended exposure to light or on heating.
 35.All samples studied, including the old Maxixe specimen, twenty-three blue cut stones, three green cut stones, as well as blue and 
 green rough 
 showed strong dichroism with the blue component being carried by the ordinary ray. In this they were all different from ordinary aquamarine. It was also noted that a number of these Maxixe-type stones were cut with the optic axis perpendicular to the table, while aquamarines are usually cut in the parallel position, each being the orientation for the best display of the color in the particular material.
 36.Three of the blue Maxixe-type stones and both blue and green rough were exposed to daylight with sun or to a 100 watt tungsten filament light bulb at a distance of six inches in an air-conditioned room arranged so that the stones remained at room temperature. In the daylight exposure, the stones were turned every few hours when the sun was shining so that the table faced the sun for maximum effect. 
 After one week in day/sunlight (about three hours sunshine per day during the test period) the old Maxixe beryl, which was quite pale to start with, as well as a thin piece of green rough had bleached almost completely (both to a yellow color), while a dark blue cut stone faded significantly 
. Under the 100 watt blub 150 hours (six days) almost completely faded a thin piece of blue rough and significantly faded two dark blue cut stones to perhaps one half of the original color as estimated visually.
 37.On heating samples in an electric oven for half hour periods at increasing temperatures, some deep blue rough and one deep blue cut stone needed 230[deg ]C (450[deg ]F) to bleach completely in half hour, while another deep blue stone was completely bleached in less than half hour at 100[deg ]C (200[deg ]F).
 38.
 The green rough material faded to a deep yellow color on exposure to light or on heating to 235[deg ]C (450[deg ]). On further heating to 40[deg ]C (750[deg ]F) it became colorless 
.
 39.All material showing one of three characteristics of Maxixe-type (dichroism, spectrum and fading) also showed the other two, and no aquamarine is known to show any of these characteristics.
 40.The authors further pose this question: can light or heat bleached Maxixe-type beryl be returned to the original color, and if so, has this treatment been used on any of this material? They answer both parts of the question in the affirmative.
 41.Then they pose this question: what causes the blue and green Maxixe-type color and can it be made permanent by some treatment? The answer they give is that the unpaired electrons of a `color center` cause the color, and 
 no known treatment can make it permanent 
.
 42.The authors add that: it is possible that some treatment we have not discussed could be found to convert any colorless, pink or 
 yellow 
 beryl to a permanent blue color, but the result would not then be Maxixe-type beryl, but a new type of beryl. We do not know of any such treatment.
 43.Finally they make the following conclusions: `Based on our examination of 30 specimens, we identify blue and 
 green beryl 
 as Maxixe-type if it has the following characteristics: unusual dichroism with the color being in the ordinary ray; narrow absorption bands in the ordinary ray spectrum only, between 5,000 and 7,500 Angstroms; and fading on heating (half hour at 200[deg ]F to 450[deg ]F) or prolonged 
 exposure to light more than one week in the sun 
 or 150 hours at six inches from a 100 watt tungsten lamp bulb may be needed to show pronounced fading in some specimens. In all these respects the Maxixe-type beryl differs from blue and green aquamarine beryls.
 44.
 The rate of fading on exposure to light appears to vary considerably, and we know of no test (other than destroying the color by exposure) which can determine the stability to light. An additional danger is that partly faded Maxixe-type blue beryl may resemble high quality aquamarine, only to fade subsequently to a valueless color 
.
 45.After fading, the color can in most cases be returned by irradiation with neutrons, with gamma rays or with X-rays but this color will once again fade with heat or light. This treatment does not turn just any beryl blue since a specific type of defect in Maxixe-type beryl must be present for it to work. In a set of fifteen random pale beryl specimens, two were found which showed the blue Maxixe-type color and spectrum after irradiation. This shows that a unique origin for the current material is not necessarily indicated.
 46.Of the 30 current Maxixe-type beryls examined, three were proved to have been treated with neutrons either to improve the color or to return color which had faded. Some or all of the others may have been treated with gamma rays, which leaves no detectable evidence of treatment.
 47.The focal point of the above article is that coloured secondary beryls like aquamarine have permanence of colour in that they do not fade in light or on heat. This important property, however, is absent in Maxixe and Maxixe-type beryls.
 
 Non-fading Maxixe-type beryls? 
 48.In the 1981 Winter issue of 
 Gems and Gemology 
 Dr Nassau and Dr Prescott published an article under the title: 
 Nonfading Maxixe-Type Beryl? 
 (I came by this article while looking up material on beryls. Dr Nassau, who gave evidence in this case as an expert for the defendants, referred to this article and said it was his impression that the article was submitted in evidence. I too was under the impression that it would be among the material submitted by the defendants. In the event I discovered to my amazement that it was not tendered to the court.) An introductory summary of the article reads as follows. (All italics for emphasis added by me.)
 49.It is sometimes stated that there exists some Maxixe-type deep blue beryl (occasionally misnamed `aquamarine`) that does not fade. 
 All specimens ever reported in the literature did fade, typically to almost colourless in one to two weeks in bright sunlight or over a somewhat longer period under less intense illumination 
. A `nonfading` specimen recently examined proved to be typical fading Maxixe-type beryl. A possible reason why such a stone might give the impression that it is nonfading is discussed. With the 
 exception 
 of some brown topaz and some kunzite, no significant gemstone material fades on the same time scale as does Maxixe-type beryl.
 50.The authors state the issue before them: `Several years ago there appeared on the gemology scene a deep blue beryl that had unusual properties. Specifically, the material was at first designated aquamarine, but the dichroism of the stone differed from that of aquamarine. It was soon shown that the color faded upon exposure of the material to heat or to light. A detailed study demonstrated that an irradiation-induced color center produced the color and that this material was closely related to, but not identical with, the naturally occurring deep blue beryl found in 1917 in the Maxixe mine in the Piaui area of northeastern Minas Gerais, Brazil, which also faded. 
 The new material was designated `Maxixe-type beryl` to distinguish it from the original, natural `Maxixe beryl` 
. Although the stones appear to fade at the same rate, the color centers in these two materials have been shown to be slightly different.
 51.Statements are occasionally made that specific specimens of Maxixe-type beryl do not fade. All such material studied in detail and reported in the literature has been found to fade. 
 One such purportedly non-fading specimen recently became available to the authors; it was examined to establish if it did fade and, if so, why the claim that it did not would have been made 
.
 52.Then they describe the experiment they carried out as follows: 
A 2-cm fragment of blue beryl was obtained with the kind cooperation of Dr J Keane of KMC Inc (Bedford, MA). The specimen was reported to originate from a New England locality, although the exact site was unknown. It had been irradiated some years ago and purportedly had maintained its color during this time while lying on a desk. Examination showed a typical Maxixe-type beryl, but of a much paler blue than the intense color that usually results from irradiation to saturation. A slice cut from the specimen was polished and the polarized spectra were measured in a Cary Model 14 spectrophotometer at room temperature. The result was an absorption spectrum typical of a Maxixe-type beryl, with the blue-causing absorption bands in the ordinary ray. This specimen was exposed for 100 hours (at a distance of 10cm) to the focused light from a 25 watt microscope lamp equipped with a blue filter in an environment that was air-conditioned in such a way that no heat was experienced by the beryl. As can be seen from the much-reduced absorption this treatment produced a drastic bleaching. Heating in an oven at 200[deg ]C overnight removed all the remaining color.
 53.Finally they make the following conclusion: `
 The specimen proved to be an ""ordinary"", fading Maxixe-type beryl and had undoubtedly faded significantly since it was irradiated 
.` The question remained, though, why it had been thought to be nonfading.
 54.A possible answer was obtained by means of some light-intensity observations taken with a photographic exposure meter. From a series of measurements recorded during a sunny day (late June in New Jersey) and from a sampling of desks, ranging from brightly lit by a large window to the more usual interior desks lit by incandescent or fluorescent lamps, it was found that the average desk illumination was about one hundredth the average outdoor illumination. Accordingly, 
 a Maxixe-type beryl that faded in one week in the sun to less than one half its original color would reach the equivalent stage in 100 times as long a period on a typical desk, that is, in two years 
.
 55.A series of factors may slow the fading even more: the illumination at some desks is lower than at others; the stone may lie face down, so that what light there is does not enter as effectively as occurred in a purposely face-up positioned fade test; papers can inadvertently cover the specimen part of the time; and there is some small variability among Maxixe-type beryls that otherwise appear to be identical, as has been reported.
 56.
 The `nonfading` specimen examined in this report had not lost all of its color over several years on a desk. Clearly, though, it had lost some color, but the loss had been so slow and gradual that it was not evident to the eye in the absence of a color reference sample. 
 57.A survey was made among various gem authorities for other gemstone materials that might fall into a similar fading category. Only three were candidates. Of these, amethyst was eliminated since reports of fading could not be substantiated where a high probability of exposure to heat was not also present. There remained brown topaz from a few localities (such as some in Mexico and in Utah) which fades rapidly, and also some kunzite. Apart from these, 
 all other acceptable gemstones do not fade even after many decades under bright spotlights in museum and store displays 
.
 58.
 It may be concluded that no authentic instance of nonfading Maxixe-type beryl has been proved. Although fading may be delayed by exposure to only low levels of light and can be halted completely in the absence of light, there is a major qualitative difference between this material and nonfading gemstones acceptable to the trade. 
 59.The last sentence is important. It distinguishes the qualitative difference of the naturally coloured beryls which possess colour permanence which they called `nonfading gemstones` and the Maxixe-type beryls which do not hold their colour thus highlighting their propensity to fade when exposed to light and heat. It is therefore a legitimate inference to be drawn from the expression `nonfading gemstone 
 acceptable 
 to the trade` that the fading Maxixe-type beryl is 
 not an acceptable beryl 
 in the gemstone trade even though the basic material may be natural. Finally, an authentic gemstone to deserve that designation should not have the characteristics of the Maxixe-type stone.
 60.
 Tiffany`s reject Maxixe-type beryls
Dr Nassau gave evidence in this case. He was called as an expert by the defendants. Part of his evidence was follows. Tiffany`s were offered some blue stones as aquamarine. He subjected them to test and found them to be of Maxixe-type deep blue stones. The stones were rejected since they were not aquamarine. His analyses of the stones were accordingly accepted not only by Tiffany but also by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) - that is both the dichroism test and the spectrum test were accepted for identification of deep blue and deep green Maxixe-type beryls.
 61.
 Description of Maxixe-type beryls
As stated earlier, a blue beryl is known by its trade name aquamarine. The distinct feature of aquamarine is its blueish colour which is obtained by heating. Once the blue colour is obtained it remains stable. It will not lose its blue hue partially or completely when subjected to light or heat. Therein lies its long term value and beauty and that is why it deserves its designation as a gemstone. The Maxixe-type beryls are different in that their colour is introduced by modern technology. But their colour fades - the rate of fading depending on the intensity of light and/or heat they encounter. Their colour is not permanent unless they are permanently kept in the dark. Tiffany obviously rejected them because, unlike aquamarine, a Maxixe or Maxixe-type beryl is not a legitimate or authentic or acceptable member of the gemstone market and they being reputable traders could not afford to trade in them even for what such stones are worth.
 62.Extracts from 
 Gemstone Enhancement Information Guide 
 from 
 Information Guide of Jewellery Industry 
were made available to me by the defendants. They carry information under three heads: (a) Tag Code, (b) Enhancement and (c) Consumer Care. As the whole publication was not made available to me I was left in the dark as to the full meaning of `Tag Code`. From the limited extracts I discerned the following information on aquamarine and Maxixe-type beryl which is set out in Table A annexed to this judgment. The Guide gives no information on green or yellow Maxixe-type beryls probably because they are rarer than the Maxixe-type blue beryls.
 63.My understanding of the Guide is that it requires the seller to put tags on a product sold. Once a tag showing the correct code is attached to a stone, the buyer or dealer can ascertain its characteristics if he already does not know them. In the case of a Maxixe-type stone a buyer will at once know about a Maxixe-type stone that: (a) the stone was irradiated by the use of high energy or sub-atomic particle bombardment to alter and improve the gemstone`s colour and often it was followed by a heating process; (b) the irradiation turned pale pink into blue; (c) it is rarely used (the other inapplicable alternatives being occasionally, usually, commonly); (d) its` colour stability is poor (the other inapplicable alternatives being fair to good, good and excellent); (e) it requires special care; and (f) its` colour fades in light not to mention heat.
 64.Dr Nassau said in evidence that the information that colour fades in light was based on empirical proof - that is exposure to sunlight for five days destroyed the colour. Dr Nassau further said in evidence that Maxixe or Maxixe-type beryls can be in colours other than blue. Specifically, he said that there can be dark green Maxixe type stones and golden beryls with a greenish tinge where the green comes from the presence of some Maxixe blue. He mentioned a report by one Mr Conningshield of a combination of golden beryls containing a little Maxixe.
 65.The International Confederation of Jewelry, Silverware, Diamonds, Pearls and Stones in its booklet (exh P51) says in art 9(a): The adjectives `real`, `precious`, `genuine`, `natural` or other expressions refer to exclusively to natural gemstones, and natural pearls, and must only be used to designate the natural substances by definitions A to A3. Of these only A and A1 are relevant definitions and they read: 
A: 
 Nautral substances
 
The term `genuine` is synonymous with `natural` and refers exclusively to substances which have been formed completely by nature without human interference.
 
A1: 
 Precious stones gemstones, and ornamental stones
 
Precious stones, gemstones and ornamental stones are minerals and rocks which have been formed in natural deposits without man`s intervention.
 Under the heading `Imitation` in art B1.3 it says: 
B1.3 
 Imitations
 
Imitations are simulations of natural or synthetic stones: or fancy products made entirely or partially by man. These stones imitate the effect, colour and appearance of natural gems or synthetic stones without possessing their chemical and/or their physical properties and/or their crystal structure.
 66.The above definitions in my view reflect the common understanding of the terms in the gem trade. Under these definitions the Maxixe-type stones do not qualify for the description `natural` but would come under `imitations` because though the stones are natural in origin, their colour is a simulation. They do not possess the physical properties of natural gemstones in that their colour is unstable.
 67.Natural here means that the stone must not only be natural as distinct from synthetic material but also possess natural colour and have the natural property of retaining colour. There are one or two exceptions to this rule. It is unnecessary to consider the exceptions as they do not form the subject matter of this case.
 68.
 The Guide 
 published by Gemworld International Inc (exh D19) does not mention the Maxixe-type beryl at all. The inference to be drawn from this is that it is not part of the regular gem trade.
 69.In summary the nub of the problem with the Maxixe-type stones is this: whereas an aquamarine beryl has colour stability ie permanence in the sense that it does not fade or lose its colour by reason of intense and prolonged exposure to light or heat (even 400[deg ] 450[deg ]C), the Maxixe-type of beryl fades and loses its colour when exposed to light which need not be intense and loses its colour when subjected to temperature in the region of 100[deg ]C. This takes the Maxixe-type of beryl out of the ordinary class of gemstones and makes it sub-standard in the extreme.
 70.
 The nature of stones in this case
The plaintiff called an expert from Australia, Dr Brown. While in Australia he subjected a stone of each of the three colours to the three tests to identify their nature, in particular their colour stability - that is (a) use of spectroscope, (b) the use of a dichroscope, and (c) the fade test (which involved exposure to light and the application of heat to 100[deg ]C). He submitted a report. The result of his tests showed with certainty that all three stones were of Maxixe-type. I compared the colour of each of the three stones with another stone of the same ilk which had been purchased by the plaintiff. I found that all three had faded. In the case of the blue and greenish yellow stones, the parts which had been exposed to direct light and heat had substantially lost their colour. The orangy yellow also had lost part of its colour but not so substantially.
 71.Later, Dr Brown submitted another report dated 20 June 1993. As regards the 39 beryls in question his view was that all of them displayed their strong dichroic colour in their ordinary ray. Thus they manifested one of the three key characteristics of the Maxixe-type beryl. It was common ground that one of the tests was as good as any one of the other two or all of them. I had no hesitation in accepting Dr Brown`s evidence as the reflection of truth. And his evidence remained intact even after cross-examination.
 72.Mr Palmeiri, another expert called by the plaintiff, was also of the view that all the 39 stones in question belonged to the ilk of Maxixe-type. Initially his view was very clear and strong as regards the blue stones but not the eight greenish yellow and four brownish orangy/yellow stones. But after he became aware of the findings of Dr Brown, he concluded that all of them were of the Maxixe-type. I looked at the stones of each of the three colours. They all had a peculiar murky look about them. They lacked sparkle. The colour of each group was similar. Accordingly, I had no hesitation in accepting the evidence that all the 39 stones were Maxixe-type stones.
 73.
 Defendants` position
The defendants` initial stance on the nature of the beryls is contained in correspondence between the parties. The plaintiff by his telex of 21 January 1989 complained about their propensity to fade under strong illumination. This shows that the plaintiff was not aware of this propensity at the time of purchase and that he had not been advised of it. The interpretation I place on that telex is that he placed these beryls within the same class as the aquamarines and amethysts he had purchased and which he was `naturally very happy about`.
 74.The defendants` immediate response to the plaintiff`s complaint was that the results of the Gubelin tests were consistent with the IGL certificate. That was untrue because the IGL certificates said nothing about the propensity of the stones to fade. As the plaintiff pointed out correctly in his telex of 28 January 1989 `the two types of certificates are not compatible`. The defendants said that if the plaintiff was `unhappy with the blue beryl (Maxixe-type) they would allow him to exchange them for amethysts`.
 75.By their fax of 10 February 1989 the defendants made a volte face - they said they would not refund on the Maxixe beryls nor on any of the beryls he had purchased. They referred to the IGL `Certificates of Gem Identification` and added: `In fact during the course of purchase, you mentioned that you do not recognise the IGL certificates.` This clearly shows that the IGL certificates did not form the basis of the purchase. In any event the IGL certificates were certificates of identification and not description. Identification here means the specification which distinguished one stone from another. The letter went on with a comment on the nature of the stones as set out in pp 5 and 6 of this judgment.
 76.It is plain that some five months after the purchase, far from denying the unstable colour, the defendants went on to assert the unstable nature of the stones. Suffice it to say for this moment that the defendants unreservedly admitted the nature of the Maxixe-beryls and that the plaintiff was not aware of that nature at the time he made the purchase. They of course rely on the mention of the word `Maxixe` in the IGL certificate. I will comment on this later.
 77.Next, the defendants called Dr Nassau as their expert on the nature of the stones sold. His standpoint may be summarised as follows: (1). There is a distinction between a gemmological test and a scientific test to determine whether a beryl is a Maxixe-type stone. Exposure to light and subjecting the beryl to heat is a scientific test as it reduces or destroys colour. The scientific test of subjecting the beryls to heat is unnecessary for gemmological purposes as it may destroy the colour. Any one of the four criteria (ie treating light and heat as separate tests) would serve the purpose.
 (2). At first he said that Maxixe-type of beryl was confined to deep blue colour but after much cross-examination conceded that there can be greenish and golden yellow Maxixe type beryls.
 (3). His earlier conclusions about Maxixe-type beryls were somewhat an overstatement and accordingly he was revising his view to the effect that they would not fade as fast as had been thought earlier.
 (4). The orangy beryls in question did not belong to the Maxixe-type class. (5) All the beryls were natural as described and those described as Maxixe-type were correctly described so in the IGL certificates.
 78.I am unable to accept the thrust of Dr Nassau`s evidence. My finding that all the 39 beryls were of the Maxixe-type is not altered by the evidence of Dr Nassau. Moreover, his evidence in this case on the whole did not detract from the conventional understanding of Maxixe-type beryls - that is to say they would fade when subjected to strong illumination and/or heat, they require special care and that they are rarely used and they are unacceptable in reputable gem trade.
 79.The above background description of gemstones and my findings on beryls provides the basis for decision on the alleged breach of terms of contract. Paragraph 7 of the statement of claim relies on breach of the following terms of contract: (a). non-conformity with description;
 (b). unmerchantability; and
 (c). unfitness of purpose.
 80.It is unnecessary to treat the alleged representations as collateral contracts. If the representations were made they would form part of the main contract itself.
 81.I shall now consider each breach separately.
 82.
 Sale by description - The law
Section 13(1) and (3) of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 provides as follows: 
(1) Where there is a contract for the sale of goods by description, there is an implied condition that the goods will correspond with the description. 
(3) A sale of goods is not prevented from being a sale by description by reason only that, being exposed for sale or hire, they are selected by the buyer.
 Whether there is a sale by description is a question of construction of the words used to define the goods sold and the circumstances of the sale. `Where goods are described by contract, and the buyer contracts in reliance on that description, there is a sale by description even if the goods be specific ` And it may apply where the purchaser has seen and selected the goods, if the deviation of the goods from the description is not apparent. The only sales not by description are sales of specific goods as such. Specific goods may be sold as such when they are sold without any description, express or implied; or where any statement made about them is not essential to their identity; or where, though the goods are described, the description is not relied upon, as where the buyer buys the goods such as they are -

there is a sale by description even though the buyer is buying something displayed before him on the counter: a thing is sold by description, though it is specific, so long as it is sold not merely as the specific thing but as a thing corresponding to a description, eg woollen under-garments, a hot water bottle, a second-hand reaping machine, to select a few obvious illustrations.

[1967] 1 WLR p 1193
 the defendant owner of a secondhand car inserted the following advertisement in a trade paper for secondhand cars: `Herald convertible, white, 1961, twin cabs 190.` The plaintiff purchased the car. It was held that there was a sale by description as the advertisement showed the kind of car the plaintiff was buying.
 85.In 
Couchman v Hill
 
[1947] KB 554
 the plaintiff purchased at an auction sale a heifer belonging to the defendant which was described in the sale catalogue as `unserved`. The catalogue stated that the sale would be subject to the auctioneers` usual conditions and that all lots must be taken subject to all faults or errors of description; and the conditions of sale, which were exhibited at the auction, stated that the lots were sold `with all faults, imperfections and errors of description.` At the sale the plaintiff asked both the defendant and the auctioneer whether they could confirm that the heifer in question was unserved and received from both the answer `Yes`. Later the heifer was found to be in calf and died as a result of carrying a calf at too young an age. In an action in the county court for damages for breach of warranty the county court judge held that the value of the confirmation by the defendant and the auctioneer that the heifer was unserved was destroyed by the conditions of sale and gave judgment for the defendant. On appeal it was held that in the circumstances the answers of the defendant and the auctioneer to the plaintiff`s question amounted to an offer of a warranty overriding the conditions of sale; that such offer was accepted by the plaintiff`s bid for the heifer; and that the description amounted to a condition on the breach of which the plaintiff was entitled to treat it as a warranty and recover damages. On the printed condition Scott LJ said at p 559: 
The printed condition that the vendor will take no responsibility for errors of description of things or animals specifically offered for sale on inspection is reasonable for visible defects, but for qualities or attributes which are invisible it is not reasonable. It may well become a mere trap for the unwary.
 86.Finally when applying the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act 1979, the trial judge should always keep in mind the following salutory words of Lord Wilberforce in 
Christopher Hill v Ashington Piggeries Ltd
 
[1972] AC at 489
: 
Further I do not believe that the Sale of Goods Act was designed to provoke metaphysical discussions as to the nature of what is delivered, in comparison with what is sold. The test of description, at least where commodities are concerned, is intended to be a broader, more common sense, test of mercantile character. The question whether that is what the buyer bargained for has to be answered according to such tests as men in the market would apply, leaving more delicate questions of condition, or quality, to be determined under other clauses of the contract or sections of the Act.
 87.The question of sale by description in this case can be approached from two angles. First, indisputably when the plaintiff purchased the beryls in question he purchased them as `gemstones` and the defendants sold them as such. Given that, what did the expression `gemstones` convey? It is clear that it meant that the stones possessed the properties outlined earlier - one of them being `permanence or stability` of colour. Although each of the properties is relative, a stone which is liable to fade upon exposure to light and/or heat by definition is not a gemstone. This was the thrust of the evidence of Mr Palmeiri, the expert witness on the gem trade called by the plaintiff.
 88.Another aspect of it is that the defendants admitted they did not deal in `inferior quality gemstones`. The plaintiff said that the defendants stated that `all the gemstones the plaintiff agreed to purchase were genuine, natural, without flaws and not treated in any way`. The defendants` witnesses denied having said so. I believe the plaintiff and disbelieve the defendants. I cannot accept that as gem traders the defendants kept mum about the description of the stones. It is highly probable that they described the stones as alleged by the plaintiff. Furthermore, the defendants` statement that they did not deal in `inferior quality gemstones` meant that the stones were `without flaws or defects`. A restatement of the representations is that they described the beryls as superior quality gemstones and flawless beryls. Taking a broad and commonsensical approach, beryls which were liable to fade upon exposure to light and heat and needed special care and could only be used rarely do not fit the description of superior quality `gemstones` or `gemstones without flaw or defects`. As the plaintiff said in evidence, the beryls did not possess `what is considered to be a very necessary feature in the jewellery trade. That is permanent colour, stable colour.` Accordingly, the plaintiffs were in breach of the implied condition of conformity with description.
 89.The defendants said that they described the stones as `natural` and that they were indeed natural. This, however, was only one of the descriptions and conformity with that description does not absolve them from unconformity with the other descriptions.
 90.The defendants further said that the IGL certificates described the blue stones as `Maxixe-type` and indeed they were Maxixe-type stones. This does not absolve the defendants because as they admitted and asserted, the plaintiff did not rely on the certificates. The plaintiff said in evidence `I did not rely on the IGL certificates. I relied on Peter Hung.` Further, the plaintiff and probably the defendants also, did not at the time of the sale understand the import of the word `Maxixe-type`. Accordingly, that term was not part of the description the plaintiff relied on and it did not form part of the contract. Additionally, the plaintiff said he was told by the defendants that the term referred to the origin of the stones - namely `a very famous mine in Brazil`. The plaintiff in any event did not purchase the stones on the basis of that description.
 91.
 Condition as to merchantable quality - The law
Section 14(2) Sale of Goods Act 1979 provides that: where goods are sold in the course of business, there is an implied condition in the sale that the goods are of merchantable quality, except where the defect was specifically brought to the buyer`s attention before the contract was made or where the buyer examined the goods before purchase and the defect ought to have been revealed by that examination.
 92.A sale is done `in the course of business` if selling merchandise of the kind in question is the declared vocation of the seller. In Singapore there is no difficulty in understanding that expression. If a limited company or a business firm declares itself a seller or habitually sells a given product or merchandise either as a manufacturer or trader, then anything within the class of that product or merchandise sold by that company or firm is sold in the course of business. This may be contrasted with a seller, whose normal vocation being not the selling of the product or thing, sells it as he has no need for it. For example a teacher selling his car or a lawyer selling his computer because he intends to acquire a new one would not be selling the car or the computer in the course of business.
 93.Merchantable quality` is defined in s 14(6) of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 as follows: 
Goods of any kind are of merchantable quality within the meaning of subsection (2) above if they are as fit for the purpose or purposes for which goods of that kind are commonly bought as it is reasonable to expect having regard to any description applied to them, the price (if relevant) and all the other relevant circumstances.
 94.
 Chalmers Sale of Goods 
 states at p 128, `Merchantable is a composite quality comprising elements of prescription, purpose, condition and price. The relevant significance of those elements will vary from case to case according to the nature of the goods in question and the characteristics of the market which exists for them.`
 95.As s 14(2) imposes a inherent quality, questions as to whether the buyer relied on the skill or judgement of the seller and whether the seller was conscious of any unmerchantable quality are irrelevant in the application of this provision.
 96.
 Application
The first question to ask is whether the sale was made in the course of business. The answer plainly must be in the affirmative since the defendants admittedly were dealers in coloured gemstones, one of the biggest dealers at that. The next matter to be considered is the purpose for which the stones are commonly bought for. The immediate purpose for which the goods in such large quantity were purchased was undoubtedly for resale. Resale could be to other dealers or to consumers.
 97.The evidence before me clearly pointed to only one conclusion - that the stones were not of merchantable quality. Maxixe-type stones attract very little, if any, demand in the gem trade as they are rarely used. Mr Palmeiri, the plaintiff`s expert on market and value said that Maxixe-type stones are not commonly sold in the gem trade and their value, if any, is very low. His evidence, which I accept as a reflection of the true condition, is also supported by the literature placed before me. Mr Palmeiri`s evidence was not effectively contradicted by the defendants. Maxixe-type stones historically have had an adverse market perception in the gem trade which perception either destroyed or diminished their merchantability. In the circumstances, I conclude that all the beryls were not of merchantable quality.
 98.As to the proviso in s 14(2), there was no evidence that the defect in the stones was brought to the buyer`s attention before the contract was made or that the buyer could have discovered the defect upon reasonable examination. It was the job of a scientist not a layman. Although the defendants ought to have known of the problem with the beryls, the evidence before me showed that they in all probability did not know of it until after the plaintiff complained.
 99.
 Condition as to fitness for declared purpose - The law
Where goods are sold in the course of business and the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller any particular purpose for which they are being bought, there is implied in the sale, a condition that the goods are reasonably fit for that purpose unless the buyer did not rely, or it was unreasonable for him to rely, on the seller`s skill or judgement. See s 14(3) of the Sale of Goods Act 1979.
 100.Under this provision, the seller bears the burden of showing that the buyer did not rely on his skill and judgement or that in all the circumstances it would be unreasonable for the buyer to rely on his skill or judgement.
 101.A buyer may show his reliance on the seller`s skill or judgement by stating the purpose for which the goods are purchased with sufficient particularity and it is always a question of fact depending on all the circumstances of the case. In 
 Grant 
`s case Lord Wright stated at p 99: 
It is clear that the reliance must be brought home to the mind of the seller, expressly or by implication. The reliance will seldom be express: it will usually arise by implication from the circumstances: thus to take a case like that in question, of a purchase from a retailer, the reliance will be in general inferred from the fact that a buyer goes to the shop in the confidence that the tradesman has selected his stock with skill and judgment: the retailer need know nothing about the process of manufacture: it is immaterial whether he be manufacturer or not: the main inducement to deal with a good retail shop is the expectation that the tradesman will have bought the right goods of a good make:
 102.In 
Hardwick Game Far v Suffolk Agricultural Poultry Producers Association
 
[1969] 2 AC 31
 at p 82 Lord Reid said: `A shopkeeper`s goodwill consists largely in his reputation of being reliable - the better the shop the easier it is to draw this inference.` The reliance on a seller`s skill and judgment need not be total or exclusive. See 
Christopher Hill Ltd v Ashington Piggeries Ltd
 
[1972] AC 441
 at p 468. Ignorance of unfitness, however, would not excuse the seller from liability.
 103.
 Application
The purpose for which the plaintiff purchased the beryls was for resale. This was shown not only by the plaintiff`s own evidence but also admissions made by the defendants. Additionally it also follows as a matter of reasonable inference: purchase of such a large quantity stones of the same type would normally be for resale.
 104.It is settled law that resale can be a particular purpose of purchase of any good: 
Harlingdon & Leinster Enterprises Ltd v Christopher Hull Fine Art Ltd
 
[1991] 1 QB 564
.
 105.Given that, were the stones fit for resale by the plaintiff. The answer plainly will be `No`. The reasons for this conclusions are the same as those outlined in the preceding part of this judgment.
 106.
 The remedy
The plaintiff in effect seeks rescission. The breach of a condition in a contract entitles the plaintiff to the remedy of rescission as a matter of right. It is not a matter of discretion.
 107.It is trite law that the effect of an implied term being a condition is that when the condition is breached the innocent buyer may treat the contract as discharged.
 108.The innocent party is entitled to rescission or damages at his option.
 109.In any event the only proper damages to be awarded in this case is the full value of the defective stones to be refunded. In my judgment the plaintiff is entitled to return the stones which were subjected to the heat and light test. This was necessitated by the defendants` refusal to accept the plaintiff`s proposal to return the stones which forced him to litigate and prove that the stones are defective. The return cannot be effected unless the plaintiff is able to return the stones and the gifts that went with them.
 110.The defendants` argument that the plaintiff is precluded from this remedy because the invoices said that `Goods sold are not returnable` is unsound. The efficacy of such a clause is confined to instances where the buyer proposes to cancel the sale because he has changed his mind about the purchase without any fault or breach of a term of contract on the part of the seller. It does not affect or nullify the court`s power to order rescission of the contract or award damages when it finds that the seller is in breach of the contract. When awarding damages, in suitable cases, the court of course may order the return of the goods.
 111.
 The IGL conditions
The plaintiff furthermore is not precluded from this remedy by the conditions on the reverse side of the IGL certificates. For one thing these terms did not form part of the contract as the plaintiff did not transact on the basis of the certificates. More compelling is another reason. The conditions must be construed strictly. So construed they can only apply between IGL and its customer who in this case was the defendants and not the plaintiff who did not instruct IGL to issue the certificate nor pay for it. Additionally, the conditions were inserted in the certificates for the protection of IGL and not any other person.
 112.
 The defendants` witnesses
Before concluding this judgment it is incumbent upon me to discuss the evidence of the defendants. The employees of the defendants turned out to be unsatisfactory witnesses. In any event the materiality of their evidence centred on what misrepresentations, if any, they made. As I proceeded to decide the case on the basis of contract and not tort their evidence became secondary. The effect of their evidence material to the claim founded on contract was largely admitted in pleadings, documents and their evidence.
 113.Dr Nassau was, of course, the mainstay of the defendants` case. His evidence, which I found unreliable, should not even be considered because the substance of evidence was not put to the plaintiff or his expert witnesses. Thus the defendants were in breach of the rule in 
Browne v Dunn
 
[1894] 6 R 67
. It is established law that the rule is not a question of procedure but of essential justice. I pointed this out during evidence but allowed Dr Nassau to complete his evidence as it was somewhat difficult at that time to separate the evidence that should have been put to the plaintiff`s witnesses from other evidence which might have been relevant.
 114.Secondly, his thrust of his evidence was that the Maxixe-type stones were not as prone to fade as had been thought before his evidence in court. But what mattered was the market perception at the time of the sale. The plaintiff`s case was based on the state of the art that obtained at the time of purchase. Dr Nassau`s newfangled theory was not made known to the market in 1988 when the purchases were made.
 115.He made an attempt to say that there was `already a partial correction` and referred to the article `A Non-fading Maxixe-type Beryl` which he sought to have tendered to the court but withheld it. During his testimony he visibly fumbled as will be seen from the notes of evidence. He was asked whether he had published any articles or notes which dealt with his newfangled theory. His answer was as follows: 
A: No. None. Correction. On the Maxixe there was already a partial correction. I believe we submitted in evidence. It was the article on `Is there Non-Fading Maxixe` or something like that. I do have a copy here but it was my impression that it was submitted. I don`t seem to find it at the moment. There is one entitled `Non-Fading Maxixe 1981`, sorry it was not after the book was published. It was just before the book was published. It actually happened after the book was written.
 116.The article was published in 1981 whereas his book was published in 1984. Given that, why did he not make a correction in the book. The true reason as I see it is that there was nothing to correct. He dedicated his book to his wife Julia with the following quotation from William Shakespeare: 
Love is not love
 
Which alters when it alteration finds
 117.What was more amazing than his fumbling was the casual fashion in which he formed his newfangled theory. It was not an empirical conclusion as he had come to in the article but was based on hearsay and it was made for the purpose of this case. The information on which he based his evidence in court came from persons who were not called to give evidence.
 118.He said the book was being revised and that the new edition will contain the following statement which he tendered to the court on a piece of paper: 
Note (Addendum to pp 96 and 110)
 
Both Maxixe and Maxixe-type deep blue and deep green beryls fade to about one half of their intensity after about one week in sunlight (the 5-8 carat stones were turned to always face the sun). However, indoor illumination levels are one hundredth to one two hundredth that of sunlight, so that these materials could then be expected to retain their color for one to two hundred weeks or two to four years when worn eight hours a day. There is the additional factor that in normal wear the stone does not always face the light; this extends the life by an estimated factor of ten and then gives a color retention time of 20 to 40 years in normal jewellry use. This reasonable stability to light has been confirmed by the observation of DV Manson (unpublished) that several Maxixe-type deep blue beryls of this size maintained their color over a ten year period in a brightly lit display at the Gemological Institute of America in Santa Monica. It should be noted that in this display the light was directed at the side of the stones and fans were used to prevent the building up of heat. Larger stones would retain their colour even longer.
 119.It will be seen that the conclusions appeared to contradict his co-authored article `A Non-fading Maxixe-type Beryl` where he, based on reliable tests, rejected any idea of an acceptable non-fading Maxixe beryl.
 120.In his evidence he went on a tirade against Dr Brown`s test when in fact he had himself done the same test. When pressed on this he sought refuge in Alexander Pope. He said, `I admit I have not been 100% consistent on this. I believe Alexander Pope said: ""To err is human, to forgive is divine."" I trust I can be forgiven for this.` A more pertinent question about his evidence was why was he taking an inconsistent position before the court. The answer was crystal clear: he had lost all objectivity about the matter and become prejudiced in favour of the defendants who flew him down to Singapore. He shifted his position from a neutral to a partial standpoint. That accounted for his inability to identify the yellow beryls as Maxixe-type. He could not even secure a good instrument to peer into the stone.
 121.I asked Dr Nassau to state the characteristics that define a gemstone. I did this to test his objectivity. He stressed the qualities other than stability which was of crucial importance in this case. He came out with it only when pressed by plaintiff`s counsel in cross-examination.
 122.For these reasons and remarks I made about him during evidence I reject his evidence and much prefer that of Dr Brown and Mr Palmeiri.
 123.
 Decision
For reasons set out above I adjudge and order that the defendants shall refund to the plaintiff the value of the 39 stones tested by Dr Brown in exchange for the return of the stones together with the jewellery given as gifts by the defendants. If the plaintiff is unable to return any of the stones, the value of such stones need not be refunded. If necessary, I shall hold an inquiry to give effect to this judgment and order. The defendants shall pay interest on the amount refunded at the rate of 6% per cent per annum from the date of the issue of the writ.

Cur Adv Vult
 
On 25 January 1984 at about 11.15pm, the plaintiff, who was then an infant, was riding on the pillion of a motorcycle, JAV 2966, ridden by the second defendant; they were travelling along Clementi Road towards Upper Bukit Timah Road. They reached the traffic-controlled junction of Clementi Road and Clementi Avenue 2, and while they were crossing the junction and going straight towards Upper Bukit Timah Road, a motor taxi, SHA 152 U, driven by the first defendant and coming from the opposite direction, entered the junction, turned right going towards Clementi Avenue 2 and collided with the motorcycle, in consequence of which the plaintiff sustained injuries. He brought this action, suing by his father and next friend, against the first and second defendants, claiming damages for negligence on the part of both or either of the defendants. The second defendant did not defend the claim and interlocutory judgment was entered against him. The claim against the first defendant was, however, resisted and proceeded to trial.
At the hearing before the district judge, the quantum of damages was agreed upon, namely, $9,750 for general damages and $250 for special damages, leaving only the question of liability to be tried. At the conclusion of the hearing, the learned district judge dismissed the claim of the plaintiff, holding that he (the plaintiff) had failed to prove that the accident was caused by the negligence of the first defendant. Against that decision, this appeal was brought, and at the conclusion of the hearing I allowed the appeal, set aside the judgment of the learned district judge and entered judgment for the agreed amount against the first defendant.
In coming to his conclusion that the plaintiff had failed to discharge the burden, the learned district judge said: 
 
The first question to be considered by the court is: what was the condition of the traffic lights when the defendant was making a right turn into Clementi Avenue 2. The defendant said that when the traffic lights turned green, he drove his taxi forward and stopped to give way to oncoming traffic. When the green arrow came on then he started to turn right. Was the defendant telling the truth? Unfortunately, there is no evidence to say otherwise. The plaintiff, who is a very truthful witness, has said that he did not know the state of the traffic lights when his motorcycle was crossing the junction. If the defendant is to be believed, then it means that the plaintiffs motorcycle was beating the red traffic light at the material time.
 
 
 
Furthermore, the plaintiff has admitted that he did not know how the accident happened. The rider of the motorcycle on which the plaintiff was a pillion rider was not called to give evidence because his whereabouts are not known. His evidence would be vital for the plaintiff to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the defendant has been negligent in driving his motor taxi on the day and time in question. However, this piece of evidence is missing.
In my opinion, the learned district judge, with respect, had misdirected himself in law. The plaintiff was an innocent pillion rider on the motorcycle ridden by the second defendant and he sustained injuries in the accident, which was a collision between this motorcycle and the motor taxi driven by the first defendant coming from the opposite direction. On these facts, the proper inference to be drawn is that the collision was caused either by the negligence of both the defendants or by the negligence of the first defendant or the second defendant. It is for the first defendant to rebut this inference of negligence on his part. In 
 Baker v Market Harborough industrial Cooperative Society Ltd 
[1953] 1 WLR 1472
 a collision between two vehicles proceeding in opposite directions occurred at or near the centre of the road during the hour of darkness. The Court of Appeal in England held that in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the inference was that both drivers were equally to blame for the accident. Lord Denning MR in his judgment said, at p 1476: 
 
It is pertinent to ask, what would have been the position if there had been a passenger in the back of one of the vehicles who was injured in the collision? He could have brought an action against both vehicles. On proof of the collision in the centre of the road, the natural inference would be that one or other or both were to blame. If there was no other evidence given in the case because both drivers were killed, would the court, simply because it could not say whether it was only one vehicle that was to blame or both of them, refuse to give the passenger any compensation? The practice of the courts is to the contrary. Every day, proof of the collision is held to be sufficient to call on the two defendant for an answer. Never do they both escape liability. One or other is held to blame, and sometimes both. If each of the drivers were alive and neither chose to give evidence, the court would unhesitatingly hold that both were to blame. They would not escape simply because the court had nothing by which to draw any distinction between them. So, also, if they are both dead and cannot give evidence, the result must be the same. In the absence of any evidence enabling the court to draw a distinction between them, they must be held both to blame and equally to blame.
 
 
 
In 
 France v Parkinson 
 [1954] 1 All ER 739, the plaintiff`s and the defendant`s motor cars were involved in a collision at crossroads. The collision took place in the middle of the roads and each car was on the right side of the road. At the time of the accident the plaintiff`s car was driven by one Fitzgerald, to whom the plaintiff had hired the car. Fitzgerald disappeared soon after the accident. The plaintiff claimed against the defendant for damages for negligence and Fitzgerald was not called as a witness. At the conclusion of the plaintiff`s case, the defendant called no evidence and the trial judge held that the plaintiff had not proved negligence against the defendant. On appeal, his decision was reversed. The Court of Appeal held that the evidence raised a prima facie case of negligence against the defendant which he had not displaced. Somervell LJ said, at p 740: 
 
... it is not disputed that the plaintiff was in the same position as a passenger, and, therefore, even if the driver of the car had been negligent, so long as the plaintiff can establish some negligence on the defendant`s part he could claim all his damages. I think, therefore, there was a prima facie case against the defendant on which the court should have found him negligent in the absence of any evidence given by him.
 
 
 
In the instant case, there was no dispute that there was a collision between the motorcycle ridden by the second defendant and the motor taxi driven by the first defendant at the junction of Clementi Road and Clementi Avenue 2, and the plaintiff was the pillion rider of the motorcycle. There was, therefore, a prima facie case of negligence against both the defendants or either of them, and as against the first defendant it is for him to displace it. The first defendant did give evidence, and the learned district judge should then consider whether on the evidence the first defendant had succeeded in displacing the case against him. In my opinion, the learned district judge did not evaluate the evidence on this basis.
On a review of the evidence it seems to me that the first defendant was in part to blame for the accident. The first defendant said that when he reached the junction he stopped, as the traffic light was red, and when the traffic light turned green, he drove his motor taxi forward and stopped to give way to oncoming vehicles. When the green arrow light came on, he saw two motorcycles coming from the opposite direction and he started to turn right; he did not give way to them. He said that they should stop. At that moment he could, and should, have stopped and refrained from turning right, thus avoiding the accident, and, in my view, in this respect the first defendant was at least, and probably to a lesser extent than the second defendant, partly to blame for the accident. In this connection, it should be borne in mind that even if the extent of his blame for the accident was only 1%, the first defendant would still be a joint tortfeasor with the second defendant and vis-a-vis the plaintiff would be wholly liable.
In 
 Loh Saik Pew v Tan Huat Chan 
 
 
 
[1976] 2 MLJ 1
 , there was a collision between a motorcycle ridden by the plaintiff and a motor van driven by the defendant at the junction of Geylang Road, Aljunied Road and Lorong 22. The motorcycle entered the junction after the traffic light had turned green and in crossing the intersection, he was knocked down by the motor van from the right. The Court of Appeal held that though the motorcycle was entitled to enter and cross the junction, he should have kept a lookout, which he did not, for the motor van from the right which had properly entered the junction, and if he had kept a lookout he would have seen the motor van and would have been able to take effective steps to avoid the accident, and accordingly held that the motorcyclist was partly to blame for the accident. FA Chua J, delivering the judgment of the court, said at p 2: 
 
We are of the view that although the respondent was entitled to proceed and enter the junction immediately the lights turned green in his favour, he should in his own interest have kept a lookout for vehicles coming from the direction of Aljunied Road in case some vehicle which had properly entered the crossroads might still be passing across. If he had looked to his right when moving off from the stop line, he would have seen the appellant`s motor van coming and would have been able to take effective steps to avoid a collision. We hold that, in all the circumstances prevailing, the respondent had contributed to this accident.
 
 
 
Clearly, in the circumstances of this case, the claim of the plaintiff against the first defendant must succeed, and I accordingly reversed the order made below.

Cur Adv Vult
 
On 5 March 1979 at about 4pm, the plaintiff was waiting for a taxi at the taxi stand in front of the then Singapore Turf Club at Cecil Street. The taxi stand was on the right side of Cecil Street, if one faces the direction of Cross Street and the Multi-Storey Car Park at Cecil Street/Market Street. Cecil Street was at the material time, and is, a one-way street with traffic travelling from Anson Road towards Cross Street and the Multi-Storey Car Park. At the taxi stand, there was a metal railing, and the plaintiff at the time was standing at the front exit looking towards his left from which direction the vehicles were coming. While standing there and waiting for a taxi he saw two vehicles, a taxi and a motorcycle, coming towards him. The taxi was travelling on the second lane (from his side) and the motorcycle was travelling on the right side of the taxi and on the first lane. According to him, the motorcycle was travelling abreast with the taxi. When the taxi was about 20 metres from the plaintiff it swerved to the right towards the taxi stand and collided with the motorcycle and the impact in turn caused the motorcycle to collide with the plaintiff, in consequence of which the plaintiff sustained severe injuries on his left leg. The motorcycle was ridden by the first defendant and the taxi was driven by the second defendant.
The plaintiff brought this action against both the defendants for damages for negligence. His claim was that the collision was caused either solely by the negligence of the first defendant or the second defendant or by the negligence of both of them. Before me the parties agreed on the following: (a) a sum of $9,471.03 as special damages which consisted mainly of medical expenses, and (b) a sum of $17,500.00 as general damages, leaving for trial only two issues, namely, liability and, if any, actual loss of earnings sustained by the plaintiff. At the conclusion of the trial, I held that on the first issue both the defendants were liable to the plaintiff and that the first defendant was one-third to blame and the second defendant two-thirds to blame for the accident, and on the second issue the plaintiff had sustained actual loss of earnings and awarded him a sum of $48,629.19 for the period from the date of accident to 15 July 1980. I therefore gave judgment for the plaintiff in the total sum of $75,600.22 with interest thereon at 6% pa from 1 April 1984 to the date thereof and with costs to the plaintiff, and made the usual consequential orders.
On the issue of liability the dispute was mainly between the first defendant and the second defendant; there was no dispute that either of the defendants or both of them were liable to the plaintiff, the innocent bystander, who sustained injuries arising from the collision between the first defendant`s motorcycle and the second defendant`s taxi. Each of the defendants disputed that the accident was caused or contributed by him. Both the defendants gave evidence.
The first defendant said that at the material time just before the accident he was travelling along Cecil Street from Anson Road. He was on the second lane from the right close to lane one and he saw the taxi driven by the second defendant. The taxi was also on the second lane and the first defendant was slightly behind the taxi. Before reaching the taxi stand where the plaintiff was standing, both the taxi and the motorcycle stopped at the junction of Cecil Street and McCallum Street as the traffic light was red. When the light turned green both the vehicles moved forward. There was a vehicle, a motor van, parked on the first lane before the taxi stand. After passing the motor van, the first defendant swerved slightly to the right and was entering the first lane. At that moment, the taxi suddenly swerved to the right heading towards the taxi stand. The first defendant swerved and applied the brakes but he could not avoid the collision, as a result of which he `was flung off` his motorcycle which then collided with the plaintiff who was at the taxi stand. He said that the motor van was parked at a distance of about seven to eight car lengths from the taxi stand and that in swerving right the taxi did not give any indication at all; the taxi was slightly ahead of him and he could see the rear lights of the taxi. He was then travelling at a speed between 35 km and 40 km per hour.
The second defendant in his evidence said that on that day at about 4pm he picked up three passengers at the World Trade Centre and was instructed to go to the Singapore Turf Club office at Cecil Street. He proceeded along Telok Blangah to Anson Road and then to Cecil Street. At the junction of Cecil Street and McCallum Street he stopped as the traffic light was red. He did not notice the motorcycle ridden by the first defendant. He was then on the second lane. When the traffic light turned green he moved forward intending to go to the taxi stand. He saw a motor van parked on the right about ten metres from the taxi stand. He had turned on the indicator showing that he was moving right towards the taxi stand. After he had passed the motor van and as he was swerving to the first lane towards the taxi stand, a motorcycle came from the rear and attempted to overtake him on the right. He applied the brakes but could not avoid the collision. He did not see the motorcycle before he swerved to the right lane.
It seems to me that the second defendant in swerving his taxi to the right towards the taxi stand did not keep a proper lookout for vehicles travelling on his right side along the first lane; if only he had kept a proper lookout he would have noticed the motorcycle on the right. In my view, plainly, the second defendant was negligent. The first defendant on the other hand also contributed to the accident. He was riding his motorcycle just slightly behind or at the rear of the taxi. According to him, when the taxi swerved to the right, he also swerved to the right and applied his brakes. I did not accept his evidence that he applied his brakes and slowed down. I also did not accept his evidence that at that time he was travelling at a speed of about 35 km per hour. He must be travelling much faster, and it appeared to me, and this is a matter of inference, that he probably refused to give way to the taxi switching to his lane, and on seeing the taxi swerving right to his lane he must have swerved to the right also and then sought to overtake the taxi on the right and in so doing the collision took place, as a result of which his motorcycle was thrown forward and collided with the plaintiff. The first defendant was therefore partly to blame for the accident but to a lesser extent than the second defendant. I apportioned the blame as follows: two-thirds to the second defendant and one-third to the first defendant.
I now turn to the second issue, and the first question is whether there was any loss of earnings in this case. The plaintiff was at the material time a director of his two family companies, namely, Pan-Asia Services (Pte) Ltd (PSL) and Seagull Marine Services (Pte) Ltd (SML). He was also the chairman of the board of directors of both the companies. In PSL, he was a majority shareholder and the rest of the shares were held by his children. In SML, the shares were held equally between him and his son, Ong Ee Keng. There is no doubt he controlled both the companies. He was working in these two companies as a director. Prior to the accident, he was drawing a salary of $2,000 per month as a director of PSL and $500 per month as a director of SML. Over and above the salaries, these companies also paid dividends and directors` fees. As a result of the accident, he was disabled from working for the companies for a rather long period. During the period in which he was incapacitated he continued to draw salaries from these two companies, in the case of PSL up to May 1981 and in the case of SML up to June 1980. It was not in evidence that he drew these salaries as of right in the circumstances, that is, while he was incapacitated and not working for the companies. In other words, the companies were under no obligation to pay him the salaries. However, he drew the salaries as he required them for his livelihood and expenditure. He said he would refund to the companies any amount awarded to him in respect of such loss.
It is clear that the plaintiff did not receive these salaries as of right under his contracts of service with the companies, assuming he had such contracts of service. If he did, he would not be entitled to recover any loss of earning from the defendants, as no loss had been suffered. In 
 Browning v The War Office & Anor 
 
[1963] 1 QB 750
, the plaintiff was injured in an accident and was paid the disability pension by his employer. It was held that in assessing his loss of earnings credit must be given for the amount he received as of right. This case which dealt with pensions was not approved by the House of Lords in 
 Parry v Cleaver 
 
[1970] AC 1
 but the following dictum of Lord Denning MR, at p 759, on assessment of loss of wages is, in my opinion, good law: 
 
... the injured person must, I think, give credit for any sums which he receives as of right in consequence of his injury. Take wages, for instance, that his employer pays him during his incapacity, being under an obligation to do so. The typical case is the policeman who is entitled to his full wages whilst disabled. He gets them from his employer and he cannot claim the self-same wages again from the wrongdoer. He cannot be allowed to get them twice over. He must give credit for the wages he has received and is entitled to receive.
 
 
 
On the other hand, if payments were made to the injured person by his employer on an ex gratia basis, such payments would not be taken into account in assessing his loss of earnings in the claim against the wrongdoer: see 
 Cunningham v Harrison & Anor 
 
[1973] 1 QB 942
.
In 
 Dennis v London Passenger Transport Board 
 [1948] 1 All ER 779 the plaintiff was injured through the negligence of the defendant and during the period of his disability received no wages, but was paid by his employer amounts which equalled his wages. The plaintiff was expected, but was not under any legal obligation, to refund to his employer the amounts he received if he should recover damages from the defendant. It was held that such payments should not be deducted from the amount recoverable by the plaintiff for loss of wages. Denning J (as he then was) said, at p 779: 
 
... The net result appears to be that the plaintiff received his wages from the London County Council and the Ministry of Pensions. They may have no legal claim to recover it from him, but, in those circumstances, is it to form part of the damages which the defendants have to pay?
 
 
 
The plaintiff tells me, through his counsel, that he is ready to undertake, if he recovers damages, to repay those two bodies, the London County Council and the Ministry of Pensions, the sums they have paid him, which he is under a moral obligation to do. The cardinal point to remember is that it is the defendants who are responsible for what has occurred. In my opinion, a wrongdoer is not to be allowed to reduce damages by the fact that other persons have made up to the plaintiff his wages, like the London County Council and the Ministry of Pensions in this case. The plaintiff has lost his wages. In point of law, therefore, prima facie he should have them paid by the wrongdoer. As they have been made up to him by other people who expect to be repaid I think it is proper that that sum should be included as damages, but subject to the direction that the amount paid to the plaintiff by the Ministry of Pensions and the London County Council shall be paid to those bodies out of the sums recovered.
Again, in 
 Lim Kiat Boon & Ors v Lim Seu Kong & Anor 
 
 
 
[1980] 2 MLJ 39
 , the plaintiff who was injured in an accident by the negligence of the defendants was a director of the company which paid his salary and commission during his period of disability; but there was no obligation on the part of the company to make such payments. At the date of payment, there was no expectation that he should refund the amounts received but subsequently at the hearing the plaintiff agreed to repay the amounts to the company, should they be awarded as damages. It was held by the High Court of Malaya that the plaintiff was entitled to recover these amounts of salary and commission.
The instant case is rather unique. The plaintiff did not receive his salaries from the two companies during the period of his disability as a matter of legal right; there was no contractual obligation on the part of PSL and SML or either of them to make such payments to him. It could not be said that he was entitled to receive these salaries as of right, as he was not working or performing any services for the companies or either of them. Nor could it be said that the companies paid him the salaries on an ex gratia basis. But he needed these amounts for his livelihood and expenditure and he therefore drew these amounts from the companies; he said he would refund to the companies whatever amount awarded as loss of earnings. In my view, these amounts could be regarded as advances made to him by the companies in the form of a loan or moneys wrongfully taken by a director without any authority - there was no evidence of any board resolutions passed authorizing such payments. In either case he was under an obligation to refund to the companies the amounts received by him. In my opinion, no credit ought to be given for these amounts drawn by him in assessing his loss of earnings.
The next question is the quantum of the loss of earnings. According to medical evidence, the plaintiff was not well for the period from the date of accident to 15 July 1980. Dr William Fung, the consultant orthopaedic surgeon of Tan Tock Seng Hospital, said that the plaintiff was incapacitated from work until that date. Up to that time, he had a plaster cast and he was immobilized. The plaintiff had sustained a compound comminuted fracture of the mid-shafts of the left tibia and fibula. On 19 May 1980 or thereabout he was advised to undergo an operation as there were signs of non-union of the fracture. Accordingly, he went through an operation on or about that date. He was discharged on 8 June 1980, and thereafter he received treatment as an outpatient. It was suggested that while he was in plaster cast he could move from home to office and other places and work. But Dr Fung said that he was not wholly fit and even if he was seated he would still have pain and that it was not easy for him to get about in a plaster. It seems to me that for the period from the date of accident to 15 July 1980 he could not really work effectively as a director of his companies. I therefore considered this period as a reasonable one for the purpose of calculating the quantum of loss of earnings. During this period the loss he had sustained in terms of salary from PSL amounted to $32,741.94 calculated at $2,000 pm. As for SML, no salary was drawn for the period after June 1980 at the company was not doing well. I allowed a sum of $7,935.48 representing his loss of salary from that company for the period up to June 1980 at $500 per month. To these amounts totalling $40,677.42 were added the respective amounts of contribution to the Central Provident Fund, thus making a total sum of $48,629.19 which I awarded as special damages for loss of earnings.

The Companies (Amendment) Bill was committed to a Select Committee, by resolution of Parliament, on 17 January 1984. On 26 January 1984 the Clerk of Parliament caused to be published in the 
 Straits Times 
 a notice inviting representations on the Bill from the public, for the consideration of the Select Committee.
In causing the notice to be so published, the Clerk had acted in pursuance of Standing Order 75, which is in the following terms: 
 
Unless Parliament otherwise orders, upon a Bill being committed to a Select Committee, the Clerk shall as soon as practicable thereafter advertise in such newspapers as the Speaker may direct, inviting written representations on the Bill to be sent to him within not less than a period of fifteen days from the date of the advertisement and requesting the representors to state whether they are prepared, if required, to appear before the Select Committee to give evidence in support of or supplementary to their written representations.
 
 
 
The Clerk`s notice set out the main objects of the Bill, and representors were requested to state `whether they would be prepared, if invited, to appear before the Select Committee to give oral evidence supporting or supplementing their written representations`.
The defendant, Mr S Sivadas, in response to the invitation contained in the notice, submitted written representations to the Clerk on 7 February 1984. He indicated that he would be prepared, subject to certain travel arrangements, to appear before the Select Committee with a view to giving oral evidence. The defendant`s representations were acknowledged by the Clerk in a letter dated 15 February 1984 in which the Clerk stated that the defendant would be informed if the Select Committee decided that he was to be invited to give evidence before it.
The Select Committee held a number of meetings. At the first of these which took place on 4 April 1984, all written representations then at hand were considered, and it was decided that the Committee would hear oral evidence from a number of representors. The defendant was not among those whose oral evidence the Committee resolved to hear. The Committee also decided at this first meeting that all written representations received by it would be included in its report, when published.
In the result, the defendant was not invited to give oral evidence before the Committee, whose report was presented to Parliament on 12 June 1984. Appendix II to the report comprised the written representations received by the Committee, including those made by the defendant.
The first plaintiffs are newspaper proprietors and publishers and the second plaintiffs are publishers. The third to ninth plaintiffs, all men distinguished in their respective fields, were members of the boards of the first and second plaintiffs when the defendant made his written representations to the Select Committee. They took the view that they had been gravely defamed by certain of the statements which formed part of the defendant`s representations, and caused a writ to be issued against him on 24 August 1984, claiming damages for defamation and an injunction to restrain the defendant from further publishing the statements complained of or similar statements.
On 15 November 1984 the defendant`s solicitors issued a summons to strike out, asserting that the statements complained of by the plaintiffs could not be the subject of proceedings, by reason of absolute privilege. The application was dismissed with costs by the registrar on 11 January 1985.
The defendant appealed to a judge in chambers. His appeal was dismissed with costs in May 1985. Lai Kew Chai J, while expressing a tentative view that the defendant`s written representations to the Select Committee were absolutely privileged, held that it was not so plain or obvious a case as to warrant a striking out: 
 Times Publishing Bhd & Ors v Sivadas 
 
 
 
[1986] 1 MLJ 372
 .
Pleadings closed on 24 May 1985. The defendant raises a number of defences, including absolute privilege. Paragraph 8 of the amended defence is in the following terms: 
 
Further or in the alternative as to para 5 of the re-amended statement of claim herein, the defendant will say that the alleged occasion of publication was an occasion of absolute privilege.
 
 
 
 
 Particulars
 
The defendant will say that the said words are published in pursuance of an advertisement or notice placed by Parliament of Singapore on 26 January 1984 requesting members of the public to make representations on the said Companies (Amendment) Bill which is a matter of public interest and/or is covered by the privilege given to parliamentary proceedings.
Further or in the alternative as to para 5 of the re-amended statement of claim herein, the defendant would say that the alleged occasion of publication was an occasion of qualified privilege.
On 23 July 1985, the defendant petitioned the Public Petitions Committee of Parliament. He asked, inter alia, that the proceedings commenced against him by the plaintiffs be declared a breach of the privileges of Parliament. The Committee sought the opinion of the Attorney General, and in the light of his opinion, reported to Parliament on 16 October 1985 that it would not be proper for Parliament `to intervene in the legal proceedings against Mr Sivadas`.
There matters rested until 3 March 1986, when the defendant applied for a preliminary issue to be determined by the court. On 25 April 1986, the learned Chief Justice made this order: 
 
The following question or issue of law be tried as a preliminary issue in this action before the trial of the action and that until the determination of the preliminary question or issue, all further proceedings in the action be stayed, namely, whether the defence of absolute privilege as pleaded in the amended defence herein is as a matter of law available to the defendant as a defence on the facts disclosed in the pleadings herein.
 
 
 
It is common ground that an affirmative answer on the preliminary issue would dispose of the plaintiffs` claim against the defendant.
It is plain, and was not in dispute, that absolute privilege extends to statements made by strangers when so made by them as witnesses physically present in the course of proceedings in Parliament, and that proceedings before a Select Committee are `proceedings in Parliament`. Accordingly, the sole question is whether absolute privilege extends to written representations made by a witness, who is a stranger, to a Select Committee of Parliament in Singapore, in response to an invitation from Parliament, when the witness has not given oral evidence before the Committee.
I will proceed first by investigating the position in England, and then by considering whether that position is in any way altered by the provisions of the relevant Singapore statute, the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act (the Singapore Act).
 Lake v King 
 85 ER 137 concerned printing of a libel of the plaintiff Lake in a petition addressed by the defendant King to a Committee of the House of Commons `then and there constituted and appointed, by the Commons then and there assembled in Parliament, to hear and examine the grievances of this realm of England, which said Committee then and there had full power and authority to hear and examine grievances of this kind ...`. Having presented his petition to the Committee, Lake was summoned to appear before it. He did so, and gave evidence. It was held that the exhibiting of the petition to the Committee was lawful, and that no action lay for it, notwithstanding that it contained matter which was false and malicious.
The Bill of Rights was passed into law some 21 years after 
 Lake v King 
 85 ER 137. Article 9 of it provided that `the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament`. It is clear, on the face of it, that the Bill of Rights was an Act declaratory of `the rights and liberties of the subject ...`. The freedom of speech attaching to proceedings in Parliament was not introduced by the Bill but was a right based upon custom or practice, established certainly by the mid-16th century: 
 
The practice of claiming these privileges developed gradually. In the reign of Henry IV, the only privilege claimed by the Speaker was for himself, that he might be allowed to inform the King of the mind of the Commons, and that if he made any error in doing so it might be corrected by reference to the House (3 Rot Parl 424; see also ibid, 425). In 1536 there is a definite demand of access to the Crown; in 1541 comes the demand for freedom of speech (by Speaker Moyle, see Elsynge 175-6), and in 1554 the three claims of freedom from arrest, freedom of speech, and of access, were first made together (CJ (1547-1628) 37). By the end of the sixteenth century the practice seems to have become regular (see 2 Hatsell 225 et seq. 
 Erskine May
 (20th Ed) p 73).
 
 
 
 
 
 Erskine May 
 
 proceeds to consider the meaning of `proceedings in Parliament` in the following terms, at p 92: 
 
The primary meaning, as a technical parliamentary term, of `proceedings` (which it had at least as early as the seventeenth century) is some formal action, usually a decision, taken by the House in its collective capacity. This is naturally extended to the forms of business in which the House takes action, 
 and the whole process, the principal part of which is debate, by which it reaches a decision
.
 
 
 
An individual member takes part in a proceeding usually by speech, but also by various recognized kinds of formal action, such as voting, giving notice of a motion etc, or presenting a petition or a report from a Committee, most of such actions being time-saving substitutes for speaking.
Officers of the House take part in its proceedings principally by carrying out its orders, general or particular. 
 Strangers also can take part in the proceedings of a House, eg by giving evidence before it or before one of its committees, or by securing the presentation of their petitions 
.
While taking part in the proceedings of a House, members, officers and strangers are protected by the same sanction as that by which freedom of speech is protected, namely, that they cannot be called to account for their actions by any authority other than the House itself. [Emphasis mine.]
In 
 Goffin v Donnelly 
 
(1881) 6 QBD 307
, the defendant, in answer to an action for slander, pleaded that the statements complained of were part of the evidence given by him in the character of a witness before a Select Committee of the House of Commons, which had been appointed to inquire into and report upon the circumstances relating to the supervision of the certificate of the plaintiff, a schoolmaster. In the course of its inquiry, the Committee summoned the defendant as a witness, and the words complained of by the plaintiff were extracts from the defendant`s evidence as a witness before the Committee.
In holding that the defence of absolute privilege was good, Field J stated: 
 
It was argued that it was contrary to natural justice that a man should be allowed to be prejudiced by statements made before a Select Committee, upon an occasion when he could have no opportunity to rebut such statements, and to show that the imputations made upon him were unfounded; but the statement made by the defendant in 
 Seaman v Netherclift
 2 CPD 53 affected a person who was not present, and who had no opportunity of vindicating himself on the occasion when the statement was made. It may be a hardship upon individuals that statements of a defamatory nature should be made concerning them, but the interest of the individual is subordinated by the law to a higher interest, viz, that of public justice, to the administration of which it is necessary that witness should be free to give their evidence without fear of consequences. The plaintiff`s counsel drew a distinction between a court of justice and the tribunal before which the statements in this case were made. Can such a distinction be drawn? The House of Commons, in the performance of its functions and for the purposes of legislation, has to inquire into many matters, and among others the conduct of that department of government which deals with education.
 
 
 
For the purposes of such inquiries committees are appointed, and require the attendance of witnesses. If persons so required to attend did not attend, they would be committed for contempt. If they do attend they must answer the questions asked of them, and may be examined on oath.
The evidence given is, therefore, as much given under compulsion as in the case of a court of law. For these reasons this seems to me to be a stronger case of privilege than some of the occasions that have been held to be clearly privileged.
In 
 Rivlin v Bilainkin 
[1953] 1 QB 485the plaintiff in an action for slander and libel was granted an interim injunction to restrain the defendant from repeating the alleged defamatory statements. The defendant subsequently delivered, by post and hand, five communications repeating the alleged libel to five members of Parliament. The plaintiff applied for an order convicting the defendant to prison for breach of the injunction. It was held that, since the communications were in no way connected with any proceedings in Parliament, they were not protected by parliamentary privilege so as to oust the jurisdiction of the court to commit for contempt.
 Re Parliamentary Privilege Act 1770 
 [1985] AC 331 was a case in which a member of Parliament wrote a letter of complaint to a minister concerning certain activities of an area board of a nationalized industry for which the minister was responsible. The minister forwarded the letter to the board. Upon the board threatening to sue the member for libel, he raised the threat in the House of Commons, as a question of privilege. The Committee of Privileges, which considered the matter, reported that the member, in writing to the minister, was engaged in a proceeding in Parliament, and that the board and its solicitors were in breach of parliamentary privilege. However, having regard to the possible effect of the Parliamentary Privilege Act 1770 on the question, the Committee of Privileges recommended that the opinion of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council be sought on the issue as to whether art 9 of the Bill of Rights had been impliedly repealed by the 1770 statute. In advising that the Bill of Rights was not affected by the later statute, the Judicial Committee declined to be drawn on whether the member`s letter to the minister amounted to a proceeding in Parliament.
However, in a commentary on the case 
 de 
 
 Smith on Constitutional & Administrative Law 
 (5th Ed) at p 330, states: 
 
At present the probability is that a court would hold a letter written by an MP to a minister on a matter lying within the minister`s general area of responsibility to be protected only by qualified privilege in the law of defamation, 
 unless the letter was ancillary, or an immediate preliminary, to proceedings within Parliament itself
. Public policy considerations can be canvassed on either side. Letters, from members of the public to MPs (and presumably from MPs to members of the public) on matters of public concern enjoy only qualified privilege. So do fair and accurate newspaper reports of parliamentary proceedings. [Emphasis is again mine.]
 
 
 
In 
 Church of Scientology of California v Johnson-Smith 
 [1972] 1 All ER 378, the plaintiffs brought an action for libel against the defendant, a member of Parliament, for remarks made during a television interview. The defendant claimed, inter alia, that the words complained of were fair comment on certain reports appearing in Hansard, which document, the defendant asserted, was absolutely privileged. By sub-paras (ix) and (x) of their reply, the plaintiffs asserted malice, and during the trial counsel for the defendant suggested that the court might impinge upon the privileges of Parliament if those paragraphs of the reply which referred to Hansard were inquired into. The court invited the Attorney General`s assistance as amicus curiae, following which it was held that the extracts from Hansard `... must not be used in any way which might involve questioning, in a wide sense, what was said in the House of Commons as recorded in Hansard`. In the course of his judgment on the point, Browne J said: 
 
In my view sub-paras (ix) and (x) must involve a suggestion that the defendant was, in one way or another, acting improperly or with an improper motive when he did and said in Parliament the things referred to in those sub-paragraphs. I accept the Attorney General`s argument that the scope of parliamentary privilege extends beyond excluding any cause of action in respect of what is said or done in the House itself. And I accept his proposition which I have already tried to quote, that is, that what is said or done in the House in the course of proceedings there cannot be examined outside Parliament for the purpose of supporting a cause of action even though the cause of action itself arises out of something done outside the House. In my view this conclusion is supported both by principle and authority.
 
 
 
In 
 R v Secretary of State, ex parte Anderson Strathclyde Plc 
 [1983] 2 All ER 233, the question as to the use to which Hansard could be put was again considered by the court, which considered and applied the decision of Browne J in the 
 Church of Scientology 
 case [1972] 1 All ER 378. Dunn LJ, at p 239, stated: 
 
In my judgment there is no distinction between using a report in Hansard for the purpose of supporting a cause of action arising out of something which occurred outside the House, and using a report for the purpose of supporting a ground for relief in proceedings for judicial review in respect of something which occurred outside the House. In both cases the court would have to do more than take note of the fact that a certain statement was made in the House on a certain date. It would have to consider the statement or statements with a view to determining what was the true meaning of them, and what were the proper inferences to be drawn from them. This, in my judgment, would be contrary to art 9 of the Bill of Rights. It would be doing what Blackstone said was not to be done, namely to examine, discuss and adjudge on a matter which was being considered in Parliament. Moreover, it would be an invasion by the court of the right of every member of Parliament to free speech in the House with the possible adverse effects referred to by Browne J.
 
 
 
The Australian case of 
 R v Murphy 
ALR 498 dealt with the question whether the makers of written statements to a Select Committee could, without breach of parliamentary privilege, be cross-examined in a criminal trial in relation to those statements. Counsel appearing as amicus curiae submitted that the witnesses could not be so cross-examined, relying for that proposition on art 9 of the Bill of Rights.
The facts giving rise to the question are summarized by Hunt J, at pp 499-500, in this way: 
 
The particular circumstances to which the law of parliamentary privilege is said to be relevant are these:
 
 
 
 
(1) In May 1984, the principal Crown witness, Mr Briese CSM, gave a written statement to a Senate Select Committee appointed earlier that year to inquire into, and to report upon, the conduct of a federal judge. In both May and July, Mr Briese gave evidence before that committee. 
 
(2) In July, the accused in these present proceedings gave a written statement to the committee in response to the matters detailed in Mr Briese`s statement. 
 
(3) The committee`s report was presented to the Senate and ordered to be printed in August. 
 
(4) In September, Mr Briese gave a further statement to counsel assisting a second Senate Select Committee appointed that month to, inquire into, and to report upon, his allegations concerning the accused. In October, Mr Briese gave evidence before that committee. 
 
(5) Following a specific resolution of the Senate, the statement given by the accused to the first committee was one of the documents made available by the second committee to the Commissioners appointed to assist it, and to Mr Briese and his counsel. When tendered in evidence before the second committee, however, the statement was rejected as inadmissible under the rules of evidence. The accused declined to appear as a witness before the committee. 
 
(6) The second committee`s report was presented to the Senate and ordered to be printed later the same month. 
 
(7) In both reports, the evidence of Air Briese is referred to in considerable detail, and parts of it are quoted. The statement given by the accused to the first committee is refereed to in general terms only. I am informed that its contents have never been made public by either of the committees or by the Senate, but its precise status has not been resolved by me in these preliminary proceedings.
  
 
 
It will be seen, therefore, that the accused Murphy submitted a written statement to the Select Committee, but declined to appear as a witness before it.
Article 49 of the Australian Constitution contains a provision similar to s 3(1) of the Singapore Act. It provides that, until declared by Parliament itself, the privileges of the Commonwealth Parliament and of its members and committees are those of the House of Commons in the United Kingdom as at 1901. There was no contest that the Bill of Rights was part of Australian law.
Hunt J concluded, inter alia, that the courts in England had gone too far in the 
 Church of Scientology 
 [1972] 1 All ER 378 and 
 Anderson Strathclyde 
 [1983] 2 All ER 233 cases in concluding that any questioning of what is said in Parliament constitutes a breach of parliamentary privilege. The learned judge concluded that it was permissible to consider the contents of a statement made by a witness to Parliament, so long as it was not sought to challenge such statement in a manner which brought about consequences upon the maker of the statement. He said, at p 508: 
 
What is meant by the declaration that `freedom of speech ... in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament` is, in my view, that no court proceedings (or proceedings of a similar nature) having legal consequences against a member of Parliament (or a witness before a parliamentary committee) are permitted which by those legal consequences have the effect of preventing that member (or committee witness) from exercising his freedom of speech in Parliament (or before a committee) or of punishing him for having done so. In other words, the phrase `impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament` in art 9 should be interpreted in the sense that the exercise of the freedom of speech given to members of Parliament (and committee witnesses) may not be challenged by way of court (or similar) process having legal consequences for such persons because they had exercised that freedom.
 
 
 
The question is to what extent the authorities and textbooks to, which I have referred assist me in determining whether the written representations of the defendant in this case can be said to have been part of proceedings in Parliament, to which absolute privilege attached.
The facts in 
 Lake v King 
 85 ER 137 come very close to those in the present case. Mr Wong Meng Meng, for the defendant, advanced it as major support for his argument that the position in England, even pre-Bill of Rights, was that a written representation to a committee of Parliament, no matter that it contained statements which were malicious and untruthful, attracted absolute privilege. Lord Irvine, on behalf of the plaintiffs, saw 
 Lake v King 
 85 ER 137 as simply no authority by which to decide that, in modern times, all written representations to all Select Committees, concerning potential legislation are clothed with absolute privilege, regardless that they might contain false and malicious allegations. 
 Lake v King 
 85 ER 137, he argued, was a pre-Bill of Rights case. The committee in 
 Lake v King 
 85 ER 137 was exercising a judicial or quasi-judicial function, which the committee in the present case was not. All 
 Lake v King 
 85 ER 137 established was that when Parliament is exercising a judicial or quasi-judicial function, then a stranger who is a witness before it enjoys the same privilege as if he were a witness before a court of law. That was clear, said Lord Irvine, from the passage at p 139 of the report which states that no action lay against King because the Committee sat `in a summary course of justice` and comprised `those who have power to examine (the petition) whether it be true or false`.
I do not consider the fact that the Select Committee in 
 Lake v King 
 85 ER 137 was exercising a judicial or quasi-judicial function, rather than a legislative one, affects the value of the case as authority. No case was cited to me in which that distinction was made for any purpose. I am not impressed, either, with the fact that 
 Lake v King 
 85 ER 137 was a pre-Bill of Rights case, because it is clear that the Bill, and accordingly art 9 of it, were declaratory of the position with regard to parliamentary privilege as it existed prior to 1688. I therefore regard 
 Lake v King 
 85 ER 137 as strong authority in support of an affirmative finding on the issue, it having been there held that it `was in the order and course of proceedings in Parliament` that the defendant King had caused to be printed and delivered to the Committee the petition complained of by the plaintiff Lake.
In so far as 
 Goffin v Donnelly 
 
(1881) 6 QBD 307
 is concerned, Lord Irvine contended that the case is of no assistance at all. It makes no reference to the Bill of Rights; the Select Committee referred to in it was set up for a particular purpose and exercised a judicial function; and in any event, the court applied the analogy of a witness present and given evidence in a court of law.
In my judgment, 
 Goffin v Donnelly 
 dealt, without a doubt, with the question of parliamentary privilege. The fact that the Committee exercised a judicial function, and was set up for a particular purpose, is immaterial. The value of the case lies in the importance attached by the court to the principle that a witness before a parliamentary committee should feel free to give evidence without any apprehension as to the consequences of doing so, even if persons prejudiced by such evidence might have no opportunity to rebut it. Incidentally, if it be said that Field J`s mind was affected by the fact that a witness before a parliamentary committee was compellable, and might be committed for contempt if he failed to attend, then the same can be said of the position in Singapore since Standing Order 98(2) empowers Select Committees to `send for persons`, and s 20(2) of the Singapore Act provides sanctions for contempt.
Lord Irvine submitted that 
 Rivlin 
`s case 
[1953] 1 QB 485
 is of little value, since it makes no reference to the Bill of Rights, and does not support the proposition that under the Bill of Rights the defendant would be entitled to absolute privilege. All the case showed was that the privilege is that of a witness who gives oral evidence. In my judgment, 
 Rivlin 
 goes further. The issue in the case was whether or not the court`s jurisdiction was ousted by parliamentary privilege in that the defendant`s communications were connected with `proceedings in Parliament`, in the sense of art 9 of the Bill of Rights, although the Bill was not expressly referred to. The inference is that, had the defendant been able to establish that his communication was connected with proceedings in Parliament, he would have succeeded.
The 
 Church of Scientology 
 [1972] 1 All ER 378 and 
 Strathclyde 
 [1983] 2 All ER 233 cases demonstrate the extent to which the courts in England are prepared to go in ensuring that proceedings in Parliament are not impeached. Although Hunt J, in 
 R v Murphy 
 64 ALR 498, took a more restrictive view, he nonetheless held that the accused in a criminal trial could not, without breach of parliamentary privilege, be cross-examined in relation to a statement made to a Select Committee, although he had declined to appear as a witness before the Committee.
In the result, I am persuaded by such authority as exists, that the defendant`s written representations to the Select Committee would have attracted absolute privilege had they been made to a Select Committee of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom. In my judgment, the act of the defendant in submitting written representations was so ancillary to, and connected with proceedings in Parliament, as to become part of those proceedings. Put another way, they were part of the parliamentary process by which the House reached its decision on the Bill laid before it.
It is true that the defendant Sivadas was not invited to attend before the Select Committee in order to give evidence in support of his representations. But whether or not he was so invited was a matter entirely in the hands of the Committee. He could have been invited; he might even have been `sent for` or summoned. The fact that he was not should surely not affect the character of the representations he made, in the sense of clothing them with absolute privilege if he gave evidence in support of them, and depriving them of privilege if he did not. A situation can be envisaged in which written representations might be made which are so complete and explicit that the Select Committee considering them does not require the representor to attend and support them by oral evidence. Is such a representor to be at a disadvantage, in terms of privilege, compared to one whose representations require explanation or elaboration, and who is thus required to attend and give evidence before the Committee for this purpose? That would be a remarkable, and unjust, result.
I have reached my conclusion notwithstanding Lord Irvine`s powerful submission that absolute privilege does not extend to written communications addressed to a Select Committee, whether or not they are invited, when the communicator does not give evidence in person. Lord Irvine conceded that in order to succeed in the action his clients must show malice, but he argued that it was quite another thing to say that the defendant was entitled to his claim to absolute privilege. Sound public policy requires, he contended, that the privileges of Parliament should be kept within reasonable bounds so as to involve the minimum curtailment of a litigant`s ordinary right to claim damages for a wrong done to him. This was particularly so when the claim to privilege was not by Parliament, or a member of Parliament, but by a stranger.
Lord Irvine urged me to adopt, by analogy, the approach of Lord Wilberforce in 
 Roy v Prior 
 
[1971] AC 470
. The facts and determination of that case are set out in the head-note, which reads: 
 
At the trial of A for larceny, his solicitor, the defendant in the present action, issued a witness summons requiring the attendance of the plaintiff, a doctor, to give evidence in A`s defence. The subpoena was not served and the defendant took the view that the plaintiff was evading service. Accordingly he instructed counsel to apply for the issue of a bench warrant to compel the plaintiff`s attendance and he gave evidence himself in support of the application. The plaintiff was arrested and compelled to give evidence.
 
 
 
The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant claiming damages for causing his arrest and his being forcibly brought to court to give evidence. The Court of Appeal, allowing the defendant`s appeal from the decision of MacKenna J refusing to dismiss the action, ordered the statement of claim to be struck out on the ground that it disclosed no maintainable cause of action. The Appeal Committee gave the plaintiff leave to appeal on condition that the pleadings were amended to disclose an allegation of malicious arrest.
On the plaintiff`s appeal: 
 
Held, that the action should not be dismissed, as disclosing no cause of action; that although no action would lie against a witness for words spoken in giving evidence, an action in respect of an alleged abuse of the process of the court was not to be defeated even though one step in the abuse involved the giving of evidence.
 
 
 
In the course of his brief speech, Lord Wilberforce said: 
 
The reasons why immunity is traditionally (and for this purpose I accept the tradition) conferred upon witnesses in respect of evidence given in court, are in order that they may give their evidence fearlessly and to avoid a multiplicity of actions in which the value or truth of their evidence would be tried over again. Moreover, the trial process contains in itself, in the subjection to cross-examination and confrontation with other evidence, some safeguard against careless, malicious or untruthful evidence.
 
 
 
But none of this applies as regards such evidence as was given in support of the application for a bench warrant. It was given ex parte: Dr Roy had no means, and no other party any interest, in challenging it: so far from the public interest requiring that it be given absolute protection, that interest requires that it should have been given carefully, responsibly and impartially. To deny a person whose liberty has been interfered with any opportunity of showing that it was ill founded and malicious, does not in the least correspond with, and is a far more serious denial than, the traditional denial of the right to attack a witness to an issue which has been tested and passed upon after a trial. Immunities conferred by the law in respect of legal proceedings need always to be checked against a broad view of the public interest. So checked, the present case provides no justification for protecting absolutely what the solicitor said in the court. I need not add that I am not prejudging in any way whether what he said was well founded or lacking in malice. That is for the action to decide.
Lord Wilberforce`s approach, it was said, applied word for word to the issue of whether the plaintiffs in this case should be entitled to vindicate themselves, allegedly having been libelled by the ex parte representations of the defendant, which were untested by the Select Committee since the defendant was not invited to give evidence.
The main speech in 
 Roy v Prior 
 
[1971] AC 470
 was delivered by Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest. Lords Reid, Dilhorne and Diplock agreed with his reasoning. In the course of his speech, Lord Morris said: 
 
It is well settled that no action will lie against a witness for words spoken in giving evidence in a court even if the evidence is falsely and maliciously given (see 
 Dawkins v Lord Rokeby
 (1873) LR 8 QB 255, 
 Watson v M`Ewan
 
[1905] AC 480
). If a witness gives false evidence he may be prosecuted if the crime of perjury has been committed but a civil action for damages in respect of the words spoken will not lie (see the judgment of Lord Goddard CJ in 
 Hargreaves v Bretherton
 
[1959] 1 QB 45
). Nor is this rule to be circumvented by alleging a conspiracy between witnesses to make false statements (see 
 Marrinan v Vibart
 
[1963] 1 QB 528
).
 
 
 
This, however, does not involve that an action which is not brought in respect of evidence given in court but is brought in respect of an alleged abuse of process of court must be defeated if one step in the course of the abuse of the process of the court involved or necessitated the giving of evidence.
It must often happen that a defendant who is sued for damages for malicious prosecution will have given evidence in the criminal prosecution of which the plaintiff complains.
The essence of the complaint in such a case is that criminal proceedings have been instituted not only without reasonable and probable cause but also maliciously. So also in actions based upon alleged abuse of the process of the court it will often have happened that the court will have been induced to act by reason of some false evidence given by someone. In such cases the actions are not brought on or in respect of any evidence given but in respect of malicious abuse of process (see 
 Elsee v Smith 
 (1822) 2 Chit 304).
It is evident, therefore, that Lord Morris, and their Lordships other than Lord Wilberforce, considered as inviolate the principle that no action lies against a witness arising out of evidence given in court, even if that evidence be false and malicious. It must follow that the principle applies, even if the evidence is given ex parte and is not open to challenge, and whether or not the evidence was `given carefully, responsibly and impartially`.
Accordingly, I find myself, with great respect, unable to adopt in the present case the approach of Lord Wilberforce.
I turn now to consider whether the position which I have concluded prevails in the United Kingdom is in any way affected by the provisions of the Singapore Act. Section 3(1) and (2) of the Singapore Act are in the following terms: 
 
 
3(1) Save as is otherwise expressly provided in the Constitution and in this Act, the privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament and of the Speaker, members and committees shall be the same as those for the time being held, enjoyed or exercised by the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom or the Speaker, members or committees thereof.
  
 
 
 
(2) Such privileges, immunities and powers shall for all purposes be construed and have effect as if such privileges, immunities and powers were prescribed by this Act, and it shall not be necessary in all proceedings to plead the same but the same shall be judicially noticed in an the courts.
  
 
 
Section 4 of the Singapore Act, which in effect mirrors art 9 of the Bill of Rights, makes the following provisions: 
 
There shall be freedom of speech and debate and proceedings in Parliament, and such freedom of speech and debate and proceedings shall not be liable to be impeached or questioned in any court, commission of inquiry, tribunal or any other place whatsoever out of Parliament.
 
 
 
The Singapore Act deals with privileges and immunities in s 5, which states: 
 
 
(1) No member shall be liable to any civil or criminal proceedings, arrest, imprisonment, or damages by reason of any matter or thing which he may have brought before Parliament or a committee by petition, bill, resolution, motion, or otherwise or may have said in Parliament or in committee. 
 
(2) No person shall be liable to any civil or criminal proceedings, arrest, imprisonment or damages by reason of any act done under the authority of Parliament or the Speaker and within its or, his legal powers or under any warrant issued by virtue of these powers.
  
 
 
The marginal, note to s 17 of the Singapore Act reads: `Immunity of witness in respect of evidence`, and sub-s (1) of that section is in the following terms: 
 
Without prejudice to the provisions of section 16 of this Act and subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, no person who gives evidence before Parliament or any committee shall be liable to any civil or criminal proceedings, arrest, imprisonment or damages by reason of anything which he may have said in such evidence.
 
 
 
It is apparent that the Singapore Act has taken art 9 of the Bill of Rights as its starting point for the purposes of providing for privileges and immunities. The Singapore Act then sets out to add flesh to s 4 by providing, in s 5(1) for exemption from liability for members; and in s 5(2) for exemption from liability for any person, other than a member, who acts `under the authority of Parliament ...`.
It is said, on behalf of the plaintiffs, that s 5(2) has nothing to do with strangers, and that what s 5(2) is concerned with are things done in the name of and on behalf of Parliament by persons authorized by Parliament, in cases where Parliament is acting within its powers and privileges. Thus, as occurred in 
 Bradlaugh v Gossett 
 
(1884) 12 QBD 271
, were an officer of the Singapore Parliament to exclude a member from the House in obedience to a resolution of the House directing him to do so, an action against such officer would not lie by virtue of s 5(2). The subsection, it was argued, did not authorize the defendant`s written representations and affords him no exemption from liability for their contents.
I am unable to agree that s 5(2) justifies the restrictive construction placed upon it by counsel for the plaintiffs. In my judgment, the word `person` in that subsection means any person, and includes strangers. Both the Clerk of Parliament and the defendant, the one by inviting representations and the other by responding to his invitation were performing acts under the authority of Parliament by virtue of Standing Order 75. It follows, in my view, that the defendant is entitled to the immunity provided by s 5(2) of the Singapore Act.
I do not regard this conclusion to be inconsistent either with the presence in the Singapore Act of s 17(1), or with the provisions of that subsection. Section 5(2) confers immunity for acts done under the authority of Parliament. Those acts might or might not involve the making of representations. Section 17(1) is of a narrower ambit. It provides only for the immunity of witnesses who give evidence before Parliament or a committee of Parliament, and I take the view that it is intended to apply to witnesses who appear and give evidence in person. The use of the expression `no person` in s 17(1) suggests to me that it applies, as does s 5(2), to any person who appears before Parliament or a committee in the character of a witness, and it is the final word on the immunity of such a person.
There is therefore no conflict between the provisions of ss 4, 5(2) and 17(1) of the Singapore Act; nor do the provisions of any one of them render otiose the provisions of any other. Section 4 is a general statement which reflects art 9 of the Bill of Rights; s 5(2) deals with the acts of all persons done under the authority of Parliament; and s 17(1) confers immunity on all persons who appear and give evidence in person. The facts of the present case have resulted in an overlap in the provisions of ss 5 (2) and 17(1), on my view of their meaning, but I do not apprehend that to be an uncommon result of the proper construction of a statute.
Accordingly, I find that the immunities of Parliament in Singapore are those which I have concluded exist in the United Kingdom, and that these immunities include exemption from civil and criminal liability arising out of the contents of written representations made by a member of the public to Parliament concerning a Bill before a Select Committee, made in response to an invitation by the Clerk of Parliament, when the representor has not appeared before the Committee and given evidence in person. The question may arise at some time as to whether an unsolicited representation to a Select Committee attracts privilege. That is not a question I propose to address since it does not arise in this case, and could depend on special facts.
Lord Irvine submitted that the existence of parliamentary privilege is due to considerations of public policy, and when a question as to its extent arises, the answer depends upon a balancing by the court of the need to protect proceedings in Parliament with the need to protect citizens who have been wrongfully injured. He argued that it would therefore be consonant with public policy to hold that qualified privilege attaches in relation to written representations to a Select Committee; and that absolute privilege attaches only to oral evidence given by a witness physically present. It is good for democracy, said Lord Irvine, that Parliament should invite the public at large to make representations, but this opportunity for public consultation is open to abuse if the law is that every person who responds to Parliament`s invitation to make written representations is thereby given carte blanche to defame without fear of consequences.
This was a theme to which Lord Irvine returned, in one form or another, at several points in his argument. In answer to it, I would say this. There was nothing before me to suggest that in Singapore written representations to Select Committees have been regarded by representors as charters to defame under the cloak of absolute privilege. Were that to happen, it would be reasonable to expect Parliament to enact legislation to define `proceedings in Parliament` so as to exclude written representations to Select Committees in cases where the representor does not attend and give evidence in person.
Unless and until such legislation is passed into law in Singapore, it remains, in my judgment, in the overriding public interest that written representations to Parliament should attract absolute privilege, so that persons making them in the discharge of their rights should feel free to do so without being threatened with, or vexed by proceedings, whether they be civil or criminal.
It follows that I answer the preliminary question or issue affirmatively. Since that answer disposes of the plaintiffs` cause, and so renders the trial of this matter unnecessary, I dismiss the plaintiffs` claim. They must pay the defendant`s costs of the action.

This is an appeal by the plaintiffs against the decision of the assistant registrar given on 28 August 1987 making no order on the application of the plaintiffs under O 24 r 10 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1970 for the production by the defendants of a certain report referred to in the defence filed.
In this suit, the plaintiffs, a professional firm of accountants, sues for, inter alia, damages for libel. The first defendant is a statutory corporation established under s 3 of the Accountants Act (Cap 2) (the Act) and the second and third defendants are the president and registrar respectively of the first defendant.
Sometime on or about 27 November 1986, the first defendant appointed two of its members, J Medora and KB Lee (hereinafter called `the investigators`), to investigate the accounts of the Pan Electric Group of Companies. As a result of the report of the investigators, the defendants on or about 21 April 1987 issued or caused to be issued a press statement, the full text of which reads as follows: 
 
Two members of the Singapore Society of Accountants were appointed to investigate the accounts of the Pan Electric Group of Companies. They have completed their report and it has been submitted to the Singapore Society of Accountants. It was a massive exercise as there were about 68 subsidiaries and associate companies belonging to the group. It has taken the two investigating accountants more than five months to complete their task.
 
 
 
The investigating accountants have concluded, inter alia, that the accounts for the year 1984 cannot be stated to be `true and fair`. There is evidence to suggest that the group`s profits could be overstated by about $15m.
The report also states that there were abnormally large payments and receipts in the accounts of the group during the last few days of the years 1983 and 1984 and the first few days of the following years for no apparent reason. It also appears that this flow of moneys was effected through a bank account opened only for this purpose. Most of these payments and receipts were from or on behalf of other group companies and a stock broking firm, Associated Asian Securities (Pte) Ltd, with whom most of the companies had no apparent dealings. There is no evidence that the auditors investigated into this state of affairs fully.
The group accounts also show that some 25% of the profits in 1984 were derived from trading in shares. The annual report does not sufficiently disclose this information to the shareholders.
Notwithstanding evidence before them, the auditors failed to carry out adequate audit procedures and exercise appropriate professional judgment.
The Registrar of the Society is presently studying the report and will be taking legal advice on the appropriate action against the auditors involved.
The plaintiffs allege in their statement of claim that it was a matter of public knowledge that the above statement referred and was understood to refer to them as they were involved in auditing the accounts of the Pan Electric Group as a whole and a large number of its subsidiary companies, The plaintiffs aver that the statement was defamatory of them in the way of their profession and in relation to their conduct therein.
On or about 23 April 1987, the defendants issued or caused to be issued a further press statement along similar lines as the first statement save that: 
 
 
(i) the figure in the second paragraph thereof was $10m, not $15m; 
 
(ii) the final sentence in the third paragraph of the first statement was deleted; and 
 
(iii) the penultimate paragraph of the first statement was deleted.
  
 
 
In the statement of claim, the plaintiffs also question the propriety of the appointment of Messrs Medora and Lee by the first defendant to investigate the accounts of the Pan Electric Group of Companies. As this point does not concern us here, I do not propose to say anything more about it.
In the defence filed on 6 June 1987, the defendants admitted that the investigators submitted a report of their investigation (the report) to the third defendant who received it on behalf of the first defendant. The report was referred to in paras 3(1)(e), 3(5) and 3(6) of the defence.
In response to the plaintiffs` claim based on libel on account of the two statements issued, the defendants pleaded that the words are not defamatory of the plaintiffs and, in the alternative, that the words are true in substance and in fact and furnished the following particulars in para 6 of the defence in justification: 
 
 
 Particulars of justification
 
 
 
 
The defendants will rely on the facts and matters stated in that part of the report of Messrs Medora and Lee which is annexed hereto and served herewith.
 
 
 
By a written notice to produce documents referred to in pleadings dated 13 June 1987, the plaintiffs, pursuant to O 24 r 10(1), required the defendants to produce for inspection the complete report of the investigators. There having been no compliance by the defendants, the plaintiffs on 22 June 1987 applied by summons-in-chambers for, inter alia, the production of the report and for an order that the plaintiffs be at liberty to inspect and peruse the documents so produced and to make notes of their contents and be entitled to be supplied with copies thereof on payment of the proper charges. However, on 1 July 1987, the defendants gave written notice to the plaintiffs, pursuant to O 24 r 10(2), objecting to the production of the report on the ground that the other parts of the report, which dealt with accounts audited by two other firms of accountants, Messrs Ernst & Whinney and Messrs Tan Teo & Wong, are not relevant to the issues in the present suit. Not that anything turns on this, I thought I should mention that the notice of objection was given late because it would appear that the solicitor for the defendants was out of the country at the relevant time.
The assistant registrar having made no order on the application to produce the entire report, the plaintiffs have appealed to the judge-in-chambers and this is the matter now before me.
According to the defendants, the report of the investigators consists of three parts. One part relates to the accounts audited by the plaintiffs. Another part relates to the accounts audited by Messrs Ernst & Whinney and a third part relates to the accounts audited by Messrs Tan Teo & Wong. The defendants stated that the three parts are separate and distinct and they do not interrelate. The main reason, as stated in the defendants` written skeletal arguments, why the defendants object to the production of the entire report is that they do not wish those two other firms to complain or take action against the defendants either by way of civil proceedings or by laying a complaint under s 499 of the Penal Code. The defendants contended that if the other two parts are defamatory of the other two firms, then what the plaintiffs are seeking is to ask the court to order the commission of a tort or the commission of an offence.
The defendants stressed that the other two parts of the report have nothing to do with the plaintiffs as they relate to the audit of the other two firms. The defendants stated that Messrs Ernst & Whinney were responsible for the audit of the accounts of four subsidiary companies and Messrs Tan Teo & Wong were responsible for the audit of the accounts of only one subsidiary company and that the plaintiffs had no responsibility whatsoever for the audit of these subsidiary companies. The defendants contended that those two parts of the report are not relevant to the present action of defamation and they are not relying on them.
The functions and duties of an auditor of a holding company are set out in s 207 of the Companies Act (Cap 50). Subsection (2) of that section requires such an auditor to state in his report to the members, inter alia: 
 
 
(i) whether the consolidated accounts are in his opinion properly drawn up so as to give a true and fair view of the matters that are required to be dealt with and are in accordance with the provisions of the Act; 
 
(ii) whether he has considered the accounts and auditor`s reports of all subsidiaries of which he has not acted as auditor, being accounts that are included in the consolidated accounts; 
 
(iii) whether he is satisfied that the accounts of the subsidiaries are in form and content appropriate and proper and whether he has received satisfactory information and explanations are required by him; and 
 
(iv) whether the auditor`s report on the accounts of any subsidiary was made subject to any qualification or comment. Such an auditor of a holding company must also state any defect or irregularity in the consolidated accounts and any material matter not set out in the consolidated accounts. He is also required to form an opinion whether the procedure and methods used by a holding company or a subsidiary in arriving at the amounts taken into account in the consolidated accounts were appropriate to the circumstances of the consolidation.
  
 
 
As stated above, the plaintiffs were the auditors of the consolidated accounts of the Pan Electric Group of Companies, besides being the auditors of numerous subsidiary companies. The following remarks in the two statements complained of are most pertinent: 
 
 
(i) `There is evidence to suggest that the group`s profits could be overstated by about $15m.` (changed to $10m in the second statement.) 
 
(ii) In referring to the abnormally large payments and receipts in the accounts of the group during the last few days of the years 1983 and 1984 and the first few days of the following years, the following comment was made: `There is no evidence that the auditors investigated into this state of affairs fully,` (appears only in the first statement). 
 
(iii) `The group accounts also show that some 25% of the profits in 1984 were derived from trading in shares. The annual report does not sufficiently disclose the information to the shareholders.` 
 
(iv) `The auditors failed to carry out adequate audit procedures and exercise appropriate professional judgments.` (appears only in the first statement.)
  
 
 
No distinction was made between the different firms of accountants and neither is there any reference to parts of a report.
From the information contained in that portion of the report which has been furnished by the defendants, Mr JM McCormack, in his affidavit filed on behalf of the plaintiffs on 15 September 1987 has listed out four instances where the plaintiffs were criticized by the investigators in relation to audit work undertaken by Messrs Ernst & Whinney, Messrs Tan Teo & Wong and Messrs Peat Marwick Mitchell. Bearing in mind the functions and duties of an auditor of a holding company preparing consolidated accounts, I would tend to agree that the remarks made by the investigators on the audit work of Messrs Ernst & Whinney and Messrs Tan Teo & Wong would be relevant in determining whether the remarks against the plaintiffs made by the investigators, upon which the defendants rely, are justified and/or fair and reasonable.
In para 10 of the affidavit of Ms Susan Leong filed on 11 March 1988, she sets out the views of the two investigators on this point. It is of interest to note that the investigators said that `our investigation reports for each of the three auditors can be treated as separate` and not `are separate`. This is also the first time where the report is referred to in the plural - `reports`. The link between the duties of the auditors of the group accounts and those of the auditors of the subsidiary accounts is recognized by the investigators when they said `at the stage when SSA [first defendant] reviews the group accounts the group auditor would have to justify what steps were taken to ensure the reasonableness of the subsidiaries` figures that were incorporated into the group accounts.`
I also note that the portion of the report which has been furnished by the defendants to the plaintiffs does not appear to be in the usual form and those pages seem to contain separate comments on the audit done by the plaintiffs on the accounts of each individual company, including the holding company. I find it most unusual for an investigator to submit a report in this way. I would expect there to be at least a covering letter or an introduction setting out the terms of reference and the methods used in their investigations. Similarly, there must also be a general conclusion. In any event, having regard to the nature of the present action and the clear link between the accounts of a subsidiary company and those of its holding company, I am of the opinion that the entire report is relevant to the action and that the production of the full report is necessary for disposing fairly of this case (see O 24 r 13(1) of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1970).
I turn next to the arguments of the defendants that the production of the entire report could expose the defendants to civil and criminal action which could be brought by Messrs Ernst & Whinney and Messrs Tan Teo & Wong. I would first point out that this is not a ground set out in the notice of objection served by the defendants pursuant to O 24 r 10(2). In any case, I seriously wonder why the defendants are taking this point at this time. This should have been their concern before they issued the statements on 21 April and 23 April 1987. I do not think it could have been their intention now to suggest that anything improper is contained in the other two parts of the report. Indeed, a partner of Messrs Tan Teo & Wong was convicted of wilfully making a misleading statement, an offence under s 401(2) of the Companies Act, in relation to the firm`s audit of one of the subsidiaries of the Pan Electric Group. No authority was cited to me by counsel for the defendants to show that compliance by a party with an order of court to produce constituted publication which could form a basis for an action in tort or a basis for criminal action under s 499 of the Penal Code. On the contrary, it is settled law that statements made in the course of judicial proceedings or statements contained in documents made in judicial proceedings are absolutely privileged: see 
 Gatley on Libel & Slander 
 (8th Ed) paras 381, 385 and 400, and 
 Law v Llewellyn 
 
[1906] 1 KB 487
. Where an occasion is privileged at common law for the purposes of civil libel, it will also be privileged for the purposes of criminal libel: see 
 R v Rule 
 
[1937] 2 KB 375
 and 
 R v Munslow 
 [1895] 1 KB 758 at p 761.
It also seems clear that a party who obtains documents by process of court can only use them for the purposes of those proceedings and nothing else: see 
 Gatley 
 at para 1210 and 
 Harman v Home Office 
 
[1983] 1 AC 280
, a decision of the House of Lords. A subsequent action founded on documents so disclosed may be struck out: see 
 Riddick v Thames Board Mills 
 
[1977] QB 881
. In 
 Riddick 
 
[1977] QB 881
, Lord Denning said at p 896: 
 
The memorandum was obtained by compulsion. Compulsion is an invasion of a private right to keep one`s documents to oneself. The public interest in privacy and confidence demands that this compulsion should not be pressed further than the course of justice requires. The courts should, therefore, not allow the other party - or anyone else - to use the documents for any ulterior or alien purpose ... In order to encourage openness and fairness, the public interest requires that documents disclosed on discovery are not to be made use of except for the purposes of the action in which they are disclosed. They are not to be made a ground ... for bringing a libel action ...
 
 
 
In the premises, and as no good cause has been shown to refuse production, I would order the production by the defendants of the complete report within seven days hereof at the office of their solicitors, Messrs Chung & Co, for inspection by the plaintiffs, and the defendants shall, as requested by the plaintiffs, furnish copies thereof on payment of the proper charges. I should, however, like to make it an express condition of this order that the report shall be used by the plaintiffs solely for the purposes of this action and nothing else. I would hasten to add and this must have been obvious, that no observation that I have made herein should be taken to mean that I have in any way passed judgment on any aspect relating to the substantive merits of the case.
The appeal is accordingly allowed with costs fixed at $1,000.

In Magistrate`s Appeal No 463 of 1985 the petitioner, Hawa bte Haji Hussain, who brought a private summons against the respondent, appealed against the sentence on the ground that it was manifestly inadequate. The respondent was tried and convicted of the offence of voluntarily causing hurt to the appellant. The magistrate gave him a conditional discharge for one year from 22 November 1985. The proceedings were taken pursuant to a complaint under s 128(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the Code) which complaint was examined under s 133(1) of the Code. Since the restrictions imposed by ss 129 to 132 of the Code did not apply, the appellant as the complainant was represented by counsel who appeared under s 28(1) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161).
Not satisfied with what she considered to be a manifestly inadequate sentence, the appellant who was only the complainant in the case filed a notice of appeal under s 247(1) of the Code which, being important for present purposes, is reproduced below: 
 
Subject to sections 242, 244 and 245 any person who is dissatisfied with any judgment, sentence or order pronounced by any District Court or Magistrate`s Court in a criminal case or matter to which he is a party may prefer an appeal to the High Court against that judgment, sentence or order in respect of any error in law or in fact or, in an appeal against sentence, on the ground that the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive or inadequate by lodging within 10 days from the time of the judgment, or order being passed or made, with the Registrar of the Subordinate Courts at the court house at which the trial was held, a notice of appeal in triplicate addressed to the High Court.
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant then referred to s 249 of the Code and contended that the magistrate`s court was only obliged to, as it did, transmit to the respondent a signed copy of the record of proceedings and of the grounds of decision together with a copy of the notice and of the petition of appeal. The Public Prosecutor was not served with the papers. Counsel for the appellant stressed the disjunctive in s 249 of the Code which reads as follows: 
 
When section 247 has been complied with, the court appealed from shall transmit to the High Court and to the Public Prosecutor or to the respondent or his advocate, as the case may be, a signed copy of the record of the proceedings and of the grounds of the decision together with a copy of the notice and of the petition of appeal.
 
 
 
At the commencement of the hearing of the appeal, the deputy public prosecutor appeared and submitted that the notice of appeal should be rejected by this court and that, at any rate, the Public Prosecutor was intervening to withdraw the appeal. He relied on cl 8 of art 35 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore which provides: 
 
The Attorney General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence.
 
 
 
He then submitted that the appeal being a criminal matter it did not follow that the appellant nor her counsel had any right to appear to argue the appeal. He submitted that s 247(1) of the Code should be read with s 336 of the Code, sub-s (1) of which reads: 
 
The Attorney General shall be the Public Prosecutor and shall have the control and direction of prosecutions and proceedings under this Code.
 
 
 
It is also relevant for present purposes to reproduce below s 336(4), (5), (6) and (8) of the Code: 
 
 
(4) The Public Prosecutor or the Solicitor General or a person appointed a deputy under subsection (3) may authorize any advocate to act for him as Public Prosecutor in the conduct of any case or prosecution in court or in any part of such conduct. 
 
(5) Every criminal prosecution before the High Court shall be conducted by the Public Prosecutor or by the Solicitor General or by a deputy appointed under subsection (3) or by an advocate authorized under subsection (4). 
 
(6) No person shall appear on behalf of the Attorney General in any criminal appeal or on any point of law reserved under Chapter XXIX other than the Public Prosecutor or the Solicitor General or a deputy appointed under subsection (3) or an advocate authorized under subsection (4). 
 
... 
 
(8) Nothing in this section shall be held to preclude private persons or any officer of any government department from appearing in person or by advocate to prosecute in summary cases before a Magistrate`s Court or in summary non-seizable cases before a District Court.
  
 
 
It will be seen that s 336(8) enables a private person to appear in person or by his counsel to prosecute in a summary case before a magistrate`s court, as was what had happened in this case.
Counsel for the appellant contended that s 336(8) of the Code is a saving section and not an enabling section and that on a reading of s 247(1) the appellant, being a `party` to the criminal matter below, should not only have the right of appeal but a right of audience either by herself in person or by counsel.
In my view, the Public Prosecutor under s 336(1) of the Code has `the control and direction of ... proceedings under` the Code and since the appeal before me is a proceeding under the Code, the Public Prosecutor could properly in his discretion intervene and withdraw the appeal. His discretion is entrenched in art 35(8) of the Constitution. Further, as a matter of principle, it must be recognized, as it was in 
 Ponniah v Lim 
 
 
 
[1960] MLJ 152
 , that the interests of the state in a criminal matter which are entrusted to the Public Prosecutor are not always the same as those of a complainant who may allow his `private passions and prejudices to creep into the conduct` of a criminal appeal.
The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellant was charged with an offence under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 88, 1970 Ed).
Section 3(1) reads as follows: 
 
Subject to the provisions of this Act, it shall not be lawful for any person to use or to cause or permit any other person to use a motor vehicle unless there is in force in relation to the use of the motor vehicle by that person or that other person, as the case may be, such a policy of insurance or such a security in respect of third-party risk as complies with the requirements of this Act.
 
 
 
The appellant claimed trial to the charge. He was convicted and sentenced to a fine of $300 and disqualified from driving class 4 motor vehicles for a period of 12 months.
The facts are not in dispute. On 26 July 1985, the appellant permitted one Quek Wee Beng to use a school bus to ferry adult passengers. At that time, he did not possess an Adult Workers Contract Permit (AWCP) and was therefore not licensed to carry adult passengers under r 41 of the Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Rules 1976.
The sole issue in this appeal is whether there was a policy of insurance in force in relation to the use of the motor vehicle at the material time.
As I have said in 
 PP v See Albert 
 
 
 
[1971] 1 MLJ 47
 , the answer must depend on a consideration of the material provisions of the insurance policy in question. In this case, the uses to which the vehicle can be put are defined in the `Limitations as to use` clause and Memo B in the policy. The relevant clauses provide as follows:
 Limitations as to use
Use only for the carriage of passengers or goods in connection with the policy holder`s business. The policy does not cover - 
 
 
(1) Use of racing, pacemaking, reliability trial or speed-testing. 
 
(2) Use whilst drawing a trailer except the towing (other than for reward) of any one disabled mechanically propelled vehicle.
  
 
 
 
 
 Memo B 
 
 
 
It is hereby declared and agreed that the `limitations as to use` under this policy is extended as follows:
 
 
 
 
(a) Use for the carriage of adult passengers under an Adult Workers Contract Permit. 
 
(b) Use for the carriage of not more than 40 passengers for hire or reward.
  
 
 
On a literal reading of the `limitations as to use` clause, the insurance coverage encompasses the carriage of passengers or goods in connection with the policy holder`s business. Prima facie, this includes the carriage of all categories of passengers in connection with the policy holder`s business which is described as that of a `bus owner/ driver`. However, this clause must be read with Memo B in determining the exact scope of the policy. The preamble to Memo B provides for the extension of the `Limitations as to use` clause to include the carriage of adult passengers under an AWC permit. The use of the word `extend` in Memo B presupposes that the matters therein set out were not included in the `limitations as to use` clause. Any other construction would render Memo B superfluous. I thus find myself in agreement with the magistrate that the policy does not, on its true construction, cover the use of the vehicle at the time of the offence.
Whilst this is sufficient to dispose of the appeal at this stage, it would be useful for me to make some observations on the submissions advanced by counsel for the appellant. The appellant contends that the failure to obtain the AWC permits amounts only to a breach of the policy which renders it voidable at the option of the insurers. In my view, this argument overlooks a fundamental distinction which must be drawn in all such cases falling under s 3(1). First, the trial judge must determine whether, as a matter of construction, the policy covers the use of the vehicle at the material time.
This is perhaps best illustrated by the cases of 
 Leggate v Brown 
 [1950] 2 All ER 564 and 
 Kerridge v Rush 
 [1952] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 305. In 
 Leggate v Brown 
 [1950] 2 All ER 564, the defendant was convicted under s 35 of the Road Traffic Act 1930 for driving a vehicle without a policy in force against third-party risks in respect of that vehicle. The policy contained an endorsement which enabled the tractor to be used with two trailers. However, the tractor was drawing two laden trailers which was an offence under the Road Traffic Act 1930. In quashing the conviction, Lord Goddard CJ said: 
 
When this vehicle was being driven on the road and was stopped by the police it was drawing two trailers and they were both laden. The policy says nothing about laden trailers. It simply allows the vehicle to be used with two traders, and, whatever else this policy does, it certainly does not insure the appellant against the consequences of using the tractor in that manner. If the policy had insured him against using the tractor illegally, to that extent it would have been ineffective, but I am far from saying that such a term would have vitiated the whole policy.
 
 
 
This case can be usefully contrasted with that of 
 Kerridge v Rush 
 [1952] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 305. In that case, the defendant also used a tractor to draw two laden trailers. However, the language of the defendant`s policy was couched in different terms. The endorsement provided that `it shall not be deemed to grant indemnity in connection with any vehicle described in the schedule of this policy 
 and/or any trailer whilst such vehicle is drawing a greater number of trailers in all than is permitted by law 
` (emphasis added). The carrying of two laden trailers was an offence under the Road Traffic Act. In upholding the conviction, Lord Goddard CJ said: 
 
The vehicle in this case was drawing a greater number of trailers than was permitted by law, and therefore the underwriters have said, it seems to me, in language which cannot bear more than one meaning, that if you draw a greater number of trailers than allowed by law, they do not indemnify and there is no policy in existence.
 
 
 
Secondly, if upon its true construction, the policy covers the use of the vehicle in question, the policy may yet be voidable at the option of the insurers, eg on the ground of misrepresentation. However, such a policy will remain a policy in force unless the policy had in fact been avoided in accordance with s 9(4) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act: see, for example 
 Durrant v Maclaren 
[1956] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 70.
In the circumstances, I am of the opinion that the magistrate was right in convicting the accused. In respect of the appeal against sentence, s 3(2) of the Act provides for a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to both. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, I do not think that the sentence imposed by the learned magistrate of a fine of $300 is manifestly excessive. As regards the order of disqualification, s 3(2) of the Act provides that a person convicted under s 3(1) shall be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of 12 months unless there are special reasons for the court to order otherwise. I agree with the learned magistrate that there are no special reasons on the facts of this case not to impose an order that the appellant be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence in respect of class 4 vehicles for a period of 12 months.
 Order accordingly.",1988-09-01 00:00:00,SG High Court

This is an appeal by the two appellants against conviction and sentence by the district court. The first appellant, Samad bin Kamis, was convicted of abetting David Tan Kim Aun, the bunkering clerk of the vessel Neptank 1, in the commission of an offence of criminal breach of trust of about 157 metric tonnes of marine fuel oil worth about $62,616.95, an offence punishable under s 109 read with s 406 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Code`) and was sentenced to five months` imprisonment.
The second appellant, Victor Keh Ghim Yeow, was convicted of dishonestly receiving stolen property to wit about 157 metric tonnes of marine fuel oil worth about $62,616.95 belonging to Shell Eastern Petroleum Pte Ltd, an offence punishable under s 411 of the Code and was sentenced to five months` imprisonment.
The material facts are these: David Tan was employed as a bunkering clerk with Neptune Ship Management Services Pte Ltd (`Neptune`). As a bunkering clerk he was in charge of the cargo laden on board the vessel. It was his duty to ascertain the quantity loaded and to ensure that the requisite quantity was delivered. He was also responsible for the documentation in connection with the loading and discharge of cargo.
By an agreement dated 19 February 1985, Neptune chartered the vessel Neptank 1, a bunker barge, on a time charter to Shell Eastern Petroleum Pte Ltd (`Shell`) commencing from 28 February 1985.
Shell contracted to supply 6,500 tonnes of marine fuel oil to the vessel Mungia and the delivery of the fuel oil to the Mungia was made by the bunker vessels Neptank 1, Aljawhara and Victory.
On 19 March 1985, Saini bin Sor, the bunker programmer of Shell, instructed the bunkering clerk of Neptank 1, David Tan, to load a full cargo of marine fuel oil at Pulau Bukom on 20 March 1985, and to discharge the full cargo of oil to the Mungia. Accordingly on 20 March 1985, the Neptank 1 was loaded with 2,775.998 kilolitres of grade 380 CST oil, which is equivalent to about 2,641.09 metric tonnes, to bunker the Mungia.
On 20 March 1985, at 1.57pm, the supertanker Mungia arrived in Singapore and dropped anchor at the Western Jurong Anchorage for the purpose of taking on bunker fuel oil.
On the same day, at about 4.06pm, the Neptank 1 arrived alongside the starboard side of the Mungia to bunker. On board the Neptank 1 were David Tan, the captain of the vessel, the chief officer (the first appellant), the chief engineer, the second engineer, the bosun and three able-bodied seamen.
The pumping of the fuel oil by Neptank 1 to the Mungia started at 6.58pm and ceased at 1.05am on 21 March 1985. It was not in dispute that not all the 2,641.09 metric tonnes of marine fuel oil on the Neptank 1 was pumped to the Mungia. There was left on the Neptank 1 about 157 metric tonnes of the marine fuel oil.
At about 7.15am on 21 March 1985, a lighter named Good Services came alongside the starboard side of the Neptank 1 which was still on the Mungia`s starboard side. The lighter was owned by Seashell Line Marine Oil Trading Pte Ltd (`Seashell Line`). On the lighter were the bunker clerk Victor Keh Ghim Yeow (the second appellant), the captain of the lighter and two able-bodied seamen. The 157 metric tonnes of marine fuel oil which was still on the Neptank 1 was transferred to the Good Services.
The Good Services sailed off from the Neptank 1 at about 8.20am and at about 11.30am on the same day she came alongside the storage barge Seashell anchored at Eastern Bravo Anchorage. The Seashell was owned by Seashell Line. After the Good Services was secured to the barge, the second appellant instructed the watchman of the barge, Lhu Kim Eng, to put the hose from the Good Services into tank No 2 of the barge and oil was then pumped from the Good Services into the barge.
It was the master of the Mungia, Garay Alibizuri Enrique, who discovered that there was a shortage in the delivery of the marine fuel oil to the Mungia, which was later ascertained to be 157 metric tonnes. He also saw the Good Services coming alongside the Neptank 1 at about 7.15am on 21 March 1985. The master protested to Shell of the short supply. Shell engaged a firm of surveyors to conduct a survey. The master informed the surveyor of the Good Services taking some of the marine fuel oil away and that he had photographs to prove it. Subsequently a report was lodged with the marine police. Eventually David Tan and the captain and all the crew members of the Neptank 1 were arrested and charged and so were the second appellant and the captain and all the crew members of the Good Services.
At the commencement of the trial on 15 March 1986, David Tan and the captain and crew of the Neptank 1 were jointly charged with the offence of criminal breach of trust by an agent under s 409 read with s 34 of the Code. Victor Keh and the captain and crew of the Good Services were charged jointly with the offence of dishonestly receiving stolen property punishable under s 411 of the Code.
During the course of the trial, on 30 March 1987, the prosecution withdrew the charges against the captain and the chief engineer of the Neptank 1 and against the two able-bodied seamen of the Good Services.
On 17 August 1987, the prosecution tendered a reduced charge of criminal breach of trust under s 406 of the Code against David Tan, to which he pleaded guilty and was convicted and sentenced to five months` imprisonment.
The trial then proceeded against the remaining eight accused persons including the first and second appellants.
At the end of the prosecution`s case the court found that the prosecution had failed to prove its case against Ripin bin Doll, an able-bodied seaman of the Neptank 1 and he was accordingly acquitted without his defence being called. The charge against the first appellant and the other remaining four crew members of the Neptank 1 was amended to one under s 109 read with s 406 of the Code. The charge against the second appellant was amended to one of dishonestly receiving stolen property. The charge against the captain of the Good Services was amended to one of abetment of dishonestly receiving stolen property.
At the close of the trial, the first and second appellants were convicted on the respective charges. The remaining accused persons were acquitted and discharged.
As to why the 157 metric tonnes of marine fuel oil was retained in the Neptank 1 and later transferred to the Good Services, the prosecution relied mainly on the evidence of David Tan. His evidence was this:
After the Neptank 1 had completed loading the full cargo of marine fuel oil and after he had completed the necessary documentation, he received confirmation from Pulau Bukom to deliver the full cargo to the Mungia. After receiving the confirmation, he wrote on a piece of paper the full quantity of oil to be discharged, the name and the location of the vessel they were to bunker. He then handed this piece of paper to the first appellant and to the captain of the vessel who were both at the bridge. A little while later, the captain left. The first appellant, who was still with him said: `This is a good chance`. He did not ask the first appellant what the latter meant by that as he understood that to mean the possibility of retaining some oil. He responded by saying `Why not, I don`t mind`. After that he walked off.
The Neptank 1 arrived alongside the starboard side of the Mungia at about 4.06pm on 20 March 1985. The document `Before delivery bunkering receipt` was sent up to the chief engineer of the Mungia by rope as the Mungia was too high. Thereafter, the message was relayed back via the rope that the hoses could be connected and to proceed with bunkering.
He then relayed this message to the first appellant to discharge the full quantity load on the Neptank 1 to the Mungia. At about 7.05pm Neptank 1 commenced discharging oil to the Mungia. Between 9 to 10pm when he and the crew members were having their dinner in the resting room, the first appellant said to those present there that he intended to retain some oil. Nobody answered or objected. Then at about 10.30pm to 10.45pm the first appellant returned and informed them that he had managed to retain some oil in tank No 3. Those in the resting room were curious and he (David Tan) suggested to able-bodied seaman Fauzi to take measurements of the retained oil. After Mohd Fauzi returned with the measurements, he (David Tan) went to his cabin and calculated that about 140 metric tonnes of oil was retained. When this result was taken back to the resting room, the consensus was that the quantity to be retained was so much. He (David Tan) then complained to the first appellant that this was too much but the first appellant said `If you want to, do a big one`, to which he (David Tan) replied `That is your business`.
After the discharge of the oil was completed at about 1am on 21 March, the first appellant asked him whether he knew of anyone who could buy the retained oil as he (the first appellant) could not get anyone. At that time the hoses for the pumping to the Mungia had already been disconnected and he (David Tan) had no choice but to tell the first appellant to try and contact the second appellant of the Good Services through channel 10 of the VHF set.
At about 2am they managed to contact the second appellant. He told the second appellant that his chief officer had retained 140 metric tonnes of 380 fuel oil. The second appellant asked for the price. He ascertained from the first appellant that it would be $185 per metric tonne to which the second appellant replied that he was agreeable. The rest of the conversation was taken over by the first appellant and he (David Tan) then left the bridge.
Later the first appellant came to the resting room where he and some of the crew members were and told him that everything had been arranged and that what they needed to do was to wait for the barge to come alongside.
Then at about 7am, while he was still in the resting room he heard noises on the deck on the starboard. He was curious and he sneaked up to the bridge where he saw the first appellant talking to the second appellant. He could not hear their conversation but he could see the bosun and the three able-bodied seamen connecting the hoses. On the way back to the resting room, he saw the second engineer going into the engine room and he heard the first appellant instruct the second engineer to start the pump. The work was completed about 40 minutes later. All this time he was in the resting room as he was particular about people recognizing him.
Subsequently he went up to the deck on the starboard side, took a peep and saw the Good Services leaving. Fifteen minutes later the first appellant came and told him that the Mungia had protested on shortage of oil supplied to the vessel. He (David Tan) told the first appellant that there was nothing he could do. He then reported to Saini through the bunker set of the protest by the Mungia whereupon they were told to standby.
In his defence, the first appellant testified that as chief officer of the Neptank 1, he supervised the loading and unloading of the cargo and the maintenance of the vessel. He also assisted the captain to navigate the vessel.
When the Neptank 1 arrived alongside the Mungia his duty was to arrange the operation work with all his crew; to have the crew prepare the hoses to be lifted up to the Mungia. When everything was done, he waited for instructions from David Tan to pump to the Mungia.
Pumping commenced at about 7pm on 20 March 1985. About half an hour after commencement of the pumping, David Tan told him not to `discharge all oil in the number 3 tank dry, to leave about three tanggal of tank number 3` but the other tanks were to be dried out. He complied with those instructions as they were quite normal instructions. After this he continued with the supervision of the crew in connection with the discharge of the oil.
At about 1.30am on 21 March 1985, the Neptank 1 completed bunkering the Mungia. At about 2am after the hoses on the deck were disconnected, he went back to his cabin.
At about 6.30am the bosun called him at his cabin and said that David Tan called for him to prepare as one vessel was coming alongside the Neptank 1. He then went up to the deck and took a look to see if everything was in order. The Good Services was then not yet alongside the Neptank 1.
When the Good Services came alongside, he saw David Tan talking to the second appellant. It was then that he instructed the bosun to get three able-bodied seamen to connect the hoses from Neptank 1 to the Good Services.
The second appellant stated in his defence that at about 9pm on 20 March 1985, he was instructed by his company, Seashell Line, to bunker 50 metric tonnes of grade 180 CST oil to the vessel Three Stars No 1 at the Pasir Panjang Coastal Anchorage. He arrived at the destination at around midnight but the Three Stars No 1 was not there. He then went in search of the vessel.
Up to 2 or 3am, they still could not find the vessel. At about that time, the captain of the Good Services informed him that David Tan had called for him over the VHF set on channel 12, the PSA traffic frequency. He then went to the bridge and spoke to David Tan, who later asked him to lower down to channel 10.
David Tan said he had over 100 tonnes of oil to see and asked him if he was interested in buying the oil. He ascertained from David Tan the price of the oil and also that it was not stolen. They agreed at the price of $185 per metric tonne. He was then asked by David Tan to go to David Tan`s location. He instructed his captain to proceed to the location. He did not tell the captain the reason for going there.
When the Good Services came alongside the Neptank 1 he talked to David Tan in Chinese. After that the hoses were connected and the oil from Neptank 1 was pumped into all the six tanks of the Good Services including tank No 2 which contained 50 metric tonnes of grade 180 CST oil meant for Three Stars No 1. This would have resulted in the two different grades of oil being mixed. He did this so as to keep the Good Services stable.
When he purchased the oil he knew it was below market price. He purchased it for the benefit of his company, though normally his company dealt with Esso, Caltex and sometimes BP oil, but never with Shell.
He had decided to purchase Shell`s oil because David Tan had told him that the oil was not stolen and the price was a good price. It did not occur to him that the oil could be stolen. If his company did not purchase the oil, then he would try to sell it on his own though he had never sold fuel oil to anyone on his own.
After receiving the oil from Neptank 1, he took it and transferred it to his company`s oil barge. From there he and the crew members of the Good Services were taken back to shore at Marine Parade.
The following day, he went to the office and informed his employers that he had bought the oil at that price. When asked why he had bought the oil, he told his employers that the oil was cheap and it was not stolen.
The appeals of both the appellants raised issues of fact. In respect of the first appellant the issue of fact is whether he knew that the transfer of the oil from Neptank 1 to Good Services was illegal. In respect of the second appellant, the issue of fact is whether he knew or had reason to believe that the 157 metric tonnes of marine fuel oil he received from Neptank 1 was stolen property.
 Appeal of the first appellant, Samad bin Kamis
The trial judge found that the first appellant`s version that David Tan had instructed him to cease pumping the oil from tank No 3 and that the first appellant did not know that the oil retained in tank No 3 is illegal cannot be reasonably believed.
The main contention of the first appellant is that the trial judge erred in law by convicting the first appellant on the testimony of David Tan, an accomplice, whose evidence was riddled with discrepancies and inconsistencies.
The submission of counsel for the first appellant is that it is apparent from the grounds of decision that the trial judge relied on the evidence of David Tan in justifying the conviction and that the trial judge should not have relied on the evidence of David Tan who was the only prosecution witness to give evidence as to why and how the 157 metric tonnes of oil came to be retained in Neptank 1 and subsequently transferred to the Good Services.
At the trial counsel for the first appellant made an application under s 122(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`) to impeach David Tan`s credit. The application was unsuccessful as the trial judge found no material discrepancies.
David Tan, having pleaded guilty, was sentenced to five months` imprisonment and had nothing to gain by giving evidence against the first appellant. It was not suggested that he had any motive to falsely implicate the first appellant.
Even if there are some discrepancies in David Tan`s evidence that does not mean that his evidence must be rejected in toto (see 
Khoon Chye Hin v PP
 
 
[1961] MLJ 105
  and 
PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris (No 2)
 
 
[1977] 1 MLJ 15
  ).
The trial judge made a finding of fact that he believed the version of David Tan as to what transpired at the bridge. The trial judge in his grounds of decision said (at p 35): 
 
Samad`s version that David Tan had instructed him to cease pumping oil from tank No 3 and that he (Samad) did not know that the oil retained in tank No 3 is illegal cannot be reasonably believed. He did not deny that he and David had met at the bridge at the material time when according to David, after the captain had left the bridge, Samad had suggested about the opportunity to retain oil. What had transpired at that point of time is only known to both Samad and David. I believe the version given by David in that he had been forthright and candid in stating the facts though certain aspects of his testimony had not been too clear and may have given rise to some inconsistencies. On the other hand, Samad had tried to portray himself as being a victim of circumstances. Amongst the crew members, other than the captain, Samad would be the next most senior man. I would even rank him as having more responsibility for other than assisting the master in the navigation, he had also to co-ordinate the whole process of the discharge of the cargo. Naturally, if any oil were to be retained by him without the permission of David, this would have been discovered by David when he checks the tanks after the pumping of the oil had been completed. Likewise, since Samad is in charge of the pumping operations, there can be no possibility of David retaining the oil without the knowledge of Samad. There was therefore no doubt in my mind that Samad and David [sic] had so instigated David to permit him to cause oil to be retained in tank No 3. Thus I was satisfied that Samad had abetted David in the commission of criminal breach of trust of the 157 metric tons of marine fuel oil ...
 
 
 
I am unable to say that this finding of fact is wrong.
The trial judge did not rely solely on the evidence of David Tan. There were other evidence on which the trial judge relied on to reach his findings.
Evidence was adduced by the prosecution (the evidence of Simon bin Abdul Kudus, the technical superintendent of Neptune), that it was the duty of the captain or the chief officer to enter in exh P31, the log sheet of Neptank 1, all entries regarding all events and movements of Neptank 1. If oil had been discharged by Neptank 1 at about 7.20am to the vessel Good Services the entry should be reflected in P31. The bunkering clerk is in no position to direct the chief officer not to make entry in the log sheet. It is the responsibility of the captain and the chief officer to ensure that there is maximum discharge of cargo oil. In the case of the Neptank 1, by its very construction, it would be to the advantage of the customer vessel if the chief officer planned for the vessel to gradually trim aft during the discharge of the oil cargo as this will make it possible for each and every tank to be discharged till empty.
The first appellant agreed that he made the entries in the log sheet P31. He was subjected to extensive cross-examination regarding the entries made by him in P31. He was ccross-examined as to why he did not enter in P31 that at 7.35pm he was instructed by David Tan to retain three tanggal of oil in tank No 3 when he had made an entry that at 1.30am `Completed discharging #3, 4, 2 & 5 (380 CST)`. His answers were far from satisfactory and the trial judge found that the entry of 1.30am was incorrect as it did not truly reflect that not all oil was discharged to the Mungia and that the entry was calculated to conceal the retention of oil in tank No 3 by giving the impression that all oil had been discharged from all the tanks, including tank No 3. I am unable to say that this finding of fact is wrong.
The first appellant was also cross-examined as to why he did not enter in P31 the bunkering operation with respect to Good Services. His answer was that at 10am on 21 March 1985, David Tan informed him not to enter any log about discharging to the Good Services and that he (David Tan) will deal direct with the office. The prosecution pursued their cross-examination and the first appellant was evasive in answering the questions. The answers of the first appellant regarding the entries to be made in P31 and the sequence of the tanks for oil to be discharged, to maintain stability and to ensure maximum discharge of the oil cargo, is contradictory to that of Simon bin Abdul Kudus, the technical superintendent of Neptune.
The trial judge also took into consideration the evidence of Abdul Hamid bin Abu Jalil (`DW6`), an able-bodied seaman on the Neptank 1. His evidence was that by 6.30pm on 20 March 1985, all preparations for bunkering operation were made. He and Ripin bin Doll were on duty. At 7pm the first appellant instructed him to open the valve of tank No 3 to discharge oil from the tank to the Mungia. After oil was discharged half way through tank No 3, the first appellant instructed him to close the valve of tank No 3. Whilst he was closing the valve of tank No 3, Ripin was instructed by the first appellant to open the valve of tank No 4. This aspect of the evidence of Abdul Hamid was not challenged by the first appellant.
The trial judge took into consideration the evidence of Abdullah bin Wadi (`DW1`), the bosun of Neptank 1, who disclosed in cross-examination that as bosun he took charge of the three able-bodied seamen during the bunkering operations to the Mungia and received instructions from Chief Officer Samad only. The first appellant had given him instructions as to the quantity of oil to be delivered to the Mungia and to empty all tanks, from tank Nos 2 to 5, though the sequence in which the tanks were to be discharged were not mentioned. The first appellant also instructed him to have two persons on deck performing four-hourly shifts. When the pumping commenced, Abdul Hamid (`DW6`) and Ripin bin Doll were on duty. When he and Mohd Fauzi (`DW4`) took over duty at about 10pm, he was instructed by the first appellant to empty tank No 2, then tank No 5. At that time oil in tank No 2 was in the process of being discharged; tank Nos 3 and 4 had already been emptied.
As to the events that transpired on the morning of 21 March 1985, just before the Good Services came alongside the Neptank 1 the evidence of Abdullah bin Wadi (`DW1`) was that at about 6am on that day David Tan knocked at his cabin door and told him to inform the chief officer that a vessel would be coming alongside the Neptank 1. He then went to the first appellant`s cabin and informed the latter whereupon the first appellant instructed him to get another two crew members to assist him in the bunkering operation. He then got Mohd Fauzi (`DW4`) and Abdul Hamid (`DW6`) to prepare hoses on the deck of Neptank 1, to join the hoses to the Good Services and to open the valve of tank No 3.
The evidence of Yeo Khing Hai (`DW3`), the second engineer of Neptank 1 was that from 7am onwards on 21 March 1985, when he was doing cleaning work in the engine room David Tan came and told him to switch on the machine. He did not enquire as to why the machine was to be switched on though he knew it was either for filling up of oil or for transferring oil as the cargo pump can be operated after the machine is switched on. The first appellant took charge of the switching on of the pump on the deck level. At about 8am upon the instructions of the chief engineer he switched off the machine.
There was variance in the evidence of the first appellant and Abdullah bin Wadi as to the time when the first appellant instructed Abdullah to get two other crew members to assist in the bunkering operation to transfer oil from Neptank 1 to the Good Services. Abdullah`s evidence was that those instructions were given at the time when he went to inform the first appellant of what David Tan had told him to do, whereas the first appellant`s version was that he gave the instructions to Abdullah to get three able-bodied seamen after the Good Services had come alongside the Neptank 1 and after he saw David Tan talking to Victor Keh (the second appellant) of the Good Services.
The trial judge made the following finding (at p 25 of the grounds of decision): 
 
From the evidence adduced, I find that at about 7.30pm on 20 March 1985, oil had been retained in tank No 3 of the Neptank 1. This was done on the instructions of Samad when he instructed Abdul Hamid to close the valve of tank No 3 when oil had not been fully discharged from that tank. I was also satisfied that Samad had given instructions to bosun Abdullah about getting the crew members, in particular the able-bodied seamen, to assist and prepare for the transfer of oil from Neptank 1 to Good Services at the time when bosun Abdullah went to inform him of what David had said of another vessel coming alongside their vessel as at that point of time, Samad had already known of the coming of Good Services to receive the retained oil and in that connection another bunker operation had to be carried out. And for bosun Abdullah to have his men to open the valve of tank No 3, instructions must have come from Chief Officer Samad as bosun Abdullah receives instructions from the chief officer only.
 
 
 
Again I am unable to say that this finding of fact is wrong.
The crux of the first appellant`s defence was that about half an hour after commencement of the pumping of the oil to the Mungia, David Tan told him: `Do not discharge all oil in number 3 tank dry, to leave about three tanggal of tank number 3 .... He said that the other tanks were to be dry out.` As pointed out by the DPP this defence was never put to David Tan during cross-examination. What was put to David Tan was this (at pp 129-130 of the record): 
 
 
Q I put it to you that your statement that the chief officer came to you at 10.45 and told you that he managed to retain some oil at tank 3 was absolutely false because loading operations were going on and did not cease till 1am? 
 
A No. At about 10.45 to 11pm, he told me that he had retained the oil in tank 3 because the valve is controlled by the crew and there are four tanks. By then one and a half tanks should be empty. So I suppose tank 3 is empty first and probably they can retain the oil in tank 3. Which tank to discharge first to maintain the trim of the vessel is the decision of the chief officer and the captain. 
 
Q Between 10.30pm and 10.45pm, you instructed the chief officer to tell accused Abdul Hamid to close the valve of tank 3? 
 
A I disagree. 
 
Q I put it to you that your earlier statement that the chief officer came and told you all that he managed to retain oil at tank 3 is absolutely false? 
 
A The chief officer told us that he retained oil in tank 3.
  
 
 
There appears to be inconsistencies between the first appellant`s evidence in court and his instructions to counsel on this very important issue.
The trial judge`s findings of fact were not wrong and the conviction must be upheld. As regards sentence, a custodial sentence in the circumstances of the case is correct. The offence is a serious one. The amount involved is substantial. The length of the sentence is not manifestly excessive. The appeal of the first appellant against conviction and sentence is dismissed.
 Appeal of the second appellant, Victor Keh Ghim Yeow
The essence of the offence of receiving stolen property under s 411 consists in the receipt or retention, with full knowledge at the time of receipt or retention that the property was obtained in one of the ways specified in s 410. It is immaterial whether the receiver knows or not who stole it.
As the receipt of the stolen property was not disputed, the only issue as far as the second appellant is concerned is whether the trial judge`s finding of fact that the second appellant had at the very least, reason to believe that the oil that was being sold to him was stolen property is against the weight of evidence.
The trial judge in his grounds of decision said (at p 28): 
 
The defence adopted by Victor was that he did not know or had reason to believe that the oil he had purchased was stolen. Under cross-examination by the prosecution, Victor agreed that the price at which he had agreed to purchase the oil was very cheap, way below the market price; he did not ask David how he had obtained the oil, how much he had bought it for or why he was prepared to sell it to him at such a low price nor did he ask him why he had loaded his oil on board the Neptank 1 on which he is working. His evidence was that it did not occur to him that the oil could be stolen. If indeed that was so, why did he have the presence of mind to ask David whether the oil was stolen oil? I find it hard to reconcile these two points. I find that Victor would have at the very least, reason to believe that the oil that David was going to sell to him was stolen oil.
 
 
 
Counsel for the second appellant says that the defence is dissatisfied with the trial judge`s finding as it was the same evidence that implicated all of the other accused persons. However, the judge felt evidence against some of the accused persons should not be accepted against these accused persons and thought fit to acquit and discharge them at various stages of the hearing but accepted in toto the evidence against the present two appellants and convicted them.
Counsel for the second appellant submits that the trial judge failed to give any acceptable reason as to why he thought fit to acquit and discharge some of the accused persons and convict the first and second appellants when the evidence against all were similar. The answer to that submission is this: as the prosecution did not appeal against the acquittal of the remaining accused persons, there was no need for the trial judge to give reasons as to why the charges against those accused persons were not proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
It is not correct to say that the evidence against all the accused persons were similar. In respect of the first appellant there was additional supporting evidence to confirm his guilt. In respect of the second appellant, the issue does not depend only on David Tan`s evidence. The issue of whether the second appellant had reason to believe that the oil was stolen property is one of inference from all the circumstances. As Arulanandom J in 
Ahmad bin Ishak v PP
 
 
[1974] 2 MLJ 21
  said (at p 22): 
 
`Reason to believe`, knowledge, intention are things in a man`s mind and you cannot see it, you cannot hear it. Nobody who receives stolen goods carries a big banner saying that these are stolen goods. Nor does he shout from the roof tops. You must look into the circumstances and consider if the circumstances are such that any reasonable man could see sufficient cause to believe that it was stolen.
 
 
 
The second appellant admitted that he received the call from David Tan over the VHF set; that David Tan negotiated the sale of the oil to him and also told him the location of David Tan`s vessel; that he knew that the price of $185 per metric tonne was below the market price and that he did receive the marine fuel oil from the Neptank 1 but denied having knowledge or having reason to believe that the oil was stolen property. He also admitted that some of the oil from Neptank 1 was pumped into tank No 2 of the Good Services which already contained the 50 metric tonnes of grade 180 CST oil meant for Three Stars No 1. He knew that this would have resulted in two different grades of oil being mixed up. He said he did this so as to keep the Good Services stable.
The second appellant said that he decided to purchase the oil as he was assured by David Tan that it was not stolen; that he bought the oil for the benefit of his company although normally his company dealt with Esso, Caltex and sometimes BP, but never with Shell; that if his company would not buy the oil, he would try to sell it himself though he had never sold fuel oil to anyone on his own.
The second appellant also said that prior to this incident he had never purchased oil from anyone else, and, not knowing David Tan very well, he did not ask him where the latter had obtained the oil from or how much he had bought it for or why he was prepared to sell it at such a low price.
The trial judge, commenting on the second appellant`s story, said in his grounds of decision (at p 37): 
 
... but quite surprisingly, he did have the presence of mind to ask David if the oil was stolen oil or otherwise. He ventured to state that he bought the oil for the benefit of his company and if the company did not purchase the oil, he would then try to sell it on his own but he had never sold fuel oil to anyone on his own. That indeed was strange and is not consistent with what a reasonable man would do when doing a first deal which, even working at $185 per m ton would amount to a substantial $29,000! As for purchasing the oil for the benefit of his employer, he was aware that the company deal with Esso, Caltex and sometimes BP oil but never with Shell. That being the case, surely he ought to have obtained permission or sought clearance from his employer before venturing to buy the oil. He claimed that he informed his employer of the purchase of the oil when he went back to the office on the morning of 22 March 1985. There was evidence that on the morning of 21 March 1985, the agent of Three Stars No 1 called PW12, the managing director of the Sea Shell Line Marine Oil Trading Company Ltd, to inform him that the vessel did not receive the bunker and that same morning at about 10.30am Victor had called PW12 on Singapore radio and informed him that he cannot locate the vessel. Surely since Victor Keh could contact his employer at that point of time, he could also have informed him of the purchase of the oil rather than to wait till the following day. Further, as Victor had called his employer to inform him of his inability to locate the vessel, it follows that if he could not have located the vessel Three Stars No 1 he could have contacted the office to get further instructions. The company had paid Shell for the oil as their vessels, viz the Good Services and the Sea Shell were under police custody as case exhibits and it was apparent that in order that the vessels be released for them to continue with their business, some terms had to be worked out between the parties concerned. Shell did not want the oil back as it was contaminated. The only logical thing for the company to do then was to buy over the oil.
 
 
 
The trial judge then made the following finding (at p 39): 
 
On the evidence adduced in the defence of Victor, I was satisfied that the version of Victor Keh is not a plausible one and could not be reasonably believed. I was further satisfied that he was not acting for the benefit of the company when he purchased the oil. Accordingly, I found him guilty of the amended charge (exh P2A) of dishonestly receiving stolen property, punishable under s 411 of the Penal Code.
 
 
 
Foremost of the circumstances in this case is the very cheap price at which the oil was sold to the second appellant. The second appellant purchased the oil at $185 per metric tonne. The market price of the oil was $398 per metric tonne (see PS8, statement of Wong Kun Yew, oil evaluation manager of Shell). The second appellant`s company paid $62,616.95 to Shell for the 157 metric tonnes of oil. The second appellant purchased the oil at less than half the market price. The second appellant knew that the oil was sold to him at a very cheap price.
The market price of the 157 metric tonnes of oil at $398 per metric tonne comes to a big sum of $62,486. The second appellant knew that David Tan was only a bunkering clerk. Considering the value of the oil and the fact that David Tan was only a bunkering clerk, the second appellant must have realized that David Tan could not have come by such a large quantity of oil by honest means and only to sell it at a huge loss. The oil was also on the very vessel on which David Tan was working and the deal was made in the very early hours of the morning, 2am, in the open sea.
In these circumstances the second appellant clearly had reason to believe that the oil was stolen property. The finding of the trial judge is quite correct.
It is submitted on behalf of the second appellant that the trial judge failed to consider that the oil was discharged into the second appellant`s company`s storage barge Seashell, which a person would not normally do if he intended to benefit from his illegal act. It would therefore appear that whatever the second appellant did was for the benefit of his company.
The trial judge made a finding of fact that the second appellant was not acting for the benefit of his company (at p 39 of the grounds of decision). His reasoning for arriving at this finding is set out in his grounds of decision at pp 37-39.
Furthermore, the second appellant knew full well that his company did not purchase Shell oil, yet he had the Shell oil from Neptank 1 pumped into tank No 2 of the Good Services thereby mixing the Shell oil of higher grade with the lower grade oil of his company which was intended for the company`s customer, the Three Stars No 1. This act of the second appellant could not support his contention that he purchased the Shell oil for the benefit of his company. If he had intended to purchase the Shell oil for his company, the second appellant could have asked David Tan to sell the oil direct to his company; there was no need to contaminate the oil by mixing the two different grades.
It is clear that the second appellant discharged the oil into the storage barge Seashell as he needed a place to store the stolen oil.
The findings of fact of the trial judge are correct and the second appellant was properly convicted.
The trial judge was right in passing the custodial sentence. The length of the sentence is also not manifestly excessive.
The total value of the stolen property is substantial - $62,616.95. Counsel for the second appellant submits that full restitution has been made and there was no loss to anyone. This, however, has nothing to do with the second appellant as the oil was bought by his employers so that the two vessels could be released. Counsel also submits that the part played by the second appellant was minor. This certainly is not correct. If the second appellant had not agreed to purchase the oil, the offence would not have been committed. As the DPP says it is people like the second appellant who encourage theft/criminal breach of trust by providing an outlet for the disposal of stolen property. The appeal of the second appellant against conviction and sentence is dismissed.

Cur Adv Vult
 
On 17 October 1984, the first plaintiff and Liau Siew Eng (hereinafter called the `deceased`) were crossing Boon Keng Road when they were knocked down by a motor car which was being driven by the defendant along Boon Keng Road towards Lavender Street. Arising from the accident, the first plaintiff claimed damages for personal injuries and consequential loss. Lee Ing Hoe and Toh Keng Kheong Ronald, the administrator and co-administrator respectively of the estate of the deceased, as the second plaintiffs, claimed damages for the estate of the deceased and also for the benefit of the dependents of the deceased.
Before the hearing commenced, liability was admitted by the defendant as to 75% and by the plaintiffs as to 25%, subject to the court`s approval for the second plaintiffs on account of the minority interests involved. Special damages in respect of the first plaintiff were agreed at $1,000. In respect of the second plaintiffs, the following amounts of damages were agreed: (a) $7,000 for loss of expectation of life; (b) $5,030 for funeral expenses; and (c) $1,000 for costs of letters of administration.
 First plaintiff `s claim
The first plaintiff was a production operator at General Electric Consumer Electronics Pte Ltd (`the company`) and 28 years old at the time of the accident. Married to her husband in 1974 in India, she arrived in Singapore in 1976 and acquired Singapore citizenship. On 19 December 1983, she joined the company in order to alleviate financial hardship in the home and worked on the night shift six days a week. Nonetheless, during this time, she still attended to all the household work and marketing. Whilst at work, a neighbour would take care of her two sons who were aged four and seven at the time of the accident. Her job in the company involved loading and unloading light materials into an automated insertion machine which would produce PCB boards. Owing to the relative complexity of the PCB board, her skills would have had to be higher than that of the more run-of-the-mill assembly-type operator. She received a gross salary of about $366 per month and was also entitled to a 13th month bonus as is common in Singapore employment. As a result of the accident, she was retrenched on 10 May 1985, the same day on which, as a result of recession, a general retrenchment exercise took place in the firm. It could not be ascertained whether the first plaintiff would have been retrenched regardless of the accident as part of this retrenchment exercise. The criteria for retrenchment was citizenship and/or performance. The first plaintiff was a Singapore citizen. As for her performance, details could not be given as the record of her employment could not be found and most of her supervisors who had been working there during the time of her employment had been retrenched.
As a result of the accident, the first plaintiff suffered the following injuries: (a) multiple abrasions; (b) avulsion fracture of L1 to L5 transverse processes on the right side; and (c) head injury with fracture of the frontal bone and damage to the frontal lobe. The multiple abrasions left a permanent 10cm by 4cm scar over the posterolateral aspect of her right thigh and a permanent 6cm diameter scar on the back of her right shoulder. As regards the avulsion fracture of L1 to L5 transverse processes, an examination by Dr Lai Choon Hin (PW3) in August 1990 showed healing and he testified to the effect that there was no risk of osteoarthritis setting in. Nonetheless, in relation to the first plaintiff`s complaint of backache, he was of the view that the backaches would continue into the future. Counsel for the defendant disputed the existence of the backaches, pointing out that the complaint had only been made on one occasion.
The head injury was alleged to have effected a change in the first plaintiff`s personality (for example, apathy and emotional instability), a reduction in her IQ and occasional lapses of short-term memory. Medical evidence differed as to its seriousness and treatability. According to the report of the then head of the neurosurgery department of Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Dr Baratham (PW1), the first plaintiff merely had a `fairly mild head injury` and `no definite effects result from brain injury`. However, in the course of giving his evidence, he said that he had been mistaken in his assessment and he now agreed with Dr Balaji Sadasivan (PW2) that the injury was severe and accounted for her present mental state. Dr Ong Thiew Chai (PW4), a psychiatrist at Woodbridge Hospital, was of the opinion that the first plaintiff suffered from a chronic organic brain syndrome characterized by intellectual and memory deficits and that, given that if there was any improvement it would have taken place in the first two years, it was not likely that she would show any improvement in the near future. In contrast to Dr Ong`s finding that the first plaintiff now had an IQ of 55, Dr Douglas SG Kong (DW1) in a report of 27 September 1991 made after two interviews with the first plaintiff, disagreed with Dr Ong`s view that the first plaintiff was of unsound mind and incapable of managing herself or her affairs. According to him, she suffered from phobic anxiety (coupled with compensation neurosis) which could be overcome by specific treatment, and there was every possibility that she could improve in the future and reach a state approximate to her previous level of functioning. Nonetheless, in the same report of 27 September 1991, he acknowledged that there was a possibility that she might never attain her previous level of functioning.
 The multiple abrasions and scars
On behalf of the defendant it was submitted that a sum of $2,000 should be awarded under this head since the scars were not on a prominent area of the first plaintiff`s body and could be hidden by her clothing. Counsel for the first plaintiff, stressing the permanent nature of the scars, submitted that a sum of $5,000 was more appropriate and referred to 
 Chua Min Hua v Tan Vincent 
 in which $3,500 was awarded for lacerations, 8cm and 6cm surgical scars over the right foot and slight scarring over the left elbow and left knee.
 Injury to lumbar vertebrae
Counsel for the first plaintiff submitted that $15,000 should be awarded, citing 
 Hamzah bin Abdul Ghani v Verghese Thomas 
 and 
 Appandurai @ Raju s/o Varthan v Lim Puk Tow 
 reported in KS Dass 
 Quantum in Accident Claims 
 (Vol 1) at p 402 in which $18,000 and $15,000 respectively were awarded. The injury in those cases resulted either in residual deformities or severe backache whereas, in the instant case, counsel for the defendant submitted that there were no residuals except for occasional backache which was unsubstantiated. Awards in cases cited varied from $3,000 to $6,500 for cases was there was healing and/or stable conditions to awards of up to $12,000 where the plaintiff was left with chronic pain and/or residual deformities. Owing to the defendant`s view that the injury had completely healed and the first plaintiff`s complaints of backache were unsubstantiated, counsel for the defendant submitted that only $7,000 be awarded under this head.
 Brain injury
In contrast to the contention of counsel for the first plaintiff that $80,000 be awarded for the head injury, counsel for the defendant submitted $35,000 should be the figure. A number of cases were cited by both counsel with awards ranging from $15,000 to $70,000, giving an average of $45,800. Those on the higher end of the scale tended to involve plaintiffs who were severely impaired mentally, such that they could not lead an independent existence. Counsel for the defendant justified the proposed sum of $35,000 on the grounds that the first plaintiff was not so intellectually affected that she was unable to attend to her own needs or that of her family. From the evidence, it appeared that the first plaintiff was still able to dress herself and attend to her own needs, but was only unable to handle the finances of her family or go marketing unattended.
 Pre-trial loss of earnings
After the accident, the first plaintiff received some sums of money from her employer at various intervals until May 1985. Her counsel, in a detailed submission, assessed the monetary loss suffered during that period (taking into account the moneys received) at $1,502. This, coupled with loss of earnings from May 1985 until the date of trial, gave a total sum of $35,344. On behalf of the defendant, it was argued that the first plaintiff`s claim for loss of earnings should not be divided into pre and post-trial losses on account of (a) vicissitudes in life; (b) her educational and social background; (c) her employment period and record; (d) her lack of any particular skill; (e) family circumstances; (f) the fact that she would be gainfully employable if successfully treated for depression and phobic anxiety; and (g) Dr Kong`s evidence that her condition may improve and approximate to her previous level of functioning. If, however, the court should choose to split the loss of earnings into pre and post-trial loss, it was submitted that there was no need to assess pre-trial loss since the plaintiff did not appear to have gone back to work after the accident (except for three months) and there had been a distinct possibility of retrenchment. Alternatively, if the court did choose to assess pre-trial loss, the multiplier adopted for assessing future loss of earnings should be reduced by the time period between the date of the accident and the date of trial, ie six and a half years, so as to avoid applying an excessive multiplier.
 Future loss of earnings
Counsel for the first plaintiff submitted that the multiplier should be ascertained as at the date of trial: 
 Graham v Dodds 
 following 
 Cookson v Knowles 
. He submitted that a multiplicand of $500 and a multiplier of 14 would be appropriate which, including 13th month bonuses, would give a sum of $91,000. Counsel for the defendant chose to make two alternative submissions. Firstly, taking into account factors (a) to (e) under the preceding heading and the probability of retrenchment, a multiplier of ten years would be more suitable. Coupled with a multiplicand of $426.52, loss of future earnings would therefore amount to $55,447.60. He sought to justify the lower multiplicand on the basis that she might not have returned to gainful employment on a regular basis and there was no evidence as to how much she could be earning now but for the accident. Counsel for the first plaintiff, however, produced projections from the plaintiff`s employer showing that as from July 1990, she would have earned $502.33 per month had she stayed on with the company. In addition to the above, counsel for the defendant submitted that should the court decide to award pre-trial past earnings, the multiplier for loss of future earnings should be correspondingly reduced (see above paragraph). He argued that in 
 Graham v Dodds 
 the court failed to consider that the longer a plaintiff delayed a trial, the more would be the loss of dependency or loss of future earnings for `lost` years that the plaintiff would eventually recover, and this consideration should equally apply in the case of a living plaintiff. Accordingly, he proposed an alternative mode of calculation based on the argument that Dr Kong`s evidence should be accepted. If so, the cost of curing the first plaintiff would amount to $13,500 if treatment was meted out by Woodbridge Hospital or $27,000 if treatment was sought in a private clinic. Such sum could be claimed by the first plaintiff. Given that the treatment is envisaged to take place over a course of two to five years, loss of earnings should then be assessed for only a period of three to five years since the date of the accident calculated as $426.52 [times ] 13 [times ] 3 = $16,634.28 or $426.52 [times ] 13 [times ] 5 = $27,723.88. This was not a proposal which found favour with me.
In assessing the damages to be awarded, I accepted the first plaintiff`s calculations on pre-trial loss of earnings, which appeared to me to be reasonable and I have therefore awarded $35,000 under this head. In respect of loss of future earnings, I bore in mind that the first plaintiff was 28 years old at the time of the accident and was 35 years old at the date of hearing. Bearing in mind also that she was a night shift worker, I adopted a conservative approach and applied a multiplier of 13 to a multiplicand of $450 per month (450 [times ] 13 [times ] 13) to arrive at an award of $76,050. For the first plaintiff, the total award is therefore as follows:
 General damages
Multiple abrasion and scars $3,000
Injury to lumbar vertebrae
$7,500
Brain injury
$50,000
Loss of future earnings
$76,050
$136,550
 Special damages
Loss of pre-trial earnings $35,000
Other special damages as agreed
$1,000
$36,000
The total liability of the defendant to the first plaintiff will only be 75% of the total amount awarded as the first plaintiff was contributorily negligent to the extent of 25%. There will be interest on the general damages and on the special damages of $1,000 at 6% pa from the date of the writ until the date of judgment, and there will be interest at 3% pa on the loss of pre-trial earnings from the date of the writ until the date of judgment.
I should add that while the first plaintiff was giving evidence in the witness box, she claimed not to know or remember essential events, to the extent of her not remembering seeing her doctors or her solicitors. A suspicion arose at that time as to whether she was in fact malingering. The hearing was stopped, and she was referred to Dr Ong Thiew Chai (PW4) at Woodbridge Hospital for examination. Following Ong`s examination of her, an application was made by her husband under s 3 of the Mental Disorders and Treatment Act (Cap 178) that she was of unsound mind and incapable of managing herself and her affairs, and her husband was appointed as the committee of her estate and her next friend in the suit. Arising from this sequence of events, the first plaintiff added a claim that the court should order that the costs of the examination including the remuneration to the physicians and surgeons be borne by the defendant. Counsel for the defendant opposed the claim and cited 
 In re Cathcart 
 .6 Whether or not to order that the costs incurred by the first plaintiff be borne by the defendant is a matter in the discretion of the court, and, in the circumstances of the present case, it did not appear to me to be right to do so.
 Second plaintiffs` estate claim
The deceased was employed by the same company as the first plaintiff. Prior to joining the company, she had engaged in part-time employment as a machine operator. On 2 March 1983, she joined the company as a production operator doing the same work as the first plaintiff. She worked on the night shift five days a week during which time her husband (the second plaintiff) would look after their children, Lee Chen Chuan, born on 13 May 1980 and Lee Lay Yin, born on 9 October 1981. After her death, her sister looked after the children but eventually, this responsibility was shouldered by the deceased`s father who lives in the same block of flats as the second plaintiff and children. Other household chores such as the washing of clothes and house-cleaning were taken over by the second plaintiff.
 Loss of earnings for lost years under the estate claim
The deceased was 24 years old at the time of her death. According to Evita Lee (PW5), the employee relations manager of her employer, she would have got about $650 per month if she had lived. Counsel for the second plaintiffs submitted that an initial multiplicand of $7,800 ($600 [times ] 13) should be applied to a multiplier of 15. In contrast, counsel for the defendant asserted that a multiplier of 10 should be adopted for the same reasons as he had put forward in relation to the first plaintiff. Furthermore, he calculated that the deceased was earning an average of $420.80 and submitted $5,470.40 to be the initial multiplicand (from $420.80 [times ] 13). Basing their submissions on 
 Lee Wee Hiong & Ors v Victor Koh Ah Sai & Ors 
 and 
 Chan Heng Wah v Peh Thiam Choh 
, both counsel agreed that the available surplus should be 40% of net prospective earnings. Accordingly, counsel for the second plaintiffs arrived at a figure of $46,800 and counsel for the defendant arrived at a figure of $21,881.60. In my opinion, the most reasonable multiplicand should be $600 per month with a multiplier of 14, and with an available surplus of 40%. The award would then be 40% of ($600 [times ] 13 [times ] 14) or $43,680.
 Dependency claim
Pre-trial:
The dependents in this case were the two children and it was alleged by the second plaintiffs that at the time of her death the deceased was contributing a high proportion of $300 per month to their maintenance out of the $365.90 per month that she was earning. Counsel for the defendant submitted that there was no need to divide loss of dependency of the children into pre and post-trial loss since the increase in earnings was not substantial and would have been absorbed into the deceased`s increased personal expenses. Relying on 
 Cookson v Knowles 
, he stressed that such a method should only be used if her career prospects were good and the dependency loss expected to be substantial as a result. Counsel for the second plaintiffs argued that the deceased could easily have contributed about $180 a month for the needs of the children. Taking her average income to be $365 per month as a starting point, her take-home pay would have been about $274 per month after deducting CPF contributions of 25%. According to the second plaintiffs, the deceased did not spend much on clothes and other personal needs. Each day she would spend 80 cents on bus fares and about $2 meals ie $56 per month. This left a balance of $218 out of which she could have easily contributed a sum of $180 a month for the children. Counsel for the second plaintiffs further submitted that although there was not much increase in salary between November 1984 and June 1988, the deceased would definitely have drawn more after July 1988. Thus, he divided pre-trial loss of dependency into two parts as follows:
1 November 1984 to 30 June 1988:
$180 could have been provided for the children
$7,920
($180 [times ] 44 months)
1 July 1988 to 26 April 1991:
With her increased salary, $220 could have been provided
$7,480
($220 [times ] 34 months)
Total
$15,400
Post-trial:
The multiplier selected must be selected once and for all as at the date of death: 
 Graham v Dodds 
. Counsel for the second plaintiffs suggested that a multiplier of 15 would be fair and having given 78 months for pre-trial loss, the balance for the post-trial loss period would be 102 months. Given that the deceased could have earned $650 per month, he submitted that after deducing CPF contributions and personal expenses, $250 could have been easily set aside for the children`s needs. Thus, post-trial loss of dependency would amount to $250 [times ] 102, ie $25,500. As counsel for the defendant chose not to split dependency into pre and post-trial loss, he submitted that $150 was the appropriate multiplicand which, coupled with a multiplier of 10 years, gave $150 [times ] 12 [times ] 10 or $18,000 as the total loss of dependency.
 Loss of Central Provident Fund contributions
It was conceded on behalf of the defendant that the loss of employers` CPF contributions formed part of the dependency loss (see C
 han Heng Wah v Peh Thiam Choh 
 and 
 Lee Wee Hiong & Ors v Victor Koh Ah Sai & Ors 
) and that the pre-trial loss of such contributions equalled $4,800. Counsel for the second plaintiffs assessed post-trial loss to be $11,602 based on 17.5% of $650 (monthly income) for 102 months, giving a total loss of employers` CPF contributions of $16,402. However, adopting a multiplier of 10 which was reduced to 42 months in order to take account of the pre-trial period, counsel for the defendant calculated a post-trial loss of $4,777.50. Hence, total loss of CPF contributions was only $9,577.50.
In a claim by a living plaintiff for personal injuries suffered by him, there can often be sufficient evidence from which it will be possible to try and calculate the pre-trial loss of earnings with some degree of precision. In a claim based on dependency, there is seldom sufficient evidence to do so, and both pre-trial and post-trial loss of earnings by the deceased can only be estimated in broad terms. In my opinion, it would be preferable in many of these cases where estimates are in the realm of speculation to avoid attempting too detailed a calculation and to approach the issue in general terms. In the present case, having considered the available evidence, I am of the opinion that the most reasonable multiplicand would be $200 per month, with a multiplier of 14 to arrive at a total dependency loss, to be split into a pre-trial loss ($200 [times ] 78) of $15,600 and a post-trial loss ($200 [times ] 90) of $18,000. Using the same approach, I would award $12,000 for the total loss of Central Provident Fund contributions, to be split into a pre-trial loss of $5,500 and a post-trial loss of $6,500.
As the children are common beneficiaries under both heads of damages, their share of the estate claim should be deducted from the total damages payable to them:
 General damages
 
 
(a) Loss of expectation of life $7,000 
 
(b) Lost years $43,680 
 
(c) Dependency claim $33,600 
 
(d) Loss of CPF contributions $12,000
  
 
 
$96,280
Less 1/2 share of estate claim $25,340
$70,940
 Special damages
Funeral expenses $5,030
Letters of administration
$1,000
$6,030
The total liability of the defendant to the second plaintiffs will only be 75% of the total amount awarded as the deceased was contributorily negligent to the extent of 25%. There will be interest at 6% pa on the general damages for loss of expectation of life and on the special damages, and 3% pa on the pre-trial loss of earnings and CPF loss from the date of the writ until the date of judgment.
 Loss of wife`s services to husband
Prior to her death in October 1984, the deceased attended to the household chores. After her death, the deceased`s husband did the washing and cleaned the house. He ate most of his meals outside. He claimed pecuniary loss suffered from his wife`s death in the form of loss of services which she had gratuitously rendered to him. Counsel for the second plaintiff referred to the Malaysian case of 
 Chong Pik Sing v Ng Mun Bee 
 and the English case of 
 Mehmet v Perry & Anor 
. In the former case, it was said at p 435 that `the loss need not be a monetary loss: a loss of services rendered by the wife and capable of being valued in monetary terms will suffice, such as housekeeping ...`. In 
 Mehmet v Perry & Anor 
, the plaintiff husband actually received damages for loss of the personal care and attention of the wife but it was said that this award should be small to avoid any overlap with damages awarded for loss of the wife`s housekeeping services. In the present case, counsel submitted that based on local conditions it would cost more than $200 a month to employ a domestic servant to perform the services which had been gratuitously rendered by the deceased, and accordingly he submitted the sum of $150 per month as a fair multiplicand. Counsel further proposed a multiplier of 10 from the date of death, taking into account the fact that the husband was 40 years old at the date of trial, his chances of remarriage, the uncertainties of life and the receipt of a lump sum payment. Thus, a sum of $18,000 (150 [times ] 12 [times ] 10) under this head was suggested.
Counsel for the defendant contended that there was no basis for claiming loss of services. He pointed out that there was neither authority for the proposition in any local case nor any reference by counsel for the plaintiffs to any relevant provision(s) of the then Civil Law Act (Cap 43). Furthermore, having regard to the financial situation of the husband and his family, it was doubtful if they would able to afford domestic help. The cost of a baby-sitter or childcare services would exceed the earnings of the deceased and it would have been more economical for her to stay and look after the children. In reality, the children used to be looked after by his sister-in-law and now by his father-in-law.
While I can see no reason why the claim for the loss of services cannot be allowed if the services can reduced into monetary terms, I am not satisfied that in the present case a claim would be valid. The evidence on this, which is unclear, showed that the wife worked from March 1983 as a production operator, working five days a week on the night shift from 11.15pm to 6.45am the next day, while the husband looked after the young children. Before that, she had held part-time jobs to supplement the meagre family income. According to the husband, she would have continued working if she had not been killed. In my opinion, the second plaintiffs have failed to discharge the burden of proof in their claim for loss of services.
There will also be costs to the first plaintiff and the second plaintiffs.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This claim arises from an industrial accident on 11 October 1985, in which the first plaintiff, an infant, was severely injured. He sues by his father and next friend for damages in respect of the injuries, pain and suffering and consequential loss suffered by him as a result of his accident, on the grounds that the accident was caused by the defendant`s negligence and/or breach of statutory duty.
The defendant was manufacturing plastic synthetic resins and plastic materials at 7A Pioneer Road, Jurong Industrial Estate at premises which were a factory within the meaning of the Factories Act (Cap 104) (`the Act`). On those premises was a power-operated Meiki plastic injection moulding machine which was used to produce reference plastic colour plates. The Meiki machine has a movable gate guard that looks like a metal tunnel covering the moving and stationary moulds. Seen from the side of the machine, it is a square arch in cross-section. Seen from the front, it moves from side to side on runners. On the front runner at the right-hand end is a microswitch. There is a similar microswitch on the rear runner, but this is half-way along, not at the end. The gate guard on the machine has a handle on it. It is always opened and closed by hand and the plates are always removed by hand. When the gate guard is fully closed, then seen from the front, it is all the way to the right and its front foot then comes into contact with the front microswitch. In this position, the rear foot of the gate guard just breaks contact with the microswitch on the rear runner. Conversely, as the gate guard is opened, moving to the left, its front foot breaks contact with the front microswitch and the rear foot comes into and maintains contact with the rear microswitch. The result is that the gate guard acts, and is clearly intended to act, as an automatic safety device. Closing it activates the moving mould to close and mate with the stationary mould in about two seconds. When the gate guard is open, and this is most important, the moving mould is supposed to remain stationary so long as the rear microswitch is working properly, even if the front microswitch is somehow activated.
At the relevant time, the first plaintiff was employed by the defendant as a machine operator. His duties as such were, inter alia, to remove plates from the Meiki machine after they had been produced. The first plaintiff originally worked for the defendant as a quality control operative and did not have to handle any machines. After a month, he was told to work on the Meiki machine. He learnt to operate it on-the-job while assisting E, the man in overall charge of the injection moulding machines. In three or four weeks, he was operating the machine and removing the plates by himself. At about 1.45pm on 11 October 1985, while the gate guard was open and the first plaintiff was removing a plate from the machine, the moving mould, instead of remaining stationary as it might have been expected to, suddenly moved and closed on his right hand. He instinctively used his left hand to operate the control panel on his left-hand side, the moving mould retracted and he pulled out his injured right hand. As a result of the accident, his right index, middle and ring fingers had to be completely amputated.
The first plaintiff testified that the following incident had happened after lunch on the day of the accident, when he was assisting E, who was operating the machine. As E was taking the second plate from the machine, the moulds hit each other, damaging the plate. E was unhurt and the first plaintiff asked him why this happened. E answered rather cryptically that the first plaintiff knew nothing about the machine and that he, E, would operate it. E then operated the switch on the control panel so that the moulds would separate and then removed the plate. He continued operating the machine and removing the plates from it for another ten minutes or so before going to the office, instructing the first plaintiff to continue operating the machine and to take out the plates. Left to himself, the first plaintiff obeyed E`s instructions and all went as usual for the first two plates he took. The accident occurred as he was removing the third plate. He testified that he did not touch the front microswitch.
The first important issue is whether the rear microswitch was faulty, and the machine was not functioning as it should. The day after the accident, an inspector was called in to check the machine. He did not order cessation of its use. Nevertheless, to allay the fears of other workers, an engineer was later called in from the manufacturers of the machine and he also checked it. He did not locate any specific fault in the machine but recommended installing an extra microswitch in front. This was done a few months later. There is no evidence of the reasons why this recommendation was made. Only the Meiki engineer who made the recommendation could give direct evidence of his reasons for making that recommendation, and he was not called as a witness. There was no explanation of why he was not called, nor was there even an attempt to put in evidence any written statement or report by him. Given that the machine was designed to ensure that normally nothing should cause the moulds to close when the gate guard was open, the mere fact that the mould moved while the gate guard was open was, in my opinion, sufficient to indicate that the machine was somehow not functioning as it should.
The second issue pertaining to liability for either common law negligence or breach of statutory duty is whether the fault in the machine caused the accident. At the time of the accident, the first plaintiff was standing quite close to the machine so that, it was said, his stomach was near to the front microswitch. The defendant contended that there was a strong possibility that the first plaintiff himself depressed the front microswitch while acting in haste to make up for time lost through alleged malingering, and was thus contributorily negligent. However, the first plaintiff denied throughout that he had touched that microswitch. In my view, even if the first plaintiff had somehow depressed the front microswitch, the moving mould should, nevertheless, have remained stationary because the gate guard was open. That was the whole point of the gate guard system. It cannot be said that the first plaintiff should have his claim reduced because he did what the system was designed to render safe. So long as the gate guard was open, he was entitled to rely on there being no ill consequences, even if the front microswitch was depressed. Furthermore, there was no allegation that, if he depressed the front microswitch, he did so other than inadvertently, and there is ample authority for inadvertent acts being insufficient to constitute contributory negligence: see 
 Caswell v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd 
 .1 In my opinion, it is clear that the fault in the machine caused the accident, and that the first plaintiff could not be held to have been contributorily negligent.
The plaintiff contended that the defendant was in breach of its duty under s 24 of the Act to constantly maintain the safeguards and fencing for its machinery, and keep them in position while the parts required to be safeguarded were in motion or in use, and to properly maintain the machinery in order to prevent any breakdown which was likely to cause death or bodily injury to any person. Section 24 reads: 
 
 
(1) All fencing or other safeguards provided in pursuance of the foregoing provisions of this Part shall be of substantial construction, and constantly maintained and kept in position while the parts required to be fenced or safeguarded are in motion or in use, except when any such parts are necessarily exposed in motion for examination and for any lubrication or adjustment shown by such examination to be immediately necessary, and all the conditions specified in section 23(2) are complied with. 
 
(2) The machinery and plant shall be properly maintained in order to prevent any breakdown which is likely to cause death or bodily injury to any person.
  
 
 
The wording of s 24 indicates that these duties are absolute in the sense that once it is proved that the safeguards and machinery were not maintained or kept in position as required, the first plaintiff did not need to prove any lack of care on the part of the factory owner. The fact that the moulds closed while the gate guard was open was, in view of the intention behind the design of its gate guard, sufficient to fix liability on the defendant for failing to maintain the safeguard and failing to maintain the machinery in order to prevent any breakdown which was likely to cause death or bodily injury to any person. With the gate guard open, the accident could not have happened in the absence of a fault in the machine.
This was sufficient to determine the issue of liability, but the plaintiff also alleged that the defendant was liable on several other grounds, all of which I rejected. As time was spent on these points during the trial, I will deal shortly with them all.
The Act requires employers to fence securely dangerous machinery parts or take other equally effective safety measures whenever their employees are exposed to dangerous machinery. Section 22 reads: 
 
 
(1) Every dangerous part of any machinery, other than prime movers and transmission machinery, shall be securely fenced unless it is in such a position or of such construction as to be safe to every person employed or working on the premises as it would be if securely fenced. 
 
(2) Subsection (1) shall not apply where the dangerous part of any machinery is made safe for persons employed or working on the premises by other equally effective means.
  
 
 
The Meiki machine was not fenced but the obligation in s 22 is not an absolute one. The gate guard was designed to be an equally effective means of making the machine safe for persons employed or working on the premises. Furthermore, no fence could have prevented the accident that occurred to the first plaintiff. Fences only prevent accidents happening to those who stand behind them. In this case, the first plaintiff had to stand next to the machine and put his hand into it to withdraw the plates. Therefore, even if the defendant had been in breach of its duty under s 22, there was not established the necessary causal link between that breach and the injury suffered by the plaintiff.
Section 28 of the Act reads: 
 
 
(1) No person shall be employed at any machine or in any process, being a machine or process liable to cause bodily injury, unless he has been fully instructed as to the dangers likely to arise in connection therewith and the precautions to be observed, and -
  
 
 
(a) has received a sufficient training in work at the machine or in the process; or
 
 
 
(b) is under adequate supervision by a person who has a thorough knowledge and experience of the machine or process. 
(2) For the purpose of instructing any person employed at any such machine or process on the safety measures to be observed in respect of the safe operation of any such machine or process an employer shall cause to be displayed on such machine or at a place nearest to the process a notice written in languages understood by the persons employed at such machine or in any such process describing those safety measures.
 
 
 
Had the first plaintiff, at the time of the accident, working alone with the machine, been `fully instructed as to the dangers likely to arise in connection therewith and the precautions to be observed`? The defendant contended that the first plaintiff `received a sufficient training in work at the machine` and was `under adequate supervision by a person who [had] a thorough knowledge and experience of the machine or process`. On balance, I do not think it was proved that the plaintiff failed to receive full and adequate instruction in the operation of the machine. On the contrary, it was not clear exactly what caused it to malfunction - no instruction could have assisted the plaintiff.
At trial, the first plaintiff also contended that the defendant was in breach of its duties under s 20 of the Act. This was not pleaded in the statement of claim and it was not necessary to consider the point.
The common law requires employers to take reasonable care for the safety of their employees. At the trial, the first plaintiff contended that the defendant had failed in its duty to take reasonable care for his safety, inter alia, by neglecting to provide tongs or other equipment with which to remove the plates from the Meiki machine. It was not disputed that no tongs or other equipment had been provided, but there was no evidence that tongs or other equipment were available on the market which would have enabled the plates to be extracted from the machine without risk to the operator. The witnesses were not asked if it was possible to find such equipment or if the method by which the plates were extracted was amenable to the use of equipment. If there was no way except by hand that the plates could have been removed from the machine, the defendant could hardly have been unreasonable in not providing the other equipment. Though the danger to the machine operator was obvious, a properly functioning gate guard would be an adequate safety measure exonerating the defendant from liability at common law.
Alternatively, the claim in negligence was based on the defendant`s alleged failure to take reasonable care to maintain the machine in such state that it was reasonably safe to work with. It was contended for the first plaintiff that the accident with E after lunch on the day of the accident, coupled with what happened to the first plaintiff later, showed that the machine was not maintained in such a state. However, the first plaintiff`s evidence of the incident with E after lunch was not supported. Only E and the first plaintiff were together at the time and E was not available at the trial. In favour of the defendant, it is noted that this was an isolated incidence of such an accident. It had not happened before, nor does it appear to have happened again since. S, the first plaintiff`s supervisor at the time, said that on the day of the accident E did not speak to him of the incident of the damaged plate, neither did he show the damaged plate to him. E was not called as a witness. He was apparently not in the jurisdiction, but there was no attempt to have admitted in evidence any statement by him. Therefore this ground of action also fails.
On the basis of liability established for breach of duty under s 24 of the Act, I now consider the quantum of damages to be awarded. The first plaintiff was 20 years old at the time of the accident. He was hospitalized from the day of the accident until 8 November 1985. Subsequently, he was warded for reparative treatment between 14 and 16 November 1985 and 19 and 26 December 1985. He was seen again in May 1986 and reviewed six months later. As a result of this accident, his right hand index, middle and ring fingers had to be amputated and his last finger became deformed and stiff. His right hand is now in the shape of a lobster claw and very unsightly. He is unable to grasp, pinch or grip anything and certainly cannot use the hand to lift heavy loads or use a hammer or screwdriver. With his thumb and little finger he can pick up light objects. He can write, but slowly and clumsily and not well enough for a clerical job. He now finds it awkward to go out when he has to take public transport on which he has to stand and hold on to a support, and he finds it embarrassing to eat in public without his right hand. He was assessed to have 70% permanent incapacity for the purposes of estimating workmen`s compensation. He continues to be employed by the defendant, though not in the same capacity. His duties are now to weigh powder, which he can do mainly with his left hand. His formal education ended in secondary two and he then obtained a trade certificate from the Vocational and Industrial Training Board (`VITB`) in metal machining, a qualification that is now virtually useless to him.
 General damages
Injury, pain and suffering, and loss of amenity
The first plaintiff referred me to the broadly similar facts in 
Ong Moh Chong v Hitachi Chemical (S) Pte Ltd
 
 
[1987] 1 MLJ 450
  in which the court awarded $30,000. Bearing in mind that the first plaintiff has also been left with a deformed little finger, I award under this head a sum of $35,000.
Loss of future earnings
It is not possible to accept the first plaintiff`s assertion that, if not for the injury, he would now be earning a basic salary of $2,000. In fact, even with overtime, it is highly unlikely that his earnings each month would be anywhere near that, even if he were not injured. At the time of trial, his basic salary was $836 and it appears that when he resumed work after being discharged from hospital, he did so at the same salary he was earning when he was injured. As for the fact that he has not been promoted, this was explained to the first plaintiff as being caused by a change of management. This reason was not doubted by the first plaintiff and has certainly nothing to do with his injury. In my opinion, no compensation can be due under this head.
Loss of earning capacity
The first plaintiff is now still employed by the defendant as a weighing assistant, a job that he can perform despite his handicap. He is only 25 years old. It may not be very likely that in the near future he will need to seek another job, but he has a long working life left. Even though the defendant has quite honourably continued to find a place for him for more than six years after the accident, and no criticism may be directed against the defendant in this regard, it must nevertheless be recognized that there is a real risk that the vicissitudes of time will at some point during that long remaining working life compel him to leave the defendant`s employ and find another place. When that happens, since his handicap is permanent, he will have difficulty finding a job that would pay him as well as if he could have complete use of his right hand. His vocational qualification is now useless to him. Consequently, any future employment he may find, in the event that he loses his present one, is not likely to pay him as well as if he could use that skill as well as his hand. Moreover, some allowance will have to be made for the effect of his injury upon his chances of advancement even in the defendant`s employ. For these reasons, I award him a lump sum of $55,000 under this head, without interest thereon, for his handicap in the labour market.
 Special damages
 
 
(a) pre-trial loss of earnings - there can be none if the plaintiff was paid in full while on medical leave; 
 
(b) pre-trial loss of overtime pay from 11 October 1985 to 30 April 1986, agreed at $980; 
 
(c) pre-trial loss of overtime pay from May 1986 to July 1986 will be assessed at $70 for May 1986, $140 for June 1986 and $35 for July 1986 (taking 20 hours overtime to be worth $140); no further compensation will be awarded for pre-trial loss of overtime pay since there was evidence that the plaintiff worked a maximum of 20 hours overtime a month at the time he was injured, but from August 1986 onwards, his new duties permitted him to work more than 20 hours overtime, and at the same rate; 
 
(d) transport expenses for plaintiff`s father to visit him in hospital, agreed at $936; 
 
(e) transport expenses for plaintiff to travel to and from hospital for outpatient treatment, agreed at $240; 
 
(f) medical report, specialist`s report, factory inspection report, totalling an agreed $390.
  
 
 
There will be interest at 6% on the damages for the injury, pain and suffering and loss of amenity, and, on the facts of this case, also at 6% on the special damages awarded, in both cases from the date of writ until judgment. As all the special damages were incurred at around the same time, rather than being spread out over an extended period of time up until the date of trial, there is no reason to take the 3% rate which is normally used because it is the median measure over such an extended period. There will also be costs to the first plaintiff.

Cur Adv Vult
 
In each of these three actions, the plaintiffs claimed, inter alia, injunctive relief and damages against the defendant for infringement of their respective registered trade marks.
Prior to the commencement of these actions, the plaintiffs caused to be issued against the defendant search warrants under the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), which upon execution resulted in the plaintiffs seizing hundreds of bottles of perfumes bearing the relevant trade marks and other paraphernalia for their manufacture, bottling, and packing. The brand names involved were Christian Dior, Yves St Laurent, Polo, Gucci, Anais Anais, Charlie and Giorgio. Pursuant to these seizures, the plaintiffs have commenced private prosecutions against the defendant for offences under s 73 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332).
The three applications before me are for summary judgment against the defendant for the following orders: (1) a permanent injunction to restrain the defendant from further infringements; (2) the delivery-up of all infringing articles; (3) the defendant to disclose information relating to past infringements by means of an affidavit; (4) an affidavit setting out all information to be disclosed; (5) leave to the plaintiffs to destroy all infringing articles seized; (6) an inquiry as to damages; and (7) costs. At the first hearing before me on 2 September 1991, the defendant consented to, and judgment was given in respect of prayers (1), (2), (5), (6) and (7), such costs to be fixed by the registrar at the appropriate scale of fees by reference to the amount of damages so found in the inquiry. Prayers (3) and (4) are for discovery. The defendant resists these two prayers on the ground that the court cannot compel him to give information which tends to or will incriminate himself. In an ordinary case where such infringing acts do not expose the infringer to prosecution for criminal offences relating to or arising from such acts, it is established law that the successful plaintiff is entitled to post-judgment discovery as a means of proving his damages: see 
 Draper v Hubert Trist 
 ;1 
 The Leather Cloth Co (Ltd) v Hirschfeld 
 ;2 
 Powell v The Birmingham Vinegar Brewery Co Ltd 
 ;3 
 Murray v Clayton 
 ;4 and 
 Saccharin Corp v Chemicals & Drugs Co 
 .5
Prayers (3) and (4) read as follows: 
 
The defendant do disclose forthwith to the plaintiffs` solicitors the following:
 
 
 
 
(a) The names and addresses of all persons, firms, companies or otherwise to whom the defendant had sold, distributed, supplied or otherwise disposed of the counterfeit `Gucci` perfume and perfumery prior to the issue of the writ in this action. 
 
(b) The full details of the date and quantities of each sale, distribution, supply or disposal referred to in (a). 
 
(c) The full details of the value and description of each counterfeit item in each sale, distribution, supply or disposal referred to in (a). 
 
(d) All the documents including invoices and receipts which are or have been at any time in his possession, custody or power relating to such sale, distribution, supply or disposal referred to in (a).
  
 
 
Within seven (7) days of the service on him of the order to be made herein the defendant do make and serve on the plaintiffs` solicitors an affidavit setting out all the information to be disclosed pursuant to this order and exhibiting thereto all relevant documents and/or articles.
 
 
 
The information sought under prayer (3) forms part of each of the plaintiffs` claim for damages for infringement. Paragraph 3 of each of the statements of claim refers to past acts of infringement, viz manufacturing, bottling, having in possession for sale, selling and/or offering for sale in the course of trade, perfume bearing the plaintiffs` trade mark but which is not the perfume manufactured by the plaintiffs or with their consent. Sub-paragraphs (i) to (iv) of the particulars refer to acts of infringement evidenced by the possession of the bottles and paraphernalia that were seized under the search warrant. Sub-paragraph (v) states that the plaintiffs `are unable to particularize all the infringing acts of the defenuntil after discovery or interrogatories but will claim to recover in respect of such claims`. The plaintiffs` claim for damages are therefore not limited to the acts of infringement particularized in the particulars but include those which are to be discovered.
Although the plaintiffs are seeking discovery to augment their damages, they are effectively seeking evidence to uncover past acts of infringement. Having regard to the terms of s 73 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332), which make infringement of a trade mark in the manner prescribed therein an offence, it cannot be disputed that the past acts of infringement of the defendant, if uncovered, would constitute offences under that section. The reason is that the bases of the civil action are substantially the same as those of the s 73 offence. It is therefore plain that the plaintiffs are seeking an order of court which, when obeyed, will have the effect of compelling the defendant to incriminate himself in relation to offences arising from the past acts of infringement. Not surprisingly, the defendant has claimed the privilege against self-incrimination in an affidavit filed in each of the three applications. He does not claim the privilege in respect of the particularized acts as he has already been charged under s 73 of the Trade Marks Act in relation to such acts, and to which he has also consented to judgment. He claims it in respect of the unparticularized, and therefore unproved, acts.

 ,6 I held that the privilege against self-incrimination, being part of the common law, applied with full force in Singapore to pre-trial discovery by a plaintiff in an action for infringements of copyright, and that the privilege was not abrogated or affected by s 134 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). Counsel for the plaintiffs accepts the correctness of the decision, but does not accept that the defendant in these three actions is entitled to claim the privilege. I shall examine his arguments later. Where the privilege is claimed and there is a basis for claiming it, `it is the paramount duty of the court to uphold it` (per du Parcq LJ in 
 Triplex Glass Co 
 7 at p 617). However, the judge must consider whether it is a bona fides claim. The mere assertion by a party that he may or will criminate himself is not sufficient. The judge should be certain that the authority of the court is not being `trifled with`: see Pollock CB (at p 362) in 
 Adams v Lloyd 
 ,8 
 Triplex Safety Glass Co v Lancegaye Safety Glass (1934) Ltd 
 7 at p 617, and 
 Sociedade Nacional de Combustiveis de Angola UEE v Lundqvist 
 9 at p 293. In these three actions, there is no doubt that the defendant has a basis for claiming it.
However, counsel for the plaintiffs contends that, unlike the situation in 
 Riedel-De-Haen 
 6 where counsel for the plaintiff conceded that there was a serious risk of the defendant being exposed to a prosecution under the Trade Marks Act and the Consumer Protection (Trade Descriptions and Safety Requirements) Act (Cap 53), the defendant in these three actions is not likely to be exposed to further criminal prosecution for the past unparticularized acts of infringement. The test is whether there is a real or appreciable risk of the defendant being prosecuted for such acts, if disclosed. Counsel for the plaintiffs says that the risk is remote for the following reasons: (1) the plaintiffs will give an undertaking not to prosecute the defendant with respect to any past infringing acts disclosed by him or to use the information in the pending criminal proceedings against him; (2) the public prosecutor did not commence criminal proceedings against the defendant, as a result of which the plaintiffs had to obtain the requisite fiats from him to do so; (3) there is no real likelihood of the public prosecutor doing so with respect to the undiscovered acts of infringement when he has not done so in respect of the particularized acts. He relies on the following authorities:

All the decisions relied upon by counsel for the plaintiffs can be distinguished. In each of them, the court either found as a fact that there was no real or appreciable risk or imposed conditions against disclosure which eliminated any risk of prosecution. It is useful to examine some of them if only to highlight what they actually decided. I refer first to the decision of Davison CJ in 
 Thorn EMI 
 10 as it has often been cited to me in applications for pre-judgment discovery as a precedent for granting such discovery notwithstanding the plea of the privilege against self-incrimination. In that case, the action was based on infringement of copyright. K and B relied on the privilege to resist pre-trial discovery. They contended that the information, if given, would expose them to prosecution for offences under s 28 of the Copyright Act 1962 and/or for conspiracy to defraud under s 257 of the Crimes Act 1961. Davison CJ held that the privilege was part of the common law in New Zealand but that (1) in relation to s 28, the punishment was trivial (following 
 Rank Film Distributors Ltd v Video Information Centr 
 
 e 
 15); and (2) in relation to conspiracy, that, since there had never been a prosecution for conspiracy to defraud based on copyright infringement in New Zealand, there was no `realistic chance` of the defendants facing such a charge (following 
 Ocli Optical 
 12 and 
 Snugkoat 
 13). However, on appeal,16 one member of the Court of Appeal, Somers J, disagreed with the finding on the absence of a realistic chance, whilst the other two members, Cooke and Bisson JJ, decided that Davison CJ applied the correct test but did not unequivocally uphold the finding. The appeal was dismissed on a ground which I shall refer to later. In 
 Ocli Optical 
 ,12 the Court of Appeal held that there was no substantial risk of the defendants being prosecuted under s 21 of the Copyright Act 1956, there being no evidence of any such prosecution for that offence having been conducted, but that there was a risk of prosecution under the Theft Act 1956. However, the court went on to hold that the risk was irrelevant as s 31 thereof provided that no person should be excused, by reason of the fact that to do so might incriminate the person in respect of an offence under the Theft Act, from answering any questions put to him in proceedings to recover property, or to account for any property or dealings in property. 
 Ocli Optical 
 12 was decided after the Court of Appeal`s decision but before the House of Lords` decision in 
 Rank Film 
 .15 In 
 Snugkoat 
 ,13 Graham J thought that the two Court of Appeal decisions were difficult to reconcile. He held that `it is a matter of degree in each case as to how much weight must be given to the likelihood or otherwise of criminal proceedings in fact being brought having regard to the likely results of the making of that particular Anton Piller order`. He suggested that the court should `exercise its discretion along the lines of common sense and to do justice`. He granted the order for discovery subject to the undertaking of the plaintiffs not to initiate any criminal proceedings under s 1 of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968, although he was of the view that the penalty thereunder, being about o400, was not trivial.
The House of Lords in 
 Rank Film 
 15 held that the maximum fine of o50 for an offence under s 21 of the Copyright Act was too trivial to give effect to the claim against self-incrimination. In consequence, they also held that the offence of conspiracy to commit the said offence was also too trivial since the penalty was the same. However, they held that a charge based on the common law of conspiracy to defraud was serious as the penalties were much heavier, and because the much heavier penalties made it more likely that charges for that offence would be brought (see p 81a). Lord Wilberforce said that a charge of conspiracy to defraud, so far from being as it sometimes was, a contrived addition to other charges, was there an appropriate and exact description of what was being done by three of the respondents. He said that the risk was not contrived, fanciful or imagined as there one of them had already been charged for conspiracy to defraud. Similarly, Lord Fraser of Tulleybelton also agreed that the risk of those who manufactured illicit films being prosecuted for conspiracy to defraud was `by no means remote or fanciful` (at p 84a).
In 
 Authors Workshop 
 ,11 Lockhart J accepted that the privilege against self-incrimination was part of the common law in Australia, but held that there was no evidence before him to sustain such a claim and he gave leave to the defendant to file affidavits to support the claim. In the case of 
 Re O 
 ,14 the application was for disclosure of the assets of the accused made in connection with a restraint order under the Criminal Justice Act 1988. The jurisdiction to make restraint orders under the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1968 was mirrored by that under the Criminal Justice Act and a decision in relation to one Act would apply equally to the other. The 1988 Act contained no provisions expressly empowering the High Court to make any such order. The Court of Appeal held that, although the 1988 Act did not abrogate the privilege against self-incrimination, the Act must have intended the High Court to have the power to render effective a restraint order made under s 77 of the 1988 Act. To do that and to ensure that there was no justification for the accused to plead the privilege, the court ordered that `no disclosure made in compliance with the order of court shall be used in evidence in the prosecution of an offence alleged to have been committed by the person required to make disclosure or by any spouse of that person`. The court was of the view that the undertaking of the Crown Prosecution Service was not the appropriate course to take.
In these three actions, the main protection that the defendant has is the undertaking of the plaintiffs not to prefer new criminal charges against the defendant under s 73 of the Trade Marks Act in respect of any acts of infringement that may be disclosed, and not to use the evidence disclosed in the pending prosecutions. Their undertaking is not good enough: see 
 Rank Film 
 15 and 
 Re 
 
 O 
 .14 The fact that the public prosecutor has not prosecuted the defendant for any offences in connection with trade mark infringements does not mean that there is no likelihood of such prosecutions being commenced. In 
 Triplex Safety Glass Co Ltd v Lancegaye Safety Glass 
 ,7 du Parcq LJ said at p 618: 
 
The `danger` of the existence of which the court must be satisfied is, to quote again the words of Field J in 
 Lamb v Munster
 
(1882) 10 QBD 110
 at p 111: `... the peril and possibility of being convicted as a criminal.` In 
 R v Boyes
 [(1861) 1 B&S 311], it was held that no such danger existed, because the witness had been pardoned by the Crown for the part which he had taken in the transaction alleged to be criminal. He professed to fear, notwithstanding the pardon, that he might be impeached by the House of Commons, a supposition which the court held to be `simply ridiculous`. The principle there laid down, at p 330, was:
 
 
 
`... that a merely remote and naked possibility, out of the ordinary course of the law and such as no reasonable man would be affected by, should not be suffered to obstruct the administration of justice.`
 
 
 
That is the only case to which our attention was directed in which a witness was compelled to admit in terms the commission of a criminal offence, and the ground of the decision was that `in the ordinary course of the law` it had become not merely improbable, but impossible, that the witness should ever be convicted of that offence. It does not seem ever to have been held that a man may be compelled to answer a question directed to procuring his profession of a criminal act merely on the ground that, in the particular circumstances of the case, and on a balance of probabilities, it is unlikely that he will be prosecuted. Cases may, of course, arise in which the court is satisfied that no reasonable man could possibly be apprehensive of a prosecution - as, for instance, where the offence is trivial, or was committed many years ago - and then it may be that the judge, even if he were not prepared to go to the length of imputing mala fides to the witness, might insist upon an answer. Much must be left to the discretion of the judge, who will not usually be likely to take this course unless he thinks that there is good reason to doubt the witness`s good faith. As a general rule, it is true to say that any admission of a criminal offence, of which the witness has not hitherto been convicted, must tend to criminate him within the meaning of the rule.
 
 
 
In the 
 Thorn EMI 
 case,10 Cooke J at p 315 said: `Experience suggests that neither the police nor any other persons are likely to prosecute; but mere improbability has never been treated as tantamount to no real risk.` In that case, Cooke J (with whom Bisson J agreed) decided to eliminate the risk of prosecution by holding, firstly, that such evidence would not be admissible in criminal proceedings against the defendant, and secondly, by putting the plaintiff on terms that he would not, either directly or indirectly use the information or make the same available to the police. The Court of Appeal of New Zealand anticipated the English Court of Appeal in 
 Re O 
 14 in imposing a condition to exclude such evidence from being used in criminal prosecutions.
I should interpose here to observe that in Singapore, s 134 of the Evidence Act confers statutory immunity to a witness from prosecution for 
 any 
 offence (other than that of giving false evidence) in connection with or in respect of any answers he may give to questions asked of him in the witness box. In return for that immunity, the witness is compellable to answer any questions, the answers to which may criminate him. This provision offers no protection to the defendant in these three cases as he is not a witness or in the position of a witness. Having regard to s 134 of the Evidence Act, read with s 2 thereof and the 
 Rank Film 
 decision,15 I do not think that this court has the power, in the circumstances of this case, to impose a condition that such evidence shall not be admissible in criminal proceedings against the defendant.
None of the matters sufficient to lift the privilege against self-incrimination is present in these three cases. With regard to the gravity of the offence, this criterion is satisfied. The offence under s 73 of the Trade Marks Act of having in one`s possession for sale or for any purpose or trade or manufacture, any goods or thing to which a counterfeit trade mark is applied or to which a registered trade mark is falsely applied, is punishable with a fine of $10,000 for each goods or thing, subject to a limit of $100,000 or to a term of imprisonment for a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years or both. It is not a petty offence.
As to the real likelihood of the defendant being prosecuted for the offences under s 73 of the Trade Marks Act, no one can say that the likelihood is fanciful or remote, since the public prosecutor is free to prosecute the defendant for the unparticularized acts of infringements, even though he has not prosecuted him for the particularized offences.
Counsel for the plaintiffs has also contended that the defendant, having consented to judgment, is not entitled to claim the privilege against self-incrimination as in doing so he has incriminated himself. He relied on an old decision, viz 
 Ewing v Osbaldiston 
 .17 In this case, the bill was filed to have accounts taken of a partnership between E and O in the Surrey Theatre. The defence made by the answer was that the partnership was illegal. O did not refuse to answer any of the allegations of the bill but stated circumstances sufficient to show that the parties had incurred penalties imposed by 10 Geo 2, c28. E moved that O might be ordered to produce certain books and other documents referred to in the answer. The motion was resisted on the ground that the court would not compel a defendant to make discovery which would subject him to penalties. Shadwell VC held that as O had made admissions in his answer which clearly showed that he had incurred the penalties of the Act, and consequently `he could not be damnified by a production of the documents`. In my view, this case is only an illustration of waiver. A defendant may waive the privilege, and he does so if he answers any question without claiming the privilege. In that case, the discovery ordered was confined to documents directly connected with the admissions. In these three actions, the defendant has merely consented to judgment. Nothing in this suggests that his intention was to consent to judgment on the plaintiffs` claim other than in respect to those infringing acts that were particularized. He made his position clear by filing an affidavit to claim the privilege expressly before he consented to judgment.
The operation of the privilege against self-incrimination is unavoidable in a case where, as here, the bases for civil liability are the same as those for criminal liability. The plaintiffs says that they are more interested in recovering damages from the defendant than in further prosecuting them or putting them in a position of being further prosecuted. Be that as it may, that is not a sufficient reason to deny the defendant his right to plead the privilege, which in the United States is regarded as `one of the great landmarks in man`s struggle to make himself civilized`. (Erwin N Griswold, 
 The Fifth Amendment Today 
 (Cambridge, Mass, 1955), quoted by Frankfurter J in 
 Ullmann v US 350 
 .18) In my view, as the law stands, the privilege applies as much to pre-trial discovery as to post-judgment discovery.
For the above reasons, I make no order on prayers (3) and (4).

This was an appeal by the second defendants (`Amixco`) against the order of Coomaraswamy J made on 18 July 1986 continuing until the trial of this action or further order, a Mareva injunction obtained ex parte by the plaintiffs (`BNI`) against Amixco and the third defendants (`Kosin`).
BNI were bankers of PT Harapan Papa Plywood Industries (`HP`), an Indonesian company. On 20 September 1985, HP agreed to sell a quantity of about 10,000cu m of meranti plywood (`the said goods`) to the first defendants who, earlier on 10 September 1985, had contracted to sell the said goods to Amixco, who still earlier on had contracted to sell the said goods to a North Korean state-owned corporation (`Ilban`). Ilban in turn had agreed to sell the said goods to an Egyptian state-owned corporation (`Fabbas`) under a trade clearing account pursuant to a barter agreement between North Korea and Egypt.
Pursuant to an agreement amongst the first defendants, Amixco and HP that Amixco would pay HP directly for the said goods, Amixco on 17 October 1985 requested their bankers, Banque Paribas (`BP`) to issue an irrevocable letter of credit (`the L/C`) in favour of HP for an amount not exceeding US$2,142,346.15, available by sight drafts. The L/C was duly issued.
On or about 22 October 1985, Kosin, a freight forwarding company, time-chartered the Atlantic Mariner (`the vessel`) to carry the said goods from Pontianak, Indonesia to Alexandria, Egypt. The said goods were loaded on the vessel on or about 30 October 1985. A bill of lading dated 30 October 1985 (`the true B/L`) was issued for the said goods by Kosin`s shipping agents at Pontianak. The true B/L named HP as the shipper, BNI or their order as the consignees, and Alexandria as the port of discharge.
In November, HP presented the shipping documents to BNI for payment and BNI discounted the draft for US$2,142,346.15 drawn under the terms of the L/C and paid HP. BNI then forwarded the shipping documents to BP in Singapore for reimbursement. On 20 November 1985, BP notified BNI by telex of the following discrepancies in the documents: (1) the inspection certificate was not issued by Societe Commerciale du Bois as required; (2) the name of the shipper in the certificate of origin had the letters `LTD` omitted; and (3) in the bill of lading, (i) the number of crates should have been 3,644 instead of 3,633, and (ii) the name of the shipper was `PT Harapan Papa Plywood Industries` instead of `PT Harapan Papa Plywood Industries Ltd`. In their telex, BP also confirmed that they had sought Amixco`s instructions on the said discrepancies. On 4 December 1985, BP rejected the documents on the instructions of Amixco.
On 13 December 1985, Amixco wrote to BP as follows: 
 
Please be informed that we/ 
 final buyer
 are not in a position to accept the discrepant documents presented under reference L/C and would appreciate it if you could still treat said bill as `on collection basis`.
 
 
 
However, we have made arrangement with the 
 final buyer 
 for us to negotiate an L/C No 600517 for US$2,364,099.40 is issued by Credit Lyonnais, Zurich, covering shipment of about 1,025 metric tons of cotton and the original L/C is attached for your retention. Upon completion of the cotton shipment under this L/C, we will present full set of original documents on behalf of beneficiary to you for negotiation. In this respect, we hereby request you to pay Bank Negara Indonesia 1946, Pontianak Branch for account of PT Harapan Papa Plywood Industries Ltd, Pontianak, in settlement of the referenced bill under your L/C No IL202171 for US$2,142,346.15 only upon receipt of the proceeds pertaining to your negotiation under L/C No 600517 issued by Credit Lyonnais, Zurich.
Kindly note the above instruction by signing and returning to us the duplicate of this letter. (Emphasis added.)
This request was not accepted by BNI as on 16 December 1985, BP telexed BNI a message from Amixco to the effect that Amixco would accept the discrepant documents only upon Amixco receiving payment under the Credit Lyonnais letter of credit. BP asked BNI for further instructions on the matter. BNI`s reply is not in evidence.
However, long before these events, unbeknown to HP and BNI, the fourth defendant (`Quek`), acting as director of Kosin had caused to be issued a bill of lading (`the false B/L`) for the said goods on or about 21 October 1985, ie nine days before the true B/L was issued. The false B/L named Amixco as shipper, the order of Bancaire Saleh Salem Alexandria, a bank in Alexandria, as the consignee, and Alexandria as the port of discharge.
The vessel arrived in Alexandria in early December 1985. Kosin then instructed their agents in Alexandria to discharge and deliver the goods to Fabbas, the ultimate buyers, in exchange for a bank guarantee which was issued on 30 November 1985 by Bank du Caire, the bankers for Fabbas. The guarantee (`the BDC guarantee`), when translated into English from the Egyptian language, read: 
 
B/L No 1 - Kind meranti plywood - No pcs 5,612 Crts - CBM 10,010,663 - Guarantee 9643/5 - Value 4,084,478,86.

The BDC guarantee was at one time either in the possession of Kosin`s shipping agents in Alexandria or one Ammon, who might have been a servant of the `state agents`, as on 24 December 1985, Kosin sent him a telex instructing him not to release the said guarantee unless authorized by Kosin. At all material times, the BDC guarantee was not in the physical possession of Quek or Kosin. Quek had claimed that Kosin had not demanded payment under the BDC guarantee pending Amixco`s and Kosin`s attempt to discharge the Mareva injunction.
BNI commenced this action on 21 February 1986 against the four defendants for damages for conversion of BNI`s goods, and alternatively, against Quek only for damages for conspiring with the other three defendants to convert the said goods. On the same day, BNI obtained ex parte the Mareva injunction against Amixco and Kosin only. The affidavit filed in support of this application contained only two material facts relevant to the cause of action: (i) that using the false L/C, a party (then unknown to BNI but which later turned out to be Fabbas) in Alexandria took delivery of the said goods and BNI were unable to recover possession of them; and (ii) that Quek was the managing director and majority shareholder of Amixco, and also a co-director and 50% shareholder of Kosin, and that Amixco and Kosin shared the same office.
Further affidavits filed prior to the hearing to continue the Mareva injunction contained the following additional facts: (1) that Quek claimed that he had signed the false B/L at the request of Ilban to enable Ilban to use as documentation (whatever that meant) under the trading account referred to earlier, but subject to the express condition that Ilban would not use it as a document of title without the consent of Kosin; (2) that Kosin had received the BDC guarantee in exchange for delivery to Fabbas; (3) that Amixco had received US$790,000 from Ilban for the said goods and were waiting to be paid the balance on clearance of the barter account between the North Korean and the Egyptian governments.
Before Coomaraswamy J, counsel for Amixco and Kosin conceded that there was an arguable case for conversion against Kosin. She contended that there was no case against Amixco for conversion as (i) there was no conspiracy to injure, (ii) the issue of the false B/L was not a sufficient intent to injure as Amixco and Kosin could not have manipulated the discrepancies in the shipping documents, and (iii) the said goods were released to Fabbas under the BDC guarantee and not the false B/L, ie there was no causal link between the issue of the false B/L and the delivery of the goods to Fabbas. It was also contended that the conduct of Amixco and Kosin was not sufficient to establish dishonesty or a probability of their assets being dissipated.
Coomaraswamy J continued the Mareva injunction. He found that there was an arguable case on conversion on the following grounds: (1) that Kosin had issued the false B/L at the request of Amixco acting through Quek who had a financial interest and role in Amixco and Kosin; (2) that Kosin, being carriers, had no interest in issuing the false B/L except to assist Amixco; (3) that this was prima facie evidence that Amixco and Kosin acted together in converting BNI`s goods to their own use, which the judge found, was supported by Amixco having received US$708,000 from Ilban. He also found that the conduct of Amixco and Kosin showed that they had no intention whatever of paying for the said goods.
After the Mareva injunction was continued, BNI amended their statement of claim on 8 August 1989 to plead as follows: (a) that Amixco acted in concert with Kosin in issuing the false B/L; (b) that, alternatively, Amixco, Kosin and Quek having had knowledge of the transactions between Amixco, Ilban and Fabbas, Kosin delivered the goods to Fabbas with the assent and facilitation of Amixco and Quek; (c) that the said delivery was to and did effect the said transactions, and thereby entitling Ilban to receive payment from Fabbas, and Amixco to receive payment from Ilban; (d) that, alternatively, Amixco, Kosin and Quek have conspired either by themselves or with Ilban and Fabbas to deprive BNI of the said goods.
Amixco and Quek amended their defence on 1 August 1990 in which they denied the allegations of BNI in the amended statement of claim. Kosin filed a separate amended defence dated 28 January 1991 in which they alleged, inter alia: that the false B/L was issued by Quek without their authority; that in any case, the issue thereof was not wrongful; that they had no knowledge of the transactions between Amixco, Ilban and Fabbas; and that they did not conspire with Amixco and Quek, nor did they convert the goods which were discharged against a bank guarantee.
Only Amixco appealed against the order to continue the Mareva injunction. The appeal was founded on two grounds: (1) 
 as originally pleaded 
 , BNI did not have a good arguable case for conversion against Amixco; and (2) there were no objective facts to support the finding that Amixco would remove or dissipate their assets to avoid satisfying any judgment against them. It should be noted that the appeal was against the cause of action as pleaded in the statement of claim and not as pleaded in the amended statement of claim. It was contended that as this was an appeal, BNI were not entitled to rely on the amended statement of claim to support an injunction founded on the original pleading.
 Good arguable case
It was common ground that a good arguable case for the purpose of a Mareva injunction was one which was more than barely capable of serious argument, but not necessarily one which the judge considered would have a better than 50% chance of success: see 
 Ninemia Maritime Corp v Trave S mbH & Co 
 ( 
 `The Niedersachsen` 
)1 at p 1471A-F.
Amixco`s appeal before us was based essentially on a point of pleading. It was that BNI had no claim in conversion against Amixco upon the plea that Amixco, Kosin and Quek had wrongfully delivered the said goods to Fabbas under the false B/L, when the evidence showed that the said goods were delivered in exchange for the BDC guarantee. It was also contended that Amixco had never been in possession of the goods from the time they were loaded on board the vessel to the time the said goods were discharged at Alexandria. Accordingly, on these facts, Amixco could not have converted the said goods.
We were of the view that this argument had no merit, having regard to all the facts before us. The inadequacy of BNI`s original pleading was excusable as when they commenced this action, and up to the time they filed the statement of claim, they were aware of only a few material facts. They were aware that their goods had been wrongfully released without their knowledge and consent by Kosin to Fabbas. They knew that a false B/L had been issued by Kosin, but not that it was signed by Quek to satisfy Ilban`s needs, and that it had been indorsed in blank to Fabbas. They knew of the legal relationships between Amixco, Kosin and Quek, but not the precise role of Quek in the whole affair. On these known facts, they naturally inferred that the said goods must have been released against the false B/L as a result of the concerted acts of Amixco, Kosin and Quek. In the circumstances, BNI`s case on conversion as pleaded was only technically incorrect in so far as it specifically alleged that the said goods had been released under the false B/L.
However, many other facts and considerations had since emerged from the affidavits filed before and after the hearing before Coomaraswamy J: (1) Amixco had sold the said goods to Ilban under an arrangement which made it necessary for Amixco to procure the false B/L, which Amixco did, through Quek, either with or without the knowledge of Chong, his co-director in Kosin; (2) before the arrival of the vessel in Alexandria, Kosin, Quek and Chong had already made arrangements with Fabbas for the BDC guarantee to be issued in order to release the said goods to Fabbas; (3) there was no reason for Kosin to have performed the contract for Amixco unless Chong agreed to it or Kosin were merely an instrument in the hands of Quek, to effect the delivery; (4) after the wrongful delivery, Amixco received a substantial payment for the said goods from Ilban, thereby suggesting that Ilban had recognized that Amixco had performed their obligation to deliver the said goods to them, by effecting delivery to Fabbas; (5) Kosin had not made any claim under the BDC guarantee in spite of the commencement of this action against them and of the impediment of the Mareva injunction to their business; (6) Quek as a director of and 50% shareholder of Kosin, and a majority shareholder of Amixco, had not required Kosin to take any such action in spite of the same action and Mareva injunction against Amixco; and (7) there was evidence that Amixco, through Quek, had de jure or de facto control of Kosin. The above facts raised a seriously arguable case that BNI had indeed been deprived of possession of the said goods as a result of the concerted acts of Amixco, Kosin and Quek. Kosin, being carriers, had no reason to deliver the said goods to Fabbas except to assist Fabbas to obtain wrongful possession of them or to enable Amixco to perform their obligations to Ilban and thereby enabling Ilban, in turn, to perform their obligations to Fabbas. Similarly, Kosin`s failure to claim under the BDC guarantee had not been explained and could not be satisfactorily explained.
BNI`s original cause of action was not that Amixco alone converted the said goods but that Amixco, Kosin and Quek, jointly, had converted BNI`s goods. Therefore the fact that Amixco themselves had never been in physical possession of the said goods was not relevant to the cause of action against them as one of three joint tortfeasors. In any case, even if Amixco had been sued alone as sole tortfeasor, that would also not have mattered as it is not necessary, in law, for a person to have physical possession of goods to be able to convert them. The question was whether Amixco`s acts alone or in conjunction with those of Kosin, had deprived BNI of their right to possession or amounted to a substantial interference with that right. Amixco was sued as a joint tortfeasor. If they were not liable as such, they could still be liable as the sole tortfeasor. As we have stated earlier, there was evidence from which it could be reasonably inferred that Amixco, through Quek, had control of Kosin. If Kosin had merely been used as an instrument in Quek`s arrangements with Ilban and Fabbas, then Amixco could even be regarded as the sole tortfeasor.
After the Mareva injunction was continued, Quek disclosed several telex messages from Kosin to their representatives and the master of the vessel in Alexandria in connection with the release of the said goods to Fabbas. One telex, in particular, showed Kosin`s perception of its role in the Amixco/Kosin/Quek axis. Kosin`s telex of 7 December 1985 to their representative, one Jeffrey Koh, at his hotel in Alexandria, was as follows: 
 
 
(2) The original B/L issued in Indonesia are congenbill charterparty B/L. These original charterparty B/L are still with our bank in Spore becos L/C still not negotiated. This explains why we need rcvrs to disch cgo agnst bank guarantee.
  
 
 
... 
(4) We will send u these `original` charterparty B/L as soon as we them return by the bank.
 
 
 
This telex would suggest that Kosin was either working hand in hand with Amixco or was merely a tool in the hands of Amixco. Otherwise, they would not have referred to BP as `our bank` or promised to send the true B/L when it was returned to them by BP.
Kosin had since then filed an amended defence on 28 January 1991 in which for the first time they denied that they had authorized Quek to issue the false B/L. Chong has also filed an affidavit in these proceedings which, in our view, was a model of non-disclosure.
In our view, the evidence before Coomaraswamy J was capable of supporting a claim in conversion against Amixco either as a joint or sole tortfeasor. What was amiss was that BNI had thought the false B/L was the key to establishing the cause of action. It was probably not. All that was required at that stage of the hearing, and it should be remembered that this was only an interlocutory hearing, was a formal amendment to the statement of claim to plead (a) the various acts of Amixco, Kosin and Quek, or any one or more of them which had since come to light to substantiate the allegations that they had acted jointly, or Amixco had acted solely in having wrongfully converted the said goods; or (b) alternatively, a conspiracy between Amixco, Kosin and Quek in the wrongful delivery of the said goods to Fabbas, however it was done. That no amendment was requested or effected at that stage was not, in our view, such a serious irregularity that the Mareva injunction should have been discharged on this ground alone. It was not that BNI had pleaded the wrong cause of action but that they had pleaded the wrong act in support of the tort of conversion. We could and would have granted an application to amend the statement of claim for the purpose of pleading the said matters to support the existing cause of action if it had been necessary to have done so. It was not necessary to do so as BNI had already amended their statement of claim on 8 August 1989, shortly after the Mareva injunction was continued, to plead the said matters.
 Likelihood of dissipation
Counsel for Amixco submitted that there was no objective evidence to show any real likelihood on the part of Amixco to dissipate their assets to avoid satisfying any judgment against them. In our view, there was overwhelming objective evidence of prima facie dishonest conduct on the part of Amixco, Kosin and Quek. From the moment Quek became aware that BNI was in no position to draw under BP`s L/C because of the discrepancies, the following events occurred. First, Kosin immediately, before the arrival of the vessel at Alexandria, arranged to deliver the said goods to Fabbas in exchange for the BDC guarantee (which was issued before the vessel`s arrival). Second, Amixco and Quek refused to waive the discrepancies when the goods were in the course of being discharged into the possession of Fabbas. Third, Amixco and Quek on 13 December 1985 dishonestly informed BP that they and Fabbas could not accept the discrepancies when Fabbas had taken delivery of the said goods at Alexandria. Amixco also attempted to obtain the shipping documents `on collection basis` and when this attempt failed, they further suggested that they would accept the discrepant documents on condition that payment to HP would be effected only upon condition of their receipt of funds under the Credit Lyonnais letter of credit in their favour for a shipment of cotton. Fourth, Amixco and Quek had not disclosed what had happened to the shipment of cotton in respect of which they had expected to receive sufficient moneys to pay BNI. Fifth, Amixco had received a substantial payment for the said goods from Ilban, which they claimed was partial, but which they had not paid to BNI. Sixth, Amixco and Quek had not explained why they had not received the balance of the sale price or what steps they had taken to recover it. Seventh, Amixco, Kosin, Quek and Chong had not given any satisfactory reason why Kosin had not made a claim under the BDC guarantee.
With respect to this sum of US$790,000, Quek had alleged in his affidavit affirmed on 27 August 1986, ie after the Mareva injunction had been continued, that Amixco had paid, out of that sum, about US$700,000 to three banks, viz ABN Bank, BNP and Bangkok Bank, in order to avoid winding-up proceedings. No documentary evidence was produced to support the alleged payments or the threats of winding-up. Even if these allegations were true, Amixco had used BNI`s money to pay their other creditors. The remaining sum of US$93,330 had not been accounted for.
The aforesaid acts and omissions could hardly be said to be those of a person who would be willing to preserve his assets to meet a potential judgment for well over US$3m (if interest is taken into account).
Counsel for Amixco also submitted that Amixco was in good financial standing with four banks which had granted them credit facilities of more than $10m, that Amixco had been operating for more than 12 years and had established a substantial import and export business, and that their unaudited balance sheet as at 30 June 1985 showed a sales volume of $39,984,093.77 and a profit before tax of $919,744. However, their audited accounts as at 30 June 1985 showed a very different picture. Quek failed to update counsel on the correct state of affairs. The paid-up capital was $254,002. The retained profit was $429,013. The profit for the year was $76,422 before tax and $8,982 after tax. Their main assets were in the form of an office unit and some apartment units with a book value of $2,504,442 and quoted shares with a value of $1,093,279. However, after deducting actual liabilities, the company had net assets of $688,335 which did not include contingent liabilities in respect of a letter of credit amounting to $3,295,170. The nature of these contingent liabilities was not disclosed in the accounts.
Having regard to the amount of BNI`s claim, Amixco could not be said to be a company in good financial standing to be able to meet a judgment for the amount claimed by BNI.
In the circumstances, we were satisfied that there was a real risk of Amixco dissipating their assets to avoid satisfying BNI`s judgment.
The appeal of Amixco was accordingly dismissed with costs.

The appellant was convicted and sentenced to death by the High Court on the following charge: 
 
You, Lim Ah Poh, are charged that you, on or about 14 March 1988 between 3.10pm and 3.30pm in Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) to wit, by transporting three plastic packets containing not less than 220.62g of diamorphine from Stagmont Ring to the slip road joining the Pan Island Expressway to the traffic junction at Upper Serangoon Road in motor car AR 4599, without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(a) punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (`the Act`).
 
 
 
The appellant appealed. We dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons.
The appellant lived in Bukit Mertajam, Penang. For a number of years he worked as a bus driver plying between Butterworth and Singapore many times a month. In Singapore he came to know Chua Kee Wee, Lee Joon Seng and his son Lee Cheng Hock. Chua Kee Wee was a motor mechanic. Lee Cheng Hock lived at Lorong Kebasi, off Stagmont Ring, in a house that adjoined a temple, which he was in charge of and at which he was a medium. He was 17 years old at the time of his arrest in 1988.
The evidence of the appellant was that on 11 March 1988, he left Butterworth in his car, AR4599, and travelled to Singapore in it with his wife, two younger sisters, his youngest son and his nephew. They arrived in Singapore on 12 March 1988 and checked into the Lion City Hotel, where they all shared one room.
The following facts adduced by the prosecution were not disputed by the appellant and Lee Cheng Hock. On 14 March 1988, a party of CNB officers headed by Senior Narcotics Officer Lim Chei Yoo kept surveillance from 4.30am over motor car AR4599 which was parked in the car park of Lion City Hotel. At about 1.10pm, the appellant, with his family and Chua Kee Wee drove off in the car to Defu Lane 10 where it stopped. Chua Kee Wee left the car. About ten minutes later, Chua Kee Wee drove off in a pick-up and the appellant left Defu Lane 10 following the pick-up driven by Chua Kee Wee. The appellant`s car was trailed by the CNB officers up to Stagmont Ring. The appellant`s car parted company with the pick-up somewhere near Lorong Kebasi.
At about 3.10pm the appellant`s car was seen leaving Stagmont Ring by three CNB officers who were at the Caltex petrol station along Woodlands Road. The CNB officers resumed their surveillance and trailed the appellant`s car. The car eventually proceeded along the Pan Island Expressway heading towards Changi Airport. When the car approached the flyover near Upper Serangoon Road, it swerved suddenly and took the left-hand exit off the expressway. The car came to a stop behind several other vehicles at a traffic light. The CNB officers, believing that their surveillance had been spotted, rushed to the car and arrested the appellant who was driving the car, and Lee Cheng Hock, who was the front-seat passenger and the other three adult passengers. The boot of the car was opened. Inside the boot there was a board which divided the boot into two compartments; one exposed to view and the other concealed behind the board. When the board was removed, a large red plastic bag, containing four ordinary cardboard tissue boxes, was recovered. One tissue box was empty and three were found to contain a packet of heroin each, two of these wrapped in newspaper, inside the tissue box. The net weight of the heroin was 220.62g and its street value was later estimated at $258,980. From the dashboard in front of the driver`s seat the CNB officers recovered a red packet containing a 7cm-long straw of heroin and a S$1 note.
The appellant was charged jointly with Lee Cheng Hock on a charge of trafficking in the heroin in furtherance of their common intention.
At the close of the defence, the court decided that the prosecution had not established common intention and was doubtful whether Lee Cheng Hock was in possession of the heroin whilst he was in the car. The court directed the DPP to amend the charge. The charge against the appellant was amended to the one which we have set out earlier.
The appellant claimed trial on the amended charge, and was convicted and sentenced to suffer the mandatory death penalty, having declined the opportunity of recalling witnesses.
Being the owner of the vehicle No AR4599 and the person in charge of it at the time the heroin was discovered inside it, s 21 of the Act caused the presumption to arise that the appellant was in possession of the heroin. Once that presumption of possession arose, the appellant by virtue of s 17 of the Act was presumed to have had, until the contrary was proved, the heroin in his possession for the purpose of trafficking therein. Accordingly, the appellant had the burden of proving, on a balance of probabilities, that he was not in fact trafficking.
The evidence which the appellant gave in court was that on the evening of 12 March 1988, he went first to Jurong East to look for Lee Joon Seng. He then went to Lorong Kebasi to look for Lee Cheng Hock at the temple, to pray and to get a talisman. He asked Lee Cheng Hock for something to smoke. He had intended to ask for opium pellets but Lee Cheng Hock gave him a small packet of heroin. Lee Cheng Hock asked him if he knew anyone who wanted such a thing. Lee Cheng Hock then handed him a pager and told him to give the pager number to Chua Kee Wee so that Chua Kee Wee could reach him. Lee Cheng Hock also told him that Chua Kee Wee`s friend had left something at his place.
That evening he went to Chua Kee Wee`s house at Frankel Avenue but Chua Kee Wee was not there. He left his pager number with Chua Kee Wee`s friend. The next day, on 13 March 1988, Chua Kee Wee paged for him and he spoke to Chua Kee Wee over the telephone. Chua Kee Wee then visited him at the hotel later that morning. Upon arrival, Chua Kee Wee told him that his friend had left something at Lee Cheng Hock`s place and asked him to go and fetch Lee Cheng Hock but he refused. Chua Kee Wee then left saying that he would come again the next day.
On 14 March 1988, Chua Kee Wee came to the hotel to see him. Chua Kee Wee told him that he wanted to go to Lee Cheng Hock`s place to collect something and asked to borrow his car for that purpose. When he told Chua Kee Wee that he wanted to bring his wife and step-sisters to worship at the temple, Chua Kee Wee asked for a lift. The two of them then went to a Chinese emporium next to the hotel where he bought a bottle of Chinese wine and Chua Kee Wee bought five boxes of tissue paper.
They then drove to Defu Lane 10, where Chua Kee Wee had his workshop. Chua Kee Wee alighted, leaving the boxes of tissue in the car. He asked Chua Kee Wee why he did not take the five boxes of tissue with him. Chua Kee Wee said that he would lead the way to the temple and that he wanted him to hand the five boxes of tissue to Lee Cheng Hock.
Chua Kee Wee then drove off in a pick-up whilst he followed in his car in which the five boxes of tissue remained. Whilst following the pick-up, he realized that Chua Kee Wee was taking a circuitous route. When they reached a traffic light near Lorong Kebasi, he overtook the pick-up and arrived at Lee Cheng Hock`s house. By then the pick-up was not in sight and he did not know what happened to the pick-up after that.
When he arrived, Lee Cheng Hock was then with a friend. He told Lee Cheng Hock that Chua Kee Wee had asked him to hand over the boxes of tissue and that he had taken one box for his own use. He gave the four boxes of tissue to Lee Cheng Hock and went to the temple to pray. Whilst he was in the temple, he saw Lee Cheng Hock walking in and out and then speaking on the telephone. When he was about to leave, Lee Cheng Hock, who was then carrying the four boxes of tissue, said that he wanted to go along to look for a person called Chua Kee Wee and a friend. Lee Cheng Hock placed the four boxes of tissue in the boot of the car on the board which was lying flat in the boot. Lee Cheng Hock then lifted the board so that the boxes became concealed behind the upright board. Lee Cheng Hock sat in the front passenger seat and showed the way. Just before reaching the scene of their arrest, Lee Cheng Hock told him to take the lower road. He made a turn to the left and came to a stop at the traffic light junction. Soon after, he was arrested, handcuffed, and brought to the boot of the car and the boot was opened.
There were material conflicts in the evidence of the appellant and Lee Cheng Hock. The appellant`s contention was that he was never in possession of the heroin in the first place because he never knew it existed. He had given the four boxes of tissue to Lee Cheng Hock on Chua Kee Wee`s instruction before going to pray at the temple. Then all he did was to give a lift, on request, to Lee Cheng Hock whom he hardly knew, being much better acquainted with Lee Cheng Hock`s father, Lee Joon Seng, who was of the same age group as himself. It was Lee Cheng Hock who stowed the plastic bag containing the tissue boxes in the boot of the car. He himself did not know the tissue boxes contained heroin until after he was arrested. He alleged that the heroin belonged to Lee Cheng Hock.
Lee Cheng Hock, however, alleged that the heroin belonged to the appellant. His evidence was that he had known the appellant for about one year prior to his arrest. The appellant used to come to the temple to pray and would on occasions give him sums of $20 to $30 to supplement his irregular income. He looked upon the appellant as an uncle. In November 1987, the appellant came to his house with two other persons. The appellant carried a plastic bag which he wanted to leave with him. He asked what it was but the appellant told him there was no need to ask and promised to pay him $1,000 if he kept it for him. He agreed. The appellant told him to keep the bag outside the house. After the appellant left, he opened the bag to have a look inside and saw three packets wrapped in newspaper. He squeezed one of the packets and found that it was hard and gave a little. He thought they might be jewellery. He then kept the bag in a disused washing machine at the back of his house. Thereafter the appellant returned on a number of occasions and checked the washing machine to ensure that the bag was still there and gave him amounts from $30 to $60 on each visit.
On 12 March 1988, the appellant visited him again whilst he was with three friends. The appellant asked him for loan of a pager because he had to communicate with his friends for business purposes. He borrowed a pager from a friend Ho Eng Koon and lent it to the appellant. Lee Cheng Hock disputed the appellant`s evidence on this meeting. He denied that he gave the appellant a small packet of heroin; he denied that he told the appellant to give the pager number to Chua Kee Wee, that Chua Kee Wee`s friend had kept something in his house, or that he had some drugs to dispose of.
On the afternoon of 14 March 1988, the appellant came to his house in a car with three women and two children. The appellant was carrying a red plastic bag and asked for the return of his bag. He brought the appellant to the washing machine, took out the bag and handed it to the appellant. The appellant took out three or four boxes of tissue paper from the red plastic bag. The appellant opened the newspaper wrapping of the three packets which had been stored in the washing machine. The appellant took out the tissue paper from the boxes and placed them on the top and bottom of the three packets and told him to place one packet in one tissue box. When he asked the appellant what were in the packets he was told that it was medicine. The boxes were replaced in the red plastic bag and carried by the appellant to his car and placed in the boot. The appellant said he was going to Katong to look for a friend and asked him to show the way to the highway. Before they set off, the appellant made a telephone call from the house. Along the way as they were approaching a road that turned off the highway, he told the appellant to go on to that road. After they had turned left into the road, the car stopped at a traffic light and they were arrested.
The prosecution adduced evidence on what the appellant said to SNO Lim Chei Yoo when the plastic bag was recovered. SNO Lim Chei Yoo`s evidence was that after the two accused were arrested, they were brought to the boot of the car. When he saw the plastic bag containing four tissue boxes, he asked the appellant what that was to which the appellant replied that a friend gave it to him. He asked who the friend was and the appellant said it was Ah Seng from Penang. His evidence was confirmed by Narcotics Officer Lee Kiong Lock, who was also at the scene, as well as Lee Cheng Hock. When questioned about the red packet containing a straw of heroin, the appellant said it was for his own consumption.
After their arrest, both the appellant and Lee Cheng Hock made statements to CNB officers. The appellant made two statements on 14 March and 17 March 1988. Lee Cheng Hock made three statements on 14, 17 and 18 March 1988.
At the trial the appellant did not dispute the admissibility of his statement of 14 March 1988. He challenged the admissibility of his statement of 17 March but it was admitted after a trial-within-a-trial. Lee Cheng Hock did not dispute the admissibility of his three statements. In his statement of 14 March 1988, the appellant alleged that Lee Cheng Hock gave him a plastic bag at the temple and that he placed it in the boot of the car. He was returning to the Lion City Hotel and Lee Cheng Hock asked for a lift and got into the car. Lee Cheng Hock was directing the way when they were arrested.
In his statement of 17 March 1988, the appellant stated, inter alia, that: 
 
 
(i) On 12 March 1988, in the evening, he went to Lee Cheng Hock`s house at Lorong Kebasi. He borrowed a pager from Lee Cheng Hock. Lee Cheng Hock informed him that he had some drugs to dispose of and told him to wait for his telephone call. 
 
(ii) On 13 March 1988, one Ah Ho accompanied by Chua Kee Wee visited him at the Lion City Hotel. Ah Ho told him that Lee Cheng Hock had asked him to see him. Ah Ho asked him whether he could introduce him to an opium supplier. He promised to try to do so and gave Ah Ho his telephone number in Penang. 
 
(iii) Chua Kee Wee came to the hotel on 14 March 1988 and asked to use his car to collect drugs from Lee Cheng Hock. He declined as his wife and step-sisters would also be going to the temple to pray. He told Chua Kee Wee to find a car himself and they could go to Lee Cheng Hock`s house together. 
 
(iv) He and Chua Kee Wee then went to a supermarket beside the hotel where Chua Kee Wee bought five boxes of tissue and he bought a bottle of Chinese wine. 
 
(v) They then all got into his car and Chua Kee Wee directed him to a place (established to be Defu Lane 10). There Chua Kee Wee told him to hand four of the five boxes of tissue to Lee Cheng Hock and left the car. Later he saw Chua Kee Wee driving a pick-up and he followed it in his car. At the traffic light at about 7 milestone, Bukit Timah Road, he overtook the pick-up. 
 
(vi) When he arrived at Lee Cheng Hock`s house, he handed the four boxes of tissue which were in a pink plastic bag to Lee Cheng Hock, who placed drugs into three of the four boxes. He told Lee Cheng Hock that he was returning to the hotel and that Chua Kee Wee was on the way to the house to collect the drugs. 
 
(vii) Lee Cheng Hock asked him to place the plastic bag with the four boxes of tissue in the boot of his car and to conceal it behind the board. Lee Cheng Hock also asked for a lift to the Lion City Hotel `so that he could take a taxi from there to go somewhere with the drugs`. 
 
(viii) When they were arrested and brought to the boot of the car, an officer questioned him on the contents of the boot, but he did not reply as he was in a daze. 
 
(ix) A red packet containing a straw of heroin that was recovered from the car had been given to him by Lee Cheng Hock to be used as a sample to potential buyers.
  
 
 
The appellant`s testimony differed from the statements he made to the CNB officers, from Lee Cheng Hock`s evidence, from the evidence of the CNB officers and from the other witnesses called by Lee Cheng Hock. Chua Kee Wee, called by the appellant as his witness, contradicted the appellant`s evidence in material aspects as to the events of 14 March 1988. When examined by his counsel on his statement of 17 March 1988, he retracted portions of it.
The trial judges said [at p 95]: 
 
These were not the only contradictions in the first accused`s evidence. He was inconsistent throughout a large part of his cross-examination. Care was taken to ensure that he understood the questions put to him and he was reminded of his earlier evidence, but he remained a difficult and unsatisfactory witness.
 
 
 
On the evidence, the trial judges rejected the appellant`s contention that the heroin belonged to Lee Cheng Hock. They accepted the evidence of SNO Lim Chei Yoo, NO Lee Kiong Lock and Lee Cheng Hock that when the tissue boxes were discovered and the appellant was questioned, he said that the boxes were given to him by a friend Ah Seng from Penang. They accepted the evidence of Lee Cheng Hock that the heroin was handed to him by the appellant.
The trial judges said [at p 99]: 
 
On the totality of the evidence, we found the first accused to be unworthy of belief. His evidence was confusing and inconsistent, and he often was either unable or unwilling to answer directly to questions. What he said in his statements, in evidence-in-chief and under cross-examination were at variance.
 
 
 
The trial judges concluded [at p 99]: 
 
After considering all the evidence, we found that the first accused was in possession of the drugs recovered from the boot of the car and that he had not on a balance of probabilities rebutted the presumption that he was in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking.
 
 
 
The main ground of appeal was that the trial judges erred in finding that the appellant had failed, on the balance of probabilities, to rebut the presumption that he was in possession of the heroin for the purpose of trafficking.
The main argument of counsel for the appellant was that the trial judges were wrong in rejecting the evidence of the appellant and accepting the evidence of Lee Cheng Hock.
An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence, an appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges` findings and their reasons therefor. In the present case we were satisfied that the trial judges` conclusions of fact were right. It was plain to us that the trial judges were entitled to come to the conclusions they arrived at. We saw no reason to disturb the findings of the trial judges and we unanimously dismissed the appeal.

 The first appellant
 
The appellants pleaded guilty. The first appellant was given: 
 
 
(a) DAC 10272/90 - four years` imprisonment 
 
P1A and 12 strokes of caning. 
 
(b) DAC 10564/90 - four years` imprisonment and 
 
P3 12 strokes of caning 
 
(c) DAC 10566/90 - six years` imprisonment and 
 
P5 12 strokes of caning 
 
(d) DAC 10567/90 - four years` imprisonment and 
 
P6 12 strokes of caning
  
 
 
The court ordered the sentences of imprisonment in DAC 10272/90 and DAC 10566/90 to run consecutively as required by s 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`). The other sentences were to run concurrently. The first appellant, who was 26 years of age would have had to serve ten years` imprisonment and suffer 24 strokes of the cane.
 The second appellant
The second appellant was given: 
 
 
(a) DAC 10272/90 - three years` imprisonment plus
  
 
 
P1A
12 strokes of caning
(b)
DAC 10564/90
-
three years` imprisonment plus
P3
12 strokes of caning
(c)
DAC 10566/90
-
five years` imprisonment plus
P5
12 strokes of caning
(d)
DAC 10567/90
-
three years` imprisonment plus
P6
12 strokes of caning
The sentences of imprisonment in DAC 10272/90 and DAC 10566/90 were to run consecutively and the others to run concurrently. The second appellant who was also 26 years of age would have had to serve eight years` imprisonment and suffer 24 strokes of the cane. The longest term of imprisonment was in the case of both the appellants ordered to run consecutively to comply with s 18 of the CPC which requires the sentencing court to order at least two offences to run consecutively where at one trial a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least three distinct offences. The appellants were charged with offences for which there is prescribed a minimum term of imprisonment and minimum strokes of the cane.
The facts in respect of the first charge are that on 23 September 1990 at about 1.20am, the complainant, upon parking his car in his car park and alighting therefrom, was held by both the appellants, who were then armed with fruit knives with blades measuring 15cm in length. The two appellants ordered the complainant into the rear seat where one of them kept him pinned down while the other (the second appellant) drove them away in the complainant`s car. Along the way, the complainant was relieved of cash and valuables. They also forced the complainant to reveal to them his personal identification number (`PIN`) with which his ATM card could be used to operate his account.
At a secluded spot off Tampines Road, they ordered the complainant out of his car. They gave him $10 as taxi fare for him to go home and then drove off in his car. The complainant telephoned the police from a nearby house and reported the incident. Police patrol cars were alerted. The appellants were spotted along Paya Lebar Road by a patrol car which trailed them to Lorong 11, Geylang, where they were intercepted and then arrested after a short chase. The items robbed from the complainant were recovered from both the appellants, including the knives used by them in the robbery. The appellants were looking for an OUB automatic teller machine from which to withdraw money from the complainant by using his PIN when they were spotted by the patrol car. The appellants were charged with committing robbery under ss 392 and 397 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Code`). They were also charged with abducting the complainant, an offence under s 365 of the Code. The offences were committed in the same transaction.
The facts in respect of the second, third and fourth charges refer to offences which are adequately set out in the charges.
Both the appellants were represented by counsel before the learned senior district judge. Counsel made four main points, the first being that the appellants were forced to commit the offences as they had been under pressure from bookies and loan sharks to whom they had become heavily indebted from losses incurred in betting on horse racing. The second point was that both the appellants had co-operated with and made frank admissions to the police of their other past offences. The third point urged before the learned senior district judge was the fact that both the appellants had decided to plead guilty to the charges that were preferred against them. The fourth point was that both the appellants did not have any record of previous convictions for offences of a similar kind as those alleged in the charges before the court. The appellants gave their consent to take into consideration outstanding offences and admitted committing the offences.
 The appeal
The decision of the learned senior district judge was attacked by counsel for the appellants in a number of ways which can be summarized as follows: 
 
 
(a) that the learned judge rejected the mitigation plea made in respect of financial harassment without considering its merits. The judicial mind was closed to a mitigating factor; 
 
(b) that the learned judge failed to appreciate the worth of the co-operation the appellants had given to the police and its significance; 
 
(c) that the fact that the appellants were caught red-handed in respect of one offence was regarded as if the appellants had been caught red-handed in respect of all the offences to which the appellants had pleaded guilty and the offences they had admitted for purposes of determining sentence; 
 
(d) that the learned judge had made reference to a defect in character unsupported by the evidence; and 
 
(e) that the totality of the sentence was not sufficiently considered when the need for a deterrent sentence was considered having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case.
  
 
 
 
 Financial difficulties
 
The prosecution in its statement of facts stated: `Investigation revealed that on 23 September 1990 at about 1am, both the accused persons decided to commit robbery after having lost in gambling.`
The judgment on the question of pressure from the bookies put forward as a mitigating factor is in the following terms: 
 
In mitigation, the learned counsel for both the accused informed the court to the effect that his clients had had no alternative but to commit the offences in question as they had been under pressure from bookies and loan sharks to whom they had become heavily indebted from losses incurred in betting on horse-racing. In my view, if those were indeed the instructions received from both the accused they would have been better left unsaid, since they hardly provided anything that could be considered as being mitigatory of what they had committed.
 
 
 
It was submitted that it is not unusual for persons in debt to be constantly harassed and threatened by bookies and loan sharks for the return of money. The learned judge rejected the mitigation plea without considering whether it had merits. The sentence was accordingly manifestly excessive.
The learned senior district judge`s view that the instructions given to counsel would have been better left unsaid, since they hardly provided anything that could be mitigatory suggests sufficient consideration was not given before the fact was rejected. I am not satisfied that there was an open mind when the sentencing judge assessed this factor. The robbery took place at 1.20am after the appellants lost their money at 1am. Financial difficulties, where present before the commission of an offence, may be considered in mitigation of a sentence but it is not likely to have much effect if the offence committed is a serious offence. It may, as in this case, have counted for nothing, but it should have been considered.
 Co-operation
The appellants pleaded guilty to four charges and told the police of other offences that they had committed. The judgment of the court was that the admissions to the other offences `could have been just as much by dint of the police investigations into those offences that they were solved, and not necessarily solely because the accused had admitted to them`.
The evidence before the court was that the appellants had admitted the offences and made frank admissions to the police. Having found that in admitting the offences the appellants showed remorse and that the police had been assisted by the information provided, the judge should have asked the question whether it was a proper case to reward the appellants with a lighter sentence. The question was not asked nor were the offenders rewarded. The admissions made showed that the appellants had a change of heart. The judge, however, has left the impression that he approached the question of sentencing as if the appellants had been caught red-handed in respect of all the offences.
 Guilty pleas
The Supreme Court of India in 
Mohd Akhtar Hussain alias Ibrahim Ahmed Bhatti v Assistant Collector of Customs
 
[1988] SC 2143
 said: 
 
Generally, it is both proper and customary for courts to give credit to an accused for pleading guilty to the charge. But no credit need be given if the plea of guilty in the circumstance is inevitable or the accused has no alternative but to plead guilty, the accused being caught red-handed is one such instance.
 
 
 
... But the second case under the Customs Act was not of that type. Here the prosecution has to prove many things. ... The appellant, however, pleaded guilty perhaps on legal advice. He must have been told that some credit for such plea would be given by the court and if the credit is not given and the maximum sentence is awarded the appellant is surely entitled to complain for giving the maximum sentence.
A plea of guilty is usually given credit. In 
Peter Tham Wing Fai v PP
 
 
[1989] 2 MLJ 404
  the court said that the discount for a plea of guilty should be substantial in a case where the accused was arrested after considerable investigations had been carried out. The rule is not an inflexible rule but a discount is given to an accused person who pleads guilty even when he pleads guilty after considerable police investigations. The appellants were not given any discount. The trial judge properly gave credit to the police. He, however, failed to give a discount to the appellants for having admitted to all the offences they had committed and pleaded guilty where public interest did not require the discount to the denied the appellants. Where the legislature has prescribed a minimum sentence, it limits the discretionary powers of the court. It serves as a starting point, but it may also in a proper case serve as the sentence that will best serve the public interest where a minimum term of imprisonment is coupled with minimum number of strokes of the cane and little or no violence has been used.
 Character
The first appellant had a previous conviction for an offence under s 147 of the Penal Code committed in 1988. He was sentenced to six months` imprisonment, and for an offence under s 148 of the Code for rioting, for six months to run consecutively with the earlier sentence. The learned senior district judge assessing sentence said: 
 
Although both the accused did not have any record of previous convictions for offences of a similar kind as those alleged in the charges before the court, the first accused did have a record which included two convictions for offences under the Penal Code involving violence. ...
 
 
 
Those convictions, as well as the facts relating to the present first, second and third charges, would establish that between himself and the second accused he was imbued with more of the propensity and readiness to use violence.
The appellants in the first charge were armed with kitchen knives. No violence was used. In the second charge, they were armed with pen knives. No violence was used. The third charge makes no reference to a weapon but the appellants admitted to being armed with kitchen knives.
When the complainant put up a struggle, the knife was used by the first appellant and the complainant received a cut wound on his right arm. He had no other injuries. The cut was a 2cm-long superficial laceration on the posterior aspect of the right forearm.
The fact that both appellants did not have any record of previous convictions for offences of a similar kind was acknowledged, but the learned senior district judge relied on the convictions and the facts relating to the first, second and third charges to find that the first appellant `was imbued with more of the propensity and readiness to use violence`.
The judge in finding that between both the appellants, the first appellant `was imbued with more of the propensity and readiness to use violence` has referred to an alleged defect in his character which appears to have affected his assessment of the sentence. It is controversial. An attributed propensity is irrelevant. The second appellant`s assessment of sentence was considered in the context of the past convictions and violence of the first appellant.
In 
Goh Bok Seng v PP
 
 
[1965] 2 MLJ 66
  the appellant was convicted on his own plea of guilty of rioting under s 148 of the Penal Code (Cap 119). After he had pleaded for leniency in mitigation, the prosecutor informed the magistrate that although he had no previous conviction, he was a fighter in a secret society. He was sentenced to four months` imprisonment. On appeal, the then learned Chief Justice said [at p 67]: 
 
The only thing that has troubled me of course is the fact that after he had appealed for leniency in mitigation the prosecutor would have appeared to inform the magistrate that although he had no previous conviction he was a fighter in a secret society. That to my mind is entirely irrelevant in so far as sentence is concerned and in his grounds of decision the learned magistrate has referred to that alleged defect in his character and it would appear to have affected him in his assessment of the sentence to be imposed.
 
 
 
The then learned Chief Justice allowed the appeal and reduced imprisonment from four months to three months.
In 
 PP v Jafa bin Dau 
 
d
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 315
  the court said [at p 316]: 
 
Where the convicted person has previous records and admits them as correct, the court must consider whether the offence or offences committed previously were of similar nature as the one with which he is presently charged. The court must then consider the sentences imposed in the previous convictions for similar offences to determine whether they have had any deterrent effect on him. Where he is found to be a persistent offender for a similar type of offences, then it is in the interest of justice that a deterrent sentence should be passed ... 
 Deterrence
 
 
 
The trial judge in this case having found that both accused did not have a record of previous convictions for offences of a similar kind, proceeded to treat the offences as if they were of a similar nature by reference to the Code for purposes of imposing a deterrent sentence. The trial judge said: 
 
The purpose of such punishments would be, of course, to punish and, on a wider scale, to deter the offender from repeating those offences and other prospective offenders from actually making their debut in that field. At the same time law-abiding members of the public should have the right to expect realistic punishments against perpetrators of such crimes, in appropriate cases, if nothing more than because they can thereby - because of the deterrence of the punishments - feel assured of their safety whenever they step out of their homes at any time to go to the neighbourhood store or elsewhere.
 
 
 
The submission was that the judge disregarded public interest which is best served when punishments meted out induce offenders to turn from criminal ways to honest living. The appellant and co-accused had committed 14 and 12 offences respectively involving $20,240 of which $11,145 was recovered.
 Schedule of offences
There is one other matter that must be addressed. When the matter came up for hearing on 1 December 1990, the prosecution produced 17 charges, the application of the Attorney General under s 7(2)(a) of the CPC applying for the offences to be tried in any district court and the consents of the accused to be tried in any district court. The consent of the first appellant is in the following terms. It is signed by him:

Exhibit D was the consent of the second appellant which is in similar terms. Exhibit E was the schedule of offences which does not carry any signatures. It does not state that a copy was served on the accused persons. It was placed before the court before the accused were found guilty or had pleaded guilty. The offences that would be taken into consideration and the offences which had to be tried were distinguished by the remarks `proceed` against the four charges and `TIC` against the others.
The observations on the procedure that is followed in England when taking offences into consideration made by Scarman LJ in 
 R v Walsh 
 5 where it is a conventional practice and not by statute as it is in Singapore should be observed subject to our statutory provisions: 
 
... It is essential that, if this practice is to continue, both the court and the accused man should understand perfectly clearly what it is that they are agreeing to do. The practice is beneficial to the administration of justice and beneficial to the accused man personally. It is beneficial to the administration of justice in that it enables a number of matters which might otherwise have to come to trial to be taken into consideration in a proper case when a man is being sentenced. In fact it removes a work load from the overburdened system of administration of criminal justice. It is of great benefit to the accused man, because it means as a matter of agreement that after the sentence he will be able to face life freed of the threat of punishment for the offences that have been taken into consideration at his request.
 
 
 
Since the matter is essentially one of tacit agreement ... it is essential that those administering justice, both the police in the pre-trial stage and the court at the trial stage, should ensure that the accused man understands what is being done, admits the offences and wishes to have each and every one of them taken into consideration. ... it may be of some value to see what are the safeguards that both police and courts can adopt ...
First of all, the police have to prepare the list or the schedule which has to be served upon an accused person. If it is known that he intends to plead guilty, this schedule can be served before arraignment, perhaps some days before the day of the trial. If he is going to plead not guilty, then it may be that such a list should not be served until after he has been found guilty. All that one can say of the standards to be observed by the police in the preparation and service of the list is that they should exercise meticulous care in the preparation of the list and they should ensure that when the list is given to him, his signature is obtained and in so far as it is within the power of the police to ensure it, they should ensure that he gets an opportunity of studying the list before he signs it, and certainly, of course, before he has to deal with it in court.
But ensuring that he gets the list well before he has to face the court on a plea of guilty is not as easy in practice as it is easy to describe. When the matter is dealt with in court, it will seem to be the best practice that the police officer responsible for serving the list should be called to say that it was served and that he had the document signed by the accused man. But in any event, it is the court`s responsibility at this stage to ensure that the accused man, who after all in this matter is acting in concert and agreement with the court, understands the document that he has received, and has a proper opportunity, which means time, to consider the document; if necessary, time can be given by adjournment. Before proceeding to sentence, the court must be clear that not only that he understands the document that it has received and has had time to study it, but that he accepts that the listed offences are offences which he has committed and that he desires them to be taken into consideration. If this conventional practice is to continue to the benefit of the administration of justice and to the benefit of accused person, the burden is on the court, and to a lesser extent on the police, to ensure that the man has a full opportunity of understanding what he is being asked to accept. If that is done, then the practice is of benefit to all concerned.
Section 178 of the CPC requires the accused to be found guilty before the consent of the prosecutor and the accused will enable the court to take into consideration outstanding offences. A schedule of offences showing offences to be taken into consideration should not be produced until after the accused had pleaded guilty and the plea accepted, or found guilty. That is the stage at which the accused makes up his mind whether he wants the other offences to be taken into consideration and should be free to decide if he no longer wishes them to be taken into account. (See 
R v Davies
 
[1980] 2 Cr App R (S) 364
 )
 Sentence
The victims were susceptible to attack. The appellants were armed. They committed a number of offences. The court must provide protection for persons regarded as easy targets. A deterrent element must be seen in the sentence imposed. The appellants in this case, however, did not belong to the big league of armed robbers. The mitigating factors: 
 
 
(a) admitting offences committed where it would have been difficult to prove had there been no admission; 
 
(b) pleading guilty to the four charges; 
 
(c) consenting to be tried by the district court; 
 
(d) absence of previous convictions for offences of a similar nature; and 
 
(e) the age of the offenders and the single instance of a minor injury were matters which the court in this case should have put on the other side of the scale when determining the correct sentence. Controversial facts about character should not be taken into consideration in the matter of sentencing (see 
Lian Kian Boon v PP
 
 
[1991] 1 MLJ 51
  ), and matters pleaded in mitigation should be heard with an open mind when assessing sentence and not on the basis of what is better said and left unsaid.
  
 
 
At the end of the day, the question was simply whether the totality of the sentence was excessive and whether there had been a failure of justice. I was satisfied that this was a proper case where I should interfere with the sentences imposed. The totality of the sentences had to be reduced. I therefore allowed the appeal and reduced the sentences as follows:
 First appellant: Lim Kim Seng
 
 
(a) Sentence on the first charge (DAC 10272/90) reduced to mandatory three years` imprisonment and 12 strokes. 
 
(b) Sentence on the second charge (DAC 10564/90) reduced to mandatory three years` imprisonment and 12 strokes. 
 
(c) Sentence on the third charge (DAC 10566/90) reduced to mandatory five years and 12 strokes. 
 
(d) Sentence on the fourth charge (DAC 10567/90) reduced to mandatory three years` imprisonment and 12 strokes. 
 
(e) Sentences on first and third charges to be consecutive. 
 
(f) Sentences on second and fourth charges to run concurrently. 
 
Total: Eight years` imprisonment and 24 strokes.
  
 
 
 
 Second appellant: Lim Yew Boo
 
 
 
(a) Sentence on the first charge (DAC 10272/90) reduced to mandatory three years` imprisonment and 12 strokes. 
 
(b) Sentence on the second charge (DAC 10564/90) reduced to mandatory three years` imprisonment and 12 strokes. 
 
(c) Sentence on the third charge (DAC 10566/90) reduced to mandatory five years and 12 strokes. 
 
(d) Sentence on the fourth charge (DAC 10567/90) reduced to mandatory three years` imprisonment and 12 strokes. 
 
(e) Sentences on first and second charges to be consecutive. 
 
(f) Sentences on the third and fourth charges to run concurrently. 
 
Total: Six years` imprisonment and 24 strokes.
  
 
 
The first appellant will now serve a total of eight years` imprisonment and receive 24 strokes of the cane. The second appellant will serve a total of six years` imprisonment and suffer 24 strokes of the cane. The punishments are realistic and should deter the appellants without destroying their will to profit from the rehabilitative services provided in prison and turn to honest living on their release from prison. The sentence is a deterrent sentence specifically and generally.

This case is not without its difficulties, whichever of the views expressed either by Mr Govind for the appellant or by Mr Chua for the public prosecutor are accepted as being correct. Despite anomalous situations that can arise in some extreme cases in either of the two views, I apprehend that the view that I am about to express is the correct one.
The appellant was born on 21 June 1972. He was charged with an offence under s 326 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), an offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, alleged to have been committed on 6 November 1987, that is to say when he was just short of 15 years and 5 months old. He was duly taken before the juvenile court on 8 December 1987 and formally charged with the offence to which he claimed trial. On the date he was formally charged in the juvenile court and claimed trial, he was still under 16 years of age.
For one reason or another, which is not material to the question I have to decide, the charge against the appellant was neither tried in the juvenile court nor in any other court of summary jurisdiction. Suffice it to say that when both the prosecution and the appellant were ready for trial, around October 1988, the appellant was already over the age of 16 years, having reached that age on 21 June 1988. The presiding magistrate in the juvenile court at that time was of the view that the juvenile court would not have jurisdiction to try an accused who was over the age of 16, and therefore transferred the case to the district court where the case was fixed for hearing on 23 and 24 February 1989.
Again for reasons which are not material, the district court did not hear the case until 3 June 1989, on which date after hearing submissions on the question of jurisdiction, the district judge ruled that the juvenile court had the jurisdiction to hear this case and ordered that it be transferred to that court.
Once again there was delay, and once again the reasons for the delay are not material. Not until 2 August 1990 were dates for hearing given in the juvenile court. The hearing dates were 6 to 8 March 1991, and 13 to 14 March 1991. However, the presiding magistrate in the juvenile court, not the same one as before, had the case brought forward to 1 March 1991, and informed both the prosecuting officer and defence counsel that notwithstanding the earlier ruling of the district court, against which the prosecution had not appealed, and which the presiding magistrate felt was not binding on him, he would require argument on 6 March as to whether the juvenile court could continue to exercise jurisdiction over the appellant who had now reached the age of 18 years.
On 6 March 1991, defence counsel submitted to the juvenile court that he stood by the written submission he had made to the district court and to the High Court. The reference to the High Court relates to Criminal Revision No 4 of 1989, being a petition by the appellant to the High Court on 11 March 1989 when this case was first transferred out of the juvenile court to the district court, to set aside that order or for an order that this case be tried in the juvenile court. The High Court had not ruled on the appellant`s petition but had directed that the question of the jurisdiction of the juvenile court be dealt with by the district court. The district court dealt with the matter by ruling that the juvenile court had jurisdiction and had transferred the case back to the juvenile court for hearing. I have already dealt with this earlier.
The presiding magistrate in the juvenile court then ruled that the juvenile court did not have the jurisdiction to try this case and accordingly transferred it out of the juvenile court to be heard by another court. It is against that order that this appeal is brought.
The section dealing with the jurisdiction of the juvenile court is s 48 of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38) (`the Act`). It reads: 
 
 
(1) Subject as hereinafter provided, no charge against a child or young person shall be heard by a court of summary jurisdiction which is not a Juvenile Court:
  
 
 
Provided that - 
(a) where a child or young person is charged with an offence or offences triable only by the High Court, he shall be tried by the High Court; 
(b) a charge made jointly against a child or young person and a person who has attained the age of 16 years shall be heard by a court of appropriate jurisdiction other than a Juvenile Court; or 
(c) where in the course of any proceedings before any court of appropriate jurisdiction other than a Juvenile Court, it appears that the person to whom the proceedings relate is a child or young person, nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the court, if it thinks fit to do so, from proceeding with the hearing and determination of the proceedings. 
(2) A Juvenile Court shall have jurisdiction to try all offences which, but for subsection (1), would be triable only by a Magistrate`s Court or a District Court.
 
 
 
`Young person` is defined in s 42 of the Act and reads: 
 
`Young person` means a person who, in the absence of legal proof to the contrary, is, in the opinion of the court having cognisance of any case in relation to such person, 14 years of age or upwards and under the age of 16 years.
 
 
 
Neither the definition of `young person` nor the section itself makes it clear whether for the purposes of determining jurisdiction, the age at the time when the offence is committed is to be the deciding factor. The form of words used in the section is a double negative. The intent of the section stated in positive terms is that a charge against a young person shall be heard in a juvenile court. The word `heard` has been judicially defined to mean `heard and finally disposed of`. (See 
 Re Green 
 1 per Lord Selborne at pp 39-40 and per Lord Blackburn at p 44.) Thus what the section does make clear is that a charge against a young person must be heard and finally disposed of in the juvenile court.
The only date which can be determined with any degree of certainty is the date on which an offence is committed, for when the offender will apprehended, when he will be charged, when that charge will be heard and finally disposed of are subject to many seen and unforeseen factors. The legislature could not have intended that the jurisdiction of a juvenile court is to be founded on the determination of the age of the offender by reference to some indeterminate date as would be the case if the age of the offender for the purposes of determining the jurisdiction of the juvenile court is to be based on the date of apprehension, or the date when he is charged with the offence or the date when the hearing of the charge commences in court, or the date when the hearing is concluded and he is convicted and sentenced, or any other date other than the date when the offence itself was committed. (See the opinion of Lord Diplock in 
 Re Daley 
 2 at pp 978-979.) Thus it seems reasonably clear to me that in order to determine the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, the one and only one relevant fact that has to be considered is the age of the offender at the time of the commission of the offence and no other. I am fortified in the conclusion I have reached by the provisions of the Act, particularly s 58(1), where the phrase `at the date of the commission of the alleged offence` is used. I emphasize the word `commission` in that phrase. Section 58(1) of the Act reads: 
 
Where, in a charge for an offence triable under this Act, it is alleged that the person by whom the offence was committed was under or had attained any specified age, and he appears to the Court to have been at the date of the commission of the alleged offence under or to have attained the specified age, as the case may be, he shall for the purposes of this Act be presumed at that date to have been under or to have attained that age, as the case may be, and any order made therein shall not be invalidated by any subsequent proof that the age has been incorrectly stated.
 
 
 
No doubt the subsection raises the presumption that the age of the offender alleged in the charge shall be taken to be the age of the offender even if it should subsequently be proved that the age has been wrongly stated and that thereby the proceedings shall not be invalidated but the crucial effect of this subsection, in my view, is that the age that is to be considered is the age `at the date of the commission (and here again I emphasize the word `commission`) of the alleged offence`. This to my mind is as clear an indication as any of the legislative intent, that it is the age of the offender at the date of the commission of the alleged offence and no other that shall determine the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.
I find further support for the conclusion I have reached in s 55(1) of the Act which provides that any court before which a child or young person is found guilty of an offence shall have the power to remit the case to the juvenile court, and when so remitted, the juvenile court may deal with him in any manner in which he might have been dealt with if he had been tried and found guilty in that court. This subsection again clearly indicates that the relevant age is the age at the time of the commission of the offence.
Sections 59, 60, 105 and 106 of the Act, which I do not propose to deal with but mention only in passing, also lend weight to the conclusion I have reached. I will also note that Kan Ting Chiu JC had occasion recently to consider the same question but in another context in Criminal Case No 5 of 1990. In that case Kan Ting Chiu JC was considering the matter from the sentencing aspect of a young person who was tried with an adult of an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). In his grounds of decision delivered on 12 July 1991, he came to the same conclusion as I have. I respectfully agree with him.
As I said in the beginning in this judgment, whatever or whichever view that has been canvassed before this court is accepted, we are bound with having to face up with anomalous situations but I feel that the view that I have expressed in this judgment is the correct view. I would therefore allow this appeal.
I set aside the order of the magistrate and direct that this case be tried in the juvenile court.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This is an action for damages for libel. The defendants do not dispute that the published statement is defamatory and untrue, but they allege that the publication took place on an occasion protected by qualified privilege and they deny that it was made with malice. I shall therefore move directly to consider the circumstances of the publication.
 The facts
The background to this action is the construction of the Mass Rapid Transit (`MRT`) system in Singapore. The MRT Corp had awarded the City Hall Station and Operation Control Centre/PUB Building project (`the project`) to the Nishimatsu-Lum Chang Joint Venture (`NLC-JV`) as the main contractors. NLC-JV in turn had nominated the defendants, a Japanese engineering and construction company, as the sub-contractors for the architectural finishes works for the project.
The plaintiffs are a local company involved in the manufacture, fabrication, supply and installation of stone. In October 1985, with a view to participation in the project, the plaintiffs sent an employee, one Peter Wong, to India with representatives from NLC-JV. The purpose of the trip was to inspect the quarries of a company known as Gem Granites, Madras (`Gem Granites`). Subsequently, by a letter dated 26 December 1985, Gem Granites appointed the plaintiffs as their sole distributor in Singapore of a type of natural granite known as `Holy Brown`, which was quarried in Adoni, India.
By a letter dated 23 July 1986, the defendants as sub-contractors for the project, invited tenders from four pre-selected companies, of which the plaintiffs were one, for the supply, delivery and installation of granite slabs for the project (`the sub-contract works`). The letter stated that the tenders were to be based `on the attached tender document and drawings compliance strictly with the terms and conditions of our standard sub-contract agreement ...`. The letter further specified that: 
 
The scope of work involved in this tender shall comprise of the supply, delivery and installation of `Holy Brown` and `Rosa Limbara` to the interior/exterior floors and walls. Our proposed sizes of granite slabs are 900 [times ] 600mm and 600 [times ] 600mm with thickness of 25mm and 30mm. However, we may consider your proposal if it is more economical to use other alternative sizes/types of granite slabs.
 
 
 
The letter also stated that it was tentatively estimated that the installation should commence by the end of January 1987 and be completed by the end of May 1987. The letter further specified that the tenders were to be delivered by hand.
The material terms of the defendants` tender document were as follows: 
 
7.53.5 Obtain granite from single sources for each type as follows:
 
 
 
Type Holy Brown
 
 
 
Supplier - Gem Granite
 
 
 
Type Rosa Limbara
 
 
 
Supplier Corsi & Nicolai
 
 
 
Fabricator: Cutting and finishing to be carried out by Corsi and Nicolai
 
 
 
Confirm compliance with the specification prior to placing orders
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
7.54.1 Stainless steel anchor bolts, nuts and washers - Type 316, sizes as required, manufacturer Alpha AS SRL
 
 
 
7.58.1 Employ only operatives with a minimum of five (5) years of experience in the laying of granite. Granite installation to be supervised by an experienced representative provided by the fabricator of cut and finished units.
 
 
 
The types and sources of the granite slabs and fittings had been specified by the MRT Corp and their consent was required if different types and sources were to be used. The MRT Corp had also, in a document referred to as `Addm No 1.00 - proprietary index`, identified the plaintiffs as the local representatives of Gem Granites and of the manufacturer Alpha AS SRL. No local representative was listed in the document for the company known as Corsi & Nicolai of Italy.
For the purposes of this case, the material clause of the standard form sub-contract agreement was cl 34 which read: 
 
The sub-contractor shall, subject to any agreement between the parties, from time to time make application to the contractor for payments of the amount which at the date thereof fairly represents the sub-contractor`s value of the sub-contract works and of any variation authorized under this sub-contract then executed and of the materials and goods delivered upon the site for use in the sub-contract works ...
 
 
 
In other words, the successful tenderer would be paid by progress payments.
Under the cover of a letter dated 15 August 1986, the plaintiffs submitted a tender to supply, deliver and install the specified granite slabs for the operation control centre/PUB Building only for the sum of $4,232,235. The covering letter also stated that notwithstanding the terms of payment stated in the standard form subcontract agreement, the plaintiffs sought payment in the following manner: `On sight letters of credit equivalent to 75% of the tender sum shall be established by you in our favour upon acceptance of our tender. Balance of 25% shall be on monthly progress payment from date of installation.` The covering letter also stated that the estimated date of completion of the sub-contract works would be 22 June 1987, provided that the sub-contract be formed by 22 September 1986.
In their tender, the plaintiffs described their financial standing as having an authorized capital of $2m, half of which was paid up, and as having credit facilities of up to $4m. They also stated that their bankers were The Royal Bank of Canada and Hong Leong Finance.
The covering letter and the various tender documents were delivered to the defendants` office on 15 August 1986 by several members of the plaintiffs` company viz Peter Wong (PW1), Chong Toh Hui (PW3) and Christine Foo (PW4). These witnesses testified that they were met by one Hideichi Suyama (DW1), the person in charge of handling the tenders for the sub-contract works, and one Jacqueline Ng (DW2), his assistant. Peter Wong testified that he had a brief conversation with Suyama during which Suyama told him, in a raised voice, that the defendants were having problems with the plaintiffs over the construction of the UMNO Building in Kuala Lumpur. I digress now to consider the relevant aspects of that project.
In that project, the defendants, together with other companies, were the main contractors for the construction of the UMNO Building. They had sub-contracted part of the construction to another company called Intraco Ltd (`Intraco`) which had in turn, in August 1984 sub-contracted with the plaintiffs for the supply of marble slabs for the building. Disputes, dating from May 1985 to the time of the conversation between Peter Wong and Suyama on 15 August 1986, had arisen between Intraco and the plaintiffs over the quality and the colour of marble slabs supplied and the main contractors had eventually become involved with the negotiations towards settling the disputes. Christine Foo who had been involved in the plaintiffs` participation in the UMNO Building project, testified that the defendants had made several unreasonable demands upon the plaintiffs and had required them to replace slabs which had been damaged through no fault of the plaintiffs. She further said that despite the plaintiffs` compliance with those demands, the plaintiffs were not paid the sums due under that contract until 26 August 1989, some four years after its completion. In cross-examination, Christine Foo indicated that although the plaintiffs were not in a contractual relationship with the defendants in the UMNO project, their representatives had met at meetings and it was during such meetings that she had formed the view that the defendants bore ill-will towards the plaintiffs. She did, however, admit that she had never dealt with Suyama directly.
I now return to the conversation at the defendants` office on 15 August 1986. Peter Wong testified that Suyama had also asked if the plaintiffs were still in receivership. Peter Wong said that he denied the allegation about the receivership but said nothing in reply to Suyama`s complaints about the UMNO Building. In his view, the conversation lasted about ten minutes. In cross-examination, Peter Wong admitted that the plaintiffs and their holding company had been in some financial difficulties and that the financial troubles of the plaintiffs` holding company had been widely reported in the newspapers. Peter Wong`s account of the matter was supported by the evidence of Chong Toh Hui and Christine Foo.
Suyama`s evidence on the conversation was that he asked about the financial status of the plaintiffs as Singapore was going through a recession at the time. He said that he had heard about the plaintiffs` involvement in the construction of the UMNO Building but he had no personal involvement in it as he had left Kuala Lumpur in August 1983. He also said that he had heard rumours of the plaintiffs` holding company being in financial difficulties and that he had seen newspaper reports to the same effect. However, he could not remember if he had asked if the plaintiffs were in `receivership` or if he had mentioned the UMNO Building project. He stressed that there was no reason for him to have mentioned the UMNO project as it was of no relevance to the sub-contract works. He also denied in cross-examination that it was operating on his mind when he spoke to Peter Wong. Jacqueline Ng`s evidence was that she could not recall what was said at the meeting as it was short and nothing unusual happened, but to the best of her recollection the financial standing and the work experience of the plaintiffs were discussed.
Later, in a letter dated 21 August 1986 to the defendants, written in reply to a letter dated 18 August 1986, the plaintiffs confirmed that they would be able to commence the sub-contract works by the end of January 1987 and complete the sub-contract works by the end of May the same year, provided that a letter of credit was established in their favour by 22 September 1986. In the same letter, the plaintiffs replied to a query on their experience with similar granite works in the past five years as follows: `N/A. But enclosed is an international cladding specialist (Alpha) job reference in other parts of the world. The entire project will be managed and co-ordinated by Alpha.` The reference to Alpha was a reference to Alpha AS SRL, the manufacturer specified by the MRT Corp in cl 7.54.1 of the tender form (above).
Under the cover of a letter dated 27 August 1986, and in response to the defendant`s further invitation to tender dated 15 August 1986, the plaintiffs submitted another tender for the supply and delivery of granite slabs for the City Hall station for the sum of $2,699,945. Later, by a letter dated 29 August 1986, the plaintiffs submitted a third tender for the installation of the granite slabs to the City Hall Station for the sum of $663,844. These letters stated that the plaintiffs would require full payment by letter of credit upon acceptance of the tender. The plaintiffs` total tender price for sub-contract works was thus $7,596,024. The only other relevant bid for present purposes was that of Intraco for the sum of $4,270,000.
On 12 September 1986, the defendants wrote to NLC-JV proposing M/s Intraco Ltd/Marmi Formigari Spa Italy (`IM`) as the alternative granite supplier and fabricator in place of the plaintiffs and Corsi & Nicolai as indicated in their contract with NLC-JV. The letter opened with the following paragraph: 
 
Subsequent to the careful study of analysing the financial status, experience, source and manufacturer, delivery etc of the suitable granite supplier and fabricator so as to achieve the high quality and tight schedule of the above captioned project ...
 
 
 
The letter went on to substantiate the defendants` proposal on various grounds, namely: 
 
 
(a) Intraco had the highest paid-up capital, $75m, of the four companies invited to tender for the project; 
 
(b) Marmi Formigari was one of the best known manufacturing firms in the field of granite and marble products, with 35 years` experience in this field, and were able to obtain `Rosa Limbara` granite slabs from Sardinia, Italy and `Holy Brown` granite slabs from Gem Quarry in India; 
 
(c) IM had a proven record of competence in stonework projects in Singapore and overseas and were performing a supply contract for another MRT project to the defendants` entire satisfaction; 
 
(d) Intraco was a worldwide group; 
 
(e) IM could deliver the first shipment of the slabs by the end of December 1986 if the order was confirmed by mid-September 1986; 
 
(f) Marmi Formigari had a track record of good quality control; and 
 
(g) Intraco was prepared to offer a five-year warranty for defects of quality and workmanship.
  
 
 
In addition, the defendants submitted a comparative table of the various information regarding the four local companies invited to tender for the project (`the table`). Under the heading of `financial situation`, the defendants published the following defamatory statement regarding the plaintiffs that is the subject of this suit (`the statement`): `Under receivership, charges $25.2m.` The table also described the plaintiffs` experience of supply and installation of stoneworks as `NA`.
The letter of 12 September 1986 and the table were drawn up by Suyama, who testified that the difference between IM`s and the plaintiffs` bids made the former more attractive even though the MRT Corp had specified a supplier represented by the plaintiffs: IM had put in the lowest price; between the partners, they had the five years` experience required by cl 7.58.1 of the tender form; they had experience with MRT stations that also served as civil defence stations; Marmi Formigari was also an experienced supplier; their tender schedule met the defendants` requirement; they were able to start field installation earlier than the plaintiffs; and the plaintiffs had required payment by letters of credit. Suyama explained that as the defendants were responsible to NLC-JV for the company selected for the sub-contract works, they needed the approval of NLC-JV to select a different supplier from that specified by MRT Corp, and accordingly he drew up the letter and the table. He said that he arrived at the figure of $25.2m in the table by simply adding up the charges registered against the plaintiffs and appearing in the company search done by him. He also obtained the plaintiffs` accounts for 1983 from the Registry of Companies (`ROC`) and found that the plaintiffs had accumulated losses amounting to $1,614,199. He was unable to obtain the plaintiffs` accounts for 1984 and 1985 as these had not been lodged with the ROC. Based on this information, he formed the view that the plaintiffs were in financial trouble and unable to pay their creditors, and he thought that `receivership` was the term used to describe the situation as he had heard others use the word in this context. He admitted that, at the time of statement, he did not know the exact or legal meaning of `receivership` and he did not look it up in any dictionary, even though he was not very proficient in English. He also admitted to not being qualified to assess the financial status of a company and that he did not know how to read a company search, eg he did not know the significance of the `status` description in a company search or the meaning of `liquidation`. However, he claimed that he had the help of other persons and was therefore able to assess the plaintiffs` financial stability. He did not, however, make inquiries with the plaintiffs` bankers as to their financial standing. In cross-examination, he denied that he had been so anxious for Intraco to obtain the contract that he failed to take steps to check on the plaintiffs` financial standing. He also denied that he had ignored what was told to him by the plaintiffs` representatives at the meeting on 15 August 1986 and the statement in the tender documents that the plaintiffs had a credit line of up to $4m. Jacqueline Ng testified that she helped in the drawing-up of the table and that she simply accepted Suyama`s use of the word `receivership` which at the time suggested to her the notion of `financial trouble, not so strong`.
The plaintiffs must then have received notice of the defendants` concern over their financial status, for they wrote a letter dated 22 September 1986 reassuring the defendants of their financial standing and ability to perform the contract. This was followed by a letter dated 23 September 1986 from the plaintiffs` solicitors to the defendants complaining of the libel and asking them to withdraw the letter to NLC-JV and to clarify the position with them. The plaintiffs also sought an apology in the press. There was no immediate response to the letters. Instead, a letter dated 24 September 1986 was sent by the defendants to NLC-JV reiterating the factors that made the Intraco tender attractive but omitting the comments on the financial status of the tenderers. This was sent on by NLC-JV, with their comments, to the MRT Corp under the cover of a letter dated 29 September 1986. Then, by a letter dated 6 October 1986 and received by the plaintiffs on 23 October 1986, the defendants informed the plaintiffs that they had been unsuccessful in the tender. This was somewhat odd as neither NLC-JV nor the MRT Corp had at this time given their approval for the IM bid, although it is not disputed that by the time of the letter dated 12 September 1986, it was clear that the sub-contract works were to be awarded either to Intraco or to the plaintiffs. Indeed, questions remained over the source of the Holy Brown granite to be supplied by Intraco and, by a letter to the defendants dated 8 October 1986, Intraco forwarded documents purporting to show that the Holy Brown was from the quarries of Gem Granites. The defendants in turn sent them to NLC-JV under the cover of a letter dated 13 October 1986. The defendants wrote again to NLC-JV on 27 October 1986 describing IM as `our proposed supplier and fabricator of specified granite slabs` and enclosing further information on the IM bid.
It was only on 14 November 1986 that the defendants informed NLC-JV that the information in the table was untrue and that the plaintiffs were not in receivership and that they only had charges amounting to $2.6m registered against them. The defendants` explanation of the delay in responding to the plaintiffs` solicitors` letter was simply that they had sought legal advice on it. Subsequently, by a letter dated 25 November 1986, the defendants accepted Intraco`s tender for the sub-contract works. This was again somewhat odd as it was only later, by a letter dated 28 November 1986, that the MRT Corp informed NLC-JV of their approval of the proposed change of alternative granite supplier and fabricator. The defensay that they had heard informally from the MRT Corp before they wrote to Intraco. The MRT Corp, however, specified in their approval that it was for NLC-JV to satisfy themselves that the relevant certification of the granite was in order. Consequently, NLC-JV wrote to the defendants seeking further information of the source of the Holy Brown granite to be supplied and pointing out certain disparities in the documents submitted earlier. The defendants sent the MRT Corp and NLC-JV letters on to Intraco.
Among the documents forwarded by Intraco, under the cover of their letter dated 8 October 1986, to satisfy the defendants (and NLC-JV) was a testing certificate dated 6 October 1986 from the Universita di Pisa (`the certificate`). The certificate was in Italian and purported to be the results of tests done on `Gem Brown (Holy Brown)` granite slabs. At the end of December 1986 this certificate was shown to be a forgery. The consequences of this discovery on the sub-contract works are unclear, save that Intraco did not lose the sub-contract works as a result and no action was taken against Intraco by the defendants or the MRT Corp. Subsequently, an action (Suit No 723 of 1987) was taken out by Gem Granites and the plaintiffs against Intraco for damages for the tort of passing-off. In the course of the proceedings in that action, one Lim Meng Hoong, a manager with Intraco, swore an affidavit filed on 23 March 1987, in which he deposed, inter alia, that the plaintiffs` tender bid for the sub-contract works was $6,932,180.37. This figure appeared to be the total of the plaintiffs` first two tenders, without taking into account the third tender for the installation of the granite slabs to the City Hall Station for $663,844. The defendants denied any knowledge of how Intraco came to know of the plaintiffs` tender price.
 The claim
Based on the facts recited above, the plaintiffs allege in their pleadings that the words of the statement were defamatory, in that in their natural and ordinary meaning the words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiffs at the material time were over-indebted and that creditors had appointed a receiver over the assets or undertaking of the plaintiffs in protection of their interests. Further, by way of innuendo the words meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiffs had excessive charges on their available assets, were unable to discharge their financial obligations to their creditors, were on the brink of insolvency and were unfit to be awarded the contracts for which they had submitted tenders, as the plaintiffs were unlikely to fulfil performance of the contracts in view of their financial instability. The defendants, as stated above, do not deny that the words published were defamatory but rely on the defence of qualified privilege.
Accordingly, the issues on the question of liability in this action are whether the publication of the letter dated 12 September 1986 was made on an occasion protected by qualified privilege, and, if so, whether the publication was made with malice so as to remove the protection.
 Submissions on qualified privilege
The defendants have pleaded that the publication was privileged in that (to paraphrase their pleadings): 
 
 
(a) By their contract with NLC-JV, they were given the express option to choose a supplier of material for the sub-contract works. 
 
(b) Upon tenders being called and received, four suppliers were short-listed. The plaintiffs were one of the four. The defendants, as required by their contract with NLC-JV, did a study of the financial status, the experience and the tender price of each of the tenderers, and rendered a report with their proposal, naming a supplier for the granite. 
 
(c) This report was rendered in strict confidence and the statements contained therein were made in the honest belief that they were true. 
 
(d) In the premises, the defendants and NLC-JV had a common and corresponinterest in the subject-matter and publication of the said words.
  
 
 
Further, they have submitted that there was a legitimate common and corresponinterest between them and NLC-JV arising from the clearly superior bid of Intraco which made it necessary for them to communicate the results of the tender exercise to NLC-JV and to recommend the appointment of IM as alternative suppliers and fabricators in place of the plaintiffs and Corsi & Nicolai. Further, they contend that by virtue of the responsibility owed by them and NLC-JV to the MRT Corp over the selection of the suppliers and fabricators of the granite slabs, a common interest existed between them and NLC-JV.
The plaintiffs say that the defendants have not made out their pleaded case of qualified privilege in that: 
 
 
(a) The defendants had an express option only to choose among tenderers who conformed in terms of granite suppliers and fabricators and it was only the plaintiffs who had conformed with the specified granite suppliers and fabricators. In the event, the defendants had no option to choose any supplier other than the plaintiffs, unless they obtained approval from NLC-JV and MRT Corp. 
 
(b) The defendants did not study the plaintiffs` financial status as such a study implies, at the very least, having a person able to read accounts and an ROC instant search. If they had made such a study, the defamatory statement would never have been made. 
 
(c) The defendants were under no duty contractual or otherwise to report on the tenderers to NLC-JV. The defendants have produced no documentary evidence of any such duty. Moreover, Suyama admitted in cross-examination that if all the tenderers had conformed in terms of granite suppliers and fabricators, the defendants would have chosen among them without reference to NLC-JV.
  
 
 
The plaintiffs contend that the defamatory statement was made as part of a proposal aimed at winning NLC-JV`s approval of the alternative supplier and not as part of a routine report on the tenders.
Further or alternatively, the plaintiffs say that the occasion was not one of qualified privilege as the information communicated was so unreliable that, without taking steps to assure themselves of the truth of the statement, the defendants could not claim to be under any duty to communicate the information. The plaintiffs point out that Suyama himself admitted that he knew he was not qualified to read accounts or to interpret an instant search. The instant search by not stating against `status` that the plaintiffs were in receivership was information that they were in fact not in receivership. The instant search was also not information that the plaintiffs had charges representing a total indebtedness of $25.2m registered against them since anyone reading an instant search and having a minimal knowledge of the process of obtaining loans from a bank would know that there would be overlap between the charges, especially where the charges are stated to relate to the same bank, as a bank would take several charges in relation to each loan over different property belonging to a company with the charges being collectively limited to the total amount drawn down under the credit facility. Moreover, all that one has to do is to search at the ROC for the charge documents themselves, or obtain references from the banks named in the instant search. Furthermore, the plaintiffs had, in their tender, informed the defendants that they had credit facilities of $4m and that their bankers were The Royal Bank of Canada and Hong Leong Finance. The plaintiffs rely on a dictum of Greer LJ in 
 Watt v Longsdon 
 1 at p 293 which is set out below, as authority for this proposition.
 The law on qualified privilege
The law treats the publication of statements that are false in fact and injurious to the character of another as malicious, unless it is fairly made by a person in the discharge of some public or private duty, whether legal, social or moral, or in the conduct of his own affairs, in matters where his interest is concerned. It is also essential that the recipient of the publication shares a common interest with the publisher or has a corresponding legitimate interest or duty to receive the publication. These occasions are referred to in the law as occasions of qualified privilege and the rationale for the protection is the common convenience and welfare of society: see generally 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (8th Ed) at para 443. Such being the case, the occasions when the law offers the protection of qualified privilege are not fixed and necessarily vary with the changes in social conditions and values. The determination of whether an occasion is one of qualified privilege is one of law. The requirements stated above were set out by Scrutton LJ in 
Watt v Longsdon
 
[1929] All ER Rep 284
 at p 290 in the following terms: 
 
With slight modifications in particular circumstances, this appears to me to be well-established law, but, except in the case of communications based on common interest, the principle is that there must be either interest in the recipient, and a duty to communicate in the speaker, or an interest to be protected in the speaker and a duty to protect it in the recipient. Except in the case of common interest justifying intercommunication, the correspondence must be between duty and interest; there may, in the common interest cases, be also a common or reciprocal duty.
 
 
 
It is for the defendant to a libel action to prove that the defamatory publication was made on an occasion of qualified privilege. Where, as in the present case, the defendant relies on the existence of a common interest, he has to show that the publication was for the fair and reasonable protection or furtherance of his own interests and that the receiving party had a legitimate interest in the subject matter of the publication: 
 Stuart v Bell 
 2 and 
 Watt v Longsdon 
 .1
The plaintiffs have not contended in their submissions that there is no common interest; rather, they contend that the defendants were under no duty to communicate the information on the plaintiff`s financial status. While it is usually clear whether a legal duty or interest exists in fact, the determination of the existence of a moral or social duty is more nebulous. The question that a judge has to ask himself was set out in the following passage from the judgment of Lindley LJ in 
 Stuart v Bell 
 2 at p 350: 
 
The question of moral or social duty being for the judge, each judge must decide it as best he can for himself. I take moral or social duty to mean a duty recognized by English people of ordinary intelligence and moral principle, but at the same time not a duty enforceable by legal proceedings, whether civil or criminal. My own conviction is that all or, at all events, the great mass of right-minded men in the position of the defendant would have considered it their duty, under the circumstances, to inform Stanley of the suspicion which had fallen on the plaintiff.
 
 
 
A factor to be taken into consideration in answering the question stated is the reliability of the information to be published. This approach appears most clearly in the judgment of Greer LJ in 
 Watt v Longsdon 
 1 at p 293: 
 
In my judgment, no right-minded man in the position of the defendant, a friend of the plaintiff and of his wife, would have thought it right to communicate the horrible accusations contained in Mr Browne`s letter to the plaintiff`s wife. The information came to Mr Browne from a very doubtful source, and, in my judgment, no reasonably right-minded person could think it his duty, without obtaining some corroboration of the story, and without first communicating with the plaintiff, to pass on these outrageous charges of marital infidelity of a gross kind, and drunkenness and dishonesty, to the plaintiff`s wife.
 
 
 
 
 Decision on qualified privilege
 
The defendants` failure to put their contract with NLC-JV in evidence means that their pleaded case of qualified privilege based on their contractual obligations to NLC-JV fails as I have no evidence before me for holding that the letter of 12 September 1988 was a proposal in accordance with the contract between NLC-JV and the defendants. For the same reason, I also do not find it possible to consider the plaintiffs` contention that there is no contractual duty on the part of the defendants to report to NLC-JV concerning the tenderers.
However, in my view, the defendants have made out their claim to qualified privilege based on their common interest with NLC-JV in the sub-contract works. The defendants and NLC-JV stood in a contractual relationship as regards the architectural finishes works for the project. Although the document containing the contract between these two entities has not been produced, I think it can be inferred from their relationship that the defendants would have been liable to NLC-JV for any delays or faults in the architectural finishes. It is also a fair inference that NLC-JV would in turn be liable to the MRT Corp for any such delays or faults. It was thus in the interests of both the defendants and NLC-JV that the successful tenderer should be competent and financially stable.
The common interest between the defendants and NLC-JV is thus a broad one. It would be unrealistic to have expected the defendants to inform NLC-JV only if all the tenders did not conform to the specifications in the tender documents. In that situation, it would have been inevitable that the defendants would refer to NLC-JV but it does not follow that it is the only situation in which they had an interest in common with the joint venture in referring the tenders. Where, as here, the tender conforming with the specified source and fabrication is significantly higher than a competing tender, the defendants were certainly acting in their interests in referring the competing tenders. The information in the letter dated 12 September 1988 concerned the financial situations of the various tenderers and their respective ability to perform the sub-contract works. NLC-JV would plainly have a legitimate interest in receiving such information. Another significant factor in this situation is the concern that must have arisen from the news reports of the financial problems faced by the plaintiffs` holding company and from the demand by the plaintiffs that they be paid in advance rather than by progress payments. This concern over the financial stability of one of the tenderers must have been of common interest to the plaintiffs and NLC-JV.
Accordingly, it is not necessary for me to consider further if there was a social or moral duty to communicate and an interest in receiving the communications and I go on to consider the parties` submissions on malice.
 Submissions on malice
The plaintiffs rest their contention that the words were published with express malice on several grounds. Firstly, it is said that there was no belief in the truth of the defamatory words. The plaintiffs say that this can be inferred from the following: 
 
 
(a) The evidence of Peter Wong, Chong Toh Hui and Christine Foo to the effect that at the meeting on 15 August 1986 Suyama specifically asked whether the plaintiffs were in receivership and was told by Peter Wong that they were not. The plaintiffs submit that their witnesses` version of events should be accepted as it was in essence uncontradicted since Suyama and Jacqueline Ng both testified that the plaintiffs` finances were discussed. They say that the clarity of their witnesses` recollection was due to the importance of the meeting to the plaintiffs, and that Christine Foo recalled the word `receivership` being used because the allegation came as a shock to her. 
 
(b) Suyama had at no point deposed to an honest belief that the plaintiffs were in fact `under receivership`. The plaintiffs point out that Suyama has admitted that he was careless in his choice of words (in the sense that he was not certain of the meaning of `receivership`) so that what he ended up saying was not what he wanted to say or express. Moreover, he did not look up the meaning of `receivership` in the Japanese-English dictionary that he admits he possessed, even though the document in which the statement appeared was an important business document, on which the fate of the tender depended. The plaintiffs rely on the cases of 
Horrocks v Lowe
 
[1975] AC 135
[1974] 1 All ER 662
 and 
Leverman v Campbell Sharp Ltd
 
[1987] 36 DLR 401
  
 
 
The plaintiffs further base their contention that there was express malice on the ground that the defendants were indifferent to the truth of the words, in that Suyama had done no more than to make an instant search at the ROC. He had failed to note that the search did not describe the status of the plaintiffs as being `in receivership` and also had not made a search at the ROC to determine if a receiver had been appointed. The plaintiffs point out that the defendants also failed to obtain a reference from the plaintiffs` bankers and that Suyama admitted that he did not bother to read the names of the chargees on the instant search, but simply added up the amounts stated. It is said that had he only read the names, he would have noted that there were only two chargees, namely, Royal Bank of Canada and Hong Leong Finance, and he should then have realized that the charges were to secure credit facilities of only $4m and that there was no indebtedness of $25.2m. It is said that this failure to read even the names of the chargees was an extreme case of wilful blindness. The plaintiffs also suggest that Suyama testified that he could not remember whether he had seen the plaintiffs` accounts dated 31 December 1983 before making the defamatory statements though this suggestion was contradicted by Suyama`s evidence-in-chief on this aspect which was not weakened in cross-examination. The plaintiffs also point out that despite some attempt being made to show that there were news reports at the material time concerning the financial health of the companies related to the plaintiffs, no news reports were produced to the court, nor was there evidence that any such news report even mentioned the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs rely on 
Lee Kuan Yew v Derek Gwyn Davies & Ors
 
 
[1990] 1 MLJ 390
  for the proposition that malice can be inferred from these circumstances.
The third ground on which the plaintiffs contend that there was express malice is that the defendants had a dominant indirect motive not to report the best qualified tenderer to NLC-JV, but to procure by any means the approval of a cheaper alternative supplier regardless of the quality of his materials. They say that such dominant indirect motive can be inferred from several factors, viz: 
 
 
(a) The language and thrust of the letter dated 12 September 1986 to NLC-JV and the table: 
 
(i) The letter opened with the false claim of a `careful study of analysing the financial status`. 
 
(ii) Intraco`s warranty was highlighted as if it was something special, even though the plaintiffs had in fact offered a similar warranty. 
 
(iii) The defendants failed to set out the extensive experience of Alpha AS SRL which had been notified to them by the plaintiffs. 
 
(iv) The table indicated that Intraco`s schedule was two-and-a-half months while the plaintiffs` was four months, when in fact Intraco had only promised first delivery by the end of December 1986 while the plaintiffs promised field installation commencing end of January, ie delivery would have been earlier. The true difference was therefore less than a month, and not one-and-a-half months. The plaintiffs` schedule moreover complied with the tender requirement. The defendants had never requested the plaintiffs for any earlier date of field installation. 
 
(b) The defendants rejected the plaintiffs` tender on 6 October 1986, ie prior to the MRT Corp`s approval of Intraco as an alternative supplier. It is contended that this showed that the defendants were bent on excluding the plaintiffs from the tender. 
 
(c) The defendants did not take seriously the problems encountered by Intraco in sourcing the granite, including the production of the false certificate dated 6 October 1986. The defendants merely acted as a postbox between Intraco and NLC-JV and took no independent steps to satisfy themselves on the certification. 
 
(d) The defendants did not retract the defamatory statements until 14 November 1986, ie after the defamatory statements had achieved their desired effect, namely, the approval of Intraco by the MRT Corp. This is despite Suyama preparing another letter (the letter dated 24 September 1986) proposing Intraco as an alternative supplier. The plaintiffs say that this second proposal showed that Suyama knew that the statements in the earlier letter were untrue and that the timing of the apology and the delay in apologizing showed malice. The plaintiffs rely on 
Matheson v Schneideman
 
[1930] NZLR 151
 as authority for this proposition. 
 
(e) The cost savings of appointing Intraco were at the date of publication of the defamatory statement expected and intended by the defendants to accrue to them alone. The fact that MRT Corp subsequently reduced the amount they would pay by their letter dated 9 October 1986 is said to be irrelevant as the defendants had not invited them to reduce the price as admitted by Suyama.
  
 
 
The plaintiffs also contend that malice was shown by the defendants` spite or ill-will towards the plaintiffs: such spite or ill-will could be inferred from the conduct of the defendants towards the plaintiffs during the UMNO Building project and the fact that Intraco had learnt of the plaintiffs` tender price as indicated by the affidavit of Lim Meng Hoong in Suit No 723 of 1987.
The defendants deny that the statement was made with reckless indifference as to its truth. They concede, however, that it was made carelessly or negligently but say that this was not enough to amount to malice.
The defendants say the statement was not made with any ill-will or spite. They contend that it is not possible for any inference to be drawn from the UMNO project because Suyama had left Kuala Lumpur by the time the disputes over that project arose and it is therefore inconceivable that he could have been involved with communications with the plaintiffs` employees on the project. They further say that the plaintiffs have not demonstrated any plausible reason for Suyama to bear any ill-will or spite towards them. The defendants say that it was not possible for the plaintiffs` tender price to have been revealed to Intraco as all the tenders were submitted on the same day. With regard to the allegation of improper motive, the defendants say that it is spurious to assert that the tender prices should have been disclosed to NLC-JV in the letter dated 12 September 1986 as such disclosure would amount to disclosing their profit margins to NLC-JV.
The defendants also deny that they unnecessarily delayed the issuance of an apology to the plaintiffs. They say that Suyama was unable to reconcile the comments contained in the letters dated 22 September 1986 and 23 September 1986 from the plaintiffs and their solicitors since an instant search on 22 September 1986 and a further instant search on 29 September 1986 still revealed charges totalling $25.2m registered against the plaintiffs. It was only after receiving the benefit of legal advice from their solicitors that the defendants were advised of their misunderstanding and took steps to retract the defamatory statement from NLC-JV on 14 November 1986. The defendants deny that there was a deliberate attempt to delay the issue of the retraction and contend, instead, that any delay was contributed to by the plaintiffs` own neglect or failure to update their records lodged with the ROC. If the plaintiffs had been diligent in maintaining current records with the ROC, the defendants would have been notified that only $2.6m (as alleged by the plaintiffs) in charges remained and the defendants would have had less reason to be concerned with the vast discrepancy between the value of the registered charges and the paid-up capital of the plaintiffs. It is therefore said that Suyama believed in the truth of the statement. The defendants contend that this was not a situation where the defamatory statements were made without even bothering to verify the plaintiffs` financial position through the available public records. They further contend that the correction dated 14 November 1986 showed an absence of malice and they rely on 
 CS Wu v Wang Look Fung & Ors 
 7 as authority for this.
With regard to the false certificate, the defendants say that as it was in Italian, Suyama, who did not understand the language, had no reason to doubt its authenticity. They also contend that the falsity of the certificate is irrelevant as notice of the document`s falsehood was given to the defendants only in December 1986, after the contract for the sub-contract works had been awarded to Intraco. Moreover, no further action was taken by the MRT Corp to pursue the point and Intraco`s appointment as alternative supplier of granite was not revoked by NLC-JV or the MRT Corp.
With regard to the conversation in the defendants` office on 15 August 1986, the defendants contend that the meetings were brief and only general queries were made of each tenderer`s financial status and relevant experience. They urged the court to prefer the evidence of the defence witnesses that no mention was made of the plaintiffs being in receivership. They say that the plaintiffs` witnesses` recollection of the conversation was too vivid and consistent, and, given the lapse of almost five years, probably rehearsed.
 The law on malice
The protection afforded by qualified privilege is not an absolute one. It will be lost if the occasion that gives rise to it is misused, ie in common parlance, if the publication is made with malice. The burden of proving this is on the plaintiffs. This area of the law was authoritatively and exhaustively considered by Lord Diplock in 
Horrocks v Lowe
 
[1975] AC 135
[1974] 1 All ER 662
 at pp 149-151 and it would not be out of place for me to set out the very lengthy passage which was stressed by counsel: 
 
My Lords, as a general rule, English law gives effect to the ninth commandment that a man shall not speak evil falsely of his neighbour. It supplies a temporal sanction: if he cannot prove that defamatory matter which he published was true, he is liable in damages to whomever he has defamed, except where the publication is oral only, causes no damage and falls outside the categories of slander actionable per se. The public interest that the law should provide an effective means whereby a man can vindicate his reputation against calumny, has nevertheless to be accommodated to the competing public interest in permitting men to communicate frankly and freely with one another about matters with respect to which the law recognizes that they have a duty to perform or an interest to protect in doing so. What is published in good faith on matters of these kinds is published on a privileged occasion. It is not actionable even though it be defamatory and turns out to be untrue. With some exceptions which are irrelevant to the instant appeal, the privilege is not absolute but qualified. It is lost if the occasion which gives rise to it is misused. For in all cases of qualified privilege there is some special reason of public policy why the law accords immunity from suit - the existence of some public or private duty, whether legal or moral, on the part of the maker of the defamatory statement which justifies his communicating it or of some interest of his own which he is entitled to protect by doing so. If he uses the occasion for some other reason he loses the protection of the privilege.
 
 
 
So, the motive with which the defendant on a privileged occasion made a statement defamatory of the plaintiff becomes crucial. The protection might, however, be illusory if the onus lay on him to prove that he was actuated solely by a sense of the relevant duty or a desire to protect the relevant interest. So he is entitled to be protected by the privilege unless some other dominant and improper motive on his part is proved. `Express malice` is the term of art descriptive of such a motive. Broadly speaking, it means malice in the popular sense of a desire to injure the person who is defamed and this is generally the motive which the plaintiff sets out to prove. But to destroy the privilege the desire to injure must be the dominant motive for the defamatory publication; knowledge that it will have that effect is not enough if the defendant is nevertheless acting in accordance with a sense of duty or in bona fide protection of his own legitimate interests.
The motive with which a person published defamatory matter can only be inferred from what he did or said or knew. If it be proved that he did not believe that what he published was true this is generally conclusive evidence of express malice, for no sense of duty or desire to protect his own legitimate interests can justify a man in telling deliberate and injurious falsehoods about another, save in the exceptional case where a person may be under a duty to pass on, without indorsing, defamatory reports made by some other person.
Apart from those exceptional cases, what is required on the part of the defamer to entitle him to the protection of the privilege is positive belief in the truth of what he published or, as it is generally though tautologously termed, `honest belief`. If he publishes untrue defamatory matter recklessly, without considering or caring whether it be true or not, he is in this, as in other branches of the law, treated as if he knew it to be false. But indifference to the truth of what he publishes is not to be equated with carelessness, impulsiveness or irrationality in arriving at a positive belief that it is true. The freedom of speech protected by the law of qualified privilege may be availed of by all sorts and conditions of men. In affording to them immunity from suit if they have acted in good faith in compliance with a legal or moral duty or in protection of a legitimate interest the law must take them as it finds them. In ordinary life it is rare indeed for people to form their beliefs by a process of logical deduction from facts ascertained by a rigorous search for all available evidence and a judicious assessment of its probative value. In greater or in less degree according to their temperaments, their training, their intelligence, they are swayed by prejudice, rely on intuition instead of reasoning, leap to conclusions on inadequate evidence and fail to recognize the cogency of material which might cast doubt on the validity of the conclusions they reach. But despite the imperfection of the mental process by which the belief is arrived at it may still be `honest`, ie a positive belief that the conclusions they have reached are true. The law demands no more.
Even a positive belief in the truth of what is published on a privileged occasion - which is presumed unless the contrary is proved - may not be sufficient to negative express malice if it can be proved that the defendant misused the occasion for some purpose other than that for which the privilege is accorded by the law. The commonest case is where the dominant motive which actuates the defendant is not a desire to perform the relevant duty or to protect the relevant interest, but to give vent to his personal spite or ill-will towards the person he defames. If this be proved, then even positive belief in the truth of what is published will not enable the defamer to avail himself of the protection of the privilege to which he would otherwise have been entitled. There may be instances of improper motives which destroy the privilege apart from personal spite. A defendant`s dominant motive may have been to obtain some private advantage unconnected with the duty or the interest which constitutes the reason for the privilege. If so, he loses the benefit of the privilege despite his positive belief that what he said or wrote was true.
Judges and juries should, however, be very slow to draw the inference that a defendant was so far actuated by improper motives as to deprive him of the protection of the privilege unless they are satisfied that he did not believe that what he said or wrote was true or that he was indifferent to its truth or falsity. The motives with which human beings act are mixed. They find it difficult to hate the sin but love the sinner. Qualified privilege would be illusory, and the public interest that it is meant to serve defeated, if the protection which it affords were lost merely because a person, although acting in compliance with a duty or in protection of a legitimate interest, disliked the person whom he defamed or was indignant at what he believed to be that person`s conduct and welcomed the opportunity of exposing it. It is only where his desire to comply with the relevant duty or to protect the relevant interest plays no significant part in his motives for publishing what he believes to be true that `express malice` can properly be found.
There may be evidence of the defendant`s conduct upon occasions other than that protected by the privilege which justify the inference that upon the privileged occasion too his dominant motive in publishing what he did was personal spite or some other improper motive, even although he believed it to be true. But where, as in the instant case, conduct extraneous to the privileged occasion itself is not relied on, and the only evidence of improper motive is the content of the defamatory matter itself or the steps taken by the defendant to verify its accuracy, there is only one exception to the rule that in order to succeed the plaintiff must show affirmatively that the defendant did not believe it to be true or was indifferent to its truth or falsity. Juries should be instructed and judges should remind themselves that this burden of affirmative proof is not one that is lightly satisfied.
The exception is where what is published incorporates defamatory matter that is not really necessary to the fulfilment of the particular duty or the protection of the particular interest upon which the privilege is founded. Logically it might be said that such irrelevant matter falls outside the privilege altogether. But if this were so it would involve the application by the court of an objective test of relevance to every part of the defamatory matter published on the privileged occasion; whereas, as everyone knows, ordinary human beings vary in their ability to distinguish that which is logically relevant from that which is not and few, apart from lawyers, have had any training which qualifies them to do so. So the protection afforded by the privilege would be illusory if it were lost in respect of any defamatory matter which upon logical analysis could be shown to be irrelevant to the fulfilment of the duty or the protection of the right upon which the privilege was founded. As Lord Dunedin pointed out in 
 Adam v Ward 
[
[1917] AC 309
 at pp 326-327] the proper rule as respects irrelevant defamatory matter incorporated in a statement made on a privileged occasion is to treat it as one of the factors to be taken into consideration in deciding whether, in all the circumstances, an inference that the defendant was actuated by express malice can properly be drawn. As regards irrelevant matter the test is not whether it is logically relevant but whether, in all the circumstances, it can be inferred that the defendant either did not believe it to be true or, though believing it to be true, realized that it had nothing to do with the particular duty or interest on which the privilege was based, but nevertheless seized the opportunity to drag in irrelevant defamatory matter to vent his personal spite, or for some other improper motive. Here, too, judges and juries should be slow to draw this inference.
It is therefore for the plaintiffs to show that the publication was made with the dominant intention of injuring them. The fact that the defendants might have known that the publication would injure the plaintiffs is not sufficient. Such a dominant and improper motive can be proven if it is shown that the defendants knew that the statement was false. This is usually conclusive and it is no excuse that the publication was made carelessly such that it did not reflect the defendants` true belief even though there was no intention to publish the false statement: 
Leverman v Campbell Sharp Ltd.
 
[1987] 36 DLR 401
Following Lord Diplock, a defendant will also be held to have made the statement with malice if he made it recklessly as to its truth. A defendant is not reckless, for the purposes of proving malice, if he did so believing it was true, even if he was careless, impulsive or irrational in coming to that belief. The law does not require him to be logical. In order for him to be held to be reckless, he must be shown to have not cared or considered if the statement was true. This is illustrated by the finding of malice (albeit obiter) by LP Thean J in 
 Lee Kuan Yew v Derek Gwyn Davies & Ors 
 .5 That case was an action by the present Senior Minister for damages for libel in respect of an article concerning the detention of several persons under the Internal Security Act (Cap 143) in May 1987. For present purposes, it is only necessary to state the facts in the briefest outline. The persons were detained in connection with a clandestine communist network. Several of the persons detained were full-time workers of the Catholic Church and others were voluntary workers in the Church`s organizations. After the arrest and prior to the offending publication, several government and other statements had been published setting out conflicting accounts of the reasons for the arrests. Some of these statements were made by a priest of the Catholic Church, who alleged that the arrests were part of a campaign against the Church. The priest later resigned his position and left for Australia where he continued to make statements in the Australian and the New Zealand press, casting adverse inferences on the government`s motives for the detentions. The Senior Minister then made a lengthy statement in Parliament critical of this priest. This statement was reported in the press and the priest made a press statement in Australia in response to the Senior Minister`s statement. A copy of this press statement together with two other documents were then sent to the author of the defamatory article, who wrote the article based on the documents he received. LP Thean J held that in view of the past statements by the priest and his resignation and the statement on him by the Senior Minister, the author and the editor of the article must have realized that the priest had a deep grievance against the government and that the documents sent to them with a view to their writing and publishing a counter-attack on the government might have contained accounts that were not objective or impartial and were likely to be factually inaccurate. In those circumstances, the learned judge held that they had a duty to verify the account in the documents, and by not doing so before writing the defamatory article on the basis of the account in the documents, they were reckless as to the truth of the account in the article.
Personal ill-will or spite is also evidence of malice. The evidence for such ill-will or spite is usually found in the dealings between the parties prior to the publication: see eg 
 S Pakianathan v Jenni Ibrahim 
 .8 Exceptionally, it may also be found in the behaviour of the defendant after the publication. A refusal or a delay in apologizing, even after being told that the publication was false, usually does not amount to malice: see 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (8th Ed) para 1355, but the view has been expressed that it might do so in exceptional circumstances: 
 Matheson v Schneideman 
 .6 The case of 
 CS Wu v Wang Look Fung 
 7 is an illustration of an instance where an apology negatived the existence of malice. The courts should also bear in mind Lord Diplock`s view that they should be slow to draw an inference of ill-will or spite from the dealings between the parties.
Ill-will or spite may also be found in the defamatory publication itself if it contains defamatory matter not really necessary to the fulfilment of the particular duty or interest upon which the privilege is founded. It should be borne in mind that the test of relevance is not one of logical analysis and that the inclusion of irrelevant defamatory material is to be treated as one of the factors to be taken into account in deciding whether, in all the circumstances, an inference of malice can be drawn against the defendant. Again, a court should be slow to draw such an inference.
 Decision on malice
Having these principles in mind, I now turn to consider the instant case. The defamatory statement was made on the basis of an instant search from the ROC and the plaintiffs` accounts for the year ended 31 December 1983. While it may well be that all lawyers and others trained in the practice of the ROC may realize that the `status` line in an ROC search would indicate whether a company was or was not in receivership and that there is usually an overlap of charges indicated on the search, I do not find that an ordinary reasonable man would in all probability have such knowledge. In my opinion, Suyama clearly did not have knowledge other than an ordinary reasonable man would have had and I see no reason to doubt his testimony on this point. Having seen him in the witness box and observed him as he testified, I am also of the view that his command of the English language was not sufficiently competent for him to have known the distinction that exists in law between being indebted and being in receivership. He was certainly careless not to have checked with a dictionary, but that omission cannot amount to recklessness. The same point may be made of his failure to verify his reading of the instant search or to obtain references from the plaintiffs` bankers. The fact that the defamatory statement was in a business document is not sufficient to take it out of the context of ordinary life and I remind myself of the observations of Lord Diplock in 
Horrocks v Lowe
 
[1975] AC 135
[1974] 1 All ER 662
 which in my view are as true of Singapore as they are of England: 
 
... In ordinary life it is rare indeed for people to form their beliefs by a process of logical deduction from facts ascertained by a rigorous search for all available evidence and a judicious assessment of its probative value. In greater or in less degree according to their temperaments, their training, their intelligence, they are swayed by prejudice, rely on intuition instead of reasoning, leap to conclusions on inadequate evidence and fail to recognize the cogency of material which might cast doubt on the validity of the conclusions they reach. But despite the imperfection of the mental process by which the belief is arrived at it may still be `honest`, that is, a positive belief that the conclusions they have reached are true. The law demands no more.
 
 
 
It is said that Suyama could not have believed that the defendants were in receivership since the plaintiffs` representatives had at the meeting on 15 August emphatically denied such an allegation. I find this contention to be too technical and unrealistic. It is common ground that the plaintiffs` financial situation was discussed at that meeting, although Suyama is not certain if the word `receivership` was used, and it was also admitted by Peter Wong that the plaintiffs` holding company`s financial troubles had been widely reported in the newspapers. Such being the circumstances, it is clear that Suyama believed that the plaintiffs were in financial trouble and whether or not receivership was the right word for such problems is immaterial. Indeed, assuming that the word `receivership` was used in the discussion, there is no apparent reason why Suyama should have accepted the oral assertion of the plaintiffs` representatives who had obvious interests to protect over what appeared to him to be a reliable ROC search.
The present facts are different from the situation in 
 Lee Kuan Yew v Derek Gwyn Davies 
 5 in which there had been several public statements, including a lengthy one in Parliament, that presented a different view from that in the publication in issue in that case. Moreover, the statement in Parliament in that case cast doubts on the integrity and honesty of the source of the information for the publication. The fact that the aspersions as to the source`s integrity were cast by a leading member of the community only reinforced the need for caution before publishing the information. None of those factors are present here. Indeed, the fact that the basis for Suyama`s belief is a public document stresses the fact that a reasonable person would have thought his belief formed on proper grounds. It in no way indicates recklessness on his part.
The plaintiffs also rely on the contention that the defendants bore ill-will or spite against them. Again, I do not find this contention to be made out. First, in my opinion, the fact that Intraco professed to know the value of the plaintiffs` tender did not, in any way, indicate malice. There was no definite evidence before me of how Intraco obtained any of this knowledge. It cannot be surmised from the fact of Intraco`s knowledge that it was the defendants who leaked the value of the plaintiffs` tender. As I have indicated above, Intraco`s figure was in fact vastly different from the true figure. Just as the plaintiffs found out about the defamatory statement from an undisclosed source, so too it is possible that Intraco somehow found out some information through the construction industry`s grapevine. Se, the plaintiffs` reliance on the conduct of the defendants during the UMNO Building project ignores that fact, pointed out by the defendants, that Suyama had already left Kuala Lumpur by the time the disputes over that project arose. Moreover, although Christine Foo testified that she thought that the defendants` employees in Kuala Lumpur bore ill-will towards the plaintiffs, she did not say that Suyama was one of them. The unfortunate circumstances of the UMNO Building project, as indicated by the considerable documents exhibited before me, show that the parties to the present action had an unsatisfactory experience working together on that project. It can only be expected that the defendants therefore had a preference for tenderers other than the plaintiffs, if possible. The ROC instant search was therefore likely to have been welcomed by the defendants as providing a reason which they could use for preferring IM`s tender over that of the plaintiffs. However, such prejudice, if it did exist, cannot amount to malice unless it formed the dominant motive for the publication of the statement: 
 Horrocks v Lowe 
 .3
It is therefore necessary to consider the terms of the letter dated 12 September 1986. It is true that the letter was written in such a manner as to draw attention to the financial status of the various tenderers. However, this was clearly within the scope of the relevant common interest on the part of the defendants. The reference to `a careful study of analysing the financial status`, while clearly wrong in the sense that no financial analyst would accept the study as a careful one, could be considered by an ordinary man, such as Suyama was, as one which could be called a careful study, given that consideration had been given by him to the facts revealed by the instant search and the plaintiffs` accounts for 1983. The highlighting of the warranty offered by Intraco was probably, in the context of the letter as a recommendation of a particular tenderer, a piece of salesmanship on the part of the defendants. While such salesmanship may have been undesirable, it could not be said to have been malicious. Suyama has also explained that the experience of Alpha AS SRL in projects outside of Singapore was, in the defendants` opinion, not relevant to whether they could handle the sub-contract works. There may have been a variety of reasons for this view, eg the peculiar local geographic or climatic conditions and, accordingly, the omission of Alpha`s experience, whether taken alone or in conjunction with the other factors pointed out by the plaintiffs (see above), could not amount to malice. I am also not impressed by the argument that the defendants had misrepresented the plaintiffs` delivery schedule as the diffebetween their schedule and Intraco`s has not been shown to be material. Accordingly, I do not agree that the stated factors, whether individually or collectively, indicate that the dominant motive of the publication was to exclude the plaintiffs and not to draw attention to the financial standings of the tenderers.
The plaintiffs` reliance on evidence extraneous to the letter is also not convincing as there are other plausible reasons for the matters relied upon. The plaintiffs first rely on the fact that the defendants rejected their tender well before the MRT Corp`s approval of the Intraco bid. The defendants` explanation, as given by Suyama, was that they had heard informally from the Corporation. Having seen Suyama in the witness box, I find no reason to doubt him, especially having regard to my earlier averment that the construction industry appears to be one in which information moves rapidly.
Secondly, the plaintiffs rely on the false testing certificate dated 6 October 1988. I accept the defendants` explanation that as Suyama did not understand Italian, he had no reason to doubt its authenticity. Moreover, as the document was one forwarded by Intraco in support of their tender, it was reasonable for the defendants to act merely as a post box leaving Intraco to bear the consequences of any flaw in the certificate. While on hindsight it may have been wiser to have been more careful, it cannot be said that it would have been expected that Intraco would rely on a false document. I should, however, make clear that I in no way rely on the fact that no action was taken by the MRT Corp or NLC-JV on the false certificate. The evidence as to what transpired on discovery of the certificate`s falsity is too nebulous to be relied on.
The plaintiffs also rely on the defendants` failure to apologize until almost two months had elapsed after the plaintiffs` solicitors` letter dated 24 September 1988 had been received and after the Intraco bid had been approved. In my opinion, this submission reads too much into the sequence of events. As the defendants pointed out, a further instant search at ROC on 29 September 1988 did not indicate that the earlier search was wrong. The defendants were therefore entitled to wait for their lawyers to revert to them. Unfortunately, both parties have not shown me any evidence as to when the defendants` solicitors reverted. I therefore have to assume from all the circumstances that it was shortly before 14 November 1988, some six weeks after the complaint about the libel. In my view, the period of time is unnecessarily long but this alone cannot in the circumstances amount to malice. This was because the evidence that Suyama relied on to form his belief remained uncontradicted apart from assertions by the plaintiffs. The defendants` second proposal dated 24 September which omitted the statement did not, in my view, show that they knew that the statement was untrue. Rather, it was a prudent and conservative act, given that Suyama was in receipt of a lawyer`s letter threatening a suit and liability in damages. This was clearly not a case of a refusal to apologize after realizing that the publication was false and, accordingly, I do not need to consider whether the unorthodox view of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in 
 Matheson v Schneideman 
 6 is part of the law of Singapore.
The plaintiffs finally contend that any saving in cost of the sub-contract works was intended by the defendants to accrue to their benefit. The contention is clearly unrealistic and without merit.
For all the above reasons, the plaintiffs` claim is dismissed, with costs.

This was an appeal against sentence only. The appellant pleaded guilty on 4 December 1991 before a district court to an offence of voluntarily causing hurt punishable under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Code`), as a result of which he was sentenced to one week`s imprisonment.
On 26 September 1991 at about 8.50pm, both the appellant aged 26 years and the victim aged 51 years were driving their respective vans along Upper Thomson Road. While driving behind the victim`s van, the appellant switched on the headlights of his van to high beam. This irritated the victim who then allowed the appellant to overtake him, and in turn switched on his headlights to highbeam to irritate the appellant. Subsequently, when both parties stopped at the traffic lights, the appellant alighted from his van and confronted the victim. During the ensuing dispute, he fisted the victim on the right cheek. The victim suffered a swelling over the right malar area and was given medical leave for one day.
The appellant pleaded guilty to the following charge: 
 
That you, on or about 26 September 1991 at about 8.50pm, along Yishun Ring Road near to the pedestrian crossing of Block 103 Yishun Ring Road, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Latiff s/o Abdul Kader, to wit, by fisting his face, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
Although the appellant declined to say anything in mitigation, the district judge took into account the fact that he was a first offender. He could not ignore the fact, however, that the appellant had assaulted a man twice as old as himself on the face and had simply driven off after that, and he was of the view that the appellant`s action was one of hooliganism on the road. He noted that motorists had increasingly resorted to violence at the slightest irritation or provocation and there had recently been a spate of such cases. In his view such deliberate violence on the road must be deterred.
Counsel for the appellant submitted that this incident had arisen from a minor misunderstanding on the road and even the prosecution had not asked the court below to pass a deterrent sentence. In the circumstances, he submitted that the district court should have merely imposed a fine, and the custodial sentence of one week`s imprisonment was manifestly excessive. In support of this argument, he cited two cases under s 323 of the Code, 
 PP v Khoo Kim Chwee 
 1 in which the prosecution`s appeal against a fine of $800 was dismissed, and 
 PP v Patrick Tan Siew Kim 
 2 in which a sentence of one week`s imprisonment was varied on appeal to one day`s imprisonment and a fine of $500 in default of one week`s imprisonment.
On the other hand, Miss Jennifer Marie for the public prosecutor drew my attention to two other cases under s 323 of the Code, 
 Philip Wong Kim Tow v PP 
 3 and 
 Tan Yok Mun v PP 
 4 in both of which the High Court dismissed appeals against sentences of two months` imprisonment. My attention was also drawn to the judgment of Rajendran JC in 
 Fred Khoo Chin Chye v PP 
 5 in which, after referring with approval to Lord Lane CJ`s observations in 
 R v Hassan; R v Schuller, 
 6 he said: 
 
Resorting to violence over trivial traffic matters has been an unpleasant feature on our roads. Such conduct cannot be condoned and the trial judge cannot be faulted for having taken the view that a prison term was called for in order to prevent the accused and other like-minded motorists from committing such offences. I am therefore unable to accede to counsel`s plea that only a fine be imposed.
 
 
 
This matter arose from what was certainly a trivial dispute. Such minor incidents occur on our roads many times every day. No doubt they are frustrating to those involved. But if, many times every day on our public roads, everyone were to lose his temper and react to the degree the appellant did, all semblance of order would quickly dissipate and only the most violent would prevail. The perceptible trend in this direction deservedly incurs the courts` displeasure and must be determinedly discouraged. Drivers must refrain from alighting from their vehicles and assaulting others simply because those others have annoyed them by their driving or in some other way. I therefore adopt unreservedly Lord Land CJ`s view in 
 Hassan & Schulle 
 
 r 
 6 that prison sentences ought to follow this sort of incident. Further, this particular display of violence was deliberate and out of all proportion to the irritation, and the incident was in any case started by the appellant himself. One week`s imprisonment clearly could not in the circumstances be manifestly excessive. I therefore dismissed the appeal.

This is an appeal against the decision of the district court which held that the defendants are liable to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $2,062 being the loss suffered by the plaintiff for the damage caused to the plaintiff`s cooker, cooker hood, curtains and door mat (hereinafter referred to as `the household items`) by rats. The learned trial judge also awarded taxed costs to the plaintiff. Having heard submissions from the parties, I allowed the appeal and awarded the defendants costs here and in the court below, the same to be taxed if not agreed. The plaintiff has appealed and I now give my reasons.
The plaintiff is and was at all material times the subsidiary co-proprietor of the flat known as 27 Pasir Panjang Close which is also known as unit 27 in the housing development referred to as Pasir Panjang Court to which the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1988 Ed) applies. The other subsidiary co-proprietor of the flat is his wife, Lily Wong. The defendants are the management corporation of Pasir Panjang Court.
This action was commenced on 26 January 1987 before the major amendments made to the Act by the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Act 1987 came into force on 1 December 1987. Although the 1988 revised edition of Cap 158 is now the proper version of the Act, I shall, for the purposes of this appeal, refer to Cap 158 of the 1985 revised edition of the Singapore statutes because many of the provisions found in the 1988 edition were not in force at the time when the alleged breaches of duty by the defendants took place. In these grounds of decision, the references to the sections of the Act are therefore to those sections of the 1985 edition of Cap 158 (`the Act`) which were in force before the amendments effected by the 1987 legislation came into force.
 The plaintiff`s case
The plaintiff`s case as pleaded in the statement of claim is as follows: 
 
 
(2) The plaintiff`s claim is for loss and damage suffered as a result of the negligence and/or breach of statutory duty of the defendants, their servants or agents, persistently over a period of years between October 1982 to [sic] [26 January 1987] at the premises known as Pasir Panjang Court, Strata Title [Plan] No 586 at Pasir Panjang Close to which the Land Titles (Strata) Act [Cap 158] applies.
  
 
 
 
 Particulars of negligence
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1) Failing to keep the rubbish chutes [of Pasir Panjang Court] in repair causing rodents to breed thereat, thus causing the plaintiff`s premises to be infested with rodents. 
 
(2) Failing to keep the common property of the Strata Title 586 [Pasir Panjang Court] in a good state of repair despite repeated reminders by the plaintiff thus causing the damage and wastage of Strata Title 586. 
 
(3) Failing to keep proper accounts of the funds of Management Corp Strata Title 586 thus causing the fund of the management corporation to be mismanaged. 
 
(4) Using the capital levy of $2,200 [per unit] levied pursuant to an emergency meeting held on 16 July 1983 for purposes it was not intended thus causing unnecessary damage and wastage to Strata Title 586. 
 
(5) Failing to conduct meetings of the management corporation properly. 
 
(6) Issuing minutes of meetings of the management corporation which are inaccurate, misleading and with omissions of matters discussed at the meetings, thus causing the management corporation to be mismanaged. 
 
(7) Failing to keep or issue minutes of meetings held on 20 July 1985, thus causing the management corporation to be mismanaged. 
 
(8) Allowing the misuse of water and electricity of the management corporation by private individuals for their own private use thus causing unnecessary expenses to the management corporation and to the plaintiff as a subsidiary co-proprietor. 
 
(9) Installing a central antenna at the expense of the management corporation when the same had not been properly approved and thus mismanaging the funds of the management corporation. 
 
(10) Failing to ensure that the subsidiary proprietor of unit 27A take effective steps to prevent the leak through the floor of unit 27A from damaging unit 27 thus causing unnecessary damage to the plaintiff`s premises. 
 Particulars of breach of statutory [duty] 
  
 
 
 
 
 
(i) Failing to maintain the rubbish chutes which [are] part of the common property under the charge of the Management Corp Strata Title 586, contrary to s [31(1)(a) of the Land Titles (Strata) Act] and byelaw 5(a) and/or (c) of the [Second Schedule to] the [said] Act. 
 
(ii) Failing to keep the common property of the Strata Title 586 [ie Pasir Panjang Court] in a state of good and serviceable repair contrary to s [31(1)(a)] of the Land Titles (Strata) Act and [byelaw] 5(a) of the Second Schedule [to] the said Act. 
 
(iii) Failing to keep proper accounts of the management corporation`s funds contrary to [para] 8(2)(a) of the First Schedule [to] the Land Titles (Strata) Act. 
 
(iv) Failing to conduct the adjourned general meeting of the management corporation held on 20 July 1985 properly, by failing to prepare proper accounts relating to all moneys of the corporation and the corporation`s income and expenditure, contrary to [para] 8(3) of the First Schedule [to] the Land Titles (Strata) Act. 
 
(v) Failing to file with the Commissioner of Buildings within 28 days of the adjourned general meeting held on 20 July 1985, certified copies of the minutes of the general meeting, contrary to [para] 8(5)(c) of the First Schedule [to] the Land Titles (Strata) Act. 
 
(vi) Allowing the misuse of water and electricity of the management corporation by private individuals for their own private use and thereby failing to control, manage and administer the common property for the benefit of all the [subsidiary] proprietors, contrary to [byelaw] 3 of the Second Schedule [to] the Land Titles (Strata) Act. 
 
(3) By reason of the matters aforesaid the plaintiff has suffered loss and damage.

 The defence
 
The defence as pleaded was a denial that the defendants were guilty of the alleged or any negligence or breach of statutory duty as alleged in the statement of claim or at all, or that any loss or damages which the plaintiff might have suffered or sustained was caused or occasioned by the acts or matters complained of (record of appeal at p 110).
 Decision of the district court
The action was heard by the district court on 5 and 6 February 1990 and on 30 and 31 January 1991. On 31 January 1991 the district judge (a) dismissed the plaintiff`s claim for damages in respect of the defendants` failure to keep proper accounts, using the capital levy for a wrongful purpose, failing to conduct meetings properly, issuing inaccurate minutes of meetings and misuse of water and electricity; and (b) gave judgment to the plaintiff for the sum of $2,062 as damages for the damage caused to the household items by rats. No award was made by the district judge for the sum of $3,000 claimed by the plaintiff as the cost of survey fees.
In his judgment, the district judge said he `considered the evidence in totality and was of the view that the defendant management corporation had not discharged their duty in maintaining the rubbish chutes in proper order` (record of appeal at p 23). Further, at pp 24 and 25 of the record of appeal, he said: 
 
... The court was satisfied with the evidence of the plaintiff PW1 Ignatius Augustine Menezes pertaining to the breeding of the rats in his kitchen area at the cooker hood, cooker and oven. The plaintiff`s description of the rats in his kitchen area was vivid and in great detail. Likewise, his description of the conditions of the rubbish chutes which gave the rats access to his apartment. The plaintiff would not have been able to describe in the way he did if what he said was untrue. ...
 
 
 
In the circumstances, the court was satisfied that the rubbish chutes were not maintained properly and the rats had entered into the plaintiff`s apartment through the holes in the rubbish chutes and causing damage to the plaintiff`s household items.
 Award of damages
Even if I had not reversed the finding of the district judge, I am of the view that he erred in awarding to the plaintiff the sum of $2,062 as damages for the damage caused to his household items. This sum represented the original value of the damaged household items. They were purchased in 1979 when the plaintiff moved into the premises. These items were alleged to have been damaged by rats during the period from October 1982 to July 1985. The plaintiff admitted that these household items were three years old in 1982 (record of appeal at p 49). The district judge failed to consider the fact that at the time the items were alleged to have been damaged by rats, their value had depreciated. The amount to be awarded as damages ought to have been the depreciated value of the household items at the time they were damaged by rats or at least in 1982.
 Award of costs
There was a trial before the district judge which lasted for four days spread over a period of 12 months. All the other issues were decided in favour of the appellants. It was contended before me, and I think rightly so, that the district judge wrongly exercised his discretion in awarding full costs to be taxed in favour of the plaintiff. Since the plaintiff was partially successful only in respect of part of his claims he should therefore be entitled to part of the costs in the court below, and the district judge ought to have made an apportionment as to costs: see 
Trustees of Leong San Tong Khoo Kongsi (Penang) Registered & Ors v Poh Swee Siang
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 611
 
 Can a breach of a statutory duty under the Act give rise to any civil liability?
The district judge did not make it clear in his judgment whether he found that the defendants were liable to the plaintiff for a breach of the duty imposed by the common law or a breach of the duty imposed upon them by the Act to maintain the chutes properly. I think this appeal raises an important question of law, namely, whether a management corporation which is constituted under the Act to control, manage and administer the common property of a sub-divided building for the benefit of all the subsidiary proprietors of the strata lots in the sub-divided building can be sued by a subsidiary proprietor for damages for a breach of its statutory duty.
It was contended before me by counsel for the defendants that even if assuming there is a breach of a statutory duty, such a breach does not by itself carry civil liabilities and that the plaintiff ought to have enforced performance of that duty by the defendants in the manner specified by s 45(2) of the Act or alternatively, the plaintiff should have lodged a complaint with the Commissioner of Buildings (`the Commissioner`) so that the penal provision under s 45(1) could be invoked.
Section 45 of the Act as it was then in force reads: 
 
Breaches of provisions of this part
 
 
 
 
(1) If the management corporation commits a breach of any of the provisions of this Part [ie Part IV] or makes default in complying with any requirement of, or duty imposed on it by, any of the provisions of this Part, the management corporation and every member of its council, or every subsidiary proprietor, who is knowingly a party to the breach or default shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a penalty expressly prescribed for such breach or default, or, if no penalty is so prescribed, to a fine not exceeding $2,000. 
 
(2) Where a requirement or duty is imposed on the management corporation by this Part, any person for whose benefit, or for the benefit of whose lot that requirement or duty imposed on the management corporation may apply to the court for an order compelling the management corporation to carry out the requirement or perform the duty, as the case may be, and, on such an application being made, the court may make such order as it thinks proper.
  
 
 
The editors of 
 Clarke & Lindsell on Torts 
(16th Ed) in para 14-10 at p 762 state that it is beyond doubt that a statutory duty may give rise to a liability in civil action only when the plaintiff can establish that Parliament intended the breach of the relevant statutory duty to be actionable by the individual harmed by that breach. At p 773, para 14-10, the editors state: 
 Where some other sanction is prescribed 
. If the statute imposes a penalty for its breach but is silent regarding a civil remedy, one has `to consider the scope and purpose of the statute and in particular for whose benefit it is intended`. In 
 Lonrho v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd (No 2) 
 
[1982] AC 173
 Lord Diplock unequivocally reasserted that the `general rule` is that where a statute creates an obligation and enforces performance in a specified manner `... that performance cannot be enforced in any other manner`. And where the only manner of performance provided for by the statute is the criminal process there are only two exceptions to that `general rule`: (i) where on the true construction of the statute it is apparent that the obligation or benefit was imposed for the benefit of a particular class of individuals; (ii) when a statute creates a public right and an individual member of the public suffers `particular direct and substantial damage other and different than that which is common to the rest of the public`.
Section 45 of the Act imposes a criminal penalty for the breach of a statutory duty by the management corporation. If a complaint is made to the Commissioner of Buildings regarding a breach of a statutory duty by a management corporation, the Commissioner will, if he thinks fit, prosecute the errant management corporation. That section also provides for a civil remedy. Section 45(2) gives the plaintiff, a person for whose benefit the duty is imposed, a remedy for the breach of the duty, ie to apply to the court for an order that the management corporation shall perform that duty. Therefore the exceptions mentioned by Lord Diplock in the 
 Lonrho 
 `s case2 do not apply to our instant case.
In cross-examination, the plaintiff said he had a meeting with the Commissioner sometime in 1985 and complained to him about the defendants` failure to manage and maintain the common property of Pasir Panjang Court in good repair. All the complaints enumerated in his statement of claim were repeated to the Commissioner (record of appeal at p 58). The plaintiff also confirmed that subsequent to the said meeting he sent to the Commissioner a copy of his letter dated 8 July 1985 addressed to the defendants. He said he did not know what action the Commissioner had taken (record of appeal at p 59).
A management corporation is a body corporate which comes into existence by operation of s 30 of the Act upon the registration of the strata title plan. This body corporate is similar in character to a company incorporated under the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1990 Ed) in that it has a common seal, as well as specified powers, authorities, duties and functions, but the Companies Act does not apply to a management corporation. Every subsidiary proprietor of a strata lot shown on the strata title plan is a member of the management corporation. The management corporation also has a legal existence separate from that of its members. The principal statutory duty of a management corporation is to manage and properly maintain the common property and keep it in a state of good and serviceable repair: see s 31(1)(a). Every subsidiary proprietor has to pay maintenance contributions determined and levied by a management corporation to provide the necessary finances for the management corporation to administer, maintain and repair the common property and for discharging other obligations of the management corporation: see s 36.
Section 30 of the Act as it was then in force in January 1987 reads: 
 
Establishment of a management corporation
 
 
 
 
(1) The subsidiary proprietor or subsidiary proprietors shall, by virtue of this Act, upon registration of the strata title plan be a body corporate with perpetual succession and a common seal and shall be called the management corporation. 
 
(2) The management corporation may - 
 
(a) sue and be sued on any contract made by it; 
 
(b) sue and be sued in respect of any matter affecting the common property; and 
 
(c) be sued in respect of any matter connected with the parcel for which the subsidiary proprietors are jointly liable. 
 
(3) The management corporation shall elect a council which, subject to any restriction imposed or direction given by the management corporation at a general meeting, shall perform the management corporation`s business on its behalf and may for that purpose exercise any of the management corporation`s powers. 
 
(4) The provisions of the First Schedule have effect in relation to the management corporation and its council. 
 
(5) If the management corporation makes default in complying with any requirements of, or duties imposed upon it by, any of the provisions of the First Schedule the management corporation and every member of its council, or every subsidiary proprietor, who is knowingly a party to the breach or default, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $500.
  
 
 
The duties of a management corporation are specified in s 31(1) of the Act which reads: 
 
Duties and powers of management corporation
 
 
 
 
(1) The duties of the management corporation include the following: 
 
(a) to manage and properly maintain the common property and keep it in a state of good and serviceable repair; 
 
(b) unless otherwise directed by a unanimous resolution, to insure and keep insured the subdivided building to the replacement value thereof against fire and such other risks as may be prescribed under this Act; 
 
(c) to effect such other insurance of the subdivided buildings as may be required by law; 
 
(d) to insure against such other risks as the subsidiary proprietors may by special resolution direct; 
 
(e) subject to any order made by the court under section 43, forthwith to apply insurance moneys received by it in respect of damage to the subdivided building in rebuilding and reinstating it so far as it may be lawful to do so; 
 
(f) to pay premiums on any policy of insurance effected by it; 
 
(g) to comply with any notice or order made by any competent, public or statutory authority requiring the abatement of any nuisance on the common property or ordering repairs or other work to be done in respect of the common property or any building or other improvement on the parcel; 
 
(h) to comply with any such notice or order as is referred to in paragraph (g) given or made in respect of any of the lots, if the subsidiary proprietor fails to do so within a reasonable time; and 
 
(i) to pay the rent (if any) on the land on which the subdivided is erected.
  
 
 
As can be seen from the above-mentioned list of duties, all the plaintiff`s complaints under the heading of `particulars of breach of statutory duty` in para 2 of his statement of claim except for the complaint relating to the failure to maintain the rubbish chutes of Pasir Panjang Court do not fall within the list of duties enumerated in s 31(1)(a).
In 
 Butler (or Black) & Anor v Fife Coal Co Lt 
 
 d 
 2 Lord Kinnear said at p 165 that if a statute imposes a penalty for its breach but is silent regarding a civil remedy, one has to consider the scope and purpose of the statute and, in particular, for whose benefit it is intended. Having regard to the scope and purpose of the Act for the establishment of a management corporation for the management of the common property of a sub-divided building and the nature of the statutory duties imposed by the Act on such a management corporation, I am of the view that a breach of a statutory duty imposed by the Act on a management corporation does not give rise to any civil liability. By enacting the criminal penalty in s 45(1) and the specific remedy in s 45(2), I am of the view that Parliament did not intend that the breach be actionable by the plaintiff who is both a subsidiary proprietor and a member of the management corporation and who has to make contributions to the management fund of the management corporation in order to provide the necessary finances for the management corporation to discharge its functions and duties under the Act.
Although I have arrived at the conclusion that a breach of a statutory duty under the Act by a management corporation does not give rise to any civil liability, I ought to mention that it is expressly provided by s 35 of the Act that a breach of any of the byelaws set out in the Second Schedule to the Act will give rise to a civil liability. The relevant provisions of s 35 of the Act read: 
 
By-laws for regulation of subdivided building
 
 
 
 
(1) Every subdivided building shown in a strata title plan shall be regulated by by-laws which shall provide for the control, management, administration, use and enjoyment of the lots and the common property. 
 
(2) The by-laws shall include the by-laws set out in the Second Schedule which shall not be added to, amended or repealed by the management corporation. 
 
... 
 
(5) The by-laws for the time being in force in respect of the subdivided building shall bind the management corporation and the subsidiary proprietors to the same extent as if they constituted properly executed agreements - 
 
(a) on the part of the management corporation with the subsidiary proprietors; and 
 
(b) on the part of each subsidiary proprietor with every other subsidiary proprietor and with the management corporation, 
 
to observe and perform all the provisions of the by-laws. 
 
... 
 
(11) The management corporation or any subsidiary proprietor shall be entitled to apply to the court - 
 
(a) for an order to enforce the performance of or restrain the breach of any by-law by; or 
 
(b) to recover damages for any loss or injury to person or property arising out of the breach of any by-law from, 
 
any person bound to comply therewith, the management corporation or the administrator, and the court may make such order against any such person, the management corporation or the members of its council, or the administrator, as the court thinks fit.
  
 
 
Whether or not the plaintiff`s cause of action is founded on the tort of negligence or a breach of any of the byelaws in the Second Schedule to the Act, the plaintiff must establish that the breach of the duty of care or any of the byelaws caused the damage to the plaintiff`s household items. It has not been pleaded by the defenthat they do not owe to the plaintiff a duty under the common law or the Act to maintain the rubbish chutes properly. There is therefore no necessity for me to decide on the question whether or not a duty of care is owed by the defendants to maintain the rubbish chutes properly. I shall now examine the evidence to determine whether or not the failure to maintain the rubbish chutes properly caused the rats to breed in the chutes and the rats thereby caused damage to the plaintiff`s household items.
At the trial before the district judge, only the plaintiff and one Ong Chin Eng (DW1), who was a member of the council of the defendant management corporation from 1982 to 1983 and the chairperson of the council from 1986 to 1987, gave evidence. I shall only deal with the evidence relevant to the question whether the rats in the rubbish chute caused the damage to the plaintiff`s household items.
 The plaintiff`s evidence
The plaintiff`s evidence was that he purchased his flat in 1979 in the joint names of himself and his wife. At an emergency meeting of the defendants held on 16 July 1983, a resolution was passed requiring the subsidiary proprietor of each flat in Pasir Panjang Court to contribute the sum of $2,200 for the repainting of the two blocks of apartments in the development as well as the repair of the bin chutes, parapet wall, etc. That would raise the sum of $61,600 for the repairs. The plaintiff`s testimony was `the rubbish chutes had corroded showing big holes and one side of the chute was missing in one of the blocks`. The minutes of that meeting (record of appeal at p 55) show that the plaintiff was present at the meeting and that he even proposed that all subsidiary proprietors pay a bit more to have all repairs done properly.
According to the plaintiff only the repainting was done in 1983 and it cost about $40,000. He said the defendants might have repaired the main chute but not the common chutes.
The plaintiff said nothing was done to the chutes and he kept bringing the matter up at subsequent annual general meetings. He referred to several letters of complaints of his to the defendants and to the minutes of the meetings held by the defendants.
The plaintiff`s flat is located on the ground floor. The kitchen of his flat has louvre windows. His unit is served by a refuse chute which has an opening in his flat. The opening has a lid which is normally in a closed position. The plaintiff`s testimony is as follows: 
 
... The rats entered through the rubbish chutes. They entered my house, eaten the electrical wires of my cooker.
 
 
 
Wires of cooker tendered, identified and marked as [exh] P7.
As a result, my oven and cooking heaters could not work. I spent two months to catch these rats and there was no other way for the rats to come in except through the chute.
I tried to change the wires but the agent could not find a replacement. The electrician could not repair the wires. The oven and the cooker are not working then. These wires are inside the cooker and because they were damaged, the cooker could not function.
In the cooker hood, the rats were breeding there. I had sent the hood for repair but the wires were gone. It cannot be repaired. The rats had also eaten a big section of the curtain ie the gauze curtain. I bought the cooker in 1979 at $480. The whole new curtains were bought for $800.
The plaintiff`s testimony (record of appeal at p 43) further reads: 
 
I had suffered damages. The cooker and cooker hood were purchased by me. I had a lot of mental anguish in claiming for the damages, running after the management corporation, loss of sleep in trying to catch the rodents. I had to give up a lot of assignments as I had to take action on the rats. My children were going to school. Personally, I had suffered a loss of sleep, loss of earnings, loss of standing when my friends came and saw the condition of the house, lots of rats, traps, etc. ...
 
 
 
The plaintiff referred to his letter dated 22 April 1985 to the defendants which states, inter alia: 
 
Finally, it is over two years since my cooker and hood have been put out of action by rodents eating away the electric wire cables within each unit. As the management corporation do not intend to repair the rubbish chute and thereby destroy the breeding nest within the holed/wasted rubbish chute, I hold you and the council, jointly and severally, liable for the damage and loss of cooking facilities thereby depriving me and my family of proper cooking facilities and cooked food.
 
 
 
As stated in my previous letters, I have no intention of paying one single cent to the management corporation till my losses are made good and suitable compensation paid to me for loss of peace and cooking facilities, cooked food, etc. because of rodents running around the house.
Although the above letter referred to previous letters written by the plaintiff to the defendants, I ought to mention that the letters written by the plaintiff to the defendants prior to 22 April 1985 which are reproduced in the agreed bundle of documents make no reference to rats.
In his letter dated 4 May 1984 to the defendants, the plaintiff put on record many of his complaints. None of them referred to rats or the rubbish chutes which were not maintained properly. In that letter he made it clear that he had `no intention of paying any further maintenance charges or charges that may be levied unless matters are set right`.
In his letter dated 21 January 1985 to the defendants, the plaintiff said, inter alia: 
 
I now wish to put on record that I have no intention of paying any moneys due to you on maintenance until and unless:
 
 
 
 
(1) KCPL has been charged 10% interest for not paying up in advance. 
 
(2) The rubbish chute base plate of apartment is repaired by NPCPL. 
 
...
  
 
 
If within seven days from your receipt of this letter I do not receive a reply from you, I shall without reference to you institute appropriate proceedings to redress threats and intimidation.
 
 
 
In this letter he listed nine complaints which he requested the management corporation to take action immediately.
The plaintiff produced photographs of his flat and the refuse chute. They were admitted and marked as exhs P1A to P1D, P2A to P2D, P3A to P3D, P4A to P4C, P5A to P5C and P6A to P6B. In cross-examination, he admitted that they were taken during the period between 25 September 1987 and 2 February 1990. When he was asked whether he took any photographs during the period between October 1982 and 26 January 1987, his answer was: `Yes, but I could not locate them. I will produce [them] if I could recover them.` (Record of appeal at p 51.) During his re-examination, the plaintiff said the photographs produced by him show `old damages` and the damages were there since 1983.
The following is the plaintiff`s testimony during his cross-examination (record of appeal at p 46): 
 
 
Q: [Exh P6B] - Rodents entered into your premises via the rubbish chute shown in [exh] P6B. The chute cover in your unit is in a closed position when not in use? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: If so, how did the rodents find their way to your flat? 
 
A: This lid inside my unit is in hinges on top and it closes on the aperture of the chute. The rats could push their way through as it is not a tight-fitting lid as they have in HDB flats. 
 
Q: Do you have photographs to show on that? 
 
A: The photographs are as in [exhs] P1 to P6. 
 
Q: Notwithstanding that the chute is in a closed position, the rats would push their way by entering through the hopper? 
 
A: I am not suggesting anything. These are facts.
  
 
 
During cross-examination, it was put to the plaintiff that the rats could enter his flat by other means, viz the shallow drain around his flat and the window louvres of his flat. It was also put to the plaintiff that even if the rubbish chute was repaired to his satisfaction, rats could still breed in the chute simply for the reason that the rubbish chute contained garbage and rubbish. He also denied a suggestion that the rats could exist in his flat as a result of poor housekeeping and not the rubbish chute (record of appeal at pp 47-48).
At p 50 of the record of appeal, the plaintiff`s evidence during his cross-examination was: 
 
 
Q: Since the replacement of the cooker oven, did you encounter any attacks by the rodents on your new cooker oven, cooker hood or other electrical appliances? 
 
A: The rodents disappeared sometime in 1985 just before the patching-up in October 1985 because of the daily clearance of the rubbish chute. The drains are also clean and no rodents came any more. 
 
Q: Since 1982 to 1985, did you encounter similar damages by rodents to your electrical appliances? 
 
A: The rodents had been persistent from 1982 to the beginning of 1985 and they had always attacked the same place right from the beginning. They had run around the house and that was how they damaged the other parts of the house.
  
 
 
 
 Evidence for the defendants
 
Mdm Ong Chin Eng (DW1) who is a senior housing and maintenance inspector with the Housing and Development Board gave evidence for the defendants. She was a council member of the defendants from 1982 to 1983. She was the chairperson of the council of the defendants from 1986 to 1987. She said she was present at the meeting of 16 July 1983 when a resolution was passed by the defendants raising the capital levy of $2,200. In her evidence in chief, she said (record of appeal at p 76): 
 
If the rubbish chute in my unit is in a closed position, it is not possible for rodents to push their way through the hook of the chute. The hopper is such that it has to be opened upwards and it is made of iron. It would be too heavy for the rat to push it from inside. Someone has to open or pull the hopper from outside.
 
 
 
At pp 93 to 94 of the record of appeal, Mdm Ong`s evidence during her cross-examination was: 
 
 
Q: If there were holes in the rubbish chute, rodents can enter them? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: In the use of the plaintiff`s rubbish chute, he did make complaints on the damage? 
 
A: Yes. The plaintiff claimed that the Ministry of Environment also complained. 
 
Q: Did any management corporation member go and have a look at the rubbish chute? 
 
A: During one of the complaints, I remembered that there was a hole in the rubbish chute which was slightly bigger than a 50-cent coin. I cannot remember whether rats could get in through the hole. We changed the rubbish chutes because they were corroded but not because of the rat problem. Corrosion could also be that the surface had worn off. 
 
Q: PB6 - Is this chute entering the house? 
 
A: This is the chute chamber where we put the bin. 
 
Q: Was repair work done to the opening end of the rubbish chute? 
 
A: I knew some repairs were done in 1985 to the bin chute.
  
 
 
 
 Principles applicable to the review
 
In reviewing this case, I took into account the following principles: Firstly, an appellate court should not lightly differ from findings of fact of the trial judge. However, where there is no question of credibility of witnesses, but the sole question is the proper inference to be drawn from specific facts, an appellate court is in as good a position to evaluate the evidence of the trial judge, and should form its own independent opinion though it should give weight to the opinion of the trial judge: see 
Benmax v Austin Motor Co Ltd
 
[1955] 1 All ER 326
 Secondly, where there is any conflict of evidence and where the objective evidence can help to resolve such conflict, the evidence of witnesses can be evaluated against the objective evidence. Thirdly, this being a civil case, the standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities.
 Analysis of the evidence
The evidence is that there was a hole in the rubbish chute serving the plaintiff`s flat. The hole is slightly bigger than a 50-cent coin. Even if the rats could squeeze through that hole and breed in the refuse chutes, the question which then arises is whether the rats in the refuse chutes entered the plaintiff`s flat. It is not in dispute that there is a lid on the opening to the chute inside the plaintiff`s flat. It is always in a closed position. The plaintiff claimed that it was not tight-fitting and rats could push through the lid and enter the flat. It was put to the plaintiff that rats could enter his flat through other sources.
It was DW1`s evidence that the opening of the chute in every flat including the plaintiff`s had a cover made of iron and rats cannot get into a flat through that opening since the hopper is in a closed position. It is not possible for the rats to push their way into a flat through the hopper when it is in a closed position. It was never put to DW1 that the rats could find their way into the plaintiff`s flat through the opening to the chute by pushing their way through the opening notwithstanding that there is a lid which is always in a closed position.
The plaintiff`s flat is on the ground floor. The photograph marked as exh P2-F shows both the rubbish chute and the louvre windows of the plaintiff`s flat. In my view the district judge erred in drawing the inference that the rats entered the plaintiff`s flat through the rubbish chutes. He failed to consider that the opening in the plaintiff`s flat to the chute had a lid which was in a closed position at all times. The lid was made of iron. The plaintiff did not complain that the lid on the opening was damaged or that there was a hole in the lid. The district judge also failed to consider that the rats could have entered his flat through that window or by other means.
The plaintiff has not produced the damaged household items or photographs of the damage caused to those items by rats. He produced some wires (exh P7) which in my view gave no indication that they were damaged by rats. Counsel for the plaintiff submitted before me that the evidence of the damage to the household items were all set out in the further and better particulars filed by the plaintiff pursuant to the request made by the defendant. He drew my attention to the fact that the plaintiff confirmed the further and better particulars to be true in his evidence-in-chief (record of appeal at p 43). In my opinion, the confirmation of the further and better particulars by the plaintiff does not have the same result as producing the damaged items before the court as primary evidence or at least photographs which show the damaged household items. There was therefore neither evidence before the district judge of the damaged household items nor evidence to link the rats in the rubbish chute to the damage (if any) caused to the household items. In my view the plaintiff failed to prove the damage to his household items were caused by rats.
Illustration (g) to s 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) provides that the court may presume that evidence which could be produced and is not produced would, if produced, be unfavourable to the person who withholds it. In my opinion the district judge also erred in not drawing an adverse inference from the plaintiff`s failure to produce the damaged household items or photographs of the damaged items.
For the reasons given above, I allowed the appeal with costs here and in the court below.

Cur Adv Vult
 
On 26 June 1983 at or about 1.10pm, one Lee Kok Chye (the deceased) was riding his motor cycle No AW8990G along Kampong Bahru Road towards the direction of Jalan Bukit Merah when he met with an accident in front of No 522 Kampong Bahru Road, Cold Storage quarters. He suffered injuries and was taken to the Singapore General Hospital where he died on 27 June 1983 at or about 3.45pm. The deceased`s death certificate (PB5) states that the cause of death was (a) a lacerated brain and (b) a fractured skull. At the time of his death the deceased left behind a father aged 51 years and a mother aged 47 years. The deceased was a bachelor, aged 24 years, at the time of his death 
 . 
 A sketch plan of the accident made by Sgt Teoh Hin Huat of the traffic accidents investigation section of the Traffic Police shows that the deceased`s motor cycle was lying on its offside at the entrance leading to the gate of No 522 Kampong Bahru Road, Cold Storage quarters. The said sketch plan shows that the motor cycle was lying just outside the left edge of Kampong Bahru Road as one faces the direction of Jalan Bukit Merah.
The deceased`s father, Lee Ngiap Hoon (the plaintiff), as the administrator of the estate of the deceased, brought this action against the defendant claiming damages for the benefit of the dependants of the deceased as well as damages for the benefit of the estate of the deceased under the Civil Law Act (Cap 30, 1970 Ed).
The case for the plaintiff as pleased in para 2 of his statement of claim is as follows: 
 
On 26 June 1983, at or about 1.10pm the deceased was lawfully riding his motor cycle No AW8990G along Kampong Bahru Road towards the direction of Jalan Bukit Merah and at or about the gate of No 522 Kampong Bahru Road the defendant drove a motor trailer No X1078T along Kampong Bahru Road in the same direction towards Jalan Bukit Merah too closely to the said motor cycle when passing it that he caused or permitted the same to collide with the deceased and to knock him to the ground thereby resulting in his death.
 
 
 
The plaintiff gave evidence before this court and no other witness was called to adduce evidence for the plaintiff`s case. The plaintiff`s testimony was that his son was killed in a road accident at Kampong Bahru Road at or about 1.10pm. He was told by the police that his son was knocked down by a lorry. His son was riding a motor cycle at that time. After the accident, he saw his son at the hospital. He went to the scene of the accident subsequently and met a Malay man who told him that his son was knocked down by a lorry. The plaintiff said he is not able to find the Malay man since he did not take down the latter`s name and address when he spoke to him. The Malay man cannot be traced now. When the plaintiff went back to the scene of the accident to look for the Malay man, he found that the row of houses which was there at the time of the accident had been demolished.
The plaintiff relied on the police report made by the defendant on 27 June 1983 (PB1-2) as evidence that the defendant`s vehicle was involved in a collision with the deceased`s motor cycle. The said report states, inter alia, that: 
 
On 26 June 1983 at 1330 hours while travelling along Kampong Bahru Road suddenly one m/taxi number, unknown forgotten to take down, came and hon [sic] on me [the defendant]. When I stop, the taxi driver informed me that I had [been] involved in an accident with a m/cycle No 8990 ref unknow[n] (forgotten). I stop my vehicle. I went to the accident scene and found out one m/cycle was lying on [the] road and [the] rider was unconscious later conveyed to hospital by ambulance.
 
 
 
Counsel for the defendant objected to the admissibility of the police report (PB1-3) on the ground that the maker of the report was not called as witness. I overruled the objection on the ground that an order of court dated 19 January 1987 states that the following documents would be admissible in evidence at the trial without calling as witnesses the makers of the documents: 
 
 
(a) the police report made by the defendant (PB1-2); 
 
(b) the sketch plan together with the legend to the plan made by Sgt Teoh Hin Huat (PB3-4); and 
 
(c) the police damage report dated 15 October 1983 (PB5).
  
 
 
At the close of the plaintiff`s case, counsel for the defendant submitted that there was no case for the defendant to answer as there was no evidence (except the statement of the taxi driver) to show that the accident was caused by the negligence of the defendant and what the Malay man told the plaintiff was but hearsay evidence. Counsel also submitted that the statement made by the taxi driver who was not called as a witness was admissible as evidence of the fact that the statement was made, but that it was inadmissible, being hearsay, if it was to be evidence of the truth of the statement: see 
Subramaniam v PP
 
[1956] 1 WLR 965
 I then informed the defendant`s counsel that I would not rule on his submission of no case to answer unless he elected not to adduce evidence for the defendant`s case. Counsel then elected to call the defendant to give evidence.
The evidence of the defendant is briefly as follows. On 26 June 1983, he was driving the trailer X1078T from Pasir Panjang in the direction of Tanjong Rhu. It was a Sunday. As he drove along Kampong Bahru Road, a taxi driver sounded his horn and asked him to stop. The taxi driver told him that a motor cycle had collided into the rear of his vehicle. He stopped his vehicle and walked to the scene of the accident to take a look. He walked for about 200ft from where he stopped his vehicle. When he reached the gate of No 522 Kampong Bahru Road, he saw a motor cycle lying at the entrance leading to the gate and the rider lying on the ground. The rider was conscious and moaning and was bleeding from his mouth. The defendant said the rider did not appear to have suffered serious injuries. The defendant did not see him wearing any helmet. Neither did he notice any helmet lying anywhere around.
The police arrived at the scene about 15 minutes later. When the police inquired as to what happened, the defendant told the police what he said in his police report. The police asked for his identity card and took down his particulars. They told him to go to Maxwell Police Station to make a report on the following day. The defendant said in his evidence-in-chief that when he made the police report, he did not think that he had caused the accident because he did not feel any impact on or collision with his vehicle. When he checked his trailer he did not find any damage to his vehicle. He told this court that he made the police report because he was told by the police to do so. The defendant said he did not know how the motor cycle rider fell. Two or three days after the accident he was asked by the police to send his vehicle for inspection. He did not know what the result of the inspection was. The defendant also said that he did not believe the taxi driver when the latter told him that a motor cycle had collided into the rear of his vehicle.
The defendant said he had been driving for more than ten years before the accident. The traffic conditions along Kampong Bahru Road that day were light. It was a Sunday. He said he was driving at a speed of approximately 30km/h. He could not travel fast because his vehicle was loaded with iron bars. The road was dry.
During cross-examination, the defendant said that Kampong Bahru Road had two lanes, one each for traffic travelling in opposite directions. He was driving his vehicle near the left edge of the road, about one or two feet away. When his trailer passed the gate of No 522 Kampong Bahru Road, he did not notice whether there was any other vehicle in front of, beside or behind his trailer. The defendant denied a suggestion that he drove his trailer very close to the edge of the road and that his trailer collided with the motor cycle when his trailer went past the motor cycle.
 Liability
Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the defendant had, in his police report, made an admission that his vehicle was involved in an accident with the motor cycle AW8990G. A taxi driver had told him that his vehicle was involved in an accident. He did not deny that. He went to the scene and waited for the police. In court, the defendant now says that he did not know of the accident. However, the police sketch plan (PB3) which shows the position of the motor cycle and the cyclist after the collision suggests that the cyclist was riding close to the edge of the road when the collision took place. He contended that the maxim res ipsa loquitur applies to the instant case. In support of his contention, he cited para 112 at p 42 and para 93 at p 35 of 
 Charlesworth on Negligence 
 (1962 Ed).
Counsel for the defendant submitted that the plaintiff has not proved on a balance of probability that the accident which resulted in the death of Lee Kok Chye was caused by the defendant or the negligence of the defendant. There was no witness before this court giving direct evidence of how the accident happened. He contended that an impartial independent vehicle report from the police (PB5) indicates that there are no scratch marks, and neither damage nor blood stains on the defendant`s motor trailer. He also drew attention to the fact that the defendant was not charged for careless driving or any other criminal offence. The only evidence available in the present case is the following: 
 
 
(a) the defendant`s testimony that a taxi driver told him that a motor cycle collided into the rear of his trailer; and 
 
(b) the plaintiff`s testimony that one day after the accident a Malay man told him that his son was involved in an accident with a lorry.
  
 
 
Counsel for the defendant submitted that these two statements are hearsay evidence. The statement made by the taxi driver to the defendant is only admissible to show the fact that the statement was made but it is inadmissible and hearsay if it goes to prove the truth of the statement. He cited the decision of the Privy Council in the case of 
Subramaniam v PP
 
[1956] 1 WLR 965
 in support of his contention.
For the maxim of res ipsa loquitur to apply, counsel for the defendant contended that there must be evidence to show that the defendant was involved in an accident. If the evidence of the Malay man and the taxi driver is excluded under the rule against hearsay evidence, he submitted that the plaintiff has no evidence to show that the accident was caused by the defendant. He referred to 
 Aw & Ors v PP 
 ,2 where it was held that if a document was not admissible, it did not become admissible merely because counsel failed to object to its admission. He submitted that the segment of the police report containing the statement made by the taxi driver is inadmissible.
Counsel for the defendant also contended that the plaintiff has not established any facts for the maxim of res ipsa loquitur to apply. He cited para 112 at p 42 and para 114 at p 43 of 
 Charlesworth on Negligence 
 (1962 Ed). He submitted that the plaintiff might have lost control of his motor cycle and fallen off his motor cycle thereby meeting his death. The police vehicle damage report (PB5) states that the defendant`s vehicle did not suffer any damage and in the case of the deceased`s motor cycle, it states that the handle bar was bent slightly and the mirrors broken. The defendant`s counsel submitted that if the two vehicles were to collide side by side, then the offside of the motor cycle would have been damaged, but it was not in this case. He asked this court to place more emphasis on evidence from independent sources: see 
 Murugan v Lew Chu Cheong 
 .3 He also stressed the fact that the police have not charged the defendant for dangerous driving causing the death of the deceased. He submitted that there was no evidence before the police which points to the defendant as having caused the accident.
On the question of whether there is any evidence before this court which points to the defendant`s vehicle being involved in a collision with the deceased`s motor cycle, I find that the defendant has made an admission in the police report that he was involved in a collision with the deceased`s motor cycle. The police report consists of two pages. On p 1 of the document, the defendant put ticks in various boxes under the following headings: 
 
 
(a) informant`s particulars; 
 
(b) general information of the accident; 
 
(c) particulars of vehicle, driver and passengers for which this report is made; and 
 
(d) particulars of the other vehicles involved.
  
 
 
A brief description of the accident is given by the defendant on p 2 of the police report. In the report he admitted that he was involved in a collision with the deceased`s motor cycle. Even if I were to disregard the segment of the report on p 2 relating to the statement made by the taxi driver because it is inadmissible for the purpose of establishing the truth of the statement, I have no hesitation in arriving at the conclusion that the defendant was involved in the accident with the deceased.
In his testimony the defendant said he made the report because he was told by the police to do so. He did not feel any impact and his vehicle showed no signs of damage. If at the time of the accident the defendant was sure that his vehicle was not involved in a collision with the deceased`s motor cycle, then he should have stated in his police report that he did not think that he was involved in any collision with the deceased`s motor cycle and that he did not believe what was told to him by the taxi driver. As the defendant was driving a heavy vehicle loaded with iron bars, it is unlikely that he could have felt anything at all when it hit or touched the deceased`s motor cycle. The motor cycle is a two-wheel vehicle and it will fall if it is grazed by another vehicle travelling beside it. I have considered the contention of the defendant`s counsel that the deceased might have lost control of his motor cycle and fallen. I have ruled that out as a possibility because the road was dry at the time of the accident and the traffic was light.
Having arrived at the conclusion that the defendant`s vehicle was involved in a collision with the deceased`s motor cycle; and in view of the fact that the police sketch plan shows that the motor cycle was lying beyond the left edge of Kampong Bahru Road and the rider had fallen at the entrance leading to the gate of No 522 Kampong Bahru Road, I am of the view that the inference to be drawn from them is more consistent with negligence on the part of the defendant than any other cause. Paragraph 93 at p 35 of 
 Charlesworth on Negligence 
 (1962 Ed) states: 
 Facts more consistent with defendant`s negligence than other causes 
 
 
There is evidence of negligence if the facts proved and the inferences to be drawn from them are more consistent with negligence on the part of the defendant than with other causes. Negligence may reasonably be inferred from facts which make it more probable that it was negligence on the part of the defendant which caused the damage in question than any other cause ... .
 
 
 
The stretch of the road in question has only two lanes and the defendant said he was driving his trailer close to the edge of the road. He could have driven it too close to the deceased`s motor cycle and grazed it. The police vehicle damage report shows that the handle bar of the deceased`s motor cycle was bent slightly and its mirrors were broken. From the facts which have been proved before me, I am of the view that the plaintiff has succeeded in establishing a prima facie case of negligence against the defendant and unless the defendant rebuts this prima facie case which he may do so by proving that the motor cyclist collided into the rear of his vehicle or that the collision was due to a specific cause and such cause was not due to any lack of care on his part, or that the event is due to some cause unknown but he himself throughout exercised reasonable care.
The defendant`s evidence was that the taxi driver told him that a motor cycle had collided into the rear of his vehicle. If what the taxi driver said is true then the defendant would have succeeded in rebutting the prima facie case of negligence established by the plaintiff. I note what the defendant said in this court is different from the brief description of the accident given by him in his police report. In the latter, the defendant said that a taxi driver told him that 
 his vehicle had collided with a motor cycle 
 . The report did not say that the taxi driver told him that 
 a motor cycle collided into the rear of his vehicle 
 . The police report is a contemporaneous document and it is very likely to have recorded the actual version of what the taxi driver told the defendant. In cross-examination, the defendant said that he told the police that the taxi driver told him that a motor cycle collided into the rear of his vehicle and he did not know how it was recorded by the police. If the deceased`s motor cycle had collided into the rear of the plaintiff`s trailer, the motor cycle would have sustained damage. The police damage report shows that the motor cycle suffered damage which is inconsistent with the allegation made by the defendant. The accident occurred almost eight years ago. Having seen the demeanour of the defendant in the witness box, I do not believe that he is telling the truth when he said that the taxi driver told him that the motor cycle collided into the rear of his vehicle. Even if he is telling the truth, then the statement of the taxi driver is only admissible for the purpose of proving the fact that the statement was made to the defendant and not admissible for proving the truth of the statement: see 
 Subramaniam v PP 
 .1
 Quantum
I now deal with the assessment of damages which should be awarded to the plaintiff. The cause of action having arisen in 1983, the claim for the estate of the deceased was made under s 8 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43) (`the Act`) before the coming into force of the 1987 amendments. For loss of expectation of life, the parties agreed that it should be $6,500. The plaintiff claims the sum of $8,000 for pain and suffering of the deceased. The deceased was unconscious soon after the accident and he died one day after the accident. I make no award for pain and suffering.
In assessing the damages to be awarded for loss of earnings for the `lost years`, the authorities make it clear that this court should take an appropriate multiplier and a multiplicand: see 
 Lee Wee Hiong & Ors v Victor Koh Ah Sai & Ors 
 ;4 
 Chan Heng Wah & Anor v Peh Thiam Choh & Anor 
 .5 The multiplier of 36 years suggested by the plaintiff`s counsel is out of line with those in comparable cases. The multiplier adopter in each of the following cases is 15: 
 Lai Chi Kay & Ors v Lee Kuo Shin 
 ;6 
 Low Kok Tong v Teo Chan Pan 
 ;7 
 Lai Wee Lian v Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd 
 ;8 and 
 Chan Heng Wah 
 `s case.5 The defendant`s counsel suggested and I accept a multiplier of 15 years for the instant case. The deceased was 24 years of age at the time of his death. There is still the problem of determining the multiplicand. Counsel for the plaintiff suggested that I use the figure of $350 per month which is the amount which the plaintiff claims that the deceased gave to his parents each month. Counsel for the defendant submitted that the plaintiff`s evidence is that the deceased was earning $410 per month. Having regard to the then prevailing rates of CPF contributions, he submitted that the deceased`s take-home pay was only $319.80. Therefore, it was impossible for the deceased to have contributed $350 per month to his parents. The plaintiff`s testimony is that the deceased had an active social life and he does go out with friends. The defendant`s counsel submitted that the deceased`s contribution to his parents was more likely to be the sum of $150 per month. He submitted that the appropriate multiplicand should be the sum of $150 [times ] 12 months (ie $1,800 pa). He also referred this court to 
 Mohamed bin Ahmad & Anor v Tan Hing Cha 
 
 i 
 9 and 
 Koh Kin Lee & Anor v OA 
 ,10 and submitted that in view of the age and social life of the deceased, the available surplus should be computed as follows: $150 [times ] 12 months [times ] 15 years [times ] 30% = $8,100.
With due respect to the defendant`s counsel, I think he is somewhat confused. For the assessment of the loss of earnings for the `lost years`, Yong Pung How J (as he then was) in the 
 Lee Wee Hiong 
 case4 stated that the multiplicand should be the average net earnings of the deceased over the relevant period of years, if he had lived and the multiplicand by its very nature does not readily allow itself to be an exercise of mathematical precision, including possibly separate calculations for different periods of his working life. What is needed is a fair and reasonable assessment of what the net future earnings of the deceased might be, bearing in mind that earnings are subject to the vagaries of life 
 . 
 Although the plaintiff said in his evidence-in-chief that the deceased earned $410 per month, I believe that the deceased`s gross salary per month was in fact much more. The letters of administration granted to the plaintiff shows that the deceased had a sum of $1,258.78 in his POSB account and that the deceased had taken out a life assurance policy with the Public Life Assurance Co Ltd. The plaintiff`s evidence is that the deceased was attending night classes. In the instant case, having regard to the facts and having considered the usual contingencies and speculative elements, I am of the view that a net income of $10,000 per year would be fair, after adding the employer`s CPF contributions and after making allowances and proof income tax and taking into account any increases in salaries which the deceased might be entitled to. Applying the multiplier of 15 years that would give a figure of $150,000.
From this estimate of loss of earnings during the lost years, there should be deducted the amount which the deceased would have spent exclusively for his own living and other expenses, as these would be expenses which would be saved in consequence of his death. In 
 Chan Heng Wah 
 `s case,5 the court came to the conclusion that the available surplus should be 40% of the net earnings. Accordingly, I arrive at the sum of $60,000.
The amounts of $2,500 and $1,000 claimed by the plaintiff for funeral expenses and obtaining the grant of letters of administration respectively are agreed to by the defendant`s counsel.
The deceased left a father 51 years of age and a mother 47 years of age at the time of his death. The plaintiff`s evidence is that the deceased gave his parents $350 per month for support. Having regard to the submissions of counsel for the plaintiff and the defendant, I assess the damages for pre-trial loss of support of $150 per month with a multiplier of eight years, amounting to $14,400 and I assess the future loss of support of $150 per month with a multiplier of seven years, amounting to $12,600. As the dependants are also the same beneficiaries of the estate, the dependency claim will merge with the estate`s claim for loss of expectation of life and lost years` earnings: see 
 Lee Wee Hiong & Anor v Victor Koh 
 .4
Damages to the plaintiff for the estate of the deceased should therefore be: 
 
 
(1) General damages: $ 
 
(a) Loss of expectation of life 6,500 
 
(b) Loss of earnings for the lost years 60,000 
 
(2) Special damages: 
 
(a) Funeral expenses (agreed) 2,500 
 
(b) Cost of letters of administration (agreed) 1,000 
 
70,000
  
 
 
Accordingly, there shall be judgment against the defendant for the sum of $70,000. The special damages should be paid to the deceased`s father. Section 9 of the Civil Law Act empowers the court to award interest on damages. Interest should be calculated at 6% pa on the amounts for loss of expectation of life and for special damages from the date of the issue of the writ to the date of judgment. As the deceased died intestate, the general damages should be apportioned one half to the father and one half to the mother. There will also be an order as to the costs of the plaintiff to be taxed and paid by the defendant and the usual consequential orders.

The respondent was convicted on 28 July 1991 by a district court on his own plea on a charge of driving while under the influence of drink on 9 June 1990 under s 67(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (`the Act`). He was sentenced to a fine of $1,000, in default three months` imprisonment, and he was disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for four years.
The respondent was also charged and convicted on two other road traffic-related charges, but these are not of any relevance to the matter before this court. He had previously on 5 March 1990 been convicted on a similar charge of driving while under the influence of drink under s 67(1) of the Act before it was amended. This conviction is relevant to the question before this court.
Section 67(1) of the Act was amended with effect from 2 April 1990 in such a way that the punishment for both first time and repeat offenders was increased. Section 67(1) before the amendment read as follows: 
 
Any person who, when driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a road or other public place, is under the influence of drink or of a drug to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of such vehicle, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, 
 and in the case of a second or subsequent conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both
. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
Section 67(1) after the amendment reads as follows: 
 
Any person who, when driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a road or other public place, is under the influence of drink or of a drug to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of such vehicle shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months 
 and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine
 of not less than $3,000 and not more than $10,000 and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months.
 
 
 
The amendment was effected by s 18 of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act No 7 of 1990 (`the Amendment Act`), by expressly repealing the pre-existing s 67(1) and substituting the new section.
The punishment introduced by the amendment can be summarized as follows. Before the amendment, for first offenders, it was either a fine or imprisonment. For repeat offenders, the punishment was a fine or imprisonment, or both, although, as to be expected, the limits prescribed were higher for repeat offenders than for first offenders. There was no provision for a minimum fine or imprisonment for either first or repeat offenders, although the maximum, of course, was provided.
The position after the amendment is that for first offenders, there is still the alternative of a fine or imprisonment, but a minimum is imposed for the fine, though not for the imprisonment. For repeat offenders, the penalty has been drastically enhanced. They are now subject to both a minimum fine and a mandatory term of imprisonment.
As the offence of which the respondent was convicted was committed after the date of coming into force of the amendment, it is not disputed that he was properly charged under the amended section.
The dispute is whether in sentencing him the court should consider him to be a repeat offender or a first offender. If his previous conviction under the section before it was amended could properly be taken into account, then he was liable to a fine with a minimum of $3,000 and a maximum of $10,000 
 and 
 a mandatory term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months. If the previous conviction under the pre-amended section could not properly be taken into account, then he was liable only to a fine with a minimum of $1,000 and a maximum of $5,000 
 or 
 imprisonment not exceeding six months.
The district judge who heard the case at first instance imposed a fine of $1,000, apparently treating the respondent as a first offender under the amended s 67(1). In his grounds of decision, however, the district judge took the view that the respondent should have been treated as a second offender punishable with a minimum fine of $3,000 and a mandatory sentence of imprisonment. He said therefore that the $1,000 he had imposed was an error.
The public prosecutor, being dissatisfied with the sentence as imposed by the district judge, appealed to the High Court. The question which we now have to decide was argued before FA Chua J. On 4 February 1991, the learned judge gave his decision on the point.1 He said [at p 505]: 
 
Now is this a second conviction of the respondent under s 67(1)? Under the repealed section the court had a discretion as to the punishment. Under the re-enacted section, the court has no discretion as to the punishment.
 
 
 
A distinction should be made between an amendment by deletion or insertion of words from or into an existing legislation, and an amendment by the repeal of the whole section and substituting therefor a new section. The re-enacted s 67(1) is in fact a new section.
Article 11(1) of the Constitution of Singapore protects a person against retrospective criminal laws.
In my view the respondent was charged and convicted under the re-enacted s 67(1) for the first time, notwithstanding that he had been dealt with under the repealed s 67(1) once before on 5 March 1990.
To treat the respondent as a second offender under the re-enacted section is to apply the re-enacted section to him retrospectively. The words preceding the provision for punishment of a second or subsequent offender under the re-enacted s 67(1) are `in the case of a second or subsequent conviction`. These words can only mean a second or subsequent conviction under the re-enacted s 67(1).
On 27 February 1991, FA Chua J varied the sentence from the fine of $1,000 to one of imprisonment for one month, the order of disqualification to stand. He also ordered a refund of the fine of $1,000 which the respondent had already paid. In doing so, the learned judge treated the respondent as a first offender under the new s 67(1).
We are informed that the respondent has already served the sentence of one month`s imprisonment.
The public prosecutor applied to the High Court under s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) to reserve the following question of public interest for the decision of this court: 
 
Whether a court, for purposes of sentencing an accused person convicted under s 67(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) as amended by Act 7 of 1990, should take into account his previous conviction under the same section before the amendment and impose a minimum fine of $3,000 and a term of imprisonment?
 
 
 
 
 The arguments
 
The respondent`s counsel`s argument before us consists basically of an exposition of an expansion on the view of the learned judge.
Counsel`s argument may be summarized as follows. Firstly, counsel drew the distinction which the learned judge had drawn in the following passage of his judgment1 [at p 505]: 
 
A distinction should be made between an amendment by deletion or insertion of words from or into an existing legislation, and an amendment by the repeal of the whole section and substituting therefor a new section. The re-enacted s 67(1) is in fact a new section.
 
 
 
Secondly, counsel for the respondent submitted that once a statutory provision is repealed it does not form part of the corpus juris of Singapore. Counsel in his written submission said: 
 
When the new s 67(1) is enacted, reference to a second or subsequent conviction must mean a second or subsequent conviction in connection with the offence of drunken driving and nothing else. The provision creating the offence of drunken driving is the re-enacted s 67(1). Therefore, the offence referred to by the word `conviction` must mean a conviction under the re-enacted s 67(1).
 
 
 
Thirdly, counsel submitted that even if the re-enactment creates an offence which is substantially the same as the offence subject of the repealed provision, the fact remains that the offence in the repealed s 67(1) has ceased to exist. He submitted that the re-enacted s 67(1) creates a new offence, albeit not new in creature but new in so far as it takes effect as from the effective date of the Amendment Act.
Fourthly, on the retrospective operation point, counsel submitted that to sentence the respondent as a second offender under the re-enacted section is to consider his earlier conviction on March 1990 as previous conviction under the re-enacted section. To do this, counsel submitted, is to apply the re-enacted section to the respondent retrospectively. Counsel said this is against the common law rule against retrospective operation of studies. He said it is also against art 11(1) of the Constitution.
The submission of Mr Bala Reddy, deputy public prosecutor, may be summarized as follows. Firstly, he submitted, a distinction should be drawn between a repeal and an amendment of a statutory provision.
Secondly, he submitted that whether a provision has been repealed or amended is a matter of substance and not of form, and the court may and should go behind the words used by Parliament to ascertain whether what has been done is a repeal or an amendment.
Thirdly, he submitted that s 67(1) has merely been amended and has not been repealed, and therefore any previous conviction under the section before the amendment can validly be taken into account for the purpose of imposing a punishment under the re-enacted section.
Fourthly, he submitted that even if the court comes to the view that s 67(1) has been repealed, and not merely amended, since the nature of the offence has not been changed, the previous conviction under the repealed provision can still be taken into account for the purposes of imposing punishment under the re-enacted section. Citing the Canadian case of 
Campbell v The King
 
[] 95 
 the learned deputy public prosecutor submitted that in the present case the repeal and re-enactment must be construed as an affirmation and continuance of the former law.
Lastly, on art 11 of the Constitution, he submitted in essence that there is no contravention of this provision of the Constitution in treating a conviction under the old s 67(1) as a conviction which could be taken into account in deciding whether the respondent is a repeat offender. No new offence was created by the re-enacted section, and therefore there is no contravention of art 11(1).
 Repeal or amendment controversy
We do not think that the question before us could sensibly be decided on the basis whether the former s 67(1) of the Act has been repealed or merely amended. We do not think that for the purpose of resolving the question before us any meaningful distinction can be drawn between a repeal and an amendment.
We are aware that, as stated earlier, the Amendment Act expressly repealed the old s 67(1) and substituted the new. We are of the view, however, that this does not assist us in any way in coming to a proper construction of the new section. One only needs to look at the subsection itself to see that the amendment could be effected either by repealing the whole subsection and substituting therefor the new subsection, or by deleting from the old subsection the portion dealing with punishment and inserting the wording of the new enhanced punishment. Either way achieves, editorially and in legal effect, the same result. There is no magic to the use by the draughtsman of the word `repeal`.
There are, of course, situations in which an argument could properly be raised based on a distinction between repeal and amendment. At common law, the distinction, broadly, is this. Subject always to any savings provision which may be made, when a statute is repealed, it is treated as if it had never existed except as to transactions past and closed. What has been done and perfected cannot be disturbed, but the enactment cannot be looked to for assistance for any further purpose. Thus, subordinate legislation, unless saved by the repealing enactment, lapses on the repeal of the provisions under which it was made (see 44 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) at para 971).
On the other hand, when an Act has been amended, the presumption is that it is intended that the Act shall continue to be operative, but, as from the date of the amendment, in its amended form.
The distinction between a repeal and an amendment of an Act raises the sort of question that arose in 
Beaumont v Yeomans
 
[1934] 34 SR (NSW) 562
 a case that went before the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales. In that case, s 105(1) of the Pastures Protection Act 1912 was amended by an Amendment Act of 1918. By a proclamation made under the 1912-1918 Act, these Acts were made applicable to the Narrandera pastures protection district. Subsequently, by a provision of a further Amendment Act of 1920, s 105(1) of the 1912-1918 Act was expressly repealed and a new subsection inserted in its place. However, no proclamation was made declaring the Act of 1912-1918, as amended by the Act of 1920, to apply to any particular district.
The question which the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal had to decide was whether the Act as thus amended applied and was in force in the Narrandera pastures protection district. It was argued for the appellant that s 105(1) had been repealed, that what had been proclaimed to be applicable to the district in question was the repealed subsection; since no proclamation had been made in respect of the new sub-s 105(1), that new subsection had no application.
Jordan CJ in the course of his judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal said: 
 
Whether an Act has been repealed or amended is a matter of substance and not one of form. One Act may purport to amend another by repealing part of it. On the other hand, an amendment may be effected either by the addition to a section of a particular phrase or by the repeal of the section and the substitution of the same words with the phrase added.
 
 
 
The learned Chief Justice held that the amendment to the Act of 1912-1918 made by the Act of 1920 and substituting other similar provisions in its place, was, in substance, an amendment and not a repeal.
In this case before us, no issue such as that which arose in 
Beaumont v Yeomans
 
[1934] 34 SR (NSW) 562
 arises. There is no question concerning the survivability of an act done under a repealed statutory provision which arises here in the way it arose in that case. The conviction of the respondent under s 67(1) before the `repeal` is a fact which did not cease to exist on the `repeal`. (We have placed the word in quotation marks as that is the word used in the Amendment Act but without attaching any significance to it with reference to the `repeal` versus `amendment` argument.) He remained as a person who had been so convicted. Unlike the situation in 
Beaumont v Yeomans
 
[1934] 34 SR (NSW) 562
 there is no question of the `repeal` affecting the subsistence of this fact. The question whether the legislative Act was a repeal or amendment is thus quite devoid of substance in the case before us.
What is before us is simply whether a conviction under s 67(1) before its `repeal` can properly be taken into account when applying the subsection after its `repeal`. The issue is one of construction, of ascertaining the intention of Parliament when enacting the new provision.
We have no doubt at all that what Parliament intended to do was simply to enhance the punishment for persons found guilty of driving while under the influence of alcohol and drugs. The offence dealt with by the amended subsection is the same as that under the old subsection. What was changed was the punishment prescribed for persons convicted of the offence. The legislature was particularly intent on dealing severely with repeat offenders. Rather than prescribing a maximum fine and imprisonment term and leaving it to the courts to impose an appropriate punishment up to the maximum, Parliament prescribed the minimum as well. This indicates beyond doubt an intention to see that such criminal conduct is treated with the required degree of seriousness by the courts. If the argument for the respondent is correct, it would lead to the absurd result that a person no matter how many times he has been convicted in the past under the old subsection would be treated as a first offender if he is convicted for the first time under the new subsection. This would obviously defeat the intention of the legislature.
We see that a similar problem of interpretation arose in the Nova Scotia Supreme Court in the case of 
Re Green
 
[1936] 2 DLR 153
 In that case, the accused, Green, was convicted of an offence of possession of liquor under s 66(2), as amended, of the Nova Scotia Liquor Control Act. He had been previously convicted of a similar offence under the same subsection of the Act before that subsection was amended. The subsection before the amendment provided that, except with authority therein specified, `no liquor shall be kept, had, given or consumed by any person`. The amendment consisted of splitting into two subsubsections, the offence of keeping or having liquor in s 66(2)(a), and the offence of giving or consuming in s 66(2)(b); otherwise, the amended version repeated verbatim what had been contained in the original s 66(2). The amendment was expressed to be by way of a repeal of the old provisions and substitution of the new.
It was argued on behalf of Green that as s 66(2) had by express words been repealed, any conviction made under it could not thereafter, by reason of such repeal, be made the basis of a second offence under the Act. It was argued that the effect of the repeal was to wipe out the prior conviction, and that only by express and positive language to that effect could such prior conviction be again taken into account.
Chisholm CJ, delivering the judgment of the court, rejected these arguments. He pointed out that in the same sentence of the amendment Act which repealed the old subsection, the subsection had been re-enacted in the same terms. The learned chief justice adopted the decision in cases which had been decided in the United States to the effect that: 
 
The repeal and simultaneous re-enactment of substantially the same statutory provisions must be construed, not as an implied repeal of the original statute, but as an affirmance and continuance of the statute in uninterrupted operation. 
Re Green
 
[1936] 2 DLR 153
 was followed by the Prince Edward Island Supreme Court in the case of 
Campbell v The King
 
[] 95 
 In that case, the appellant was convicted on a charge of possession of spirits in violation of a section of the Excise Act. He was sentenced, as for second offence, to the minimum penalty of six months` imprisonment and a fine and costs. He contended that the imposition of a second offence penalty was invalid on the ground that his previous offence was under the same section of the Act before it was amended. As in the instant case, the amendment in that case was also to enhance the penalty for the same offence. The appellant contended that the punishment for a second or subsequent offence under the re-enactment could not be imposed unless the previous offence was also under the re-enactment.
 
 
 
Campbell CJ referred to the decision of Chisholm CJ in 
Re Green
 
[1936] 2 DLR 153
 and held that the previous conviction under the enactment before its amendment could properly be taken into account for the purpose of deciding whether the appellant should be subject to punishment as for a second offence.
We would adopt the decision of these learned judges in these two Canadian cases in which a similar point arose for decision. We have no doubt at all that the previous conviction of the respondent in this case under s 67(1) of the Act should be taken into consideration in deciding whether the proper punishment in his case should be as for a second or subsequent offence. We hold that the punishment in this case should have been as for a second offence.
 The retrospective operation argument
We do not think that there is anything in the argument that in doing so the court would be applying the re-enacted provision retrospectively contrary to the common law rule against retrospective operation of statutes and against art 11(1) of the Constitution.
Article 11(1) of the Constitution provides as follows: 
 
No person shall be punished for an act or omission which was not punishable by law when it was done or made, and no person shall suffer greater punishment for an offence than was prescribed by law at the time it was committed.
 
 
 
Article 11 of the Constitution is in essence a restatement of the common law rule as it applies to criminal laws.
It seems to us that there is no question of the respondent being punished for an act or omission which was not punishable by law when it was done. The offence with which he was charged was without doubt an offence at the time it was committed. As far as the punishment is concerned, in our view of the matter as we have set out above, we do not think that the punishment as for a second offence is anything other than what was prescribed by the Act. We thus see nothing here in what we hold that would offend against the rule against retrospective operation of statutes. In the result, we answer the question submitted to us in the affirmative.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellant was charged in the High Court with the murder of one Thongdam Sarathit (`the deceased`) on 24 March 1988 at about 8.30pm at 7B Lorong 20, Geylang, Singapore. At the conclusion of the trial he was convicted, and against his conviction this appeal has been brought. [See 
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 138
  .]
The evidence adduced by the prosecution before the High Court was this. At all material times, the appellant and the deceased were both employed by Tan Song Hoe Contractors Pte Ltd (`the company`) as general workers. They were, at the date of the incident, living at 7B, Lorong 20, Geylang, which was an apartment (`the apartment`) leased by the company and used as quarters for its workers. The apartment was situated on the third level of a building and comprised two levels: the lower level had a living room, a balcony, two bedrooms, a dining room and a kitchen, and the upper level had five bedrooms, one of which, the middle room, had a bathroom attached and was occupied by the appellant with two other fellow workers, Sommai Somprasong (`Sommai`) and Somboon Saleephan (`Somboon`). The deceased was living in a room at the rear on the same upper level. The deceased`s room was separated from the appellant`s room by an open area, in which there was a bed, and by another room, and the distance between them was slightly more than 20ft. There were altogether about 20 workers living in the whole apartment.
On 24 March 1988, at about 8pm, one of the Thai workers, Somthai Phunngphan-van (`Somthai`), was in his room which was at the lower level. The deceased came to see him and sought his advice whether the deceased should go to work at the Upper Thomson Road construction site, and he advised the deceased against it. They discussed for a short while, after which both of them went to the upper level intending to go the deceased`s bedroom. On the way, they passed the middle room, and Somthai saw the appellant sitting on his bed in that room, while Somboon was asleep on another bed. Somthai and the deceased proceeded to the deceased`s bedroom. There, together with four other Thai workers, they chatted. About half an hour later the deceased said that he was going to take a bath and left the room. The remaining five persons in the room continued with their conversation until about 10.30pm when they dispersed. Up to that point of time, the deceased had still not returned to his room. On the way down to his room, Somthai again passed the middle room, and this time he saw Somboon still fast asleep and there was no sign of the appellant. Soon after 11pm, Sommai was heard to be shouting that someone had died in the bathroom (attached to the middle room). Some of the Thai workers attempted to open the bathroom door, and after using some force, they managed to push the door slightly open and the deceased was found lying on the floor of the bathroom. The police were called and after the arrival of the police, all the Thai workers were required to assemble in the living room on the lower level of the apartment.
In the meantime, the appellant had left the apartment and gone over to a worksite quarter at Thomson Road where some other Thai workers were staying. That was about 11pm. At about 3am the following day, Somthai and two others came to the Thomson Road worksite quarter and told them that the deceased had died at the apartment. When he made the announcement, the appellant, who was also present, remarked that he had $400 with the deceased, implying that the latter owed him that amount of money. To this, Somthai retorted that the appellant was lying, that the deceased had never borrowed any money from the appellant, and that the appellant never had enough money for himself. Soon thereafter, the appellant and three other Thai workers took a taxi from the Thomson Road site and returned to Lorong 20, Geylang.
At about 3.45am, Professor Chao Tze Cheng, the senior forensic pathologist, arrived at the scene and examined the body. He estimated that death would have occurred six to eight hours earlier. At about 9am the same morning, Professor Chao performed an autopsy and subsequently prepared his report. He found that there were seven injuries, all concentrated on the head region and most of them were on the back on the right side, and all of them were consistent with blows inflicted by a blunt instrument delivered with great force, and multiple fractures of the skull were caused. No defensive injuries were found. Professor Chao certified that the cause of death was fracture of the skull. In his opinion, the injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
At about 4.40am, all the Thai workers were escorted to the CID for further investigations. As a result of the investigations, the appellant was arrested. At about 9.30am on the same day, 25 March 1988, the appellant gave a statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`), and the statement (`the s 122(6) statement`) was recorded by Inspector Michael Chan with the assistance of an interpreter, Mr Lim Yew Teck. The s 122(6) statement was not objected to by the defence and it was admitted in evidence. In his statement, the appellant said that the deceased had borrowed from him a sum of $800 which the deceased wanted to send to his wife to buy a padi field. The appellant had been asking for repayment for five to six months, but the deceased kept putting off the repayment. On the evening of 24 March 1988, after having dinner and some drinks with his Thai friends, he returned to the apartment and met the deceased in front of his room. He demanded the repayment of the $800. The deceased replied that he had no money, and there followed an exchange of words between them. The following is the material part of the statement as to what happened immediately thereafter: 
 
I told him that it was because I was broke now and showed him my purse having $300 in it and told him that I needed more money for expenses to go back to Thailand and that was why I urgently demanded payment from him. On hearing this, he got angry and grabbed hold of a broom which was by the side of the door inside the room and hit me with it. I blocked the first blow with my right hand and the broom hit me on the back of my right palm. He hit me again. This time, I tried to jump away and the blow landed on the toe of my right foot and the toe next to it which was cut and there was slight bleeding.
 
 
 
Seeing that I could not fight him, I ran away and went to have a drink at the refrigerator where I saw the deceased went into his quarters to get his towel and soap and went to have his bath in the bathroom. I went into my quarter and went to the bed of one of my colleagues and took an axe which was placed under his bed. I then walked straight to the bathroom where the deceased was bathing with the axe in my right hand. The door of the bathroom was closed but not locked. I pushed the door and walked into the bathroom and saw the deceased bathing with his back facing me. Being drunk and angry without further thought I walked up to him and hit him on the back of his neck which caused him to fall onto the ground lying on his side. I hit him again with the axe once more. The blow landed on his temple but I cannot remember on which side. I hit him again and again. I cannot remember how many times did I hit him with the axe. After which, I walked back to my room and returned the axe back under the bed of my colleague.
The prosecution adduced evidence from witnesses to show that the deceased could not have owed the appellant any money. In particular, one Ang Hock Soon, a foreman of the company, was called, and he testified that in March or April 1987, the deceased requested him, in the presence of the appellant, to deduct $300 from the monthly wages payable to the appellant on the ground that the appellant owed the deceased that amount of money. He declined to do so, as it was not the company`s policy to allow such a practice. He further testified that on 17 or 18 March 1988, the deceased made another request to him, but this time in the absence of the appellant, to deduct a sum of $300 from the appellant`s wages and this was again refused. The brother-in-law of the deceased, Somwang Sariboot, was called and he said that in August 1987 when he met the deceased, the latter told him that the appellant owed the deceased $300. Another witness, Somthai, testified that the deceased had told him that the appellant owed the deceased a sum of $300, and on 23 March 1988 the deceased said that a sum of $100 was still owing from the appellant. On the same day the deceased also told Somthai that he (the deceased) had $700 to $800 in his possession with which he intended to buy a television set for his family; Somthai admitted, however, that he did not see the money which the deceased claimed he had.
The appellant gave evidence and also called Dr R Nagulendran, a consultant psychiatrist in private practice, to testify in his defence. By his evidence and that of Dr Nagulendran, the appellant raised two defences, namely: (i) the defence of grave and sudden provocation by the deceased falling within Exception 1 to s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Code`), and (ii) the defence of diminished responsibility falling within Exception 7 to s 300.
The evidence of the appellant in so far as relevant to the defences, was this. He described the very difficult conditions in which he and his family lived in his hometown in northeast Thailand and the amount of debts he incurred prior to his coming to Singapore in 1985. He said that in Thailand he felt depressed. He decided to come to Singapore to work in order to earn some money and he had to pay an agency fee of 35,000 bahts (equivalent to $2,800). To raise this amount, he caused and procured his relatives to mortgage their land. He said that in the course of his work in Singapore he suffered persistent headaches owing to stress.
The appellant admitted that during the early part of his stay in Singapore, the deceased was a good friend to him, sharing food with him because at that time he did not have enough money. This resulted in the appellant owing the deceased a sum of about $300. But this amount, he said, was later settled in an indirect way; so he thought. One of his friends, a Thai worker, by the name of Niram, was then making arrangements to return to Thailand and wanted to borrow a sum of $300 from the appellant. The appellant did not have the $300 and arranged for an advance of that amount to be given to Niram. When Niram returned to Singapore from Thailand, the appellant told Niram not to return the $300 to him but to pay it to the deceased, which would then settle the appellant`s debt to the deceased. He therefore thought that the debt of $300 to the deceased had been paid.
The appellant said that two months prior to the incident, the deceased borrowed from him a sum of 10,000 bahts (equivalent to $800). The deceased had promised that whenever the appellant wanted to go back to Thailand, the deceased would return the money to him.
On 23 March 1988, he got permission from the company to return to Thailand on 25 March 1988 on condition that he procured a letter of guarantee signed by two guarantors. On 24 March 1988, he brought the letter of guarantee to one Somboon to sign, and Somboon signed the guarantee. That was at a hotel in Lorong 13, Geylang. Also present there were four other Thai workers and they were drinking `Johnny Walker` whisky. Sometime between 6pm and 7pm, the appellant left Somboon and the other Thai workers and returned to the apartment.
Later in the evening, whilst he was in his room, the appellant heard some Thai workers returning to their quarters. They walked past his room. A little while later, the deceased came to the appellant`s room, whereupon the appellant told the deceased that he had got permission to return to Thailand and asked the deceased to return the loan to him. The deceased said he did not have the money and walked out of the room. The appellant was disappointed. After the deceased had walked out of the appellant`s room, the appellant went to the deceased`s room where he saw some other Thai workers. He then returned to his own room. Later, the deceased came to his room again and at that point of time the appellant again asked for his money, but the deceased refused to pay. As a result, a quarrel ensued between them. In the midst of the quarrel, the deceased took a broom which was in the room, and used it to hit the appellant; the appellant lifted his right hand and blocked the blow, as a result of which the broom hit his right hand. The deceased then struck a second time, and hit the appellant on his right toe. The appellant felt greatly insulted by the deceased using the broom to hit him. The deceased then left the room. The appellant also went out of the room to get some water to drink from the refrigerator. However, there was none in the refrigerator. He then looked at his right toe and it was bleeding. He felt angry and at that point of time he saw the deceased entering his room and going into the bathroom to take a bath. He became more angry because he was asking for the return of his money, yet the deceased used the broom to attack him. The appellant took an axe which Sommai had kept by the side of the bed, went to the bathroom, pushed the bathroom door open, and while the deceased had his back turned towards him, used the blunt end of the axe and hit the deceased`s head. The deceased fell onto the floor. The appellant could not remember how many times thereafter he hit the deceased. He admitted hitting the deceased with the blunt end of the axe several times. The appellant then took the wallet from the deceased`s shorts and left. He saw a rag in the room and used it to clean some hair off the blunt end of the axe and placed the axe back in the place where he had taken it. Thereafter he left the apartment and went to the Thomson Road site where he met his Thai friends. The appellant further said that from the time the deceased hit him with the broom up to the time when he went into the bathroom and struck the deceased with the axe, everything moved very quickly. He was all the time filled with anger as the deceased had insulted him.
The appellant was cross-examined rigorously in respect of the events surrounding the killing of the deceased and his motive in doing so. In the course of the cross-examination, the prosecution sought to impeach his credit under s 157 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) by showing that his evidence was inconsistent with the two statements made by the appellant under s 121 of the CPC. He did not appear to admit the whole of the statements with the result that the prosecution adduced evidence and proved that the statements were made by him. The trial judges found that the appellant had made the statement voluntarily.
The next witness called by the defence was Dr R Nagulendran, who testified as to the mental condition of the appellant at the time the offence was committed. Dr R Nagulendran examined the appellant at Queenstown Prison on four occasions between 10 August 1989 and 9 September 1989, and prepared a medical report dated 12 September 1989 which was admitted. He was of the opinion that at the time of the alleged offence, the appellant was suffering from depression and that this condition of depression was an abnormality of mind of such severity as to have impaired substantially his mental responsibility for his act. This condition of mind is known as dysthymia. The finding of Dr Nagulendran was based on the truth of personal background and past events related to him by the appellant, and in particular, the loan of $800 by the appellant to the deceased and the fight on that evening involving the deceased using a broom on the appellant.
The prosecution, in rebuttal, called the prison`s psychiatrist, Dr Chan Kim Yew. Dr Chan testified that he saw the appellant on four occasions, namely, 10 October 1989, 6 and 11 November 1989, and 10 August 1990. He prepared his medical report dated 6 December 1989 which was put up after the third interview with the appellant. His conclusion was that the appellant did not suffer `any aggregate of symptoms occurring together over a limited period of time such as to qualify for depression`. He was of the opinion that the appellant was not of unsound mind at the material time and did not suffer any depression or other psychiatric illness during his stay in Singapore prior to the killing.
The trial judges found that on the evidence there was no doubt that the appellant caused the death of the deceased by striking him on the head many times with the blunt end of the axe, causing a fractured skull, and the case fell within para (c) of s 300 of the Code. They then considered the question whether in the circumstances of the case exception 1 of s 300 applied. In that respect, the trial judges held that there were two critical questions of fact: first, whether the deceased owed the appellant a sum of $800 which the appellant claimed the deceased refused to pay, and secondly, whether there was a fight between the deceased and the appellant in which the deceased used the broom to attack the appellant. On the first question, the trial judges found there was no loan by the appellant to the deceased and that on the contrary, the appellant was the debtor, being unable to repay the balance of the loan of $300 owing to the deceased. The second question was inextricably linked with the first; as they had already found that there was no loan of $800 owing by the deceased, they rejected the appellant`s evidence of the alleged fight between them.
The trial judges further held that there was another reason for rejecting such evidence, and that was the evidence of Dr Anne Goh who examined the appellant prior to the latter making the s 122(6) statement, and whose medical report stated as follows: 
 
Somwang Phatthanasaeng m/1955 HRN
 
 
 
EH0188035012
 
 
 
The abovenamed was brought for a pre-statement examination at 9.10am on 25 March 1988. He was Thai speaking.
 
 
 
On examination, there were no external injuries seen except for a small bruise on the right hand which he said was sustained during a fall. He also had a small abrasion over the right second toe.
He was seen again at 11.35am on the same day for a post-statement examination.
On examination, there were no external injuries seen except for those mentioned above.
Dr Anne Goh did not speak Thai, and she admitted that there was no Thai interpreter present at the time when she examined the appellant. She was therefore questioned as to how she could have reported on what the appellant had said as to the cause of his injury. The doctor, however, firmly maintained that she would not have assumed the cause of any injury and the fact that she had recorded the cause of that injury probably meant that it was told to her. The trial judges accepted her evidence. They relied on the evidence of Bernard Tan, the staff nurse, and Dr Chan Kim Yew, the psychiatrist, both attached to the Changi Prison Hospital, who said that they spoke to the appellant in Hokkien. The trial judges came to the conclusion that the appellant must have spoken to the doctor in Hokkien which therefore explained the statement recorded by her that he said that the bruise on his right hand was due to a fall.
Accordingly, the trial judges found that the defence of provocation was not made out as there was no loan of $800 owing by the deceased and the deceased did not attack the appellant with a broom. On the defence of diminished responsibility, the trial judges held that as the evidence of the appellant on the loan and the fight was rejected, the opinion of Dr Nagulendran as to the mental condition of the appellant could not stand.
Before us, counsel for the appellant attacked the trial judges` findings on the two critical questions of fact. In respect of their findings on the first question, counsel contended that the trial judges` findings were against the weight of evidence and were the result of incorrect and/or improper assessment of crucial aspects of the evidence.
The trial judges referred to the following evidence in connection with their finding on the $800 loan. Firstly, they referred to the evidence of the appellant himself that in the past the appellant had asked his employers for advances, although he could not remember how many times he had done so. Secondly, they referred to his admission that his wages for September 1987 were only $87 and for November only $53. Thirdly, they referred to the evidence that a week before the incident the deceased, in the absence of the appellant, had asked the foreman of the employers to make deductions from the wages of the appellant to pay for the debt the appellant owed the deceased. Fourthly, they apparently relied on the evidence of Somthai that on 23 March 1988 the deceased had told him that the appellant had borrowed $300 from the deceased and that the appellant then still owed the deceased $100. The trial judges came to the conclusion that not only did the deceased not owe the appellant $800, on the contrary it was the appellant who was the debtor, being unable to repay the long overdue debt of $300 owed to the deceased.
We agree with counsel for the appellant that the evidence relating to the deceased`s requests to the company to deduct $300 from the wages of the appellant and that of Somthai as to what the deceased had told him were not admissible in evidence to prove that the appellant had owed the deceased any money. They were hearsay and did not come within any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. Accordingly, we agree that the trial judges` finding of fact that the appellant was indebted to the deceased cannot be supported. However, in our judgment, this finding was irrelevant to the defence of provocation relied upon by the appellant.
It has to be borne in mind that the burden of proof of the defence of provocation and the underlying facts in support was on the appellant on a balance of probabilities. Hence, the appellant has to prove that there was a loan of $800 owing to him by the deceased. On this, his evidence was deficient. Apart from saying that he had saved up $800, the appellant has adduced no evidence on the amount of his earnings, even though his ability to lend anyone such a sum of money had been seriously challenged by the prosecution. The defence chose not to ask the foreman of the company any question touching on the appellant`s earnings when the foreman was giving evidence for the prosecution, or to recall him after the defence`s allegation of the $800 loan was challenged. Furthermore, the appellant could not even give a clear account as to when the $800 was lent to the deceased. In his statement given under s 122(6) of the CPC, he said the loan was given five to six times before the incident. In court, however, he said it was about two months before the incident. He put the contradiction down to a possible error in the taking of his statement.
More fundamentally is the question of the appellant`s credibility in relation to his evidence. The prosecution had successfully shown that his evidence in several material respects was inconsistent with or different from what he had said in the two statements made to the police under s 121 of the CPC. The trial judges did not specifically refer to these inconsistencies or discrepancies in their finding on the loan of $800. However, it is clear to us that they did not accept the evidence of the appellant on the loan, having found that the credit of the appellant had been impeached. Having regard to this, no finder of fact, in our opinion, could have been expected to approach the appellant`s evidence with anything but the greatest caution and scepticism. In our judgment, the appellant has not succeeded in establishing that there was a loan of $800 owing to him by the deceased.
With regard to the second critical question of fact, counsel for the appellant contended that the trial judges were wrong in finding that the appellant could speak simple Hokkien to Dr Anne Goh as there was no basis for such a finding. The trial judges in arriving at this finding relied on the evidence of Bernard Chan and Dr Chan Kim Yew that they spoke to the appellant in Hokkien. However, such evidence, counsel submitted, could not support their finding. First, in so far as Bernard Tan is concerned, he spoke to the appellant only in August 1990, whereas Dr Anne Goh examined the appellant in March 1988. As for Dr Chan, his evidence was that he had a conversation with the appellant in Hokkien on 15 August 1990. However, Dr Chan himself said that in October 1989 when he spoke to the appellant in Hokkien or Teochew the latter said `Tai Kok` (meaning Thailand) and shook his head. Dr Chan then had a Thai interpreter with him after his failed attempt to communicate with the appellant; he also had a Thai interpreter with him when he spoke to the appellant in November 1989. On this evidence, counsel submitted, there was no proper basis for inferring that the appellant could speak and must have spoken to Dr Anne Goh in Hokkien in March 1988 on the cause of the injury on his right hand. However, we are not persuaded that the trial judges were wrong. They had seen and heard Dr Anne Goh and she was very firm in her evidence that she would not have assumed the cause of the appellant`s injury and that she must have been told of the cause of the injury. The appellant himself in his evidence never denied what Dr Anne Goh said in her report; he never said that he had no conversation with the doctor and that he could not have communicated with her at all on the cause of his injury. In this circumstances, in our judgment, the trial judges were not in error in accepting the evidence of Dr Anne Goh and holding that the appellant must have been able to communicate with the doctor and must have reported to her the cause of the bruise on his right hand.
Quite independently of this medical report of Dr Anne Goh, there was evidence which was consistent with the absence of the alleged fight between the appellant and the deceased on the fateful night of 24 March 1988. Somthai in his evidence said that on that evening, at about 8pm, the deceased came to his room which was on the lower level and talked to him, seeking his advice whether the deceased should go to work in a different construction site, and he advised the deceased to remain where he was working. After a brief conversation, they both went to the deceased`s room which was on the upper level, and as they were passing the appellant`s room, Somthai saw the appellant sitting on his bed and that Somboon was sleeping. In the deceased`s room, together with four other Thai workers, they had a conversation. About half an hour later the deceased excused himself and went to take a bath; he went to the bathroom which was attached to the appellant`s room for his bath. After he left, Somthai and the other Thai workers who were still in the deceased`s room continued with their conversation until about 10.30pm when they dispersed. This part of Somthai`s evidence was not challenged; nor was he cross-examined on it. The deceased`s room was separated from the appellant`s room by a small space, containing a bed, and by another room; the distance between the appellant`s room and the deceased`s room was only slightly more than 20ft. If there was a quarrel between the deceased and the appellant in the latter`s room followed by a fight between them in which the deceased used a broom to hit the appellant, that would have taken place between 8.30pm and 10.30pm. Such a fight would have produced some noise or a commotion. During this time Somthai and the other Thai workers were still in the deceased`s room. There was no evidence that they heard any noise or commotion from the appellant`s room.
For the reasons we have given, we agree with the trial judges` finding that there was no fight between the deceased and the appellant on the evening of 24 March 1988. Even if there was a fight the defence of provocation would still fail. Firstly, on the evidence of the appellant, after he was attacked by the deceased using a broom, the latter left the room and so did the appellant; he went to get some water to drink from the refrigerator but could not find any. At that moment he looked at his right toe and noticed that it was bleeding. He felt angry, and then he saw the deceased entering his room again and going into the bathroom to take a bath. There was therefore a cooling-off period before he took the axe and went to the bathroom and used it to attack the deceased. Secondly, the provocation was not so grave, by the standards of a reasonable man, as to warrant a retaliation by the appellant with the use of an axe. Thirdly, again on the evidence of the appellant, he took the axe, went to the bathroom while the deceased was taking his bath and with the blunt end of the axe struck the deceased on the head several times and caused the latter`s death. Such acts of retaliation by the appellant were wholly disproportionate to the act of provocation caused by the deceased. In the result, the defence of provocation fails.
We now turn to the defence of diminished responsibility. Dr Nagulendran`s diagnosis of the mental condition of the appellant was based on the truth of the events as related to him by the appellant. The doctor was asked whether his diagnosis would have been different if there had been no loan of $800 owing by the deceased to the appellant and there was no fight between them involving the use of the broom by the deceased and thus no provocation caused to the appellant. To that he answered in the affirmative. He said: 
 
My diagnosis at the time of the alleged defence will differ because the question is at the time of the alleged offence. If the $800, the ensuing fight, the provocation and insulting did not occur, then at that time of the alleged offence, he was not depressed. It forms a very crucial part of my diagnosis.
 
 
 
That answer was crucial to the defence of diminished responsibility. As the appellant has not established that there was a loan of $800 owing to him from the deceased and that the fight between him and the deceased took place on the evening of 24 March 1988, the opinion of Dr Nagulendran on the mental condition of the appellant cannot possibly stand. The defence of diminished responsibility therefore fails.
Before we conclude, there is one other complaint made by counsel for the appellant which we should consider. Five days after the appellant had been charged with the murder of the deceased and had given the s 122(6) statement, Inspector Michael Chan, with the assistance of the Thai interpreter, Lim Yew Teck, recorded two lengthy statements from him under s 121 of the CPC: one on 30 March 1988 and the other on 31 March 1988. These two statements (`the s 121 statements`) were not tendered as part of the evidence against the appellant at any stage of the case for the prosecution; nor were copies thereof furnished to the defence. During the cross-examination of the appellant (after the defence had been called), the prosecution sought to impeach his credit by showing that his evidence was inconsistent with the s 121 statements. As the appellant did not appear to admit the whole of the s 121 statements, the prosecution then adduced evidence to prove that he had made the statements voluntarily. A trial-within-a-trial was conducted, and at the conclusion thereof the trial judges were satisfied that the statements were made by the appellant voluntarily and admitted them in evidence. Thereafter, the appellant was cross-examined and was asked to explain the inconsistencies between the s 121 statements and the evidence he had given. He was then re-examined by his own counsel and was given an opportunity to clarify and explain the inconsistencies. The trial judges in their grounds of decision found that there were several material inconsistencies between his evidence and the statements, and held that the appellant had been discredited.
The complaint of counsel for the appellant is two-fold. Firstly, it was contended that the proper procedure for allowing the prosecution to use the s 121 statements to cross-examine the appellant had not been followed by the trial judges, and counsel referred us to the case of 
Muthusamy v PP
 
 
[1948] MLJ 57
  In that case the accused was charged with house trepass with intent to intimidate the occupant and also with assault. In the trial before the magistrate, previous statements made by the accused to the police were used to cross-examine the accused and were admitted as substantive evidence against the accused. On appeal to the High Court this was disallowed, and Taylor J who heard the appeal laid down the following procedure at pp 58-59: 
 
The proper way to apply the sections [ie the equivalent of s 122(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code and s 157 of the Evidence Act] is this. On the request of either side, the court reads the former statement. If there is no serious discrepancy the court so rules and no time is wasted. The first necessity is to read it with the confident expectation that it will be different from the evidence but looking judicially to see whether the differeally is so serious as to suggest that the witness is unreliable.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
If the police statement gives an outline of substantially the same story there being no apparently irreconcilable conflict between the two on any point material to the issue, the magistrate should say at once `The difference is not such as to affect his credit` and hand the statement back.
If, however, the difference is so material as probably to amount to a discrepancy affecting the credit of the witness, the court may permit the witness to be asked whether he made the alleged statement. If he denies having made it, then either the matter must be dropped or the document must be formally proved, by calling the writer or, if he is not available, by proving in some other way that the witness did make the statement.
If the witness admits making the former statement, or is proved to have made it, then the two conflicting versions must be carefully explained to him, preferably by the court, and he must have a fair and full opportunity to explain the difference. If he can, then his credit is saved, though there may still be doubt as to the accuracy of his memory. This procedure is cumbersome and slow and therefore should not be used unless the apparent discrepancy is material to the issue.
We have examined the record of proceedings before the trial judges and have found nothing which was at variance in any material respect with the procedure laid down in 
Muthusamy
 
 
[1948] MLJ 57
  The appellant was referred to the statements he made and since he did not appear to admit them, the trial judges conducted a trial-within-a-trial and at the conclusion determined that the statements were made by the appellant voluntarily. Thereafter, cross-examination of the appellant continued, after which his counsel re-examined him. For some inexplicable reason, at that point of time counsel for the appellant strenuously urged the trial judges to make a ruling whether the credit of the appellant had been impeached. The trial judges declined, and in our view, rightly, and held that they would determine that issue at the close of the case. There is no reason whatsoever why the trial judges should make any ruling at that stage as requested by counsel. In our opinion, counsel was in error. The use of the s 121 statements to impeach the credit of the appellant was part of the cross-examination by the prosecution and does not call for any special ruling at that stage.
The second complaint made by counsel for the appellant is that in their findings against the appellant, the trial judges had relied on the s 121 statements as substantive evidence. He sought to demonstrate this by quoting the following passage from the grounds of decision of the trial judges [see 
 
 [1991] 1 SLR 138 
 at p 151]: 
 
In our judgment this was a clear case where the accused intended to rob the deceased of this money for the purposes of his trip back to Thailand. He knew that the deceased was a responsible worker who had savings which the deceased intended to send back to his family. In the case of the accused the evidence was quite clear that he was always out of money, frequently seeking advances from his company. He intended to strike while the deceased was having his bath. As the bathroom door was not locked, he sneaked into the bathroom with the axe in his hand and struck the deceased many times on the head. Having done so he took the wallet of the deceased, pressed the door knob, came out of the bathroom and pulled the door behind him in order to lock it. All this was done in order to prevent the early discovery of the crime. We were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to strike the deceased on the head with the axe and that the injuries had in the normal course of nature caused the death of the deceased. Indeed this case borders on s 300(a). The line between this case and another where an accused pointed a gun at the head of his victim, squeezed the trigger and took away the wallet of the victim, is thin.
 
 
 
These findings, counsel submitted, were substantially derived from the s 121 statements, because apart from the s 121 statements, there was no evidence to support such a finding. Counsel submitted that where a previous statement made by an accused has been used to cross-examine him with the view to impeaching his credit it cannot be admitted as evidence of the facts stated therein, and in support, he relied on the following authorities: 
Jones v R
 
 
[1948] MLJ 182
  
Muthusamy v PP
 
 
[1948] MLJ 57
  and 
PP v Wong Yee Sen & Ors
 
 
[1990] 1 MLJ 187
 
We do not think that the principle of law is in any doubt: a previous statement made by an accused which has been used to impeach his credit, is only admissible for that limited purpose, ie to impeach his credit, and not as substantive evidence of the content thereof. We think, however, that the trial judges in this case were fully aware of this principle. They referred to the s 121 statements merely for the purpose of determining the credit of the appellant and the extent of the contradictions or inconsistencies between his evidence given in court and the s 121 statements. The learned deputy public prosecutor submitted, and we agree with him, that there is nothing in the grounds of decision of the trial judges and even in that portion quoted by counsel for the appellant to suggest that they had adopted and used any portions, more specifically, the inculpatory portions of the s 121 statements, as substantive evidence against the appellant. The trial judges found against the appellant on the two crucial issues of facts. In making such findings the trial judges made no reference whatsoever to any part of the s 121 statements. Next, there was evidence before them, which they accepted and which showed that the appellant was indebted to the deceased at the material time and that the appellant had made arrangements to return to Thailand on the following day, ie 25 March 1988. There was then the evidence given by the appellant himself. The appellant admitted both in his s 122(6) statement and in his evidence that on the evening of 24 March 1988, he saw the deceased going to the bathroom to take a bath, that he took an axe which was lying next to the bed of Sommai, that he went to the bathroom armed with that axe, that while the deceased was having his bath with his back towards him he struck the deceased on the head with the blunt end of the axe, that after the deceased had fallen, he further struck the deceased with the axe in the same manner several times, that he took the wallet of the deceased from the deceased`s shorts and that he took the money from the wallet. On these primary facts, the trial judges could not have come to any conclusion other than that the appellant intended to rob the deceased of his money and intended to inflict on him the injuries which were inflicted, which were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death and which did cause death. The only finding of the trial judges in the grounds of decision which was not wholly supported by evidence was that part which stated that the appellant pressed the door knob, came out of the bathroom and pulled the door behind him in order to lock it. In our opinion, whether or not he locked the door of the bathroom in the manner as stated or at all is wholly immaterial; it is an act after the event. He had already killed the deceased.
For the reasons we have given, we dismiss the appeal.

The appellant, Ng Chong Teck, was convicted of trafficking in diamorphine by transporting it from Lorong 1A Toa Payoh to Jalan Novena Barat contrary to s 5(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`the Act`) and sentenced to death pursuant to s 33 thereof.
The fact that the appellant was in possession of not less than 68.6g of diamorphine at the time of his arrest was not disputed by him. The appellant also did not dispute that the bulk quantity he carried from Lorong 1A Toa Payoh to Jalan Novena Barat, in which the diamorphine was found, weighed 449.9g.
The prosecution`s entire case rested on s 17(c) of the Act (before it was amended by Act 38 of 1989) which provides that 
 
any person who is proved or presumed to have had in his possession more than -
 
 
 
... 
(c) 2 grammes of diamorphine (heroin) contained in any controlled drug shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that controlled drug in his possession for the purpose of trafficking therein.
 
 
 
It is settled law that s 17(c) creates a rebuttable presumption and that the burden is on the accused person to rebut that presumption on a balance of probabilities. The sole defence of the appellant at the trial was that he was in possession of the diamorphine for his own consumption. The trial judges did not believe him and found that the appellant had not rebutted the presumption that he was in possession of the diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. Trafficking in more than 15g of diamorphine carries the death penalty.
The appellant was arrested at about 10.30pm on 7 October 1988 soon after the taxi in which he was travelling was stopped by a team of narcotics officers led by Senior Narcotics Officer Lim Chei Yoo (`SNO Lim`) as the taxi was about to enter the car park of a block of apartments off Jalan Novena Barat. The appellant was the only passenger in the taxi. Beside him was a brown briefcase. At the request of SNO Lim the appellant opened the briefcase which had a combination lock. Inside the briefcase, under a 
 Nam 
 magazine were found three plastic packets of a pinkish substance which SNO Lim believed to be diamorphine. This was later found to be correct. When SNO Lim asked the appellant what the contents of the three plastic packets were, he remained silent. The appellant at that time lived at 22 Jalan Novena Barat. A search was then made of his home in his presence but nothing incriminating was found.
The appellant had in fact been trailed from Lorong 1A Toa Payoh to Jalan Novena Barat by SNO Lim and his team of narcotics officers. Earlier that day on 7 October 1988 at about 8.40pm, acting on information received, SNO Lim had assembled together a team of narcotics officers to keep vigilance in the areas of Lorong 1, Lorong 2 and Lorong 1A Toa Payoh. At about 10.20pm a male Chinese carrying a bag was seen by one of the narcotics officers coming out from a car park which serviced a complex of flat dwellings, off Lorong 1A and hailing a taxi. The other narcotics officers keeping vigilance were alerted by `walkie-talkie` and the taxi which the male Chinese carrying a bag had boarded was followed by the narcotics officers to Jalan Novena Barat where it was stopped and the male Chinese arrested. That male Chinese was the appellant.
Following the search of the appellant`s home he was taken to the Central Narcotics Bureau. The next morning at about 2.05am Toh Siew Kean, who was then a senior narcotics officer, recorded a cautioned statement from the appellant. He followed the procedure prescribed under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`). This statement was admitted in evidence without objection from the appellant. The statement was brief. The appellant merely said `I have nothing to say. That is all.`
The foregoing facts introduced by the prosecution in evidence went unchallenged by the appellant.
The effect of the presumption created by s 17(c) was first stated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Wong Kee Chin v PP 
. Choor Singh J delivering the judgment of the court said (at p 161): 
 
When it is proved that the quantity of diamorphine which the accused person was transporting (in the dictionary sense of the term) was two or more grams, a rebuttable presumption arises under s 15(2) [now s 17(c)] that the accused had the said controlled drug in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. Proof of the act of transporting plus the presumption under s 15(2) would constitute a prima facie case of trafficking which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction. In those circumstances the burden of proof would clearly shift to the accused and he would have to rebut the case made out against him. The rebuttal will depend upon the evidence placed before the court. If he can convince the trial court by a preponderance of evidence or on the balance of probabilities that the drug was for his own consumption he would be entitled to an acquittal. Factors such as the type of `transporting`, the quantity involved, whether or not the accused is an addict, would be relevant. It would be a question of evidence and the inferences to be drawn from the totality of the evidence before the court.

[1981] 1 MLJ 64
  set the seal of approval on the Court of Criminal Appeal`s judgment in 
Wong Kee Chin v PP
 
 
[1979] 1 MLJ 157
  Lord Diplock who delivered the judgment of the Judicial Committee said at p 70: `So, in their Lordships` view, the effect of the Drugs Act was stated with clarity and accuracy in the following passage of the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
Wong Kee Chin v PP
 
 
[1979] 1 MLJ 157
  (at p 161).` He was referring to the passage quoted above.
At p 69 of the report of 
Ong Ah Chuan v PP
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 64
  Lord Diplock made the following observation: 
 
As a matter of common sense the larger the quantity of drugs involved the stronger the inference that they were not intended for the personal consumption of the person carrying them, and the more convincing the evidence needed to rebut it. All that s 15 does is to lay down the minimum quantity of each of the five drugs with which it deals at which the inference arises from the quantity involved alone that they were being transported for the purpose of transferring possession of them to another person and not solely for the transporter`s own consumption. There may be other facts which justify the inference even where the quantity of drugs involved is lower than the minimum which attracts the statutory presumption under s 15.
 
 
 
The appellant sought to rebut the statutory presumption successfully raised against him by the prosecution through his own evidence. He called no witnesses.
The essence of his evidence was that at the time of his arrest he was already dependent on heroin. He was accustomed to consuming two to three straws of heroin daily. He obtained his heroin from a `pusher` in King George`s Avenue and sometimes from his friend, Kim Kiat, who like him, also consumed heroin. On occasions he would go to Kim Kiat`s flat at Block 139, Lorong 1A Toa Payoh and join him in consuming heroin. It will be noted that Block 139 is in the same complex of flat dwellings from the car park of which the appellant was first seen coming out by the narcotics officers on 7 October 1988.
On one of the occasions he and Kim Kiat had consumed heroin together, they had discussed the benefits to be gained were they to buy the heroin in bulk. It would be cheaper and the risk of arrest when making a purchase would be reduced. He had asked Kim Kiat to look out for a bulk purchase of heroin. On 4 October 1988 Kim Kiat had told him that a pound of heroin was available for $5,000. He had approved the purchase and arrangements were made for payment and the delivery of the heroin to take place the next day.
Kim Kiat had not called the next day. However, a Malaysian friend who was in Singapore had. He had met this Malaysian friend to discuss some business and as the Malaysian friend was returning to Kuala Lumpur early the next morning, he had himself gone to Kuala Lumpur on the afternoon on 6 October to continue the business discussion. Both in Singapore and in Kuala Lumpur he and the Malaysian friend had consumed heroin together.
The next day, 7 October 1988, he returned to Singapore by air. He had given a lift to one Frances Hay whom he had befriended at Subang Airport. She lived in Toa Payoh. Since he was in the area and was by then craving for heroin, he decided to go to Kim Kiat`s flat. He had arrived there at about 8.45pm. Kim Kiat was not in but his wife was. He asked her to page for Kim Kiat and went to the bedroom in search of heroin. In a drawer he found two plastic packets of heroin. He also found two thigh guards. He assumed that the two packets of heroin were for him and that the thigh guards were to secure the packets to his thighs by way of concealment.
Later, having spoken with Kim Kiat on the telephone who confirmed that the two packets of heroin were for him, he left for his home in Jalan Novena Barat. Before leaving he had consumed some heroin from one of the two packets. The opened packet had spilled more than he had required. The excess amount was placed in a smaller plastic bag. When he left he had the unopened plastic packet, the opened plastic packet and the small plastic bag in his briefcase which he carried with him. He boarded a taxi at Lorong 1A Toa Payoh for home and when the taxi got to Jalan Novena Barat, it was stopped and he was arrested by the narcotics officers.
The foregoing evidence was no doubt given by the appellant with a view to impressing on the trial court the extent of his dependency on heroin, and thus to explain the possession of such a large quantity of heroin. Emphasis was also laid on the fact that when his home was searched after his arrest by the narcotics officers, nothing incriminating was found. Further emphasis was laid on the fact that the appellant when arrested was in the act of transporting the heroin to his own home. All this, it was submitted, clearly was in the appellant`s favour and on a balance of probabilities, proved that the appellant was transporting the heroin to his own home for his own consumption and not with any view, of then or later, transferring the heroin to a third person.
The trial judges were not impressed. They rejected the appellant`s evidence for two reasons. Firstly, at the time of his arrest and during the investigations, the appellant did not say that the heroin was for his own consumption although he was well aware that he would not be charged for trafficking if he could prove that the heroin was for his own consumption. The appellant had no less than five opportunities to give this explanation for being in possession of the heroin. The first occasion was immediately on arrest when he was asked by SNO Lim what the contents of the packets were. He remained silent although he knew perfectly well what they were. Even if this silence is accepted as being the stunned reaction to the arrest, the next occasion, when the cautioned statement was recorded by Toh Siew Kean is difficult to understand unless this `defence` is nothing more than an afterthought.
Toh Siew Kean followed this s 122(6) CPC procedure. This procedure requires the caution to be explained and it is to the effect that any defence intended to be relied upon at the trial ought to be stated then or else it may be less likely to be believed. Plain enough words, but all the appellant would say was: `I have nothing to say. That is all.` These are words of defiance and not of explanation.
In an attempt to retrieve the position, the appellant maintained in cross-examination that he had told Toh Siew Kean before the cautioned statement was recorded that the heroin was in fact for his own consumption. Toh Siew Kean was not examined on this matter by the appellant`s counsel simply because the appellant had not disclosed this to him. Toh Siew Kean was recalled. He denied any such disclosure. The trial judges accepted the evidence of Toh Siew Kean.
The appellant had at least three further opportunities to make this disclosure when statements were being recorded from him by SNO Lim. He did not do so. His explanation at the trial was that he did not want to implicate anyone else, least of all Kim Kiat who was his friend. Rightly, the trial judges rejected this explanation.
The second ground on which the trial judges rejected the appellant`s evidence was that they did not believe his evidence that the drugs seized were a three to four months` supply for himself. They noted that it was the appellant`s own evidence that he was a relative new comer to heroin, having started consuming it only since April 1988. His rate of consumption of two to three straws a day was not high. Notwithstanding his own evidence that he suffered from withdrawal symptoms after his arrest, there was no evidence that it had been noted by the prison authorities or that he had sought medical attention. As against this there was the sheer quantity of the heroin seized. SNO Lim gave evidence that based on his experience and knowledge he estimated that the quantity seized was sufficient to make 5,623 straws. At the appellant`s then rate of consumption he had a five years` supply and not a four months` supply. Alternatively, he would have to increase his consumption by 15 times to consume that quantity in four months. The appellant`s counsel questioned the reliability of SNO Lim`s evidence but did not himself put forward an alternative analysis. In the result, the trial judges were perfectly justified in accepting SNO Lim`s evidence.
The insurmountable difficulty the appellant faced was to explain away the large quantity of heroin found in his possession at the time of his arrest. The larger the quantity of the drugs involved, the stronger the inference that they were not intended for personal consumption, and the more convincing the evidence needed to rebut it. (See 
Ong Ah Chuan v PP
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 64
  )
On the evidence in this case the trial judges could not have come to any other conclusion. To say the least, the appellant`s explanation for being in possession of that quantity of diamorphine at the time of his arrest was incredible.
The appellant`s counsel also argued before us that before a court rejects the defendant`s evidence given in rebuttal of the statutory presumption created by s 17(c) that the drugs were for his own consumption, the court should look for some objective facts which would have a tendency to make the defendant`s evidence that the drugs were for his own consumption less probable. He illustrated his point by reference to a series of cases. It will be sufficient if we refer to just two.
In 
Ong Ah Chuan v PP
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 64
  the accused failed to rebut the statutory presumption by his evidence that he was taking the drugs in his possession to Pulau Ubin for his own consumption. The objective facts which made the accused`s evidence less probable were that he had no father-in-law in Pulau Ubin who was going to employ him as he had contended; that he was not an addict; that he could not have been on his way to Pulau Ubin when arrested as he was arrested at Newton Circus.
In 
Sim Mai Tik v PP
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 363
  again, the accused failed to rebut the statutory presumption that he was bringing the drugs into Singapore from Johore Bahru by car for his own consumption. The objective facts that made the accused`s assertion less probable were, among others, that the accused had 70 plastic bags of diamorphine weighing more than 67.49g; he had intended to come to Singapore only for the day; certain paraphernalia found in his room in Johore Bahru were things which a trafficker in drugs would have.
Counsel submitted that there were no such objective facts in this case to make the appellant`s assertion that he was in possession of the diamorphine for his own consumption less probable. If anything, that he was addicted to heroin; that he was on his way home when he was arrested; that no paraphernalia to incriminate him in drug trafficking was found in his home, all made his assertion more probable.
It was submitted that the trial judges had failed to scrutinize the evidence with the care with which they were expected to. We cannot agree. The insurmountable obstacle in this case was the sheer quantity of the diamorphine found in the possession of the appellant when he was arrested coupled with the fact that he was not the addict he made himself out to be. These are the objective facts in this case. The absence of incriminating paraphernalia in his home is neutral.
We have no doubt that on the totality of the evidence in this case, the trial judges came to the right conclusion when they found that the appellant had not rebutted the presumption that he was in possession of the diamorphine from Lorong 1A Toa Payoh to Jalan Novena Barat for the purpose of trafficking. We are satisfied that no other conclusion was open to them on the evidence.
Accordingly this appeal is dismissed.

s 18 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)
 
Five charges were preferred against the first appellant. He pleaded guilty to all the charges. Various other charges of a similar nature were taken into consideration.
The first appellant`s sentences were as follows:
First charge - Four years` imprisonment
Second charge
-
Three years` imprisonment
Third charge
-
18 months` imprisonment
Fourth charge
-
Two years` imprisonment
Fifth charge
-
Two years` imprisonment
All the offences are connected with criminal abuse of letters of credit. The learned district judge ordered all the sentences to run consecutively, with the result that the first appellant was required to serve imprisonment for a period of 121/2 years.
Three charges were preferred against the second appellant who also pleaded guilty. The second appellant started associating with the first appellant from the age of about 17 years. She has a child by him. The first appellant has been described as the mastermind and authoritative figure, and directors of various companies carried out his instructions although he was a bankrupt. They have all been described as puppets.
The decision of the learned district judge has been attacked on a number of grounds by both counsel. It is enough for me to say that four principles must be applied when sentencing: (a) retribution, (b) deterrence, (c) prevention, and (d) rehabilitation, and not just the two aspects of deterrence - deterrence of the offender and deterrence of likely offenders. In this respect, it must be noted that Singapore takes rehabilitation seriously. The Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises must be allowed to carry on with its good work of rehabilitating prisoners.
The legislature has given a guide on consecutive sentences. Section 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) requires the court to order where a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least three distinct offences that two of these offences shall run consecutively. There must be very exceptional circumstances before a man of 53, who pleads guilty to five charges of a similar nature, is ordered to serve all the sentences consecutively.
The charges are of a similar nature in this case. Prosecuting counsel has explained the differences in imprisonment between the third charge to which the first appellant was sentenced to 18 months and the first charge to which he was sentenced to four years as being due to the amounts involved. Counsel for the appellants have cited cases where the sentence of imprisonment for larger sums was for a shorter period of imprisonment.
We therefore have to go back to the classical principles when sentencing. (See 
R v Sergeant
 
[1975] 60 Cr App Rep 74
[1975] Crim LR 173
 ) The question is whether society must be protected by putting away the first appellant, who is 53 years old, for 121/2 years, and the second appellant, who is 30 years old and has an eight-year-old child, for six years. The first appellant is not a man who is likely to repeat the offence. The second appellant is even less likely to do so.
The court must, in a proper case, impose punishment which really hurts but society does not expect the court to go on hurting for a long time. Twelve-and-a-half years and six years are likely to do that. The sentence is manifestly excessive. The appeal is allowed. The first appellant`s sentence is accordingly reduced to:
First charge - Two years` imprisonment
Second charge
-
Two years` imprisonment
Third charge
-
To stand
Fourth charge
-
To stand
Fifth charge
-
To stand
The sentence on the first and second charge in respect of the first appellant will run consecutively. Sentences on the third, fourth and fifth to remain and will run concurrently, except for the sentence for corruption which will be served after the expiration of the sentences imposed for the five charges.
The learned district judge who imposed the sentence on corruption to be served after the sentence for cheating has given his reasons and this court is in no position to disagree with it. They are good and valid reasons. Persons who are arrested and who thereafter seek to bribe police officers must expect sentences of imprisonment to be served apart from the offence or offences for which they were arrested. The appeal on the corruption charge is dismissed.
The second appellant was clearly under the spell of the first appellant. She gave him love, a son and her services. She was not the mastermind. The prosecution has very fairly and properly accepted the fact that she cannot be placed on the same footing as the first appellant, and that there are references in the statement of facts which clearly refer only to the first appellant which the record shows as having been admitted by the second appellant.
The appeal of the second appellant is allowed. The sentence is accordingly reduced to:
First charge - six months
Second charge
-
three months
Third charge
-
13 months and 1 week to cover the entire period of her detention so that she will be free to leave the court.
The first two charges will run consecutively and the third charge will run concurrently with the first and second charges.

The appellant was convicted for trafficking in heroin [under s 5(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) and punishable under s 33 thereof]. The offence was that on 13 September 1989 he sold one straw of heroin to Narcotics Officer Ravinder Singh for $15.
The main evidence against him came from NO Ravinder Singh. His evidence was that on that day he was on an operation with two other officers, namely, NO Rahman A Bakar and ANO Mohd Erfan. He was instructed to pose as a purchaser seeking a supplier. At about 8.20pm he approached a female Malay and told her that he wanted to buy heroin and she referred the appellant to him. After he asked the appellant for a straw of heroin, the appellant went to a nearby house and returned a few minutes after 8.55pm with a straw of heroin which he sold to him for $15.
The appellant was not arrested immediately after the sale. In fact, he was not arrested for a week until 20 September 1989 when NO Ravinder Singh approached him again to buy heroin. He refused to sell him any heroin, and was arrested later on.
As the appellant denied selling the drugs to NO Ravinder Singh, the failure to arrest him at the time of the alleged sale and his arrest a week later when he was not selling drugs were material issues in the case against him.
The prosecution adduced evidence at the trial as to why the appellant was not arrested immediately on 13 September 1989 when he made the sale. NO Ravinder Singh said that there was no arrest because his team was engaged in a pending operation in that area. NO Rahman who was in charge of the operation gave another reason. He said that NO Ravinder Singh advised him not to make the arrest because there were other drug traffickers around, and they may be overpowered if they tried to do that. When questioned by the trial judge, he said that there were no other operations against drug traffickers in the area that night.
These explanations were contradictory and inconsistent. Whereas NO Ravinder Singh said that there was a pending operation, NO Rahman said that there was only one operation. Although NO Rahman said he was advised by NO Ravinder Singh not to make an arrest for fear of being overpowered, NO Ravinder Singh made no mention of having or expressing such apprehension.
It was unfortunate that the officers who carried out a planned operation against traffickers which concluded without an arrest even after having established contact and completed a purchase did not make any proper record of the reasons why the operation concluded that way. This was made worse when conflicting reasons were given by them when they came to court. This unsatisfactory evidence on this aspect of the operation also undermined the veracity of the evidence of the sale itself.
After the appellant was arrested on 20 September 1989, a statement was recorded from him on the same day. The prosecution tendered in evidence the statement. The appellant objected to its admission on the grounds that he was assaulted before the statement was recorded and that he did not say anything. After a trial- within-a-trial, the trial judge admitted the statement. In the statement the appellant admitted that on 13 September 1989 at about 8.30pm a female friend introduced him to NO Ravinder Singh. NO Ravinder Singh wanted to buy one straw of heroin, and at about 9pm he sold him that for $15. The contents of the statement were substantially similar to the evidence of NO Ravinder Singh, which were that he met the appellant on that day sometime after 8.20pm through a female Malay and completed the purchase a few minutes after 8.55pm.
The statement would have been unexceptional if it was recorded after the appellant had been informed of the offence for which he was arrested, but that was not the case. The recording officer Ng Beng Chin told the trial judge that he did not tell the appellant the particulars of the charge before he recorded the statement. There was a question whether the appellant really made the statement of an event in the previous week without being told that that was the event under investigation. The DPP submitted that even if the appellant was told of the offence under investigation, that would not affect the probative value of the statement which the trial judge had found to be properly recorded. That is not an adequate answer. Once the evidence of the recording officer is called into question, the integrity of the whole recording exercise is affected. In so far as the trial judge failed to consider these matters at all before admitting the statement in evidence, that ruling must be re-examined. After reviewing all the evidence, I found that there was a doubt whether the statement was recorded in the manner described by the prosecution and that the statement should not have been admitted in evidence.
I also considered the trial judge`s rejection of the appellant`s defence. The appellant`s evidence was that he did not sell heroin to NO Ravinder Singh on 13 September 1989. He also said that NO Ravinder Singh returned on the two following days, ie 14 and 15 September 1989, and tried to buy heroin from him, but again he did not sell him any. A few days later, the CNB officers arrested him. The prosecution`s evidence was that he was arrested on 20 September 1989 after he refused to sell heroin to NO Ravinder Singh.
The prosecution did not dispute or confirm the appellant`s evidence on the events of 14 and 15 September 1989. If it was accepted, then the events did not take place as described by NO Ravinder Singh and NO Rahman. The effect of the evidence was that after not having affected an arrest on 13 September 1989, NO Ravinder Singh tried thrice to buy heroin from the appellant and failed before the appellant was arrested on 20 September 1989. If that was what really took place, then the credibility of NO Ravinder Singh and NO Rahman was undermined because they had presented the events as having occurred over two days - the day of sale and the day of arrest. As the appellant`s evidence on this point was not disputed, it must on a proper consideration raise further doubt in the prosecution case.
The result of the foregoing examination of the case was that there are doubts on two issues which were not considered by the trial judge - why the appellant was not arrested immediately and whether the prosecution witnesses have disclosed everything about the attempts to purchase drugs from the appellant. I therefore allowed the appellant`s appeal and set aside his conviction.

The appellant, Tan Boon Tat, was tried and convicted of the offence of having, between 3.30pm and 3.46pm on 10 May 1987, trafficked in not less than 1,120.81g of diamorphine by transporting the diamorphine from the car park at Lorong 7, Toa Payoh, to the entrance of the car park at Balestier Plaza in motor car EP3230P. Against that conviction he appealed.
The facts in brief were as follows. On 10 May 1987 officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) kept watch in the vicinity of a flat at 369A Balestier Road. At about 3.10pm they saw the appellant come out of the flat and drive off in motor car EP3230P. Four narcotics officers on two motor cycles and four other narcotics officers in two motor cars trailed the appellant to the car park behind Block 18, Lorong 7, Toa Payoh, but they lost sight of him thereafter. They kept watch.
At about 3.25pm See Leng Yeow (`See`), one of the narcotics officers keeping watch, saw the appellant walking at the ground floor of Block 18. He was carrying a white plastic bag. See trailed the appellant and saw the appellant open the boot of motor car EP3230P, put the white plastic bag into the boot, close the boot and get into the car. See beckoned to SNO Lim Chei Yoo (`SNO Lim`), a senior narcotics officer in the party, who rode his motor cycle forward to meet See. See told SNO Lim what he had seen. The team of narcotics officers trailed the appellant back to Balestier Road where just as the appellant was driving into the car park at Balestier Plaza, they surrounded his car and arrested him.
The appellant was brought to the rear of the car and SNO Lim asked See to open the boot of the car. See did so with the car key. When the boot was opened, See pointed to SNO Lim the white plastic bag which he said he had seen the appellant carrying. The white plastic bag was then in a blue plastic bag.
SNO Lim opened the white plastic bag and found that it contained two polythene bags, one white and one blue, which contained bags of white compressed powder. He asked the appellant in the Hokkien dialect what the contents of the two plastic bags were. The appellant replied in Hokkien that someone had given them to him. When asked who the person was, the appellant did not reply but just grinned. The appellant was then escorted in motor car EP3230P to the office of the CNB.
At the CNB, photographs were taken of the contents of the boot as they were at the time. The contents were then unloaded and photographs of the individual items were taken. The car was searched and from the glove compartment three international passports and two airline tickets for a journey from Singapore to Sydney were seized. One of the passports seized was that of the appellant. The two airline tickets and the other two passports were in the name of one Lim Chee Keong and one Ng Ling. Later that day SNO Lim, with other narcotics officers and the appellant, conducted raids at Block 18, #10-232, Lorong 7, Toa Payoh, and at #06-34, Block 28, Hoy Fatt Road.
At 12.05am on 11 May 1987 at the CNB, SNO Tan Boon Hock (`SNO Tan`), with the assistance of Wu Nan Yong, a certificated interpreter, recorded a statement from the appellant under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`). The admissibility of this statement was challenged. After a trial-within-a-trial, the judges held that the statement was admissible. In the statement (`P30`), the appellant said: `Low Chak asked me to bring a plastic bag to Hoover Theatre and someone would come and collect the plastic bag. If the plastic would be collected, Low Chak would give me $10,000 tonight (10 May 1987).`
The white plastic packets were sent to the Department of Scientific Services for analysis. They were found to contain a total of not less than 1,120.81g of diamorphine.
When the defence was called, the appellant testified that at the relevant time he was a contractor but as he did not have much contract work, he rented a flat at 369A Balestier Road and ran it as a gambling mess where he and his friends played mahjong. Occasionally, he would lend money to those of his friends who lost money at gambling. For this purpose, he had a reserve of $2,000 to $3,000 cash. It was in this mess that he met Low Chak who frequented the place every night. Low Chak frequently lent the appellant money (interest free) when the appellant was short of cash to lend to gamblers.
The appellant confirmed that motor car EP3230P belonged to him. He said that the key to the car was hung up in the mess and anyone patronizing the mess could make use of the car. He said that his friends, including Low Chak, used the car and put things in the boot of the car; he never asked them what these things were as he trusted them.
On the night of 8 May 1987, Low Chak came to the mess with a friend whom the appellant had not met before. Low Chak handed to the appellant two international passports and a sum of $3,000 in cash and asked the appellant to buy two airline tickets from Singapore to Sydney for 10 May 1987 in the names stated in the passports. The appellant said he felt obliged to help Low Chak, and so on 9 May 1987 he purchased the two tickets.
When Low Chak came to the mess on the night of 9 May 1987, the appellant told Low Chak that he had purchased the tickets for $2,500 but had lost the balance of $500 in gambling. Low Chak told the appellant not to worry about the $500 and said that his friend would collect the passports and tickets the following morning. Low Chak also told the appellant that he would call the appellant in the afternoon of the following day to ask the appellant to send the two passports, the airline tickets and the thing that he had put in his car to Low Chak`s friend. The appellant said that he did not know what it was that Low Chak had put in his car.
The appellant said that that night, as is his normal practice, he continued gambling until the following morning. At 6am on 10 May 1987 he sent some of his gambling friends home to Yishun Ring Road and returned to the mess at about 7am. At about 9am he went to his home at Hoy Fatt Road and returned to the mess at about 1pm. Shortly thereafter, he received a telephone call from Low Chak who asked him to bring the two passports, airline tickets and the thing he had put in his car to a place in front of Hoover Theatre and to wait for his friend. Soon after the telephone call the appellant left for Toa Payoh. When he arrived at the flat at Toa Payoh, he found that there was no one in and he thereupon returned to Balestier Road. He denied that when he was at Toa Payoh he carried anything from the flat to his car.
As for the statement recorded by SNO Tan, the appellant said that what he told SNO Tan was that the $10,000 would be lent, not given, to him by Low Chak. As for the plastic bag referred to in the statement, the appellant said he did not know which plastic bag it referred to or what the plastic bag contained. He said that the friend of Low Chak would collect the plastic bag.
The learned trial judges, in convicting the appellant, said in their grounds of judgment (which is reported in 
 
 
[1990] 2 MLJ 466
  ) that the appellant had failed to rebut the presumptions that arose against him under ss 18 and 21 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`the Act`). In their judgment they specifically stated that, even discounting the evidence of See and the evidence contained in the statement P30, the appellant had not succeeded in rebutting the said presumptions. The learned judges obviously took particular care to consider the evidence against the appellant without P30 and without the evidence of See because the admissibility of P30 was challenged and severe criticism had been made on the credibility of See. We will deal with these matters in considering the submissions made to us by counsel for the appellant.
Counsel for the appellant raised four grounds of appeal before us which he classified broadly as follows: 
 
 
(i) accepting and relying on the evidence of See; 
 
(ii) admitting prejudicial evidence; 
 
(iii) the s 122(6) statement (P30): 
 
(a) whether voluntary; 
 
(b) whether statutory provision complied with; and 
 
(iv) rejecting the defence.
  
 
 
We will deal with these submissions in the order in which they were raised.
 The evidence of See Leng Yeow
It was submitted that the learned trial judges erred in accepting the evidence of See in that: 
 
 
(a) they failed to scrutinize the material inconsistencies and improbabilities in See`s evidence; and 
 
(b) they failed to treat See`s evidence with the degree of caution prescribed by law in view of the fact that See was, at all material times, a witness of an admittedly tainted and infamous character, in that he was himself an addict and was in all probability the corrupt public servant who had attempted to solicit a bribe of $2,000 from the appellant`s wife.
  
 
 
The inconsistencies and improbabilities in the evidence of See referred to by counsel related in the main to difficulties See would have had, from where he had positioned himself, in observing the plastic bag carried by the appellant and in being able to observe the part of the boot of the car where the appellant had placed the bag. At the trial See was cross-examined at length on these matters. The learned trial judges having seen and heard See, and having heard submissions of counsel on the alleged inconsistencies and improbabilities of See`s evidence, accepted the evidence of See. We are not persuaded that in so doing the learned trial judges were wrong.
See, though an officer in the CNB, had himself been taking drugs since 1984. In July 1987, he tendered his resignation from the CNB when his drug habit became known and he was thereafter admitted to the drug rehabilitation centre. In addition, there was evidence before the court that someone identifying himself as See had sometime in mid-1987 telephoned members of the appellant`s family, asked for $2,000, and in return promised to alter his testimony so as not to implicate the appellant. The learned trial judges said in their grounds of judgment that they accepted the evidence of the appellant`s wife that she had received such a telephone call.
Counsel for the appellant submitted that, assuming that See was the one who made the telephone call, what we have is a person quite prepared to perjure for a fee. Combining that with addiction to drugs whilst working for the CNB, he was what counsel termed `a most vile witness`. We agree with the submission of counsel that it is prudent not to accept the evidence of such a witness and that if the evidence is accepted, there must be good reasons for so doing and the reasons must be given.
In this case, the learned trial judges were fully aware of the dangers of relying on the evidence of such a witness and have given their reasons for accepting his testimony. This is what they said (at p 477 of the report): 
 
We accept the evidence of Mdm Lim on this point. However, assuming that See Leng Yeow was the person who actually called Mdm Lim, we do not think that his credibility as a witness on what he saw at the car park of Block 18, Lorong 7, Toa Payoh, was in any way impeached. At the material time he [See] could not have conceived the plan of telephoning the accused`s wife and seeking to extort money from her; at that time, he had not even met the accused`s wife. We therefore accept this material part of the evidence of See Leng Yeow. It is significant that upon being picked up by Lim Chei Yoo at the car park behind Block 18, Lorong 7, Toa Payoh, he immediately told Lim Chei Yoo that the accused had carried a plastic bag and placed it in the boot of his car. Further, when the accused was arrested at the entrance to the car park of Balestier Plaza and the boot of the car was opened, it was he who pointed the plastic bag to Lim Chei Yoo without hesitation. There were then so many plastic bags in the boot, and of all those bags he pointed out to the particular bag which contained the two polythene bags of drugs.
 
 
 
It is clear from their judgment that the learned trial judges treated the evidence of See with considerable caution. The reasons they gave as to why they accepted See`s evidence in spite of his character are, in our view, sound. We therefore saw no merit in counsel`s submission that the learned trial judges failed to treat See`s evidence with the required degree of caution.
Counsel further submitted that if See`s evidence had been properly scrutinized as having little or no weight, it would have been open to the learned trial judges to have found that the appellant had rebutted the presumptions against him on a balance of probabilities. This submission does not take into account the fact that the learned trial judges specifically stated that `even discounting the evidence of See Leng Yeow ...`, the accused had not succeeded in rebutting the presumptions raised by ss 18 and 21 of the Act.
 Admitting prejudicial evidence
Counsel submitted that the trial court had erred in allowing the DPP to suggest to the appellant that: 
 
 
(a) the appellant had intended to commit the offence of exporting drugs from Singapore to Australia; and 
 
(b) the appellant intended to commit this offence (of exporting drugs) in furtherance of a common intention with or in conspiracy with at least two other persons, namely, Ng Ling and Lim Chee Keong
  
 
 
in that, as these suggestions tended to show that the appellant had been guilty of a criminal act or acts other than that with which he was charged, there was a real danger of the learned trial judges being prejudiced against the appellant by such suggestions.
There was no indication anywhere in the record that the learned trial judges in arriving at their decision were in any way prejudiced by these suggestions. To submit that they were or could have been so prejudiced seemed somewhat fatuous. In any event, questions asked in order to ascertain if the appellant intended to export the drugs (bearing in mind his purchase of the tickets to Sydney) would have been relevant under s 8 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) to show a motive for the offence of trafficking for which the appellant was charged. It would also be relevant under s 14 of the Evidence Act to show that the appellant had knowledge of the contents of the polythene bags. Such evidence does not merely go to show that the appellant was a person likely from his criminal conduct or character to have committed the offence with which he was charged. It is not surprising therefore that, at the trial below, counsel for the defence raised no objections to this line of questioning.
 The s 122(6) statement: whether voluntary
In considering the admissibility of the s 122(6) statement made by the appellant, the learned trial judges said (at p 471H of the report): 
 
We next examine the evidence of the events that occurred between the time of the arrest of the accused and the time when the statement was recorded to see whether any inducement, threat or promise was made to the accused which caused him to make the statement which was made. We think that in all probability, when the accused was at the car porch and the contents were off-loaded from the boot of the car and also at the time when the accused was in the room of Lim Chei Yoo, the latter did request the accused to co-operate. Plainly, at that time Lim Chei Yoo having found such a large quantity of what he believed to be controlled drugs would be interested to find out the source where it came from and would try to elicit from the accused any relevant or useful information. He was probably seeking more information from the accused. However, we do not think that the words he used with a view to seeking information from the accused at that stage could amount to an inducement to the accused to make the statement before Tan Boon Hock.
 
 
 
As to the evidence of the accused`s wife, Mdm Lim Lian Heng, we accept her evidence that when the party of narcotics officers raided her apartment at Hoy Fatt Road, Lim Chei Yoo spoke to her and asked her not to worry and said that he and the accused were `best friends` and that he could help and that whatever she knew she could tell him and could contact him at the number which he gave her. These are clearly words of comfort made by the investigation officer, but they were said to Mdm Lim, and not to the accused though within his hearing. There was no evidence that in consequence of what Lim Chei Yoo said, Mdm Lim asked or persuaded the accused to speak up and make the statement which he made later.
Based on what the learned trial judges said, counsel for the appellant submitted that having found that: 
 
 
(a) in all probability when the appellant was at the car park of the CNB office and at SNO Lim`s office, SNO Lim did request the appellant to co-operate; 
 
(b) at the appellant`s flat at Hoy Fatt Road, SNO Lim told the appellant`s wife in the appellant`s presence that: 
 
(1) the appellant and he were `best friends`; and 
 
(2) he could `help`;
  
 
 
the learned trial judges should have held the statement to be inadmissible since the request for `co-operation` coupled with the reference to `best friends` and `help` amounted to an inducement to the appellant to make the statement.
In the case of 
PP v Teh Lye Tong
 
[1958] 3 MC 208
 quoted by counsel, the accused was charged for unlawful possession of opium in contravention of the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. In that case, when customs officers detained the car driven by the accused, the accused asked an officer to `tolong` (which is the Malay word for `help`). The officer asked him in Hokkien `What tolong` and the accused said `I had opium`. When the car arrived at the customs office and a more senior officer informed the accused that the car would be searched, the accused again said `tolong`. The senior officer also asked the accused what he meant by `tolong` and the accused said he had opium in the car. The trial judge was of the view that some form of inducement was held out by the customs officer (or officers) when he said `What tolong` in answer to a request for `tolong` and that this inducement gave the accused grounds for supposing that by making the confession he would gain some advantage or avoid some evil of a temporal nature. On appeal by the public prosecutor, Rigby J in rejecting the finding of the trial judges said: 
 
The word `tolong` and the reply `What tolong` seem to me only capable of one of two meanings. The accused asked for help; the reply given to him indicated either a complete ignorance of what he was talking about, or alternatively, a query as to what was the nature and extent of the help he required. In neither instance does it seem to me that the words used `What tolong` were capable of giving the accused - to quote the words of s 24 itself - `grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it (a confession) he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceeding against him`. If the accused, of his own volition, chose to read into words a meaning of which, on their ordinary interpretation and construction they were not capable, and consequently to use words tantamount to an admission of guilt, I can see no reason why the words used by him should be excluded in evidence under s 24 of the Evidence Ordinance.
 
 
 
Counsel submitted that in 
Teh Lye Tong
 
[1958] 3 MC 208
 the word `tolong` did not render the confession inadmissible because it did not emanate from a person in authority but that, unlike the situation in 
Teh Lye Tong
 
[1958] 3 MC 208
 in the present case it was the customs officer who had repeatedly asked the appellant for co-operation and help, and that such a request would be sufficient to constitute inducement.
In considering the voluntariness of a statement, Lord Hailsham in 
DPP v Ping Lin
 
[1975] 3 All ER 175
 at pp 182-183 said: 
 
I cannot myself help regarding the issue as basically one of fact. The trial judge should approach his task by applying the test enunciated by Lord Sumner in a common sense way to all the facts in the case in their context much as a jury would approach it if the task had fallen to them. In the light of all the facts in their context, he should ask himself this question, and no other: `Have the prosecution proved that the contested statement was voluntary in the sense that it was not obtained by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage excited or held out by a person in authority or (where it is relevant, as is not the case on appeal here) by oppression?`
 
 
 
I cannot help thinking that many of the recent cases in the Court of Criminal Appeal, or the Court of Appeal, Criminal Division, approach the whole question, which is basically one of fact, in too legalistic and casuistical a spirit, so as to form, as the judges in 
 R v Northam 
 [(1967) 52 Cr App Rep 97] expressed themselves to be unhappily aware, a clog on the proper exercise by the police of their investigatory function, and, indeed, on the administration of justice itself.
Lord Salmon in the same case echoed a similar view and said at pp 187-188 of the report: 
 
Unfortunately, there are far too many reported cases concerning appeals against decisions allowing evidence of confessions or statements to go before a jury. A whole body of case law seems to have been conjured up out of what are essentially decisions on questions of fact. This has, I fear, led to a great deal of unnecessary confusion and complication in a branch of the law which is essentially clear and simple. I entirely agree with my noble and learned friend, Lord Kilbrandon, that in deciding whether an alleged confession or statement was free and voluntary and should be admitted in evidence, it is useless, just as it is in an accident case, to search for another case in which the facts seem to be familiar and treat it as binding. Facts vary infinitely from case to case. The judge`s task is to consider the evidence before him, to assess its implications and to decide the case on his view of that evidence in the light of the basic established principle.
 
 
 
Under our law, a confession made to a customs officer (or a narcotics officer as in the present case) is admissible in evidence provided the provisions of s 24 of the Evidence Act are complied with. Under s 24 of the Evidence Act, the court is required, inter alia, to consider: 
 
 
(a) if the confession appears to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise proceeding from a person in authority; and 
 
(b) approach the matter from the viewpoint of the accused and consider whether the circumstances were such that it could give reasonable grounds for the accused to suppose that by making it he would gain an advantage or avoid any evil of the kind referred to in s 24.
  
 
 
In the present case, the learned trial judges were of the view that the request to co-operate in a situation where SNO Lim was trying to elicit information from the appellant as to the source of the drugs was not an inducement in respect of the statement subsequently made by the appellant to SNO Tan under s 122(6) of the CPC. They specifically found that the statement made by the appellant `did not owe its origin` to anything said or done by SNO Lim. They were satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that the statement as recorded by SNO Tan was made by the appellant voluntarily and that no inducement, threat or promise was made to the appellant. In satisfying themselves beyond reasonable doubt that the statement was voluntary, the learned trial judges were following the standard applied by the House of Lords in 
DPP v Ping Lin
 
[1975] 3 All ER 175
The learned trial judges in this case have (to quote Lord Hailsham) approached their task in a common sense way to all the facts in the case when they found that the statement was not caused by anything said or done by SNO Lim or SNO Tan. We were not persuaded that the learned trial judges made a wrong assessment of the evidence before them or had in any way failed to apply the correct principles.
As for the words said to Mdm Lim Lian Heng, there was, as the learned trial judges noted, no evidence that as a consequence of what SNO Lim said Mdm Lim asked or persuaded the appellant to speak up and make the statement. The appellant was, between that time and the time he made the s 122(6) statement, in the custody of the narcotics officers and Mdm Lim did not have access to him. There was also no evidence from the appellant that he had heard what was said to Mdm Lim. We saw no reason to disagree with the finding of the learned trial judges that what SNO Lim said to Mdm Lim was no more than words of comfort to her.
At the trial the appellant had sought to show that the circumstances in which he made the statement were so oppressive that his will was sapped or broken with the result that the statement was not one made on his own free will. The appellant claimed that he had not had any sleep the night before his arrest. In addition, from 3.40pm when the appellant was arrested until 1am the next day when he made the statement, the appellant had not been given any food or drink.
The learned trial judges were highly critical of the CNB - a criticism that we indorse - for not having given the appellant food or drink. They accepted that the appellant was at the material time tired, hungry and thirsty. They also accepted that the appellant was under great stress, having regard to the fact that he was in custody and confronted with a charge of having trafficked in a substantial quantity of controlled drugs. But the learned trial judges went on to say that they did not think that the appellant was in such a state of shock, exhaustion or fatigue that he had no will to resist making any statement which he did not wish to make. They therefore rejected the submission made to them that the statement was not voluntary.
At the hearing of this appeal, the submission of oppressive conduct was repeated. Counsel also submitted that the learned trial judges should have evaluated the voluntariness of the statement not by virtue of an objective test but by a subjective test of the way in which the appellant, being in such a situation, would have perceived the matter at the material time. Counsel submitted that had the evidence at the trial-within-a-trial been evaluated in accordance with the court`s finding as to the appellant`s physical and emotional condition, the statement would not have been admitted in evidence.
We found nothing in the judgment of the learned trial judges to support the submission that they had applied an objective test. To the contrary, from the tenor of their judgment and, in particular, their reference to the judgment of Lord Morris in 
DPP v Ping Lin
 
[1975] 3 All ER 175
 it is apparent that the learned trial judges considered the matter from the point of view of the accused. Having done so, they were satisfied that the statement was voluntary.
 Non-compliance with statutory provisions
Section 122(6) of the CPC reads as follows: 
 
Where any person is charged with an offence or officially informed that he may be prosecuted for it, he shall be served with a notice in writing, 
 which shall be explained to him
to the following effect:
 
 
 
`You have been charged with/informed that you may be prosecuted for - [set out the charge].
 
 
 
Do you wish to say anything in answer to the charge? If there is any fact on which you intend to rely in your defence in court, you are advised to mention it now. If you hold it back till you go to court, your evidence may be less likely to be believed and this may have a bad effect on your case in general. If you wish to mention any fact now, and you would like it written down, this will be done.` (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
On P30, the recording officer SNO Tan had immediately after the notice in writing noted: 
 
The content of the above notice was 
 read
 to the accused in Hokkien. After which I accordingly served the duplicate, this notice of warning to him on 11 May 1987 at 12.10am at the Central Narcotics Bureau, Singapore. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
The appellant also testified that although the charge and the notice of warning were read and interpreted to him, no one had explained them to him. Counsel submitted that by reason of this breach of the requirements of s 122(6), the statement, P30, was inadmissible.
Counsel submitted that the learned trial judges erred in holding that a mere reading of the notice in writing and the charge was sufficient compliance of s 122(6) and that the correct interpretation of the law was to be found in 
PP v Chan Sway Beng
 
 
[1988] 2 MLJ 405
  and in 
Tsang Yuk Chung v PP
 
 
[1990] 3 MLJ 264
 
In 
PP v Chan Sway Beng
 
 
[1988] 2 MLJ 405
  the charge and the notice in writing under s 122(6) had been read and interpreted to the accused but had not been explained. The court held that in view of this breach the s 122(6) statement that was recorded was inadmissible. In delivering the court`s judgment, Grimberg JC said (at p 412): 
 
In setting out to record a statement from the accused, Inspector Maniam had proceeded under s 121(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code [Cap 113, 1970 Ed]. That subsection provides that a person who is invited to make a statement `shall be served with a notice in writing` (the warning) `which shall be explained to him ...`. The warning incorporates the charge, and it follows that both must be explained.
 
 
 
It was plain from the evidence before us that the charge was not explained to the accused; nor was the warning. Both were read out to him in English, and interpreted to him, word for word, in Cantonese. That is all. It is true that the accused signed statements written out on P52 to the effect that he understood both the charge and the warning, which statements were themselves interpreted to him, but we were not persuaded that this cured the omission to explain the charge and the warning.
Sections 121(6) and 122(1), now s 123(1), were enacted in 1976. The combined effect of these two subsections is that, where a person in the position in which the accused found himself fails, upon being administered the warning provided by s 121(6), to mention a fact which he could reasonably have been expected to mention, the court may draw adverse inferences against him. Having removed the right, which previously existed, of an accused person to remain silent without adverse consequences, the legislature was, by enacting ss 121(6) and 122(1), conferring upon the accused the right, if he wished, to make a statement in exculpation of himself at a certain stage of the proceedings against him, which the court was entitled to take a full account of.
That, it seemed to us, could well be why s 121(6) required that the warning be `explained`. The Act makes a clear distinction between explanation and interpretation, as will be seen by comparing s 121(6) with s 123(4), the latter dealing with statements or confessions made before a magistrate.
In the present case, it was obvious to Inspector Maniam when he decided to record a statement from the accused under s 121(6), that the accused intended to make a confession, which might not or might contain exculpatory statements. It must follow that Inspector Maniam anticipated that the statement would be used in the proceedings against the accused. The more reason then why the warning and the charge should have been explained. The accused was a primary six drop-out, and he told us that, inter alia, he did not understand what was meant by the word `defence` (in court) which appears in the warning. In our view, he was entitled to fully appreciate that if he had anything to say in exculpation of the alleged offence, that was the time to say it. Admittedly, the accused signed a statement to the effect that he understood the charge, and the warning. He may well have thought he did, when in fact he did not. Had the evidence been that he received an explanation, as required by s 121(6), he could not have been heard to complain.
We declined to admit the accused`s statement by reason of the failure of Inspector Maniam and Miss Lau to explain the charge and the warning to the accused, and for no other reason.
The learned trial judges in declining to follow the decision in 
PP v Chan Sway Beng
 
 
[1988] 2 MLJ 405
  said (at p 473 of the report): 
 
With respect, we are unable to agree with this conclusion. First, the admissibility of a statement made pursuant to s 121(6) is not governed by that subsection but, in the case where a statement is made to a police officer, is governed by s 121(5) of the CPC and, in the case of statement made to narcotics officer, by the Evidence Act. A failure to explain the charge and the warning to an accused cannot afford a reason for excluding the statement made by the accused which is otherwise admissible. The purpose of s 121(6) is to inform the accused of the charge he is facing and to give him an opportunity of saying any fact which he intends to rely on in his defence in court and further to warn him that if he does not say it then, his silence may give rise to an adverse inference against him. Clearly, s 122(6) has a direct bearing on s 123 of the CPC, and the whole of the exercise prescribed in s 122(6) is to forewarn the accused of the court`s power under s 123(1).
 
 
 
The ruling by the learned trial judges that the admissibility of a statement recorded under s 122(6) is governed not by s 122(6) but by s 122(5) (or the Evidence Act) was sufficient for the purposes of admitting P30. The learned judges, however, went a step further to consider the meaning that should be given to the word `explain` in s 122(6). In their view (at p 474D):
... the word `explain` in sub-s (6) should in the context of that subsection be construed in a broad common sense manner. `To explain` is to make one understand. If an accused is made to understand the substance of the charge and the adverse implication of not stating any fact which may or might exculpate him, then that subsection would have been complied with. If the accused is one who reads and speaks English, and both the charge and the warning are read to him and are shown to him and the accused is made to understand the substance of the charge and the implication of the warning, we do not see what else there is that ought to be explained to him. It is clearly not intended by that subsection that the recording officer should explain the ingredients of the offence with which the accused is being charged. Further, the warning is couched in very simple language which is easily comprehensible by those who read English. We do not see what else there is and how else one ought to explain the warning; it is certainly unsafe to simplify it or, on the other hand, to elaborate or amplify it; any such attempt may convey a wrong meaning or implication to the accused. It follows that if an accused does not read and speak English, and the charge and the notice of warning are both accurately interpreted to him in a language which he understands, it would, in our opinion, amount to an explanation to him of the charge and the warning; he would have understood from the interpreter the substance of the charge and the implication of the warning. 
Tsang Yuk Chung v PP
 
 
[1990] 3 MLJ 264
  was a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal given after the judgment in the present case had been delivered. Counsel referred us only to a short passage at p 267 of the judgment in 
Tsang Yuk Chung
 
 
[1990] 3 MLJ 264
  where Wee Chong Jin CJ said: 
 
However, the fact remains that s 122(6) contains the requirement that the notice in writing `shall be explained`. In our opinion, the requirement is satisfied if an accused person is told in general terms what the charge and warning mean. Since accused persons differ in background, what form the explanation should take must ultimately depend on the facts of each case.
 
 
 
Relying on that passage, counsel submitted that in order to comply with s 122(6), it is not enough to merely read the notice of warning and the charge - some form of explanation was required.
In 
 Tsang Yuk Chung 
`s case,4 the issue was also whether a s 122(6) statement recorded after the charge and notice of warning had been read and interpreted to the accused but which had not been explained to the accused was admissible in evidence. There too, the decision in 
PP v Chan Sway Beng
 
 
[1988] 2 MLJ 405
  was cited in support of the proposition that the s 122(6) statement was not admissible since it had not been explained.
The Court of Criminal Appeal, following much the same reasoning as the learned trial judges herein, ruled that the statement was admissible. In delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, Wee Chong Jin CJ said (at pp 266-267): 
 
In our opinion, non-compliance with s 122(6) results not in a statement being inadmissible - since, as we have said, its admissibility depends on s 122(5) - but in enabling the court having to take such non-compliance into consideration when deciding what inferences, if any at all, should be drawn from the failure of the accused to mention certain facts.
 
 
 
It may well be that the court considers the non-compliance of s 122(6) serious enough so that it will not draw any inferences at all from the failure of the accused to mention certain facts. On the other hand, the non-compliance may be trivial in nature, eg a non-material typographical error in the notice in writing, and the court will not in such a case be prevented from drawing such inferences as appear proper.
We are of the same view. The admissibility of a statement recorded under s 122(6) is dependent on s 122(5) of the CPC or the Evidence Act (as the case may be). Non-compliance with the provisions of s 122(6) may put into jeopardy the possibility of the court drawing an adverse inference under s 123(1) but has little or no bearing on the question of admissibility.
The passage from the judgment in 
 Tsang Yuk Chung 
`s case4 relied on by counsel for the appellant appears in that part of the judgment of the court where, having ruled that the statement even if recorded in contravention of s 122(6) would be admissible provided s 122(5) has been complied with, the court went on to make observations on the meaning to be given to the words `shall be explained` in s 122(6). In so doing, the court, as the learned trial judges did in this case, commented on some of the problems that can arise if the recording officer is obliged to `explain` the charge and the notice of warning. We agree with these comments but, for the purposes of this appeal, it is not necessary for us to go into these matters as there is no question in this case of any adverse inference being drawn against the appellant under s 123(1) of the CPC.
 Failing to consider the appellant`s defence
Counsel for the appellant conceded that as the appellant was in physical custody of the plastic bag, the statutory presumptions in the Act were correctly invoked against him. He submitted, however, that the appellant had, on a balance of probabilities, proved that he did not at the material time have possession of the contents of the plastic bag and that he did not know the nature of its contents. Counsel submitted that the learned trial judges had failed to appreciate that the evidence needed to rebut a statutory presumption was on a balance of probabilities. In this context, counsel referred us to the following passage in the judgment where the learned trial judges, in referring to the evidence given by the appellant, said [at p 477D]: 
 
He [the appellant] said that the gamblers quite often used the car and put things in the car, but, he had not called any of his gamblers to testify that those persons who gambled at his mess had frequently or occasionally made use of his car and put things in the boot ... . In connection with the person, Low Chak, the accused had also not called any of his gamblers to testify that there was indeed such a person called Low Chak who frequently or even occasionally went to the mess to gamble.
 
 
 
and submitted that the adverse comments made by the learned trial judges on the appellant`s failure to call witnesses in support of the defence case indicated that the learned trial judges were placing too high a burden on the defence.
Whether the appellant had or had not rebutted the presumptions against him is entirely a question of fact. The learned trial judges in arriving at their decision had the benefit of observing the appellant and forming a view on his credibility. In the event, they found the evidence of the appellant that he did not know what was in the boot of his car difficult to accept. Reading the appellant`s evidence as it appeared in the record, we too found his evidence difficult to accept. That the learned trial judges did not apply the wrong burden is clear from the reference in their judgment to a passage from 
Wong Kee Chin v PP
 
 
[1979] 1 MLJ 157
  which specifically stated that when the presumptions under the Act arise, the burden on the accused is on a preponderance of evidence or on the balance of probabilities.
The adverse comments relating to the failure to call any of the gamblers to testify were made by the learned trial judges in the context of their saying that they found it incredible to believe that there were so many things in the boot of the car in respect of which the appellant did not know who the owners were save that they belonged to friends of his who frequently gambled at his mess. In our view, bearing in mind that the burden was on the appellant to rebut the presumptions on a balance of probabilities, it was not unreasonable or irregular in the circumstances of this case for the learned trial judges to comment adversely on the appellant`s failure to call any of the gamblers to testify.
We were of the view that there was no merit in the appeal and we accordingly dismissed the appeal.
